john irving the hotel new hampshire for my wife shyla whose love provided the light and the space for five novels the bear called state omaine the summer my father bought the bear none of us was bornwe werent even conceived not frank the oldest not franny the loudest not me the next and not the youngest of us lilly and egg my father and mother were hometown kids who knew each other all their lives but their union as frank always called it hadnt taken place when father bought the bear their union frank franny used to tease him although frank was the oldest he seemed younger than franny to me and franny always treated him as if he were a baby what you mean frank franny said is that they hadnt started screwing they hadnt consummated their relationship said lilly one time although she was younger than any of us except egg lilly behaved as if she were everyones older sistera habit franny found irritating consummated franny said i dont remember how old franny was at the time but egg was not old enough to hear talk like this mother and father simply didnt discover sex until after the old man got that bear franny said that bear gave them the ideahe was such a gross horny animal humping trees and playing with himself and trying to rape dogs he mauled an occasional dog frank said with disgust he didnt rape dogs he tried to franny said you know the story fathers story lilly would then say with a disgust slightly different from franks disgust it was franny frank was disgusted with but lilly was disgusted with father and so its up to methe middle child and the least opinionatedto set the record straight or nearly straight we were a family whose favourite story was the story of my mother and fathers romance how father bought the bear how mother and father fell in love and had in rapid succession frank franny and me bang bang bang as franny would say and after a brief rest how they then had lilly and egg pop and fizzle franny says the story we were told as children and retold to each other when we were growing up tends to focus on those years we couldnt have known about and can see now only through our parents many versions of the tale i tend to see my parents in those years more clearly than i see them in the years i actually can remember because those times i was present of course are coloured by the fact that they were upanddown timesabout which i have upanddown opinions toward the famous summer of the bear and the magic of my mother and fathers courtship i can allow myself a more consistent point of view when father would stumble in telling us the storywhen he would contradict an earlier version or leave out our favourite parts of the talewe would shriek at him like violent birds either youre lying now or you lied the last time franny always the harshest of us would tell him but father would shake his head innocently dont you understand he would ask us you imagine the story better than i remember it go get mother franny would order me shoving me off the couch or else frank would lift lilly off his lap and whisper to her go get mother and our mother would be summoned as witness to the story we suspected father of fabricating or else youre leaving out the juicy parts on purpose franny would accuse him just because you think lilly and egg are too young to hear about all the screwing around there was no screwing around mother would say there was not the promiscuity and freedom there is today if a girl went off and spent the night or weekend with someone even her peers thought her a tramp or worse we really didnt pay much attention to a girl after that her kind sticks together we used to say and water seeks its own level and franny whether she was eight or ten or fifteen or twentyfive would always roll her eyes and elbow me or tickle me and whenever i tickled her back shed holler pervert feeling up his own sister and whether he was nine or eleven or twentyone or fortyone frank always hated sexual conversations and demonstrations of frannys kind he would say quickly to father never mind that what about the motorcycle no go on about the sex lilly would tell mother very humorlessly and franny would stick her tongue in my ear or make a farting noise against my neck well mother said we did not talk freely of sex in mixed company there was necking and petting light or heavy it was usually carried on in cars there were always secluded areas to park lots more dirt roads of course fewer people and fewer carsand cars werent compact then so you could stretch out franny said mother would frown at franny and persevere with her version of the times she was a truthful but boring storytellerno match for my fatherand whenever we called on mother to verify a version of a story we regretted it better to let the old man go on and on franny would say mothers so serious frank would frown oh go play with yourself frank youll feel better franny would tell him but frank would only frown harder then hed say if youd begin by asking father about the motorcycle or something concrete youd get a better answer than when you bring up such general things the clothes the customs the sexual habits frank tell us what sex is franny would say but father would rescue us all by saying in his dreamy voice i can tell you it couldnt have happened today you may think you have more freedom but you also have more laws that bear could not have happened today he would not have been allowed and in that moment we would be silenced all our bickering suddenly over when father talked even frank and franny could be sitting together close enough to touch each other and they wouldnt fight i could even be sitting close enough to franny to feel her hair against my face or her leg against mine and if father was talking i wouldnt think about franny at all lilly would sit deathly still as only lilly could on franks lap egg was usually too young to listen much less understand but he was a quiet baby even franny could hold him on her lap and hed be still whenever i held him on my lap he fell asleep he was a black bear father said he weighed four hundred pounds and was a trifle surly ursus americanus frank would murmur and he was unpredictable yes father said but goodnatured enough most of the time he was too old to be a bear anymore franny said religiously that was the line father usually began withthe line he began with the first time i remember being told the story he was too old to be a bear anymore i was in my mothers lap for this version and i remember how i felt fixed forever to this time and place mothers lap franny in fathers lap beside me frank erect and by himselfsitting crosslegged on the shabby oriental with our first family dog sorrow who would one day be put to sleep for his terrible farting he was too old to be a bear anymore father began i looked at sorrow a witless and loving labrador and he grew on the floor to the size of a bear and then aged sagging beside frank in smelly dishevelment until he was merely a dog again but sorrow would never be merely a dog that first time i dont remember lilly or eggthey must have been such babies that they were not present in a conscious way he was too old to be a bear anymore father said he was on his last legs but they were the only legs he had we would chant our ritual responselearned by heartfrank franny and i all together and when they got the story down pat eventually lilly and even egg would join in the bear did not enjoy his role as an entertainer anymore father said he was just going through the motions and the only person or animal or thing he loved was that motorcycle thats why i had to buy the motorcycle when i bought the bear thats why it was relatively easy for the bear to leave his trainer and come with me the motorcycle meant more to that bear than any trainer and later frank would prod lilly who was trained to ask what was the bears name and frank and franny and father and i would shout in unison state omaine that dumb bear was named state omaine and my father bought him in the summer of together with a indian motorcycle with a homemade sidecarfor dollars and the best clothes in his summer footlocker my father and mother were nineteen that summer they were both born in and raised in dairy new hampshire and had more or less avoided each other through the years they were growing up it is one of those logical coincidences upon which many good stories are founded that theyto their mutual surpriseended up having summer jobs at the arbuthnotbythesea a resort hotel that was for them far away from home because maine was far from new hampshire in those days and to their thinking my mother was a chambermaid although she dressed in her own clothes for serving dinner and she helped serve cocktails under the tents to the lawn parties which were attended by the golfers the tennis and croquet players and the sailors home from racing on the sea my father helped in the kitchen carried luggage handgroomed the putting greens and saw to it that the white lines on the tennis courts were fresh and straight and that the unsteady people who should not have been on board a boat in the first place were helped on and off at dockside with a minimum of injury or getting wet they were summer jobs both my mothers and fathers parents approved of although it was a humiliation to mother and father that they should discover each other there it was their first summer away from dairy new hampshire and they no doubt imagined the posh resort as a place where they could present themselvestotal strangersas also somewhat glamorous my father had just graduated from the dairy school the private boys academy hed been admitted to harvard for the fall he knew it would be the fall of before hed finally get to go because hed set himself the task of making money for his tuition but at the arbuthnotbythesea in the summer of my father would have been happy to let the guests and other help think he was headed for harvard straight away my mother being there with her hometown knowledge of his circumstances forced father to tell the truth he could go to harvard when he made the money for what it would cost it was some accomplishment that he could go at all of course and most of the people of dairy new hampshire had been surprised to learn hed even been admitted to harvard the son of the football coach at the dairy school my father winslow berry was not quite in the category of a faculty child he was a jocks only son and his father whom everyone called coach bob was not a harvard manhe was thought incapable in fact of producing harvard material robert berry had come east from iowa when his wife died in childbirth bob berry was a little old to be single and a firsttime fatherhe was thirtytwo he came searching for an education for his baby boy for which he offered himself in trade for the process he sold his physical education abilities to the best prep school that would promise to take his son when his son was old enough to go the dairy school was not a bastion of secondary school education it might have once wished for a status equal to exeters or andovers but it had settled in the early s for a future of compromise near to boston it admitted a few hundred boys who had been turned down by exeter and andover and a hundred more who shouldnt have been admitted anywhere and it gave them a curriculum that was standard and wiseand more rigorous than most of the faculty who were employed to teach there most of them had been turned down elsewhere too but even secondrate among new england prep schools it was far better than the area public schools and especially better than the only high school in the town of dairy the dairy school was just the kind of school to make deals like the one it made with coach bob berry for a piddling salary and the promise that coach bobs son win could be educated there for free when he was old enough neither coach bob nor the dairy school was prepared for how bright a student my father win berry would turn out to be harvard accepted him among the first class of applicants but he was ranked below scholarship level if hed come to them from a better school than dairy he probably could have won some kind of latin or greek scholarship he thought he was good at languages and at first wanted to major in russian my mother who being a girl could never go to the dairy school attended the private female seminary also in town this was another secondrate education that was nonetheless an improvement over the public high school and the only choice of the towns parents who wished their daughters to be educated without the presence of boys unlike the dairy school which had dormitoriesand percent boarding studentsthe thompson female seminary was only a private day school my mothers parents who for some reason were even older than coach bob wished that their daughter would associate only with the dairy school boys and not with the boys from the townmy mothers father being a retired dairy school teacher everyone called him latin emeritus and my mothers mother being a doctors daughter from brookline massachusetts who had married a harvard man she hoped her daughter might aspire to the same fate although my mothers mother never complained that her harvard man had whisked her away to the sticks and out of boston society she did hope thatthrough meeting one of the proper dairy school boysmy mother could be whisked back to boston my mother mary bates knew that my father win berry was not the proper sort of dairy boy her mother had in mind harvard or no harvard he was coach bobs sonand a delayed admission was not the same thing as being there or being able to afford to go mothers own plans in the summer of were hardly appealing to her her father old latin emeritus had suffered a stroke drooling and addled and muttering in latin he would totter about the dairy house with his wife ineffectually worrying about him unless young mary was there to look after them both mary bates at nineteen had parents older than most peoples grandparents and she had the sense of duty if not the inclination to pass up the possibility of her own college education to stay at home and care for them she thought she would learn how to type and work in the town this summer job at the arbuthnot was really meant to be an exotic summer vacation for her before she settled into whatever drudgery the fall would bring with every year she looked ahead the dairy school boys would get younger and youngeruntil none of them would be interested in whisking her back to boston mary bates had grown up with winslow berry yet they had never given each other more than a nod or a grimace of recognition we seemed to be looking beyond each other i dont know why father told us childrenuntil perhaps they first saw each other out of the familiar place where theyd both grown up the motley town of dairy and the barely less motley campus of the dairy school when the thompson female seminary graduated my mother in june of my mother was hurt to realize that the dairy school had already had its graduation and was closed the fancier outoftown boys had gone home and her two or three beaus as she called themwho she might have hoped would ask her to her own graduation dancewere gone she knew no local high school boys and when her mother suggested win berry to her my mother ran out of the dining room or i suppose i could ask coach bob she shouted to her mother her father latin emeritus raised his head from the dinner table where hed been napping coach bob he said is that moron here to borrow the sled again coach bob who was also called iowa bob was no moron but to latin emeritus whose stroke seemed to have fuddled his sense of time the hired jock from the midwest was not in the same league with the academic faculty and years ago when mary bates and win berry had been children coach bob had come to borrow an old sleigh once notorious for standing three years unmoved in the bates front yard does the fool have a horse for it latin emeritus had asked his wife no hes going to pull it himself my mothers mother said and the bates family watched out the window while coach bob put little win in the drivers seat gripped the whiffletree in his hands behind his back and heaved the sleigh into motion the great sled skidded down the snowy yard and into the slippery street that was still lined with elms in those daysas fast as a horse could have pulled it my mother always said iowa bob had been the shortest ulterior lineman ever to play firststring football in the big ten he once admitted to being so carried away he bit a running back after he tackled him at dairy in addition to his duties with football he coached the shot put and instructed those interested in weight lifting but to the bates family iowa bob was too uncomplicated to be taken seriously a funny squat strongman with hair so short he looked bald always jogging through the streets of townwith a ghastlycoloured sweatband around his dome latin emeritus used to say since coach bob would live a long time he was the only grandparent any of us children would remember whats that sound frank would ask in alarm in the middle of the night when bob had come to live with us what frank heard and what we often heard after coach bob moved in was the creaking of pushups and the grunting of situps on the old mans floor our ceiling above us its iowa bob lilly whispered once hes trying to stay in shape forever anyway it wasnt win berry who took mary bates to her graduation dance the bates family minister who was considerably older than my mother but unattached was kind enough to ask her that was a long night mother told us i felt depressed i was an outsider in my own hometown but in a very short while that same minister would marry your father and me they could not even have imagined it when they were introduced together with the other summer help on the unreal green of the pampered lawn at the arbuthnotbythesea even the staff introductions were formal there a girl was called out by name from a line of other girls and women she would meet a boy called out from a line of boys and men as if they were going to be dance partners this is mary bates just graduated from the thompson female seminary shell be helping in the hotel and with hostessing she likes sailing dont you mary waiters and waitresses the grounds crew and caddies the boat help and the kitchen staff oddjobbers hostesses chambermaids laundry people a plumber and the members of the band ballroom dancing was very popular the resorts farther southlike the weirs at laconia and hampton beachdrew some of the bigname bands in the summers but the arbuthnotbythesea had its own band which imitated in a cold maine way the bigband sound and this is winslow berry who likes to be called win dont you win hes going to harvard in the fall but my father looked straight at my mother who smiled and turned her face awayas embarrassed for him as she was for herself shed never noticed what a handsome boy he was really he had a body as hard as coach bobs but the dairy school had exposed him to the manners the dress and the way with his hair that bostonians not iowans were favouring he looked as if he already went to harvard whatever that must have meant to my mother then oh i dont know what it meant she told us children kind of cultured i guess he looked like a boy who knew how to drink without getting sick he had the darkest brightest eyes and whenever you looked at him you were sure hed just been looking at youbut you could never catch him my father maintained that latter ability all his life we felt around him always the sense that hed been observing us closely and affectionatelyeven if when we looked at him he seemed to be looking elsewhere dreaming or making plans thinking of something hard or faraway even when he was quite blind to our schemes and lives he seemed to be observing us it was a strange combination of aloofness and warmthand the first time my mother felt it was on that tongue of bright green lawn that was framed by the grey maine sea staff introductions pm that was when she learned he was there when the introductions were over and the staff was instructed to make ready for the first cocktail hour the first dinner and the first evenings entertainment my mother caught my fathers eye and he came up to her it will be two years before i can afford harvard he said immediately to her so i thought my mother said but i think its wonderful you got in she added quickly why wouldnt i have gotten in he asked mary bates shrugged a gesture learned from never understanding her father since his stroke had slurred his speech she wore white gloves and a white hat with a veil she was dressed for serving at the first lawn party and my father admired how nicely her hair hugged her headit was longer in back swept away from her face and clamped somehow to the hat and veil in a manner both so simple and mysterious that my father fell to wondering about her what are you doing in the fall he asked her again she shrugged but maybe my father saw in her eyes through her white veil that my mother was hoping to be rescued from the scenario she imagined was her future we were nice to each other that first time i remember that mother told us we were both alone in a new place and we knew things about each other nobody else knew in those days i imagine that was intimate enough there wasnt any intimacy in those days franny said once even lovers wouldnt fart in front of each other and franny was forcefuli frequently believed her even frannys language was ahead of her timeas if she always knew where she was going and i would never quite catch up to her that first evening at the arbuthnot there was the staff band playing its imitation of the bigband sound but there were very few guests and even fewer dancers the season was just beginning and it begins slowly in maineits so cold there even in the summer the dance hall had a deck of hardshined wood that seemed to extend beyond the open porches that overlooked the ocean when it rained they had to drop awnings over the porches because the ballroom was so open on all sides that the rain washed in and wet the polished dance floor that first evening as a special treat to the staffand because there were so few guests and most of them had gone to bed to get warmthe band played late my father and mother and the other help were invited to dance for an hour or more my mother always remembered that the ballroom chandelier was brokenit blinked dimly uneven spots of colour dappled the dance floor which looked so soft and glossy in the ailing light that the floor appeared to have the texture of a candle im glad someone i know is here my mother whispered to my father who had rather formally asked her to dance and danced with her very stiffly but you dont know me father said i said that father told us so that your mother would shrug again and when she shrugged thinking him impossibly difficult to talk toand perhaps superiormy father was convinced that his attraction to her was not a fluke but i want you to know me he told her and i want to know you yuck franny always said at this point in the story the sound of an engine was drowning out the band and many of the dancers left the floor to see what the commotion was my mother was grateful for the interruption she couldnt think of what to say to father they walked not holding hands to the porch that faced the docks they saw under the dock lights swaying on the overhead wires a lobster boat putting out to sea the boat had just deposited on the dock a dark motorcycle which was now roaringrevving itself perhaps to free its tubes and pipes of the damp salt air its rider seemed intent on getting the noise right before he put the machine in gear the motorcycle had a sidecar attached and in it sat a dark figure hulking and still like a man made awkward by too many clothes its freud someone on the staff said and other older members of the staff cried out yes its freud its freud and state omaine my mother and father both thought that state omaine was the name of the motorcycle but then the band stopped playing seeing its audience was gone and some of the band members too joined the dancers on the porch freud people yelled my father always told us he was amused to imagine that the freud would any moment motor over beneath the porch and in the highstrung lights lining the perfect gravel driveway introduce himself to the staff so here comes sigmund freud father thought he was falling in love so anything was possible but this was not that freud of course it was the year when that freud died this freud was a viennese jew with a limp and an unpronounceable name who in the summers since he had been working at the arbuthnot since when hed left his native austria had earned the name freud for his abilities to soothe the distress of the staff and guests alike he was an entertainer and since he came from vienna and was a jew freud seemed only natural to some of the odd foreign wits at the arbuthnotbythesea the name seemed especially appropriate when in freud arrived for the summer on a new indian motorcycle with a sidecar hed made all by himself who gets to ride behind and who gets to ride in the sidecar freud the working girls at the hotel teased himbecause he was so frightfully scarred and ugly with pockmarks holes from the boils he called them that no woman would ever love him nobody rides with me but state omaine freud said and he unsnapped the canvas canopy from the sidecar in the sidecar sat a bear black as exhaust thicker with muscles than iowa bob warier than any stray dog freud had retrieved this bear from a logging camp in the north of the state and had convinced the management of the arbuthnot that he could train the beast to entertain the guests freud when he emigrated from austria had arrived in boothbay harbor by boat from new york with two job descriptions in capital letters on his work papers experience as animal trainer and keeper good mechanical aptitude there being no animals available he fixed the vehicles at the arbuthnot and properly put them to rest for the nontourist months when he travelled to the logging camps and the paper mills as a mechanic all that time he later told my father hed been looking for a bear bears freud said were where the money was when my father saw the man dismount from the motorcycle under the ballroom porch he wondered at the cheers from the veteran members of the staff when freud helped the figure from the sidecar my mothers first thought was that the passenger was an old old womanthe motorcyclists mother perhaps a stout woman wrapped in a dark blanket state omaine yelled someone in the band and blew his horn my mother and father saw the bear begin to dance he danced away from freud on his hind legs he dropped to all fours and did a short lap or two around the motorcycle freud stood on the motorcycle and clapped the bear called state omaine began to clap too when my mother felt my father take her hand into histhey were not clappingshe did not resist him she gave back equal pressure both of them never taking their eyes from the bulky bear performing below them and my mother thought i am nineteen and my life is just beginning you felt that really franny always asked everything is relative mother would say but thats what i felt yes i felt my life start holy cow said frank was it me or the bear you liked father asked dont be silly mother said it was the whole thing it was the start of my life and that line had the same fixmetothespot quality of fathers line about the bear he was too old to be a bear anymore i felt rooted to the story when my mother said that this was the start of her life it was as if i could see mothers life like the motorcycle after long revving finally chunk into gear and lurch forward and what must my father have imagined reaching for her hand just because a bear was brought by a lobster boat into his life i knew it would be my bear father told us i dont know how and perhaps it was this knowledgethat he saw something that would be histhat made him reach for my mother too you can see why we children asked so many questions it is a vague story the kind parents prefer to tell that first night they saw freud and his bear my father and mother did not even kiss when the band broke up and the help retired to the male and female dormitoriesthe slightly less elegant buildings separate from the main hotelmy father and mother went down to the docks and watched the water if they talked they never told us children what they said there must have been a few classy sailboats there and even the private piers in maine were sure to have a lobster boat or two moored off them there was probably a dinghy and my father suggested borrowing it for a short row my mother probably refused fort popham was a ruin then and not the tourist attraction it is today but if there were any lights on the fort popham shore they would have been visible from the arbuthnotbythesea also the broad mouth of the kennebec river at bay point had a bell buoy and a light and there might have been a lighthouse on stage island as long ago as my father never remembered but generally in those days it would have been a dark coast so that when the white sloop sailed toward themout of boston or new york out of the southwest and civilization anywaymy mother and father must have seen it very clearly and watched it undistracted for the time it took to come alongside the dock my father caught the mooring line he always told us he was at the point of panic about what to do with the ropetie it up to something or tug itwhen the man in the white dinner jacket black slacks and black dress shoes stepped easily off the deck and climbed the ladder up to the dock and took the rope from my fathers hands effortlessly the man guided the sloop past the end of the dock before he threw the rope back on board youre free he called to the boat then my mother and father claimed they saw no sailors on board but the sloop slipped away back to the seaits yellow lights leaving like sinking glassand the man in the dinner jacket turned to my father and said thanks for the hand are you new here yes we both are father said the mans perfect clothes were unaffected by his voyage for so early in the summer he was very tanned and he offered my mother and father cigarettes from a handsome flat black box they didnt smoke id hoped to catch the last dance the man said but the band has retired yes my mother said at nineteen my mother and father had never seen anyone quite like this man he had obscene confidence my mother told us he had money father said have freud and the bear arrived the man asked yes father said and the motorcycle the man in the white dinner jacket smoked hungrily but neatly while he looked at the dark hotel very few rooms were lit but the outdoor lights strung to illuminate the paths the hedgerows and the docks shone on the mans tanned face and made his eyes narrow and were reflected on the black moving sea freuds a jew you know the man said its a good thing he got out of europe when he did you know europes going to be no place for jews my broker told me this solemn news must have impressed my father eager to enter harvardand the worldand not yet aware that a war would interrupt his plans for a while the man in the white dinner jacket caused my father to take my mothers hand into his for the second time that evening and again she gave equal pressure as they politely waited for the man to finish his cigarette or say good night or go on but all he said was and the worlds going to be no place for bears his teeth were as white as his dinner jacket when he laughed and with the wind my father and mother didnt hear the hiss of his cigarette entering the oceanor the sloop coming alongside again suddenly the man stepped to the ladder and only when he slipped quickly down the rungs did mary bates and win berry realize that the white sloop was gliding under the ladder and the man was perfectly in time to drop to its deck no rope passed bands the sloop not under sail but chugging slowly under other power turned southwest toward boston or new york againunafraid of night traveland what the man in the white dinner jacket last called to them was lost in the sputter of the engine the slap of the hull on the sea and the wind that blew the gulls by like party hats with feathers bobbing in the water after drunks had thrown them there all his life my father wished hed heard what the man had to say it was freud who told my father that hed seen the owner of the arbuthnotbythesea ja that was him all right freud said thats how he comes just a couple of times a summer once he danced with a girl who worked herethe last dance we never saw her again a week later some other guy came for her things whats his name father asked maybe hes arbuthnot you know freud said someone said hes dutch but i never heard his name he knows all about europe thoughi can tell you that my father was dying to ask about the jews he felt my mother nudge him in his ribs they were sitting on one of the putting greens after hourswhen the green turned blue in the moonlight and the red golfing flag flapped in the cup the bear called state omaine had his muzzle off and was trying to scratch himself against the thin stem of the flag come here stupid freud said to the bear but the bear paid no attention to him is your family still in vienna my mother asked freud my sister is my only family he said and i dont hear nothing from her since a year ago march a year ago march my father said the nazis took austria ja youre telling me freud said state omaine frustrated by the lack of resistance the flagpole gave himfor scratchingslapped the flagpole out of the cup and sent it spinning across the putting green jesus god said freud hes going to start digging holes in the golf course if we dont go somewhere my father put the silly flag marked back into the cup my mother had been given the night off from serving and was still in her chambermaids uniform she ran ahead of the bear calling him the bear rarely ran he shambledand never very far from the motorcycle he rubbed up against the motorcycle so much that the red fender paint was shined as silvery as the chrome and the conical point of the sidecar was dented in from his pushing against it he had often burned himself on the pipes going to rub against the machine too soon after it had been driven so that there were ominous patches of charred bear hair stuck to the pipesas if the motorcycle itself had been at one time a furry animal correspondingly state omaine had ragged patches in his black coat where his fur was missing or singed flat and brownthe dull colour of dried seaweed what exactly the bear was trained to do was a mystery to everyoneeven something of a mystery to freud their act together performed before the lawn parties in the late afternoon was more of an effort for the motorcycle and freud than it was an effort for the bear around and around freud would drive the bear in the sidecar canopy snapped offthe bear like a pilot in an open cockpit without controls state omaine usually wore his muzzle in public it was a red leather thing that reminded my father of the face masks occasionally worn in the game of lacrosse the muzzle made the bear look smaller it further scrunched up his already wrinkled face and elongated his nose so that more than ever he resembled an overweight dog around and around they would drive and just before the bored guests returned to their conversation and abandoned this oddity freud would stop the motorcycle dismount with the engine running and walk to the sidecar where he would harass the bear in german this was funny to the crowd largely because someone speaking german was funny but freud would persist until the bear slowly would climb out of the sidecar and mount the motorcycle sitting in the drivers seat his heavy paws on the handlebars his short hind legs not able to reach the footposts or the rearbrake controls freud would climb into the sidecar and order the bear to drive off nothing would happen freud would sit in the sidecar protesting their lack of motion the bear would grimly hold the handlebars jounce in the saddle paddle his legs back and forth as if he were treading water state omaine someone would shout the bear would nod with a kind of embarrassed dignity and stay where he was freud now raging in a german everyone loved to hear climbed out of the sidecar and approached the bear at the controls he attempted to show the animal how to operate the motorcycle clutch freud would say hed hold the bears big paw over the clutch handle throttle he would shout hed rev the motorcycle with the bears other paw freuds indian had the gearshift mounted alongside the gas tank so that for a frightening moment the driver needed to take one hand from the handlebars to engage or change gears shift freud cried and slammed the cycle into gear whereupon the bear on the motorcycle would proceed across the lawn the throttle held at a steady low growl neither accelerating nor slowing down but moving resolutely toward the smug and beautifully attired gueststhe men even fresh from their sporting events wore hats even the male swimmers at the arbuthnotbythesea wore bathing suits with tops although the thirties saw trunks on men prevailing more and more not in maine the shoulders of the jackets mens and womens were padded the men wore white flannels wide and baggy the sportswomen wore saddle shoes with bobby socks the dressed women wore natural waistlines their sleeves frequently puffed all of them made quite a colourful stir as the bear bore down on them pursued by freud nein nein you dumb bear and state omaine his expression under the muzzle a mystery to the guests drove forward turning only slightly hulking over the handlebars you stupid animal freud cried the bear drove awayalways through a party tent without striking a support pole or snagging the white linen tablecloths that covered the tables of food and the bar he was pursued by waiters over the rich expanse of lawn the tennis players cheered from the courts but as the bear drew nearer to them they abandoned their game the bear either knew or didnt know what he was doing but he never hit a hedge and he never went too fast he never drove down to the docks and attempted to board a yacht or a lobster boat and freud always caught up with him when it seemed that the guests had seen enough freud mounted the cycle behind the bear hugging himself to the broad back he guided the beast and the indian back to the lawn party so a few kinks to work out hed call to the crowd a few flies in the ointment but nichts to worry in no time he will get it right that was the act it never changed that was all freud had taught state omaine he claimed it was all that the bear could learn hes not so smart a bear freud told father i got him when he was too old i thought hed be fine he was tamed as a cub but the logging camps taught him nothing those people have no manners anyway theyre just animals too they kept the bear as a pet they fed him enough so he wouldnt get nasty but they just let him hang around and be lazy like them i think this bears got a drinking problem because of them loggers he dont drink nowi dont let himbut he acts like he wants to you know father didnt know he thought freud was wonderful and the indian was the most beautiful machine he had ever met on days off my father would take my mother driving on the coast roads the two of them hugged together and cool in the salt air but they were never alone the motorcycle could not be driven away from the arbuthnot without state omaine in the sidecar the bear went berserk if the motorcycle tried to drive away without him it was the only event that could make the old bear run a bear can run surprisingly fast go ahead you try to get away freud told father but better push it down the driveway all the way out to the road before you start the engine and the first time you try it dont take poor mary with you wear lots of heavy clothes because if he catches you hell paw you all over he wont be madjust excited go on try it but if you look back after a few miles and hes still coming you better stop and bring him back hell have a heart attack or hell get losthes so stupid he dont know how to hunt or anything hes helpless if you dont feed him hes a pet hes not a real animal no more and hes only about twice as smart as a german shepherd and thats not smart enough for the world you know the world lilly would always ask her eyes popping but the world for my father in the summer of was new and affectionate with my mothers shy touches the roar of the indian and the strong smell of state omaine the cold maine nights and the wisdom of freud his limp of course was from a motorcycle accident the leg had been set improperly discrimination freud claimed freud was small strong alert as an animal a peculiar colour like a green olive cooked slowly until it almost browned he had glossy black hair a strange patch of which grew on his cheek just under one eye it was a silkysoft spot of hair bigger than most moles at least the size of an average coin more distinctive than any birthmark and as naturally a part of freuds face as a limpet attached to a maine rock its because my brain is so enormous freud told mother and father my brain dont leave room on my head for hair so the hair gets jealous and grows a little where it shouldnt maybe it was bear hair frank said once seriously and franny screamed and hugged me around the neck so hard that i bit my tongue frank is so weird she cried show us your bear hair frank poor frank was approaching puberty at the time he was ahead of his time and he was very embarrassed about it but not even franny could distract us from the mesmerizing spell of freud and his bear we children were as caught up with them as my father and mother must have been that summer of some nights father told us he would walk my mother to her dorm and kiss her good night if freud was asleep father would unchain state omaine from the motorcycle and slip his muzzle off so the bear could eat then my father would take him fishing there was a tarp staked low over the motorcycle like an open tent which protected state omaine from the rain and father would leave his fishing gear wrapped in the flap of that tarp for these occasions the two of them would go to the bay point dock it was beyond the row of hotel piers and choppy with lobster boats and fishermens dinghies father and state omaine would sit on the end of the dock while father cast what he called spooners for pollack he would feed the pollack live to state omaine there was only one evening when there was an altercation between them father usually caught three or four pollack that was enoughfor both father and state omaineand then theyd go home but one evening the pollack werent running and after an hour without a nibble father got up off the dock to take the bear back to his muzzle and chain come on he said no fish in the ocean tonight state omaine wouldnt leave come on father said but state omaine wouldnt let father leave the dock either earl the bear growled father sat down and kept fishing earl state omaine complained father cast and cast he changed spooners he tried everything if he could have dug for clam worms down on the mud flats he could have bottomfished for flounder but state omaine became unfriendly whenever father attempted to leave the dock father contemplated jumping in and swimming ashore he could sneak back to the dorm for freud then and they could come recapture state omaine with food from the hotel but after a while father got into the spirit of the evening and said all right all right so you want fish well catch a fish goddamn it a little before dawn a lobsterman came down to the dock to put out to sea he was going to pull his traps and he had some new traps with him to drop andunfortunatelyhe had bait with him too state omaine smelled the bait better give it to him father said earl said state omaine and the lobsterman gave the bear all his baitfish well repay you father said first thing i know what id like to do first thing the lobsterman said id like to put that bear in my traps and use him for bait id like to see him et up by lobsters earl said state omaine better not tease him father told the lobsterman who agreed ja hes not so smart that bear freud told father i should have warned you he can be funny about food they fed him too much at the logging camps he ate all the timelots of junk and sometimes now he just decides hes not eating enoughor he wants a drink or something you got to remember dont ever sit down to eat yourself if you havent fed him first he dont like that so state omaine was always well fed before he performed at the lawn partiesfor the white linen tablecloths were everywhere burdened with hors doeuvres fancy raw fish and grilled meats and if state omaine had been hungry there might have been trouble but freud stuffed state omaine before the act and the bloated bear drove the motorcycle calmly he was placid even bored at the handlebars as if the greatest physical need soon to seize him would be an awesome belch or the need to move his great bears bowels its a dumb act and im losing money freud said this place is too fancy theres only snobs who come here i should be someplace with a little cruder crowd someplace where theres bingo gamesnot just dancing i should be places that are more democraticplaces where they bet on dog fights you know my father didnt know but he must have marvelled at such placesrougher than the weirs at laconia or even hampton beach places where there were more drunks and more careless money for an act with a performing bear the arbuthnot was simply too refined a crowd for a man like freud and a bear like state omaine it was too refined even to appreciate that motorcycle the indian but my father realized that freud felt no ambition drawing him away freud had an easy summer at the arbuthnot the bear simply hadnt turned out to be the gold mine freud had hoped for what freud wanted was a different bear with a bear this dumb he told my mother and father theres no point in trying to better my take and you got other problems when you hustle them cheap resorts my mother took my fathers hand and gave it firm warning pressureperhaps because she saw him imagining those other problems those cheap resorts but my father was thinking of his tuition at harvard he liked the indian and the bear called state omaine he hadnt seen freud put the slightest effort into training the bear and win berry was a boy who believed in himself coach bobs son was a young man who imagined he could do anything he could imagine he had earlier planned that after the summer at the arbuthnot he would go to cambridge take a room and find a jobperhaps in boston he would get to know the area around harvard and get employed in the vicinity so that as soon as there was money for tuition he could enroll this way he imagined he might even be able to keep a parttime job and go to harvard my mother of course had liked this plan because boston to dairy and back again was an easy trip on the boston mainethe trains ran regularly then she was already imagining the visits from my fatherlong weekendsand perhaps the occasional though proper visits she might make to cambridge or boston to see him what do you know about bears anyway she asked or motorcycles she didnt like either his idea thatif freud was unwilling to part with his indian or his bearfather would travel the logging camps with freud win berry was a strong boy but not vulgar and mother imagined the camps to be vulgar places from which father would not emerge the sameor would not emerge at all she neednt have worried that summer and how it would end were obviously planned more hugely and inevitably than any trivial arrangements my father and mother could imagine ahead of them that summer of was as inevitable as the war in europe as it would soon be called and all of themfreud mary bates and winslow berrywere as lightly tossed along by the summer as the gulls knocked about in the rough currents at the mouth of the kennebec one night in late august when mother had served at the evening meal and had only just had time to change into her saddle shoes and the long skirt she played croquet in father was called from his room to assist with an injured man father ran past the lawn for croquet where mother was waiting for him she held a mallet over her shoulder the christmaslike light bulbs strung in the trees lit the lawn for croquet in such a ghostly way thatto my fathermy mother looked like an angel holding a club ill be right with you father said to her someones been hurt she came with him and some other running men and they ran down to the hotel piers alongside the dock was a throbbing big ship aglow with lights a band with too much brass was playing on board and the strong fuel smell and motor exhaust in the salt air mixed with the smell of crushed fruit it appeared that some enormous bowl of alcoholic fruit punch was being served to the ships guests and they were spilling it over themselves or washing the deck down with it at the end of the dock a man lay on his side bleeding from a wound in his cheek he had stumbled coming up the ladder and had torn his face on a mooring cleat he was a large man his face florid in the blue wash of the light from the moon and he sat up as soon as anybody touched him scheiss he said my father and mother recognized the german word for shit from freuds many performances with the assistance of several strong young men the german was brought to his feet he had bled magnificently over his white dinner jacket which seemed large enough to clothe two men his blueblack cummerbund resembled a curtain and his matching bow tie stuck up straight at his throat like a twisted propeller he was rather jowly and he smelled strongly of the fruit punch served on board ship he bellowed to someone from on board came a chorus of german and a tall tanned woman in an evening dress with yellow lace or ruching came up the docks ladder like a panther wearing silk the bleeding man seized her and leaned on her so heavily that the woman despite her own obvious strength and agility was pushed into my father who helped her maintain her balance she was much younger than the man my mother noted and also germanspeaking in an easy clucking manner to him while he continued to bleat and gesture nastily to those members of the german chorus left on board up the dock and up the gravel driveway the big couple wove at the entrance to the arbuthnot the woman turned to my father and said with a controlled accent he vill need stitches ja of course you haf a doctor the desk manager whispered to father get freud stitches freud said the doctor lives all the way in bath and hes a drunk but i know how to stitch anybody the desk manager ran out to the dorm and shouted for freud get on your indian and bring old doc todd here well sober him up when he arrives the manager said but for gods sake get going it will take an hour if i can find him freud said you know i can handle stitching just get me the proper clothes this is different the desk manager said i think its different freudi mean the guy hes a german freud and its his face thats cut freud stripped his work clothes off his pitted olive body he began to comb his damp hair the clothes he said just bring them its too complicated to get old doc todd the wound is on his face freud father said so whats a face said freud just skin ja like on the hands or foots ive sewn up lots of foots before axel and saw cutsthem stupid loggers outside the other germans from the ship were bringing trunks and heavy luggage the shortest distance from the pier to the entrancewayacross the eighteenth green look at those swine freud said putting dents where the little white ball will get caught the headwaiter came into freuds room it was the best room in the mens dormno one knew how freud ended up with it the headwaiter began to undress everything but your jacket dummy freud said to him doctors dont wear waiters jackets father had a black tuxedo jacket that more or less agreed with the waiters black pants and he brought it to freud ive told them a million times the headwaiter saidalthough he looked strange saying this with any authority while he was naked there should be a doctor who actually lives at the hotel when freud was all dressed he said there is the desk manager ran back to the main hotel ahead of him father watched the headwaiter looking helplessly at freuds abandoned clothes they were not very clean and they smelled strongly of state omaine the waiter clearly did not want to put them on father ran to catch up with freud the germans now in the driveway outside the entrance were grinding a large trunk across the gravel someone would have to rake the stones in the morning is der not enough help at dis hotel to help us one of the germans yelled on the spotless counter in the serving room between the main dining hall and the kitchen the big german with the gashed cheek lay like a corpse his pale head resting on his foldedup dinner jacket which would never be white again his propeller of a dark tie sagged limply at his throat his cummerbund heaved itz a goot doctor he asked the desk manager the young giantess in the gown with the yellow ruching held the germans hand an excellent doctor the desk manager said especially at stitching my father said my mother held his hand itz not too civilized a hotel i tink the german said itz in der vilderness the tawny athletic woman said but she dismissed herself with a laugh but itz nicht so bad a cut i tink she told father and mother and the desk manager we dont need too goot a doctor to fix it up i tink just so itz no jew the german said he coughed freud was in the small room though none of them had seen him he was having trouble threading a needle itz no jew im sure the tawny princess laughed they haf no jews in maine when she saw freud she didnt look so sure guten abend meine dame und herr freud said was ist los my father said that freud in the black tuxedo was a figure so runted and distorted by his boil scars that he immediately looked as if he had stolen his clothes the clothes appeared to have been stolen from at least two different people even his most visible instrument was blacka black spool of thread which freud grasped in the greyrubber kitchen gloves the dishwashers wore the best needle to be found in the laundry room of the arbuthnot looked too large in freuds small hand as if hed grabbed the needle used to sew the sails for the racing boats perhaps he had herr doktor the german asked his face whitening his wound appeared to stop bleeding instantly herr doktor professor freud freud said moving in close and leering at the wound freud the woman said ja freud said when he poured the first shot glass of whiskey into the germans cut the whiskey washed into the germans eyes ooops said freud im blind im blind the german sang nein youre nicht so blind freud said but you should have shut your eyes he splashed another glass in the wound then he went to work in the morning the manager asked freud not to perform with state omaine until after the germans leftthey were leaving as soon as ample provisions could be loaded aboard their large vessel freud refused to remain attired as a doctor he insisted on tinkering with the indian in his mechanics costume so it was in such attire that the german found him seaward of the tennis courts not exactly hidden from the main hotel grounds and the lawns of play but discreetly off to himself the huge bandaged face of the german was badly swollen and he approached freud warily as if the little motorcycle mechanic might be the alarming twin brother of the herr doktor professor of the night before nein itz him said the tanned woman trailing on the germans arm whats the jew doctor fixing this morning the german asked freud my hobby freud said not looking up my father who was handing freud his motorcycle toolslike an assistant to a surgeontook a firmer grip on the threequartersinch wrench the german couple did not see the bear state omaine was scratching himself against the fence of the tennis courtmaking deep thrusting scratches with his back against the metal mesh groaning to himself and rocking to a rhythm akin to masturbation my mother to make him more comfortable had removed his muzzle i never heard of such a motorcycle as dis the german told freud critically itz junk i tink ja whats an indian i never heard of it you should try riding it yourself freud said want to the german woman seemed unsure of the ideaand quite sure that she didnt want tobut the idea clearly appealed to the german he stood close to the motorcycle and touched its gas tank and ran his fingers over its clutch cable and fondled the knob to the gearshift he seized the throttle at the handlebars and gave it a sharp twist he felt the soft rubber tubelike an exposed vital organ among so much metalwhere the gas ran from the tank into the carburetor he opened the valve to the carburetor without asking freuds permission he tickled the valve and wet his fingers with gasoline then wiped his fingers on the seat you dont mind herrdoktor the german asked freud no go on freud said take it for a spin and that was the summer of my father saw how it would end but he could not move to interfere i couldnt have stopped it father always said it was coming like the war mother at the tennis court fence saw the german mount the motorcycle she thought shed better put state omaines muzzle back on but the bear was impatient with her he shook his head and scratched himself harder just a standard kick starter ja the german asked just kick it over and shell start right up freud said something about the way he and father stepped away from the motorcycle made the young german woman join them she stepped back too here goes the german said and kicked the starter down with the first catch of the engine before the first rev the bear called state omaine stood erect against the tennis court fence the coarse fur on his dense chest stiffening he stared across centre court at the indian that was trying to go somewhere without him when the german chunked the machine into gear and began rather timidly to advance across the grass to a nearby gravel path state omaine dropped to all fours and charged he was in full stride when he crossed centre court and broke up the doubles gameracquets falling balls rolling loose the player who was playing net chose to hug the net instead he shut his eyes as the bear tore by him earl cried state omaine but the german on the throaty indian couldnt hear anything the german woman heard however and turnedwith father and freudto see the bear gott vut vilderness she cried and fainted sideways against my father who wrestled her gently to the lawn when the german saw that a bear was after him he had not yet got his bearings he was unsure which way the main road was if hed found the main road of course he could have outdistanced the bear but confined to the narrow paths and walkways of the hotel grounds and the soft fields for sports he lacked the necessary speed earl growled the bear the german swerved across the croquet lawn and headed for the picnic tents where they were setting up for lunch the bear was on the motorcycle in less than twentyfive yards clumsily trying to mount behind the germanas if state omaine had finally learned freuds driving lesson and was about to insist that the act be performed properly the german would not allow freud to stitch him up this time and even freud confessed that it was too big a job for him what a mess freud wondered aloud to my father such a lot of stitchesnot for me i couldnt stand to hear him bawl all the time it would take so the german was transported by the coast guard to the hospital at bath state omaine was concealed in the laundry room so that the bears mythical status as a wild animal could be confirmed out of the voods it came said the revived german woman it must haf been incensed by der noise from der motorcycle a shebear with young cubs freud explained sehr treacherous at this time of year but the management of the arbuthnotbythesea would not allow the matter to be dismissed so easily freud knew that im leaving before i have to talk with him again freud told father and mother they knew that freud meant the owner of the arbuthnot the man in the white dinner jacket who occasionally showed up for the last dance i can just hear him the big shot now freud you knew the riskwe discussed it when i agreed to have the animal here we agreed he would be your responsiblity and if he tells me im a lucky jewto be in his fucking america in the first placei will let state omaine eat him freud said him and his fancy cigarettes i dont need this isnt my kind of hotel anyway the bear nervous at being confined in the laundry room and worried to see freud packing his clothes as fast as they came out of the washstill wetbegan to growl to himself earl he whispered oh shut up freud yelled youre not my kind of bear either it was my fault my mother said i shouldnt have taken his muzzle off those were just love bites freud said it was the brutes claws that really carved that fucker up if he hadnt tried to pull state omaines fur father said i dont think it would have gotten so bad of course it wouldnt have freud said who likes to have hair pulled earl complained state omaine that should be your name earl freud told the bear youre so stupid thats all you ever say but what will you do father asked freud where can you go back to europe freud said they got smart bears there they have nazis there father said give me a smart bear and fuck the nazis freud said ill take care of state omaine father said you can do better than that freud said you can buy him two hundred dollars and what you got for clothes these are all wet he shouted throwing his clothes earl said the bear distressed watch your language earl freud told him two hundred dollars mother asked thats all theyve paid me so far father said i know what they pay you freud said thats why its only two hundred dollars of course its for the motorcycle too youve seen why you need to keep the indian ja state omaine dont get in cars they make him throw up and some woodsman chained him in a pickup oncei saw that the dumb bear tore the tailgate off and beat in the rear window and mauled the guy in the cab so dont you be dumb buy the indian two hundred dollars father repeated now for your clothes freud said he left his own wet things on the laundry room floor the bear tried to follow them to my fathers room but freud told my mother to take state omaine outside and chain him to the motorcycle he knows youre leaving and hes nervous poor thing mother said he just misses the motorcycle freud said but he let the bear come upstairsalthough the arbuthnot had asked him not to allow this what do i care now what they allow freud said trying on my fathers clothes my mother watched up and down the hall bears and women were not allowed in the mens dorm my clothes are all too big for you my father told freud when freud had dressed himself im still growing said freud who must have been at least forty then if id had the right clothes id be bigger now he wore three of my fathers suit pants one pair right over the other he wore two suit jackets the pockets stuffed with underwear and socks and he carried a third jacket over his shoulder why trouble with suitcases he asked but how will you get to europe mother whispered into the room by crossing the atlantic ocean freud said come in here he said to mother he took my mothers and fathers hands and joined them together youre only teenagers he told them so listen to me you are in love we start from this assumption ja and although my mother and father had never admitted any such thing to each other they both nodded while freud held their hands okay freud said now three things from this follow you promise me you will agree to these three things i promise said my father so do i mother said okay said freud heres number one you get married right away before some clods and whores change your minds got it you get married even though it will cost you yes my parents agreed heres number two freud said looking only at my father you go to harvardyou promise meeven though it will cost you but ill already be married my father said i said it will cost you didnt i freud said you promise me youll go to harvard you take every opportunity given you in this world even if you have too many opportunities one day the opportunities stop you know i want you to go to harvard anyway mother told father even though it will cost me father said but he agreed to go were up to number three freud said you ready and he turned to my mother he dropped my fathers hand he even shoved it away from his so that he was holding mothers hand all alone forgive him freud told her even though it will cost you forgive me for what father said just forgive him freud said looking only at my mother she shrugged and you freud said to the bear who was sniffing around under fathers bed freud startled state omaine whod found a tennis ball under the bed and put it in his mouth urp the bear said out came the tennis ball you freud said to the bear may you one day be grateful that you were rescued from the disgusting world of nature that was all it was a wedding and a benediction my mother always said it was a good oldfashioned jewish service my father always said jews were a mystery to himof the order of china india and africa and all the exotic places hed never been father chained the bear to the motorcycle when he and mother kissed freud goodbye the bear tried to butt his head between them watch out freud cried and they scattered apart he thought we were eating something freud told mother and father watch out how you kiss around him he dont understand kissing he thinks its eating earl the bear said and please for me freud said call him earlthats all he ever says and state omaine is such a dumb name earl my mother said earl the bear said okay father said earl it is goodbye earl freud said auf wiedersehen they watched freud for a long time waiting on the bay point dock for a boat going to boothbay and when a lobsterman finally took himalthough my parents knew that in boothbay freud would be boarding a larger shipthey thought how it looked as if the lobster boat were taking freud to europe all the way across the dark ocean they watched the boat chug and bob until it seemed smaller than a tern or even a sandpiper on the sea but then it was out of hearing did you do it for the first time that night franny always asked franny mother said well you said you felt married franny said never mind when we did it father said but you did right franny said never mind that frank said it doesnt matter when lilly said in her weird way and that was trueit didnt really matter when when they left the summer of and the arbuthnotbythesea my mother and father were in loveand in their minds married after all they had promised freud they had his indian and his bear now named earl and when they arrived home in dairy new hampshire they drove first to the bates family house marys home my mothers mother called whats that machine shes on said old latin emeritus whos that with her its a motorcycle and thats win berry my mothers mother said no no said latin emeritus whos the other one the old man stared at the bundled figure in the sidecar it must be coach bob said my mothers mother that moron latin emeritus said what in hell is he wearing in this weather dont they know how to dress in iowa im going to marry win berry my mother rushed up and told her parents thats his motorcycle hes going to harvard and this is earl coach bob was more understanding he liked earl id love to know what he could benchpress the former big ten lineman said but cant we cut his nails it was silly to have another wedding my father thought that freuds service would suffice but my mothers family insisted that they be married by the congregational minister who had taken mother to her graduation dance and so they were it was a small informal wedding where coach bob played the best man and latin emeritus gave his daughter away with only an occasional mumbling of an odd latin phrase my mothers mother wept full of the knowledge that win berry was not the harvard man destined to whisk mary bates back to bostonat least not right away earl sat out the whole service in the sidecar of the indian where he was pacified with crackers and herring my mother and father had a brief honeymoon by themselves then you surely must have done it franny always cried but they probably didnt they didnt stay anywhere overnight they took an early train to boston and wandered around cambridge imagining themselves living there one day and father attending harvard they took the milk train back to new hampshire arriving at dawn the next day their first nuptial bed would have been the single bed in my mothers girlhood room in the house of latin emerituswhich was where my mother would still reside while father sought his fortune for harvard coach bob was sorry to see earl leave bob was sure the bear could be taught to play defensive end but my father told iowa bob that the bear was going to be his familys meal ticket and his tuition so one evening after the nazis took poland with the earliest nip of fall in the air my mother kissed my father goodbye on the athletic fields of the dairy school which rolled right up to iowa bobs back door look after your parents my father told mother and ill be back to look after you yuck franny always groaned for some reason this part bothered her she never believed it lilly too shivered and turned up her nose shut up and listen to the story frank always said at least im not opinionated to the degree of my brothers and sisters i could simply see how mother and father must have kissed carefullycoach bob amusing the bear with some game so that earl would not think my mother and father were eating something that they werent sharing with him kissing would always be hazardous around earl my mother told us that she knew my father would be faithful to her because the bear would maul him if he kissed anybody and were you faithful franny asked father in her terrible way why of course father said ill bet franny said lilly always looked worriedfrank looked away that was the fall of although she didnt know it my mother was already pregnantwith frank my father would motorcycle down the east coast his exploration of resort hotelsthe bigband sounds the bingo crowds and the casinostaking him farther and farther south as the seasons changed he was in texas in the spring of when frank was born father and earl were at that time touring with an outfit called the lone star brass band bears were popular in texasalthough some drunk in fort worth had tried to steal the indian unaware that earl slept chained to it texas law charged father for the mans hospitalization and it cost father some more of his earnings to drive all the way east to welcome his first child into the world my mother was still in the hospital when father returned to dairy they called frank frank because my father said that was what they would always be to each other and to the family frank yuck franny used to say but frank was quite proud of the origins of his name father stayed with my mother in dairy only long enough to get her pregnant again then he and earl hit virginia beach and the carolinas they were banned from falmouth cape cod on the fourth of july and back home with mother in dairyto recoversoon after their disaster the indian had thrown a bearing in the falmouth independence day parade and earl had run amok when a fireman from buzzards bay tried to help father with the ailing motorcycle the fireman was unfortunately accompanied by two dalmatian dogs a breed not known for intelligence doing nothing to disprove their reputation the dalmatians attacked earl in the sidecar earl beheaded one of them quite cleanly then chased the other one into the marching unit of the osterville mens softball team where the foolish dog attempted to conceal himself the parade was thus scattered the grieving fireman from buzzards bay refused my father any more help with the indian and the sheriff of falmouth escorted father and earl to the city limits since earl refused to ride in cars this had been a most tedious escort earl sitting in the sidecar of the motorcycle which had to be towed they were five days finding parts to rebuild the engine worse earl had developed a taste for dogs coach bob tried to train him out of this maiming habit by teaching him other sports retrieving balls perfecting the forward rolleven situpsbut earl was already old and not blessed with the belief in vigorous exercise that possessed iowa bob slaughtering dogs didnt even require much running earl discovered if he was slyand earl was slythe dogs would come right up to him and then its all over coach bob observed what a hell of a linebacker he could have been so father kept earl chained most of the time and tried to make him wear his muzzle mother said that earl was depressedshe found the old bear increasingly sadbut my father said that earl wasnt depressed in the slightest hes just thinking about dogs father said and hes perfectly happy to be attached to the motorcycle that summer of father lived at the bates house in dairy and worked the hampton beach crowd at night he managed to teach earl a new routine it was called applying for a job and it saved wear and tear on the old indian earl and father performed in the outdoor bandstand at hampton beach when the lights came on earl would be seated in a chair wearing a mans suit the suit radically altered had once belonged to coach bob after the laughter died down my father entered the bandstand with a piece of paper in one hand your name father would ask earl earl said yes earl i see father said and you want a job earl earl said earl yes i know its earl but you want ajob right father said except it says here that you cant type you cant even readit saysand you have a drinking problem earl earl agreed the crowd occasionally threw fruit but father had fed earl well this was not the same kind of crowd that father remembered from the arbuthnot well if all you can say is your own name father said i would venture to say that either youve been drinking this very night or youre too stupid to even know how to take off your own clothes earl said nothing well father asked lets see if you can do it take off your own clothes go on and here father would pull the chair out from under earl who would do one of the forward rolls coach bob had taught him so you can do a somersault father said big deal the clothes earl lets see the clothes come off for some reason it is silly for a crowd of humans to watch a bear undress my mother hated this routineshe said it was unfair to earl to expose him to such a rowdy uncouth bunch when earl undressed father usually had to help him with his tiewithout help earl would get frustrated and rip it off his neck you sure are hard on ties earl father would say then the audience at hampton beach loved it when earl was undressed father would say well come ondont stop now off with the bear suit earl earl would say off with the bear suit father would say and hed pull earls furjust a little earl earl would roar and the audience would scream in alarm my god youre a real bear father would cry earl earl would bellow and chase father around and around the chairhalf the audience fleeing into the night some of them stumbling through the soft beach sand and down to the water some of them threw more fruit and paper cups with warm beer a more gentle act for earl was performed once a week in the hampton beach casino mother had refined earls dancing style and she would kick off the big bands opening number by taking a turn with earl around the empty floor the couples crowded close and wondering at themthe short bent broad bear in iowa bobs suit surprisingly graceful on his hind paws shuffling after my mother who led those evenings coach bob would babysit with frank mother and father and earl would drive home along the coast road stopping to watch the surf at rye where the homes of the rich were the surf at rye was called the breakers the new hampshire coast was both more civilized and more seedy than maine but the phosphorescence off the breakers at rye must have reminded my parents of evenings at the arbuthnot they said they always paused there before driving home to dairy one night earl did not want to leave the breakers at rye he thinks im taking him fishing father said look earl ive got no gearno bait no spooners no poledummy father said to the bear holding out his empty hands earl looked bewildered they realized the bear was nearly blind they talked earl out of fishing and took him home how did he get so old my mother asked my father hes started peeing in the sidecar father said my mother was quite pregnant this time with franny when father left for the winter season in the fall of he had decided on florida and mother first heard from him in clearwater and then from tarpon springs earl had acquired an odd skin diseasean ear infection some fungus peculiar to bearsand business was slow that was shortly before franny was born late in the winter of father was not home for this birth and franny never forgave him for it i suspect he knew i would be a girl franny was fond of saying it was the summer of before father was back in dairy again he promptly impregnated my mother with me he promised he would not have to leave her again he had enough money from a successful circus stint in miami to start harvard in the fall they could have a relaxed summer playing hampton beach only when they felt like it he would commute on the train to boston for his classes unless a cheap place in cambridge turned up earl was getting older by the minute a pale blue salve the texture of the film on a jellyfish had to be put in his eyes every day earl rubbed it off on the furniture my mother noticed alarming absences of hair from much of his body which seemed shrunken and looser hes lost his muscle tone coach bob worried he ought to be lifting weights or running just try to get away from him on the indian my father told his father hell run but when coach bob tried it he got away with it earl didnt run he didnt care with earl father said familiarity does breed a little contempt he had worked with earl long and hard enough to understand freuds exasperation with the bear my mother and father rarely talked of freud with the war in europe it was too easy to imagine what could have happened to him the liquor stores in harvard square sold wilsons thats all rye whiskey very cheap but my father was not a drinker the oxford grill in cambridge used to dispense draught beer in a glass container the shape of a brandy snifter and holding a gallon if you could drink this within some brief amount of time you got a free one but father drank one regular beer there when his weeks classes were over and hed hurry to the north station to catch the train to dairy he accelerated his courses as much as possible to graduate sooner he was able to do this not because he was smarter than the other harvard boys he was older but not smarter than most of them but because he spent little time with friends he had a pregnant wife and two babies he hardly had time for friends his only recreation he said was listening to professional baseball games on the radio just a few months after the world series father listened to the news of the attack on pearl harbor i was born in march of and named johnafter john harvard franny had been called franny because it somehow went with frank my mother was not only busy taking care of us she was busy taking care of old latin emeritus and helping coach bob with the aged earl she didnt have time for friends either by the end of summer of the war had really obtruded on everyone it was no longer just the war in europe and although it used very little gas the indian was retired to the status of living quarters for earl it was no longer used for transportation patriotic mania spread across the nations campuses students were allowed to receive sugar stamps which most students gave to their families within a threemonth period every acquaintance father had at harvard either was drafted or had volunteered into some programme when latin emeritus diedand in her sleep my mothers mother quickly followed himmy mother came into a modest inheritance my father accelerated his induction voluntarily and went off in the spring of for basic training he was twentythree he left behind frank franny and me with mother in the bates family house he left behind his father iowa bob to whom he trusted the tedious care of earl my father wrote home that basic training was a lesson in ruining the hotels of atlantic city they washed down the wood floors daily and marched off down the boardwalk for rifle training on a sand dune the bars on the boardwalk did a booming business with the trainees except my father no one inquired about age the trainees most of them younger than my father wore all their marksmans medals and drank on the bars were full of office girls from washington and everyone smoked unfiltered cigarettesexcept my father father said everyone romanticized about a last fling before going overseas although far fewer realized it than boasted of it father at least had hiswith my mother in a hotel in new jersey this time fortunately he did not make her pregnant so mother would not be adding to frank franny and me for a while from atlantic city my father went to a former prep school north of new york for cryptographic training he was then sent to chanute fieldkearns utahand then to savannah georgia where hed earlier performed with earl in the old desoto hotel then it was hampton roads port of embarkation and my father went to the war in europe having a vague idea that he might find freud there father felt confident that by leaving three offspring with my mother he was ensuring his safe return he had air force assignment at a bomber base in italy and the greatest danger was shooting someone when drunk being shot by someone who was drunk or falling into the latrine when drunkwhich actually happened to a colonel my father knew the colonel was crapped on several times before he was rescued the only other danger involved acquiring a venereal disease from an italian whore and since my father did not drink or screw he had a safe passage through world war ii he left italy via navy transport and trinidad to brazilwhich is like italy in portuguese he wrote my mother he flew back to the states with a shellshocked pilot who buzzed a c up the broadest street of miami from the air my father recognized a parking lot where earl had vomited after a performance my mothers contribution to the war effortalthough she did secretarial work for her alma mater the thompson female seminaryconsisted of hospital training she was in the second class the dairy hospital gave to prepare nurses aides she worked one eighthour shift per week and was on call for substitutions which were frequent there being a great shortage of nurses her favourite stations were the maternity ward and the delivery room she knew what it was like to have a baby in that hospital with no husband around that was how my mother spent the war just after the war father took coach bob to see a professional football game which was played in fenway park boston on their way to the north station to take the train back home to dairy they met one of fathers harvard classmates who sold them a chevy coupe for dollarsa bit more than it cost new but it was in fair shape and gasoline was ridiculously cheap maybe twenty cents a gallon coach bob and my father split the cost of insurance so at last our family had a car while father finished his degree at harvard my mother had a means to take frank franny and me to the beaches on the new hampshire shore and iowa bob drove us once to the white mountains where frank was badly stung by yellow jackets when franny pushed him into a nest harvard life had changed the rooms were overcrowded the crimson had a new crew the slavic studies students claimed responsibility for the american discovery of vodka no one mixed it with anythingyou drank it russian style cold and straight in little stemmed glassesbut my father stuck with beer and changed his major to english literature that way he tried once again to accelerate his graduation there were not many of the big bands around ballroom dancing was declining as a sport and pastime and earl was too decrepit to perform anymore my fathers first christmas out of the air force he worked in the toy department of jordan marsh and made my mother pregnant again this time it would be lilly as concrete as the reasons were for calling frank frank and franny franny and me john there was no specific reason for calling lilly lillya fact that would bother lilly perhaps more than we knew maybe for all her life father graduated with the harvard class of the dairy school had just hired a new headmaster who interviewed my father at the harvard faculty club and offered him a jobto teach english and coach two sportsfor a starting salary of twentyone hundred dollars coach bob had probably put the new headmaster up to it my father was twentysix he accepted the position at the dairy school although it hardly struck him as his lifes calling it would simply mean he could finally live with my mother and us children in the bates family house in dairy near to his father and near to earlhis ancient bear at this phase in his life my fathers dreams were clearly more important to him than his education perhaps even more important to him than we children certainly more important to him than world war ii at every phase of his life franny would say lilly was born in when frank was six franny was five and i was four we suddenly had a fatheras if for the first time really he had been at war at school and on the road with earl all our lives so far he was a stranger to us the first thing he did with us in the fall of was to take us to maine where wed never been before to visit the arbuthnotbythesea of course it was a romantic pilgrimage for my father and motheran expedition for old times sake lilly was too young to travel and earl was too old but father insisted that earl come with us the arbuthnot is his place too for gods sake father told mother it wouldnt be the sameto be at the arbuthnot without old state omaine so lilly was left with coach bob and mother drove the chevy coupe with frank franny and me a big basket of picnic food and a mountain of blankets father got the indian running he drove it with earl in the sidecar that was how we travelled unbelievably slowly up the tortuous coast highway many years before there was a maine turnpike it took hours to get to brunswick it took another hour past bath and then we saw the rough moving bruisecoloured water that was the mouth of the kennebec meeting the sea fort popham and the fishing shacks at bay pointand the chain drawn across the driveway to the arbuthnot the sign said closed for the season the arbuthnot had been closed for many seasons father must have realized this soon after he took down the chain and our caravan drove up to the old hotel bleached colourless as bones the buildings stood abandoned and boardedup every window that was showing had been smashed or shot out the faded flag for the eighteenth green had been stabbed into a crack between the floorboards of the overhanging porch where the ballroom was the flag drooped from the arbuthnotbythesea as if to indicate that this had been a castle taken by siege jesus god father said we children huddled around my mother and complained it was cold it was foggy the place scared us wed been told we were going to a resort hotel and if this was what a hotel was we knew we wouldnt like it great clots of grass had pushed their way through the ruptured clay of the tennis courts and the lawn for croquet was kneehigh to my father with a sawedged kind of marsh grass that grows wildly by salt water frank cut himself on an old wicket and began to snivel franny insisted on fathers carrying her i hung to my mothers hips earl whose arthritis affected him disagreeably refused to move away from the motorcycle and threw up in his muzzle when father took his muzzle off earl found something in the dirt and tried to eat it it was an old tennis ball which father took from him and tossed far away toward the sea gamely earl started to retrieve the ball then the old bear seemed to forget what he was doing and just sat there squinting at the docks probably he could barely see them the hotel piers were sagging the boathouse had been washed out to sea in a hurricane during the war the fishermen had tried to use the old docks to bolster up their fishing weirs which were strung together down at the lobstermens dock at bay point where a man or a boy appeared to be standing guard with a rifle he was stationed there to shoot seals father had to explainbecause the faroff figure with the gun startled my mother seals were the number one reason why weir fishing would never be too successful in maine the seals broke into the weirs gorged themselves on the trapped fish and then broke out they ate a lot of fish this way and destroyed the nets in the process and the fishermen shot them whenever they could its what freud would have called one of the gross rules of nature father said he insisted on showing us the dormitories where he and mother had stayed it must have been depressing to both of themit was simply uncomfortable and foreign to us childrenbut i think my mother was more upset at fathers reaction to the fall of the arbuthnot than she was upset by what had happened to the once great resort the war changed a lot of things mother said showing us her famous shrug jesus god father kept saying think of what it could have been he cried how could they have blown it they werent democratic enough he told us baffled kids there ought to be a way to have standards to have good taste and still not be so exclusive that you go under there ought to be a livable compromise between the arbuthnot and some hole like hampton beach jesus god he kept calling out jesus god we followed him around the beaten buildings the mangled and grownamok lawns we found the old bus that the band members had travelled in and the truck the grounds crew had usedit was full of rusty golf clubs they were the vehicles freud had fixed and kept running they wouldnt run anymore jesus god father said we heard earl calling to us from far away earl he called we heard two shots from the rifle from far awaydown on the bay point dock i think we all knew that it was not the sound of a seal being shot it was earl oh no win my mother said she picked me up and started running frank ran in agitated circles around her father ran with franny in his arms state omaine he cried i shot a bear the boy on the dock was calling i shot a whole bear he was a boy in dungaree coveralls and a soft flannel shirt both knees were gone out of the coveralls and his carrotcoloured hair was stiff and shiny from saltwater spray he had a curious rash on his pale face he had very poor teeth he was only thirteen or fourteen years old i shot a bear he screamed he was very excited and the fishermen out on the sea must have wondered what he was yelling about they couldnt hear him over their trolling motors and the wind off the water but they slowly gathered their boats around the dock and came bobbing in to land to see what the matter was earl lay on the dock with his big head on a coil of tarred rope his hind paws crumpled under him and one heavy forepaw only inches from a bucket of baitfish the bears eyes had been so bad for so long he must have mistaken the boy with the rifle for father with a fishing pole he might even dimly have remembered eating lots of pollack off that dock and when he wandered down there and got close to the boy the old bears nose was still good enough to smell the bait the boy watching out to seafor sealshad no doubt been frightened by the way the bear had greeted him he was a good shot although at that range even a poor shot would have hit earl the boy shot the bear twice in the heart gosh i didnt know he belonged to anybody the boy with the rifle told my mother i didnt know he was a pet of course you didnt my mother soothed him im sorry mister the boy told father but father didnt hear him he sat beside earl on the dock and raised the dead bears head into his lap he hugged earls old face to his stomach and cried and cried he was crying for more than earl of course he was crying for the arbuthnot and freud and for the summer of but we were very worried we childrenbecause at that time we had known earl longer and better than we really knew our father it was very confusing to uswhy this man home from harvard and home from the war should be dissolved in tears hugging our old bear we were all of us really too young to have known earl but the bears presencethe stiff feel of his fur the heat of his fruity and mudlike breath the deadgeranium and urine smell of himwas more memorable to us for example than the ghosts of latin emeritus and my mothers mother i truly remember this day on the dock below the ruined arbuthnot i was four and i sincerely believe that this is my first memory of life itselfas opposed to what i was told happened as opposed to the pictures other people have painted for me the man with the strong body and the gentlemans face was my father who had come to live with us he sat sobbing with earl in his armson a rotting dock over dangerous water little boats chugged nearer and nearer my mother hugged us to her as tightly as father held fast to earl i think the dumb kid shot someones dog a man in one of the boats said up the docks ladder came an old fisherman in a dirtyyellow oilskin slicker his face a mottled tan beneath a dirtywhite and spotty beard his wet boots sloshed and he smelled more strongly of fish than the bucket of bait by earls curled paw he was plenty old enough to have been active in the vicinity in the days when the arbuthnotbythesea had been the grand hotel it was the fisherman too had seen better days when this old man saw the dead bear he took off his broad souwester hat and held it in one hand which was big and hard as a gaff holy cow he said reverently wrapping an arm around the shoulders of the shaken boy with the rifle holy cow you kilt state omaine the first hotel new hampshire the first hotel new hampshire came about this way when the dairy school realized it had to admit women to its student body in order to survive the thompson female seminary was put out of business there was suddenly a large unusable piece of real estate on the dairy marketa market that was forever depressed no one knew what to do with the huge building that had once been an allgirls school they should burn it mother suggested and turn the whole area into a park it was something of a park anywaya high plot of ground maybe two acres in the dilapidated heart of the town of dairy old clapboard houses once for large families and now rented piecemeal to widows and widowersand to the retired dairy school facultysurrounded by dying elms which surrounded the fourstory brick monster of a school building which was named after ethel thompson miss thompson had been an episcopal minister who had successfully masqueraded as a man until her death the reverend edward thompson shed been called rector of the dairy episcopal parish and notorious for hiding runaway slaves in the rectory the discovery that she was a woman following an accident in which she was crushed while changing a wheel of her carriage came as no surprise to a few of the dairy menfolk who had taken their problems to her at the height of her popularity as rector she had somehow acquired a lot of money not a penny of which was left to the church it was all left to found a female seminaryuntil ethel thompson wrote that abomination of a boys academy is forced to take in girls my father would have agreed that the dairy school was an abomination although we children loved playing on its athletic fields father never ceased reminding us that dairy was not a real school just as the town of dairy had once been dairy land so had the athletic fields of the school been a pasture for cows and when the school had been founded in the early s the old barns were allowed to stand beside the newer school buildings and the old cows were allowed like the students to wander freely about the school modern landscaping had improved the fields for sports but the barns and the first of the original buildings still occupied the scruffy centre of the campus some token cows still occupied the barns it had been the schools game plan as coach bob called it to have the students care for the dairy farm while going to schoola plan that led to a lax education and poorly caredfor cows a plan that was abandoned before the first world war there were still those on the dairy school facultyand many of them were the newer younger facultywho believed that this combination of a school and a farm should be returned to my father resisted the plan to return the dairy school to what he called a barnyardexperiment in education when my kids are old enough to go to this wretched school he would rage to my mother and to coach bob they will no doubt be given academic credit for planting a garden and varsity letters for shovelling shit said iowa bob the school in other words was in search of a philosophy it was now firmly secondrate among conventional prep schools although it modelled its curriculum on the acquiring of academic skills the schools faculty grew less and less able to teach such skills and conveniently less convinced of the need for such skillsafter all the student body was decreasingly receptive admissions were down hence admission standards fell even lower the school became one of those places you could get into almost immediately upon being thrown out of another school a few of the faculty like my father who believed in teaching people how to read and writeand even punctuatedespaired that such skills were largely wasted on students like these pearls before swine father ranted we might as well teach them how to rake hay and milk cows they cant play football either coach bob mourned they wont block for each other they wont even run father said they wont hit anybody said iowa bob oh yes they will said frank who was always picked on they broke into the greenhouse and vandalized all the plants said mother who read of this incident in the school paper which was father said illiterate one of them showed me his thing franny said to cause trouble where father said behind the hockey rink franny said what were you doing behind the hockey rink anyway frank said disgusted as usual the hockey rink is warped coach bob said theres been no maintenance since that man whatever his name was retired he didnt retire he died father said father was often exasperated with his father now that iowa bob was getting older in frank was ten franny was nine i was eight and lilly was four egg had just been born and in his ignorance was spared our dread that we would one day be expected to attend the much accused dairy school father was sure that by the time franny was old enough they would be admitting girls not out of anything resembling a progressive instinct he claimed but purely to avoid bankruptcy he was right of course by the dairy schools academic standards were in question its admissions were steadily falling and its admission standards were even further in question and when the admissions continued to go down the tuition went up which turned away even more students which meant some faculty had to be let goand others the ones with principles and other means resigned the football team went for the season coach bob thought that the school couldnt wait for him to retire so that they could drop football altogetherit was too costly and the alumni who had once supported it and the entire athletic programme were too ashamed to come back and see the games anymore its the damn uniforms iowa bob said and father rolled his eyes and tried to look tolerant of bobs approaching senility father had learned of senility from earl but coach bob to be fair had a point about the uniforms the colours of the dairy school perhaps modelled on a nowvanished breed of cow were meant to be a deep chocolate brown and a luminous silver but with the years and the increasingly synthetic quality of the fabrics this rich cocoa and silver had become dingy and sad the colour of mud and clouds my father said the students at the dairy school who played with us kidswhen they were not showing franny their thingsinformed us of the other names for these colours which were in vogue at the school there was an older kid named de meoralph de meo one of iowa bobs few stars and the star sprinter on fathers winter and spring track teamswho told frank franny and me what the dairy school colours really were grey like the pallor of a dead mans face de meo said i was ten and scared of him franny was eleven but behaved older with him frank was twelve and afraid of everybody grey like the pallor of a dead mans face de meo repeated slowly for me and browncowbrown like manure he said thats shit to you frank i know said frank show it to me again franny said to de meo she meant his thing thus shit and death were the colours of the dying dairy school the board of trustees labouring under this curseand others going back to the barnyard history of the school and the lessthanquaint new hampshire town the school was plopped down indecided to admit women to the student body that at least would raise admissions that will be the end of football said old coach bob the girls will play better football than most of your boys father said thats what i mean said iowa bob ralph de meo plays pretty good franny said plays with what pretty good i said and franny kicked me under the table frank sat sullen and larger than any of us dangerously close to franny and across from me de meo is at least fast father said de meo is at least a hitter coach bob said he sure is frank said frank had been hit by ralph de meo several times it was franny who protected me from ralph one day when we were watching them paint the yardline stripes on the football fieldjust franny and i we were hiding from frank we were often hiding from frankde meo came up to us and pushed me into the blocking sled he was wearing his scrimmage uniform shit and death number his age he took his helmet off and spit his mouthpiece out across the cinder track letting his teeth gleam at franny beat it he said to me still looking at franny i got to talk to your sister in the worst way you dont have to push him franny said shes only twelve i said beat it de meo said you dont have to push him franny told de meo hes only eleven i got to tell you how sorry i am de meo said to her i wont still be here by the time youre a student ill be graduated already what do you mean franny said theyre going to take in girls de meo said i know franny said so what so its a pity thats all he told her that i wont be here by the time youre finally old enough franny shrugged it was mothers shrugindependent and pretty i picked de meos mouthpiece up from the cinder track it was slimy and gritty and i tossed it at him why dont you put that back in your mouth i asked him i could run fast but i didnt think i could run faster than ralph de meo beat it he said he zipped the mouthpiece at my head but i ducked it sailed away somewhere how come youre not scrimmaging franny asked him behind the grey wooden bleachers that passed for the dairy school stadium was the practice field where we could hear the shoulder pads and helmets tapping i got a groin injury de meo told franny want to see it i hope it falls off i said i can catch you johnny he said still looking at franny nobody called me johnny not with a groin injury you cant i said i was wrong he caught me at the fortyyard line and pushed my face in the fresh lime painted on the field he was kneeling on my back when i heard him exhale sharply and he slumped off me and lay on his side on the cinder track jesus he said in a soft little voice franny had grabbed the tin cup in his jock strap and twisted its edges into his private parts which is what we called them in those days we both could outrun him then howd you know about it i asked her the thing in his jock strap i mean the cup he showed me another time she said grimly we lay still in the pine needles in the deep woods behind the practice field we could hear coach bobs whistle and the contact but we were hidden from all of them franny never minded when ralph de meo beat up frank and i asked her why she minded when ralph beat up me youre not frank she whispered fiercely she wet her skirt in the damp grass at the edge of the woods and wiped the lime off my face with it rolling up the hem of her skirt so that her belly was bare a pine needle stuck to her stomach and i picked it off for her thank you she said intent on getting every last bit of the lime off me she pulled her skirt up higher spit in it and kept wiping my face stung why do we like each other more than we like frank i asked her we just do she said and we always will frank is weird she said but hes our brother i said so youre my brother too she said thats not why i like you why do you i asked i just do she said we wrestled for a while in the woods until she got something in her eye i helped her get it out she was sweaty and smelled like clean dirt she had very high breasts which seemed separated by too wide an expanse of chest but franny was strong she could usually beat me up unless i got completely on top of her then she could still tickle me hard enough to make me pee if i didnt get off her when she was on top of me there was no moving her one day ill be able to beat you up i told her so what she said by then you wont want to a fat football player named poindexter came into the woods to move his bowels we saw him coming and hid in the ferns wed known about for years for years the football players crapped in these woods just off the practice fieldespecially it seemed the fat ones it was a long run back to the gymnasium and coach bob harangued them for not emptying their bowels before they came to practice for some reason the fat ones could never get them entirely empty we imagined its poindexter i whispered of course it is franny said poindexter was very awkward he always had trouble getting his thigh pads down once he had to take off his cleats and remove the entire bottom half of his uniform except his socks this time he just struggled with the pads and pants that bound his knees precariously close together he kept his balance by squatting slightly forward with his hands on his helmet on the ground in front of him this time he crapped messily on the insides of his football shoes and had to wipe the shoes as well as his ass for a moment franny and i feared he would use the ferns for this purpose but poindexter was always hurried and panting and he did as good a job as he could with the handful of maple leaves hed gathered on the path and brought into the woods with him we heard coach bobs whistle blowing and poindexter heard it too when he ran back toward the practice field franny and i started clapping when poindexter stopped and listened we stopped clapping the poor fat boy stood in the woods wondering what applause he had imaginedthis timeand then rushed back to the game he played so badly and usually with such humiliation then franny and i snuck down to the path that the football players always took back to the gym it was a narrow path pockmarked from their cleats we were slightly worried where de meo might be but i went up to the edge of the practice field and spotted for franny while she dropped her pants and squatted on the path then she spotted for me we both covered our rather disappointing messes with a light sprinkling of leaves then we retreated to the usual ferns to wait for the football players to finish practice but lilly was already in the ferns go home franny told her lilly was seven most of the time she was too young for franny and me but we were nice to her around the house she had no friends and she seemed entranced by frank who enjoyed babying her i dont have to go home lilly said better go franny said whys your face so red lilly asked me de meo put poison on it franny said and hes looking around for more people to rub it on if i go home hell see me lilly said seriously not if you go right away i said well watch out for you franny said she stood up out of the ferns its all clear she whispered lilly ran home am i really all red in the face i asked franny franny pulled my face up close to hers and licked me once on my cheek once on my forehead once on my nose once on my lips i cant taste it anymore she said i got it all off you we lay together in the ferns it wasnt boring but it took a while for the practice to be over and for the first football players to come down the path the third one stepped in ita running back from boston who was doing a postgraduate year at dairy basically to get a little older before he played football in college he slid a short ways in it but caught his balance then he regarded the horror in his cleats poindexter he screamed poindexter a slow runner was well to the rear of the line of players heading for the showers poindexter screamed the running back from boston you turd poindexter whatd i do poindexter asked out of breath forever fatfat in his genes franny would say later when she knew what genes were did you have to do it on the path you asshole the running back asked poindexter it wasnt me poindexter protested clean my cleats you shitforbrains the running back said at a school like dairy the linemen although bigger were the weaker fatter younger boys often sacrificed for the few good athletescoach bob let the good ones carry the ball several rougher members of iowa bobs backfield surrounded poindexter on the path they dont have girls here yet poindexter said the running back from boston so theres nobody but you to clean the shit off my shoes poindexter did as he was told he was at least familiar with the job franny and i went home past the token cows in the fallingdown school barns past coach bobs back door where the rusty fenders of the indian were inverted on the porchto scrape your shoes on the motorcycle fenders were the only outdoor remains of earl when its time for us to go to the dairy school i said to franny i hope were living somewhere else im not going to clean the shit off anybodys shoes franny said no way coach bob who ate supper with us bemoaned his terrible football team its my last year i swear the old man said but he was always saying this poindexter actually took a dump on the path todayduring practice i saw franny and john with their clothes off lilly said you did not franny said on the path lilly said doing what mother said doing what grandpa bob said lilly told everyone frank snorted his disgust father banished franny and me to our rooms upstairs franny whispered to me you see its just you and me not lilly not frank not egg i added egg isnt anybody yet dummy franny said egg isnt a human being yet egg was only three now theres two of them following us franny said frank and lilly dont forget de meo i said i can forget him easy franny said im going to have lots of de meos when i grow up this thought alarmed me and i was silent dont worry franny whispered but i said nothing and she crept down the hall and into my room she got into my bed and we left my door open so we could hear them all talking at the dinner table its not fit for my children this school father said i know that well mother said all your talk about it has certainly convinced them of that theyll be afraid to go when the time comes when the time comes father said well send them away to a good school i dont care about a good school frank said and franny and i could sympathize with him although we hated the notion of going to dairy we were more disturbed at the thought of going away away where frank asked whos going away lilly asked hush mother said no one is going away to school we couldnt afford it if theres a benefit to being on the faculty at the dairy school its at least that theres someplace free to send our children to someplace thats not any good father said better than average mother said listen father said were going to make money this was news to us franny and i kept very still frank must have been nervous at the prospect may i be excused he asked of course dear mother said how are we going to make money mother asked father for gods sake tell me coach bob said im the one who wants to retire listen father said we listened this school may be worthless but its going to grow its going to take on girls remember and even if it doesnt grow its not going to fold its been here too long to fold its instincts are only to survive and it will it wont ever be a good school it will go through so many phases that at times we wont recognize the place but its going to keep goingyou can count on that so what said iowa bob so theres going to be a school here father said a private school is going to go on being here in this crummy town he said and the thompson female seminary isnt going to go on being here because now the girls in town will go to dairy everybody knows that said mother may i be excused lilly asked yes yes father said listen he said to mother and bob dont you see franny and i didnt see anythingonly frank sneaking by in the upstairs hall whats going to become of that old building the thompson female seminary father asked and thats when mother suggested burning it coach bob suggested it become the county jail its big enough he said someone else had suggested this at town meeting nobody wants a jail here father said not in the middle of town it already looks like a jail mother said just needs more bars said iowa bob listen father said impatiently franny and i froze together frank was lurking outside my doorlilly was whistling somewhere close by listen listen father said what this town needs is a hotel there was silence from the dining room table a hotel franny and i knew lying in my bed was what did away with old earl a hotel was a vast ruined space smelling of fish guarded by a gun why a hotel mother finally said youre always saying its a crummy townwhod want to come here maybe not want to father said but have to those parents of those kids at the dairy school he said they visit their kids dont they and you know what the parents are going to get richer and richer because the tuition is going to keep going up and up and there wont be any more scholarship studentsthere will only be rich kids coming here and if you visit your kid at this school now you cant stay in town you have to go to the beach where all the motels are or you have to drive even farther up toward the mountainsbut theres nothing absolutely nothing to stay in right here that was his plan somehow although the dairy school could barely afford enough janitors father thought it would provide the clientele for one hotel in the town of dairythat the town was so motley and no one else had dreamed of putting up a place to stay in it didnt worry my father in new hampshire the summer tourists went to the beachesthey were half an hour away the mountains were an hour away where the skiers went and where there were summer lakes but dairy was valley land inland but not upland dairy was close enough to the sea to feel the seas dampness but far enough away from the sea to benefit not in the slightest from the seas freshness the brisk air from the ocean and from the moutains did not penetrate the dull haze that hung over the valley of the squamscott river and dairy was a squamscott valley towna penetrating damp cold in winter a steamy humidity all summer not a picturepretty new england village but a mill town on a polluted riverthe mill now as abandoned and as ugly as the thompson female seminary it was a town with its sole hopes hung on the dairy school a place no one wanted to go if there was a hotel here however father said people would stay in it but the thompson female seminary would make a dreadful hotel mother said it could only be what it is an old school do you realize how cheaply one could buy it father said do you realize how much it would cost to fix it up mother said what a depressing idea said coach bob franny started to pin my arms down it was her usual method of attackshed get my arms all tied up then tickle me by grinding her chin into my ribs or my armpit or else shed bite me on the neck just hard enough to make me lie still our legs were thrashing under the covers throwing the blankets offwhoever could scissor the others legs had the initial advantagewhen lily came into my room in her weird way on all fours with a sheet over her creep franny said to her im sorry you got in trouble lilly said under the sheet lilly always apologized for ratting on us by completely covering her body and crawling into our rooms on all fours i brought you something lilly said food franny asked i pulled lillys sheet off and franny took a paper bag that lilly had carried to us clutched in her teeth there were two bananas and two of the warm rolls from supper in it nothing to drink franny asked lilly shook her head come on get in i said to her and lilly crawled into bed with franny and me were going to move to a hotel lilly said not quite said franny but they seemed to be talking about something else downstairs at the dining table coach bob was angry with my father againfor the same old thing it seemed for never being satisfied as bob put it for living in the future for always making plans for the next year instead of just living moment by moment but he cant help it my mother was saying she always defended my father from coach bob youve got a wonderful wife and a wonderful family iowa bob was telling my father youve got this big old housean inheritance you didnt even have to pay for it youve got a job so what if the pays not greatwhat do you need money for youre a lucky man i dont want to be a teacher father said quietly which meant he was angry again i dont want to be a coach i dont want my kids to go to a school this bad its a hick town and a floundering school full of rich kids with problems their parents send them here in a desperate effort to arrest their already considerable sophisticationrunamok sophistication on the part of the kids runamok hickness on the part of the school and the town its the worst of both worlds but if you just spent more time with the kids now mother said quietly and worried a little less about where theyre all going to be in a few years the future again said iowa bob he lives in the future first it was all the travellingall so he could go to harvard so he went to harvard then as fast as he couldso he could be through with it for what for this job which hes done nothing but complain about why doesnt he enjoy it enjoy this father said you dont enjoy it do you we could imagine our grandfather coach bob fuming fuming was how he ended most arguments with my father who was quicker than iowa bob when bob felt outwitted but still right he fumed franny and lilly and i could imagine his knotty bald head smoldering it was true that he had no higher regard for the dairy school than my father had but iowa bob had at least committed himself to something he felt and he wished to see my father involved with what he was doing instead of involvedas bob would saywith the future after all coach bob had once bitten a running back he had not seen my father ever so engaged he was probably distressed that my father never became passionate about any sport although father was athletic and liked exercise and iowa bob loved my mother very much he had known her all the years my father was away at the war away at harvard and away with earl coach bob probably thought that my father neglected his family in the last years i know bob thought father had neglected earl excuse me we heard frank say franny locked her hands around my waist at the base of my spine i tried to force her chin up off my shoulder but lilly was sitting on my head what is it dear mother said whats up frank father said and we could tell by the sharp creak of a chair that father had grabbed for frank he was always trying to loosen frank up a little by wrestling with him or trying to get him to play but frank wouldnt go for it franny and i loved it when father would roughhouse with us but frank didnt like it at all excuse me frank repeated youre excused youre excused father said franny is out of her room shes in bed with john frank said and lillys with them she brought them something to eat i felt franny slide away from me she was out of my bed and out of my room her flannel nightie ballooning like a sail in the draught from the upstairs hall by the stairwell lilly grabbed her sheet and crawled into my closet the old bates family house was huge there were so many places to hide but my mother knew them all i thought franny was dashing back to her room but i heard her going downstairs instead and then i heard her screaming you weirdo fink frank she screamed you fart you turd in a birdbath franny mother said i ran to the stairwell and hugged the banister the stairs were carpeted deep and soft the same carpet that covered the house i could see franny go straight for the headlock on frank in the dining room she took him down fastfrank was slowmoving and not very physical he was badly coordinated although bigger than franny and much bigger than me i rarely fought with him even in fun frank did little in the way of fighting for fun and even in fun he could hurt you he was too large and despite his distaste for the physical life he was strong he had a way too of finding your ear with his elbow or your nose with his knee he was the kind of fighter whose fingers and thumbs always found an eye whose head bobbed up and split your lip against your own teeth there are people who are so physically uncomfortable with themselves that they seem to jar against any other body frank was like that and i left him alone it was not just because he was two years older franny occasionally couldnt stand not testing him but they almost always hurt each other i watched her locked in a death grip with frank under the dining room table stop them win my mother said but father hit his head on the table trying to drag them out where he could separate them coach bob went under the table from the other side shit father said i felt something warm against my hip at the banister it was lilly peering out from under her sheet you rats asshole frank franny was screaming then frank got frannys hair and yanked her head against the dining table leg although i did not have breasts of my own i could feel it in my chest when frank dug his knuckles into frannys breast she had to let go of her headlock and he rapped her head against the table leg twice more snarling her hair around his fist before coach bob got three of their four legs in his huge hands and hauled them out from under the table franny lashed out with her free foot and caught bob with a good blow to the nose but the old iowa lineman hung on franny was crying now but she managed to strain against her hair hard enough to bite frank on the cheek frank grabbed one of her breasts in his hand he must have squeezed her hard because frannys mouth opened against franks cheek and a losing sob broke from her it was so terrible and defeated a sound that it sent lilly running back to my room with her sheet father knocked franks hand from frannys breast and coach bob got a headlock on franny so that she couldnt bite frank again but franny had a hand free and she went for franks private parts whether you were in a cup in or out of a jock or wearing nothing at all franny could get to your private parts when the chips were down frank was suddenly all arms and legs jerking and a moan so blue escaped him that i shivered father slapped franny in the face but she wouldnt let go he had to claw her fingers open coach bob dragged frank free of her but franny took a last kick with her long leg and father was forced to slap her hard across the mouth that ended it father sat on the dining room carpet holding frannys head against his chest and rocking her in his arms while she cried franny franny he said to her softly why does everyone have to hurt you to stop you easy son just breathe easy coach bob told frank who lay on his side with his knees up to his chest his face as grey as one of the dairy school colours old iowa bob knew how to console somebody whod been felled by a blow to the balls feel kind of sick dont you coach bob inquired gently just breathe easy lie still it goes away mother cleared the table picked up the fallen chairs her determined disapproval of her familys inner violence registered on her face as enforced silence bitter and hurt and full of dread try a deeper breath now coach bob advised frank frank tried and coughed okay okay said iowa bob stick with the little breaths awhile longer frank moaned father examined frannys lower lip while her tears streamed down her face and she made those gagging kinds of sobs half strangled in her chest i think you need some stitches darling he said but franny shook her head furiously father held her head tightly between his hands and kissed her just above her eyes twice im sorry franny he said but what can i do with you what can i do i dont need stitches franny mourned no stitches no way but on her lower lip a jagged flap protruded and father had to cup his hand under frannys chin to catch her blood mother brought a washcloth full of ice i went back to my room and coaxed lilly out of the closet she wanted to stay with me and i let her she fell right asleep but i lay in bed thinking that every time someone said hotel there would be blood and sudden sorrow father and mother drove franny to the dairy school infirmary where someone would stitch her lip together no one would blame fatherleast of all franny franny would blame frank of course whichin those dayswas my tendency too father would not blame himselfor at least not for longand mother would blame herself inexplicably for some while longer whenever we fought father usually cried at us do you know how this upsets your mother and me imagine that we fought all the time and you had to live with it but do your mother and i fight do we would you like it if we did we would not of course and they didntmost of the time there was only the old argument the livinginthefutureandnotenjoyingtoday argument which coach bob expressed more vehemently than mother though we knew it was her opinion of my father too that and that father couldnt help it it didnt seem like a big thing to us kids i rolled lilly on her side so that i could stretch out flat on my back with both my ears off the pillow so that i could hear iowa bob coaching frank upstairs easy boy just lean on me bob was saying the secrets in the breathing frank blubbered something and coach bob said but you cant grab a girls tit boy and not expect to take a shot in the balls now can you but frank blubbered on how franny was terrible to him how she never let him alone how she was always turning the other kids against him how he tried to avoid her but she was always there shes in the middle of everything bad that happens to me he cried you dont know he croaked you dont know how she teases me i thought i knew and frank was right he was also rather unlikable and that was the problem franny was awful to him but franny was not awful and frank was not really awful to any of us except he himself was somehow awful it bewildered me lying there lilly began to snore i heard egg snuffle down the hall and wondered how coach bob would handle it if egg woke up hollering for mother bob had his hands full with frank in the bathroom go on bob said just let me see you do it frank sobbed there cried iowa bob as if hed just discovered a fumble in the end zone see no blood boyjust piss youre okay you dont know frank kept saying you dont know i went to see what egg wanted being three he wanted something unobtainable i thought but i was surprised that he was cheerful when i came into his room he was obviously surprised to see me and when i returned all the soft animals to his bedhe had thrown them all over his roomhe proceeded to introduce me to each of them the frayed squirrel he had vomited on many times the worn elephant with one ear the orange hippopotamus he was upset whenever i tried to leave him so i took him into my room and put him in my bed with lilly then i carried lily back to her room although that was a long way for me to carry her and she woke up and became irritable before i got her in her own bed i never get to stay in your room she said then she was asleep again instantly i went back to my room and got in bed with egg who was wideawake and talking nonsense he was happy though and i heard coach bob talking downstairsat first i thought to frank but then i realized bob was talking to our old dog sorrow frank must have gone off to sleep or at least gone off to sulk you smell worse than earl iowa bob was telling the dog and in truth sorrow was dreadful to smell not only his farting but his halitosis could kill you if you werent careful and the old black labrador retriever seemed viler to me too than my faint memory of the foul odors of earl what are we going to do with you bob mumbled to the dog who enjoyed lying under the dining room table and farting all through mealtimes iowa bob opened windows downstairs come on boy he called to sorrow jesus bob said under his breath i heard the front door open presumably coach bob had put sorrow out i lay awake with egg crawling all over me waiting for franny to get back if i was awake i knew shed come and show me her stitches when egg finally fell asleep i carried him back to his room and his animals sorrow was still outside when father and mother drove franny home if his barking hadnt woken me up id have missed them well that looks pretty good coach bob was saying obviously approving of frannys lip job that wont leave any scar at all after a while five of them franny said thickly as though they had given her an additional tongue five iowa bob cried terrific that dogs been farting in here again father said he sounded grouchy and tired as if theyd been talking talking talking nonstop since theyd left for the infirmary oh hes so sweet franny said and i heard sorrows hard tail wagging against a chair or the sideboardwhack whack whack only franny could he next to sorrow for hours and be unaffected by the dogs various stenches of course franny seemed to notice smell in general less than the rest of us she had never objected to changing eggs diapersor even lillys when we were all much younger and when sorrow in his senility would have an accident overnight franny never found the dog shit displeasing she had a cheerful curiosity about strong things she could go the longest of any of us without a bath i heard all the grownups kiss franny good night and i thought families must be like thisgore one minute forgiveness the next just as i knew she would franny came into my room to show me her lip the stitches were a crisp shiny black like pubic hair franny had pubic hair i did not frank did but he hated it you know what your stitches look like i asked her yeah i know she said did he hurt you i asked her and she crouched close by my bed and let me touch her breast it was the other one dummy she said and moved away from me you really got frank i said yeah i know she said good night then she peeked back in my door we are going to move to a hotel she said then i heard her going into franks room want to see my stitches she whispered sure frank said you know what they look like franny asked him they look gross frank said yeah but you know what they look like dont you franny asked yes i know he said and theyre gross sorry about your balls frank franny told him sure he said theyre okay sorry about frank started to say but he had never said breast much less tit in his life franny waited so did i sorry about the whole thing frank said yeah sure franny said me too then i heard her testing lilly but lilly was too soundly asleep to be disturbed want to see my stitches franny whispered then after a while i heard her say to lilly sweet dreams kiddo there was of course no point in showing stitches to egg he would assume that they were remnants of something franny had eaten want a ride home my father asked his father but old iowa bob said he could always use the exercise you may think this is a crummy town bob said but at least its safe to walk at night then i listened some more i knew when my parents were alone i love you my father said and my mother said i know you do and i love you i knew then that she was tired too lets take a walk father said i dont like to leave the children mother said but that was no argument i knew franny and i were perfectly capable of looking after lilly and egg and frank looked after himself it wont take fifteen minutes father said lets just walk up there and look at it it of course was the thompson female seminarythat beast of a building father wanted to turn into a hotel i went to school there mother said i know that building better than you do i dont want to look at it you used to like walking with me at night father said and i could tell by my mothers laughter which was only slightly mocking that she was shrugging her shoulders for him again it was quiet downstairs i couldnt tell if they were kissing or putting on their jacketsbecause it was a fall night damp and cooland then i heard mother say i dont think you have any idea how much money youre going to have to sink into that building to make it even resemble a hotel anybody would ever want to stay in not necessarily want father said remember it will be the only hotel in town but wheres the money going to come from mother said come on sorrow father said and i knew that they were on their way out the door come on sorrow come stink up the whole town father said mother laughed again answer me she said but she was being flirtatious now father had already convinced her somewhere sometime beforeperhaps when franny was taking the stitches in her lip stoically i knew without a tear wheres the money going to come from mother asked him you know he said and closed the door i heard sorrow barking at the night at everything in it at nothing at all and i knew that if a white sloop had pulled up to the front porch and the trellises of the old bates family house my mother and father would not have been surprised if the man in the white dinner jacket who owned the once exotic arbuthnotbythesea had been there to greet them they wouldnt have blinked an eye if hed been there smoking tanned and impeccable and if hed said to them welcome aboardthey would have set out to sea on the white sloop there and then and when they walked up pine street to elliot park and turned past the last row of the houses lived in by the widows and widowers the wretched thompson female seminary must have shone in the night to them like a chateau or a villa throwing a gala for the rich and famousalthough there couldnt have been a light on and the only soul around would have been the old policeman in his squad car cruising every hour or so to break up the teenagers who went there to neck there was just one streetlight in elliot park franny and i would never cross the park after dark in our bare feet for fear of stepping on beer bottle glassor used condoms but how father must have painted a different picture how he must have taken mother past the stumps of longdead elmsthe glass crunching underfoot must have imitated the sound of pebbles on an expensive beach to themand how he must have said cant you just imagine it a familyrun hotel wed have it to ourselves most of the time with the killing wed make on the big school weekends we wouldnt even have to advertiseat least not much just keep the restaurant and bar open during the week to attract the businessmenthe lunch and cocktail crowd businessmen my mother might have wondered aloud what lunch and cocktail crowd but even when sorrow flushed the teenagers from the bushes even when the squad car stopped father and mother and asked them to identify themselves my father must have been convincing oh its you win berry the policeman must have said old howard tuck drove the night car he was a moron and smelled of cigars extinguished in puddles of beer sorrow must have growled at him here was an odour to conflict with the dogs own highly developed smell poor bobs having a rough season old howard tuck probably said because everyone knew my father was iowa bobs son father had been a backup quarterback for one of coach bobs old dairy teamsthe teams that used to win another rough season my father must have joked wutcha doin here old howard tuck must have asked them and my father without a doubt must have said well howard between you and me were going to buy this place you are you betcha father would have said were going to turn this place into a hotel a hotel thats right father would have said and a restaurant with a bar for the lunch and cocktail crowd the lunch and cocktail crowd howard tuck would have repeated youve got the picture father would have said the finest hotel in new hampshire holy cow the cop could only have replied anyway it was the nightduty town patrolman howard tuck who asked my father wutcha gonna call it remember it was night and the night inspired my father he had first seen freud and his bear at night he had fished with state omaine at night nighttime was the only time the man in the white dinner jacket made an appearance it was after dark when the german and his brass band arrived at the arbuthnot to spill a little blood it must have been dark when my father and mother first slept together and freuds europe was in total darkness now there in elliot park with the patrol cars spotlight on him my father looked at the fourstorey brick school that indeed resembled a county jailthe rustiron fire escapes crawled all over it like scaffolding on a building trying to become something else no doubt he took my mothers hand in the darkness where the imagination is never impeded my father felt the name of his future hotel and our future coming to him wutcha gonna call it asked the old cop the hotel new hampshire my father said holy cow said howard tuck holy cow might have been a better name for it but the matter was decided the hotel new hampshire it would be i was still awake when mother and father came homethey were gone much longer than fifteen minutes so i knew that theyd encountered at least the white sloop if not freud and the man in the white dinner jacket along the way my god sorrow i heard father say couldnt you have done that outside the vision of them coming home was clear to me sorrow snorting through the hedges alongside the clapboard buildings of the town rousing the lightsleeping elderly from their beds confused with time these old people might have looked out and seen my father with my mother hand in hand unaware of the years gone by they would have gone back to bed muttering its iowa bobs boy with the bates girl and that old bear again just one thing i dont understand my mother was saying will we have to sell this house and move out of it before were ready to move in there because that was the only way he could afford to convert a school into a hotel of course the town would be glad to let him have the thompson female seminary dirtcheap who wanted to have the eyesore left empty where children could get hurt smashing the windows and climbing the fire escapes but it was my mothers family housethe lush bates family housethat would have to pay for the restoration perhaps this was what freud meant what mother must forgive father for we may have to sell it before we move there father said but we may not have to move out those are just details those details and others would take us years and would cause franny to say long after the stitches were out of her lip and the scar was so thin that you thought you could brush it away with your fingeror that one good kiss would erase the mark from her mouthif father could have bought another bear he wouldnt have needed to buy a hotel but the first of my fathers illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels iowa bobs winning season in frank joined the freshman class at the dairy schoolan uneventful transition for him it seemed except that he spent even more time in his room by himself there was a vague homosexual incident but a number of boys all from the same dormitory had been involvedall older than frankand the assumption was that frank had been the victim of a rather common prep school joke after all he lived at home its not surprising that he was naïve about dormitory life in franny went to the dairy school that was the first year women went there and the transition was not so smooth transitions would never be too smooth when franny was involved but in this case there were many unforeseen problems ranging from discrimination in the classrooms to not enough showers in the wing of the gym they had partitioned for the women to use also the sudden presence of women teachers on the faculty caused several tottering marriages to fall and the fantasy life of the boys at dairy was no doubt increased a thousandfold in it was my turn that was the year they bought an entire backfield and three linemen for coach bob the school knew he was retiring and he hadnt had a winning season since just after the war they thought theyd do him a favour by stocking his football team with oneyear postgraduate athletes from the toughest boston high schools for once coach bob not only had a backfield he had some beef up front for blocking and although the old man disliked the idea of a bought teamof what even in those days we called ringershe appreciated the gesture the dairy school however had more in mind than making iowa bobs last year a winning season they were shooting every angle they could to attract more alumni money and a new and younger football coach for the next year one more losing season bob knew and the dairy school would drop football forever coach bob would rather have gone out a winner with a team he built over several years but who wouldnt rather go out a winner almost any way possible besides said coach bob even good talent needs a coach these guys wouldnt be so hot without me everybody needs a game plan everybody needs to be told what theyre doing wrong in those years iowa bob had lots to say to my father on the subject of game plan and doing wrong coach bob said that the restoration of the thompson female seminary was a task akin to raping a rhinoceros it took a little longer than my father had expected he had no trouble selling mothers family houseit was a beauty and we made a killing on itbut the new owners were impatient to take possession and we paid them a stiff rent to live there for a full year after all the papers were signed i remember watching the old school desks being removed from what was going to be the hotel new hampshirehundreds of desks that had been screwed down to the floor hundreds of holes in the floor to fill or else carpet the whole thing that was one of the details father had to deal with and the fourthfloor bathroom equipment was a surprise to him my mother should have remembered years before her time at the thompson female seminary the toilets and sinks for the top floor had been misordered instead of outfitting bathrooms for high schoolsized students the toilet and sink people delivered and installed miniaturesthey were meant for a kindergarten in the north of the state since the mistake cost less than the original order the thompson female seminary had let it pass and so generations of high school girls had stooped and cracked their knees while trying to pee and washthe tiny childsized toilets breaking the girls backs if they sat down too fast the little sinks hitting them a knee level the mirrors staring straight at their breasts jesus god father said its an outhouse for elves he had hoped simply to disperse the old bathroom equipment throughout the hotel he had enough sense to know that the guests wouldnt want to share communal bathrooms but he thought he could save a lot of money by using the toilets and sinks that were already there after all there wasnt much equipment that a high school and a hotel had in common we can use the mirrors anyway mother said well just mount them higher on the walls and we can use the sinks and toilets too father insisted who can use them mother asked dwarfs said coach bob lilly and egg anyway franny said at least for a few more years then there were the screweddown desk chairs that had matched the desks father wouldnt throw them out either theyre perfectly good chairs father said theyre very comfortable its sort of quaint how they have names carved in them frank said quaint frank franny said but they have to be screwed down to the floor mother said people wont be able to move them around why should people have to move hotel furniture around father asked i mean we set the rooms the way they should be right i dont want people moving the chairs anyway he said this way they cant even in the restaurant mother asked people like to shove back their chairs after a big meal said iowa bob well they cantthats all father said well let them push the tables away from them instead why not screw down the tables too frank suggested thats a quaint idea franny said she would say later that franks insecurity was so vast that he would have preferred all of life screwed down to the floor of course the partitioning of rooms with their own baths took the longest and the plumbing was as complex as a freight yard of tracks in a city railroad station when someone flushed on the fourth floor you could hear it coursing through the entire hoteltrying to find a way down and some of the rooms still had blackboards so long as theyre clean father said whats the harm sure said iowa bob one guest can leave messages for the next guest things like dont ever stay here franny said it will be all right frank said i just want my own room in a hotel frank franny said everybody gets a room even coach bob would get a room after his retirement the dairy school wouldnt let him go on living in campus housing coach bob was cautiously warming to the idea he was ready to move in when we were ready he was interested in the future of the playground equipment the crackedclay volleyball court the fieldhockey field and the basketball backboards and hoopsthe nets were long since rotted away theres nothing that looks more abandoned bob said than a basketball hoop without a net i think thats so sad and one day we watched the men with the pneumatic drills chipping thompson female seminary off the deathgrey face of stone sunk in the bricks above the great front door they stopped work for the dayim sure on purposeleaving only the letters male semin over the door it was friday so the letters stayed that way over the weekend to my mothers and fathers irritationand to coach bobs amusement why dont you call it the hotel male semen iowa bob asked my father then youll only have to change one letter bob was in a good mood because his team was winning and he knew he was about to get out of the wretched dairy school if my father was in a bad mood he rarely let it show he was full of energyenergy begets energy he would repeat and repeat to us over our homework and at sports practices for the teams he coached he had not resigned from the dairy school he probably didnt dare or mother wouldnt let him he was going ahead with the hotel new hampshire but he was teaching three classes of english and coaching track winter and spring so he was going ahead at halfspeed frank seemed to disappear at the dairy school he was like one of the token cows you didnt notice him after a while he did his workhe seemed to find it hardand he attended the required athletics although he favoured no particular sport and wasnt good enough for or didnt try to make any of the teams he was big and strong and as awkward as ever and at sixteen he grew a thin moustache on his upper lip which made him look much older there was something floppy and puppylike about hima certain heavy cloddishness in his feetthat suggested he would one day be a very large and imposing dog but frank would wait forever for the poise that must attend imposing size in order for the animal to be imposing he had no friends but no one worried frank had never been much for having friends franny of course had lots of boyfriends most of them were older than franny and one of them i liked he was a tall redhaired senior at the schoola strong silent type who stroked the first boat of the varsity crew his name was struthers he had grown up in maine and except for the blisters on his hands which were painted a rustbrown with benzointo toughen themand the fact that he smelled at times like wet socks he was acceptable to everyone in our family even frank sorrow growled at struthers but that was a smell thing struthers threatened sorrows dominance of our house i didnt know if struthers was frannys favourite boyfriend but he was very fond of her and nice to the rest of us some of the othersone of them was the leader of that pack of boston ringers whod been hired to play for coach bobwere not so nice in fact the quarterback of that imported backfield was a boy who made ralph de meo look like a saint his name was sterling dove although he was called chip or chipper and he was a cruel angular boy from one of the posher boston suburban schools hes a natural leader that chip dove coach bob said hes a natural commander of someones secret police i thought chipper dove was blondly handsome in a spotless slightly pretty sort of way we were a darkhaired family except for lilly who was not so blond as she was washedoutall over even her hair was pale i would have enjoyed seeing chip dove play quarterback without a good line to protect himand when he had to throw a lot of passes to catch up several touchdownsbut the admissions office had done a good job for coach bob dairys football team never fell behind when they got the ball they kept it and dove rarely had to pass although it was the first winning season that any of us children could remember it was dullwatching them grind down the field eating up the clock and scoring from three or four yards out they were not flashy they were simply strong and precise and well coached their defence was not so strongthe other teams scored back on them but not too often the other teams rarely got to have the ball ball control crowed iowa bob first time ive had a ballcontrol team since the war my only comfort in frannys relationship with chipper dove was that dove was such a team boy he was rarely in frannys company without the rest of the dairy backfieldand often a lineman or two they menaced the campus that year like a horde and franny sometimes was seen in their camp dove was attracted to herevery boy except frank seemed attracted to franny girls were cautious in her company she simply outshone them and perhaps she was not a very good friend to them franny was always meeting more and newer people she was probably too curious about strangers to be loyal in the way girls want their girl friends to be loyal i dont know i was kept in the dark about that at times franny would fix me up with a date but the girls were usually older and it didnt work out everyone thinks youre cute franny said but you have to talk to people a little bit you knowyou cant just start out necking i dont start out necking id tell her i never get to the necking well she said thats because you just sit there waiting for something to happen everyone knows what youre thinking you dont i said not always about me you mean she asked but i didnt say anything listen kid franny said i know you think about me too muchif thats what you mean it was at dairy that she started calling me kid although there was just a years difference between us to my shame the name stuck hey kid chip dove said to me in the showers at the gym your sisters got the nicest ass at this school is she banging anybody struthers i said although i hoped it wasnt true struthers was at least better than dove struthers dove said the fucking oarsman the clod who rows hes very strong i said that much was trueoarsmen are strong and struthers was the strongest of them yeah but hes a clod dove said just pulls his oar all day said lenny metz a running back who was alwayseven in the showersjust to the right of chip doves hip as if he expected even there to be handed the ball he was as dumb as cement and as hard well kid said chipper dove you tell franny i think shes got the nicest ass at this school and tits cried lenny metz well theyre okay dove said but its the ass thats really special she has a nice smile too metz said chip dove rolled his eyes at me conspiratoriallyas if to show me he knew how dumb metz was and he was much much smarter dont forget to use a little soap huh lenny dove said and passed him the slippery bar which metz instinctivelya nonfumblerslapped against his belly in his bearish grip i turned off my shower because some bigger person had moved under the stream of water with me he shoved me out of his way altogether and turned the water back on move on man he said softly it was one of the linemen who kept other football players from hurting chipper dove his name was samuel jones jr and he was called junior jones junior jones was as black as any night in which my fathers imagination was inspired he would go on to play college football at penn state and pro ball in cleveland until someone messed up his knee i was fourteen in and junior jones was the largest organization of human flesh i had ever seen i moved out of his way but chipper dove said hey junior dont you know this kid no i havent met him said junior jones well this is franny berrys brother chip dove said how do you do said junior jones hello i said old coach bob is this kids grandfather junior dove said thats nice said junior jones he filled his mouth with a froth of lather from the tiny bar of soap in his hand then tipped his head back and rinsed his mouth out in the downstream of the shower perhaps i thought this was what he did instead of brushing his teeth we were talking dove said about what it was we liked about franny her smile metz said you said her tits too chipper dove said and i said she had the nicest ass at this school we didnt get to ask the kid here what he likes about his sister but i thought wed ask you first junior junior jones had lathered his bar of soap away to nothing his huge head was awash with white froth when he rinsed himself under the shower the suds lapped around his ankles i looked down at my feet and felt the close presence of the remaining twosome from iowa bobs backfield a burntface boy named chester pulaski who spent too much time under the sun lampeven so his neck blazed with boils his forehead was studded with them he was primarily a blocking backnot by choice he simply didnt run quite as well as lenny metz chester pulaski was a natural blocking back because he tended to run at his opponents more than he tended away from them with him and flitting near to me like a horsefly that wont leave you alone was a boy as black as junior jones any comparison however was over with their colour he sometimes lined up as a wide receiver and when he ran out of the backfield it was only to catch chipper doves short and safe little passes his name was harold swallow and he was no bigger than i was but harold swallow could fly he had moves like the bird he was named for if anyone ever tackled him he might have broken in half but when he wasnt catching passes and flying out of bounds he was just hiding in the backfield usually behind chester pulaski or junior jones they were all there standing around me and i thought that if a bomb were to be dropped on one spot in the shower room coach bobs winning season would be over athletically at least i was the only one who wouldnt have been missed i was simply not in the same category with iowa bobs imported backfield or with the giant lineman junior jones there were other linemen of course but junior jones was the main reason chipper dove never even fell down he was the main reason there was always a hole for chester pulaski to lead lenny metz through jones made a hole big enough for them to run through side by side come on junior think chip dove said dangerouslybecause the tone of mockery in his voice implied his doubt that junior jones could think what is it you like about franny berry dove asked shes got nice little feet said harold swallow everyone stared at him but he just pranced around under the falling water not looking at anybody shes got beautiful skin said chester pulaski helplessly drawing even more attention to his boils junior chip dove said and junior jones shut off his shower he stood and dripped for a while he made me feel as if i were egg years ago still learning to walk shes just another white girl to me junior jones said and his look paused a second on each of us before moving on but she seems like a good girl he added to me then he turned my shower back on and shoved me under itit was too coldand he walked out of the shower room leaving a draught i was impressed that even chipper dove would go only so far with him but i was more impressed that franny was in troubleand still more impressed that i was helpless to do anything about it that scum chipper dove talks about your ass your tits even your feet i told her you watch out for him my feet franny said whats he say about my feet all right i said that was harold swallow everyone knew harold swallow was crazy in those days when someone was as crazy as harold swallow we said he was as crazy as a waltzing mouse what did chip dove say about me franny asked i just care about him your ass is all he cares about i told her and he talks about it to everyone i dont care she said im not that interested well hes interested i said just stick with struthers oh kid let me tell you she sighed struthers is sweet but he is boring boring boring i hung my head we were in the upstairs hall of what was now only a rented house although it still felt like the bates family house to us franny rarely came into my room anymore we did our homework in our own rooms and met outside the bathroom to talk frank didnt even seem to use the bathroom every day now in the hall outside our rooms mother would stack up more cartons and trunks we were getting ready to move to the hotel new hampshire and i dont see why you have to be a cheerleader franny i said i mean you of all peoplea cheerleader because i like it she said in fact it was after a cheerleading practice that i met franny not far from our place in the ferns we didnt see so much ofnow that we were students at the schoolwhen we encountered iowa bobs backfield they had accosted someone on the path through the woods that was the shortcut back to the gym they were working someone over in the large mud puddle that was drilled with football cleatsholes like machinegun fire in the mud when franny and i saw who they werethe boys in the backfieldand that they were beating up on someone we started to run the other way that backfield was always beating up on someone but we hadnt run more than twentyfive yards before franny caught my arm and stopped me i think it was frank she said theyve got frank so of course we had to go back for just a second before we could actually see what was going on i felt very brave i felt franny take my hand and i gave her a strong squeeze her cheerleading skirt was so short that the back of my hand brushed her thigh then she pulled her hand out of mine and screamed i was in my track shorts and i felt my legs turn cold frank was wearing his band uniform they had stripped the shitbrown pants with the deathgrey stripe down the leg clean off him franks underwear was yanked down to his ankles the jacket of his band uniform had been tugged up to the middle of his chest one silver epaulette floated free in the mud puddle alongside franks face and his silver cap with the brown braidalmost indistinguishable from the mud itselfwas squashed under harold swallows knee harold held on to one of franks arms fully extended lenny metz stretched franks other arm frank lay belly down with his balls in the heart of the mud puddle his astonishing bare ass rising up out of the water and submerging again as chipper dove pushed it down with his foot then let it up then pushed it down chester pulaski the blocking back sat on the backs of franks knees with franks ankles locked under this arms come on hump it said chipper dove to frank he pushed down on franks ass and drove him deep into the mud puddle again the football cleats left little white indentations on franks ass come on you mudfucker said lenny metz you heard the manhump it stop it franny screamed at them what are you doing frank seemed the most alarmed to see her although even chipper dove couldnt conceal his surprise well look whos here dove said but i could tell he was thinking about what to say next were just giving him what he likes lenny metz told franny and me frank likes to screw mud puddles dont you frank let him go franny said were not hurting him chester pulaski said he was forever embarrassed about his complexion and he chose to look at me not at franny he probably couldnt stand to see frannys fine skin your brother likes boys chipper dover told us dont you frank he asked so what said frank he was angry not whipped hed probably stuck his fingers in their eyeshed probably hurt one or two of them here or there frank always put up a fight putting it up boys asses said lenny metz is disgusting its like stickin it in mud harold swallow explained but he looked as if hed really rather be running somewhere than holding franks arm harold swallow always looked uneasyas if he were crossing a busy street at night for the first time hey no harm done said chipper dove he took his foot off franks ass and took a step toward franny and me i remembered what coach bob was always saying about knee injuries i was wondering if i could take a swipe at chip doves knee before he beat the shit out of me i didnt know what franny was thinking but she said to dove i want to talk with you alone i want to be alone with you right now franny told him harold swallow shrieked with a laughter as nasal and highpitched as the song of any waltzing mouse well thats possible dove said to franny sure we can talk alone anytime right now franny said i want to do it right nowor never she said well right now sure said dove he rolled his eyes to his backfield men chester pulaski and lenny metz looked mortified with envy but harold swallow was frowning at a grass stain on his football uniform it was the only mark on him a small grass stain where harold swallow must have flown too close to the ground or perhaps he was frowning because franks outstretched body blocked his view of frannys feet let frank go franny told dove and make the others goto the gym she said sure well let him go dove said we were just going to anyway right he saidthe quarterback giving signals to his backfield they let frank go frank stumbled getting up and tried to cover his private parts which were thick and sodden with mud he dressed himself furiously without a word at that moment i was more afraid of him than i was afraid of any of the othersthey were doing what theyd been told to do anyway they were trotting down the path to the gym lenny metz turned to leer and wave franny gave him the finger frank pushed wetly between franny and me and started tramping home forget something chip dove said to him franks cymbals were in the bushes he stoppedseemingly more embarrassed for forgetting his band instrument than he appeared to be humiliated for all the rest of it franny and i hated franks cymbals i think it was wearing a uniformany uniformthat had attracted frank to the band he was not a social creature but when coach bobs winning season prompted the resurrection of a marching bandno band had marched at dairy since shortly after world war iifrank could not resist the uniforms since he could play nothing musically they gave him the cymbals other people probably felt foolish with them but not frank he liked marching around doing nothing waiting for his big moment to clash it was not like having a musical member of the family always practicing and driving the rest of us nuts with the screeching tooting or plinking of an instrument frank didnt practice the cymbals occasionally at odd hours we would hear one shattering clang from themfrom franks locked roomand we had to imagine franny and i that frank had been marching in place in his uniform sweating in front of his mirror until he couldnt stand the sound of his own breathing and had been inspired to put a dramatic end to it the terrible noise made sorrow bark and probably fart mother would drop things franny would run to franks door and pound on it i would imagine the sound differently it was remindful of the suddenness of a gun to me and i always thought for an instant that we had just been startled by the sound of franks suicide on the path where the backfield had ambushed him frank dragged his muddy cymbals from the bushes clanking them under his arm where can we go chip dove asked franny to be alone i know a place she said nearby she added its a place ive known forever and i knew of course that she meant the fernsour ferns to my knowledge franny hadnt even taken struthers there i thought she could only be mentioning them this clearly so that frank and i would know where to find her and rescue her but frank was already heading home stomping down the path without a word to franny or one look at her and chip dove smiled at me with his iceblue eyes and said beat it kid franny took him by the hand and pulled him off the path but i caught up to frank in no time jesus frank i said where are you going weve got to help her help franny he said she helped you i said to him she saved your ass so what he said and then he started to cry how do you know she wants our help he said snivelling maybe she wants to be alone with him that was too terrible a thought for meit was almost as bad as imagining chipper dove doing things to franny that she didnt want done to herand i grabbed frank by his one remaining epaulette and dragged him after me stop crying i said because i didnt want dove to hear us coming i want to talk with you just talk we heard franny screaming you rats asshole she yelled you could have been so nice but you had to go and be such a super shit of a human being i hate you she cried cut it out she screamed i think you like me we heard chipper dove say i might have franny said but not now not ever we heard her say but she stopped sounding angry suddenly she was crying when frank and i reached the ferns dove had his football pants down at the knees he was having the same trouble with the thigh pads that franny and i had observed years ago while spying on the crapping posture of the fat football player named poindexter franny had her clothes on but she seemed curiously passive to mesitting in the ferns where hed pushed her she told me later with her hands over her face frank clashed his damn cymbals togetherso startling loud that i thought an airplane was flying into another airplane above us then he swung the righthand cymbal smack into chip doves face it was the hardest hit the quarterback had taken all season we could tell he wasnt used to it clearly too he was impeded by the position of his pants i dropped straight on him as soon as he was down frank continued to clash his cymbals togetheras if this were a ritual dance that our family always practiced prior to slaughtering an enemy dove threw me off him the way old sorrow could still knock egg downwith a good toss of his big headbut the clamour frank was making seemed to paralyze the quarterback it seemed to awaken franny from her moment of passivity too she made her usual unbeatable move for the private parts of chipper dove and he made the sickly motions of quitting this life forever that surely frank must have recognizedand of course i remembered from the days of ralph de meo she really grabbed him good and when he was still on his hip in the pine needles with his football pants still around his knees franny pulled his jock and cup halfway down his thighs before releasing it with a snap for just a second frank franny and i got to see doves small frightened private parts big deal franny screamed at dove youre such a big deal then franny and i had to restrain frank from going on and on with his banging cymbals it seemed that the sound might kill the trees and drive small animals from the forest chipper dove lay on his side with one hand cupping his balls and the other hand holding one ear shut against the noise his other ear was pressed to the ground i saw doves helmet in the ferns and took it with me when we left him there to recover himself back at the mud puddle on the path frank and franny filled the quarterbacks helmet with mud we left it brimming full for him shit and death franny said darkly frank couldnt stop tapping his cymbals together he was so excited jesus frank franny said please cut it out im sorry he told us and when we were nearer home he said thank you thank you too franny said both of you she said squeezing my arm i really am queer you know frank mumbled i guess i knew franny said its okay frank i said because what else could a brother say i was thinking of a way to tell you frank said and franny said this was a quaint way even frank laughed i think it was the first time id heard frank laugh since the time father discovered the size of the fourthfloor toilets in the hotel new hampshireour fourthfloor outhouse for elves we sometimes wondered if living in the hotel new hampshire would always be like this what seemed more important to know was who would come to stay in our hotel after we moved in and opened it for business as that time approached father became more emphatic about his theories for the perfect hotel he had seen an interview on television with the head of a hotelmanagement schoolin switzerland the man said that the secret to success was how quickly a new hotel could establish a pattern of advance bookings advance bookings father wrote on a shirt cardboard and stuck it to the refrigerator of mothers soontobeabandoned family house good morning advance bookings we would greet each other at breakfast to tease father but he was rather serious about it you laugh he told us one morning well i already have two two what egg asked two advance bookings father said mysteriously we were planning to open the weekend of the exeter game we knew that was the first advance booking every year the dairy school concluded its miserable football season by losing to one of the big schools like exeter or andover by a big score it was always worse when we had to travel to those schools and play them on their own wellkept turf exeter for example had a real stadium both exeter and andover had smart uniforms they were both allboys schools thenand the students wore coats and ties to classes someof them even wore coats and ties to the football games but even if they were informally attired they looked better than we did it made us feel terrible to see students like thataltogether clean and cocky and every year our team stumbled out on the field looking like shit and deathand when the game was over that was how we all felt exeter and andover traded us off each one liked to use us for their nexttolast gamea kind of warmup exercisebecause their last game of the season was with each other but for iowa bobs winning season we were playing at home and this year it would be exeter win or lose it would be a winning season but most peopleeven my father and coach bobthought that this years dairy team had a chance of going all the way undefeated and with a lastgame victory over exeter a team the dairy school had never beaten with a winning season even the alumni were coming back and the exeter game was made a parents weekend coach bob wished he had new uniforms to go with his imported backfield and junior jones but it pleased the old man to imagine that his tattered shitanddeath squad just might knock exeters crisp white uniforms with crimson letters and crimson helmets all over the field exeter wasnt having too hot a year anyway they were poking along about against better competition than we usually saw to be sure but it was not one of their great teams iowa bob saw that he had a chance and my father took the entire football season as a good omen for the hotel new hampshire the weekend of the exeter game was booked in advanceevery room reserved for two nights and reservations for the restaurant on saturday were already closed my mother was worried about the chef as father insisted on calling her she was a canadian from prince edward island where shed cooked for a large shipping family for fifteen years theres a difference between cooking for a family and cooking for a hotel mother warned father but it was a large familyshe said so father said and besides were a small hotel were a full hotel for the exeter weekend mother said and a full restaurant the cooks name was mrs urick she was to be assisted by her husband maxa former merchant seaman and galley cook who was missing the thumb and index finger of his left hand an accident in the galley of a vessel called the miss intrepid he told us children with a salty wink he had been distracted imagining what mrs urick would do to him if she knew about his time ashore with an intrepid lady in halifax all at once i looked down max told uslilly never taking her eyes from his maimed hand and there was my thumb and my finger amongst the bloody carrots and the cleaver was hacking away with a will of its own max flinched his claw of a hand as if recoiling from the blade and lilly blinked lilly was ten although she didnt seem to have grown much since shed been eight egg who was six seemed less frail than lillyand sturdily unimpressed with max uricks stories mrs urick didnt tell stories for hours she scrutinized crossword puzzles without filling in the squares she hung maxs laundry in the kitchen which had been the girls locker room of the thompson female seminarythus it was familiar with drying socks and underwear mrs urick and my father had decided that the most fetching menu for the hotel new hampshire would be familystyle meals by this mrs urick meant a choice of two big roasts or a new england boiled dinner a choice of two piesand on mondays a variety of meat pies made from leftover roasts for luncheons there would be soups and cold cuts for breakfasts griddle cakes and so forth nothing fancy but just plain good said mrs urick rather humorlessly she reminded franny and me of the kind of boardingschool dietician we were familiar with from the dairy schoola firm believer that food was no fun but somehow morally essential we shared mothers anxieties about the cookingsince it would be our standard fare toobut father was sure mrs urick would manage she was given a basement room of her own to be close to my kitchen she said she expected her stockpots to simmer overnight max urick had a room of his own tooon the fourth floor there was no elevator and my father was happy to use up a fourthfloor room the fourthfloor rooms had the childsized toilets and sinks but since max had done his bathroom business for so many years in the cramped latrine of the miss intrepid he was not insulted by the dwarf facilities good for my heart max told us good for pumping the bloodall that stairclimbing he said and whacked his stringy gray chest with his damaged hand but we thought that max would go to great lengths to keep as far from mrs urick as possible he would even climb stairshe would pee and wash in anything he claimed to be handy and when he wasnt helping mrs urick in the kitchen he was supposed to be fixing things everything from toilets to locks he claimed he could click his tongue like a key turning in a lock and he could make a terrible whooshing soundlike the tiny fourthfloor toilets in the hotel new hampshire sending their matter on an awesome long voyage whats the second advance booking i asked father we knew thered be a dairy school graduation weekend in the spring and maybe a big hockeygame weekend in the winter but the small if steady visits from parents of students at the dairy school would hardly require any booking in advance graduation right franny asked but father shook his head a giant wedding lilly cried and we stared at her whose wedding frank asked i dont know lilly said but a giant onea really big one the biggest wedding in new england we never knew where lilly thought up the things she thought up mother looked worriedly at her then she spoke to father dont be secretive she said we all want to know whats the second advance booking its not until summer he said theres a lot of time to get ready for it we have to concentrate on the exeter weekend first things first its probably a convention for the blind franny said to frank and me when we were walking to our classes in the morning or a leprosy clinic i said it will be all right frank said worriedly we didnt take the path through the woods behind the practice field anymore we walked straight across the soccer fields sometimes throwing our apple cores into the goals or else we walked down the main path that bisected the campus dormitories we were concerned that we continue to avoid iowa bobs backfield none of us wanted to be caught alone with chipper dove we hadnt told father of the incidentfrank had asked franny and me not to tell him mother already knows frank told us i mean she knows im queer this surprised franny and me only for a moment when we thought of it it made perfect sense really if you had a secret mother would keep it if you wanted a democratic debate and a family discussion lasting for hours maybe weeksperhaps monthsthen you brought up whatever it was with father he was not very patient with secrets although he was being silent enough about his second advance booking its going to be a meeting of all the great writers and artists of europe lilly guessed and franny and i kicked each other under the table and rolled our eyes our eyes said lilly is weird and frank is queer and egg is only six our eyes said were all alone in this familyjust the two of us its going to be the circus said egg howd you know father snapped at him oh no win mother said it is a circus just a little one father said not the descendants of pt barnum said iowa bob of course not father said the king brothers frank said he had a king brothers tigeract poster in his room no i mean really small father said a sort of private circus one of those secondrate ones you mean coach bob said not the kind with freaky animals franny said certainly not said father what do you mean freaky animals lilly asked horses with not enough legs said frank a cow with an extra headgrowing out of her back whered you see that i asked will there be tigers and lions egg asked just so theyre on the fourth floor said iowa bob no put them with mrs urick franny said win my mother said what circus well they can use the field you see father said they can pitch their tents on the old playground they can eat in the restaurant and some of them might actually stay in the hotel tooalthough most of those people have their own trailers i think what will the animals be lilly asked well said father i dont think they have too many animals its small you see probably just a few animals i think they have some special acts you knowbut im not sure what animals what acts said iowa bob its probably one of those awful circuses franny said the kind with goats and chickens and those everyday junky animals everyones seensome dumb reindeers a talking crow but nothing big you know and nothing exotic its the exotic ones id just as soon not have around here mother said what acts said iowa bob well father said im not sure trapeze maybe you dont know what animals mother said and you dont know what acts either what do you know theyre small father said they just wanted to reserve some rooms and maybe half the restaurant they take mondays off mondays off said iowa bob how long did you book them for well father said win my mother said how many weeks will they be here theyll be here the whole summer father said wow cried egg the circus a circus said franny a weirdo circus dumb acts dumb animals i said weird acts weird animals frank said well youll fit right in frank franny told him stop it mother said theres no reason to get anxious father said its just a small private circus whats its name mother asked well said father you dont know its name asked coach bob of course i know its name father said its called fritzs act fritzs act frank said whats the act i asked well father said thats just a name im sure theres more than one act it sounds very modern frank said modern frank franny said it sounds kinky i said whats kinky said lilly a kind of animal egg asked never mind said mother i think we should concentrate on the exeter weekend father said yes and getting yourselves and me all moved in said iowa bob theres lots of time to discuss the summer the whole summer is booked in advance mother asked you see father said now thats good business already weve taken care of the summer and the exeter weekend first things first now all we have to do is move in that happened a week before the exeter game it was the weekend when iowa bobs ringers rang up nine touchdownsto match their ninth straight victory against no defeats franny didnt get to see it she had decided not to be a cheerleader anymore that saturday franny and i helped mother move the last things that the moving vans hadnt already taken to the hotel new hampshire lilly and egg went with father and coach bob to the game frank of course was in the band there were thirty rooms over four floors and our family occupied seven rooms in the southeast corner covering two floors one room in the basement was dominated by mrs urick that meant that together with the fourthfloor resting place of max there were twentytwo rooms for guests but the headwaitress and head maid ronda ray had a dayroom on the second floorto gather herself together shed said to father and two southeastcorner rooms on the third floorjust above uswere reserved for iowa bob that left only nineteen rooms for guests and only thirteen of those came with their own baths six of the rooms came with the midget facilities its more than enough father said this is a small town and not popular it was more than enough for the circus called fritzs act perhaps but we were anxious how we were going to handle the full house we expected for the exeter weekend that saturday we moved in franny discovered the intercom system and switched on the receiving buttons in all the rooms they were all empty of course but we tried to imagine listening to the first guests moving into them the squawkbox system as father called it had been left over from the thompson female seminary of coursethe principal could announce fire drills to the various classrooms and teachers who were out of their homerooms could hear if the kids were fooling around father thought that keeping the intercom system would make it unnecessary to have phones in the rooms they can call for help on the intercom father said or we can wake them for breakfast and if they want to use the phone they can use the phone at the main desk but of course the squawkbox system also meant that it was possible to listen to the guests in their rooms not ethically possible father said but franny and i couldnt wait that saturday we moved in we were without even the maindesk phoneor a phone in our familys apartmentand we were without linen because the linen service that was going to handle the hotel laundry had also been contracted to do ours they werent starting service until monday ronda ray wasnt starting until monday either but she was therein the hotel new hampshirelooking over her dayroom when we arrived i just need it you know she asked mother i mean i cant change sheets in the morning after i wait on the breakfast eatersand before i serve lunch to the lunch eaterswithout having no place to lay down and between lunch and supper if i dont lay down i get feeling nastyall over and if you lived where i lived you wouldnt wanna go home ronda ray lived at hampton beach where she waitressed and changed sheets for the summer crowd shed been looking for a yearround arrangement for her hotel careerand my mother guessed a way to get out of hampton beach forever she was about my mothers age and in fact claimed to remember seeing earl perform in earls casino years she had not seen his ballroom dancing performance though it was the bandstand she remembered and the act called applying for a job but i never believed it was a real bear she told franny and me as we watched her unpack a small suitcase in her dayroom i mean ronda ray said i thought nobody would get a kick out of undressing no real bear we wondered why she was unpacking night clothes from the suitcase if this day room was not where she intended to spend the night she was a woman franny was curious aboutand i thought she was even exotic she had dyed hair i cant say what colour it was because it wasnt a real colour it wasnt red it wasnt blonde it was the colour of plastic or metal and i wondered how it felt ronda ray had a body that i imagined was formerly as strong as frannys but had grown a little thickstill powerful but straining it is hard to say what she smelled like althoughafter we left rondafranny tried she put perfume on her wrist two days ago franny said you following me yes i said but her watchband wasnt there thenher brother was wearing her watch or her father franny said some man anyway and he really sweated a lot yes i said then ronda put the watchband on over the perfume and she wore it for a day while she was stripping beds franny said what beds i said franny thought a minute beds very strange people had slept in she said the circus called fritzs act slept in them i said right said franny the whole summer we said in unison right franny said and what we smell when we smell ronda is what rondas watchband smells likeafter all that that was coming close to it but i thought it was a slightly better smell than thatjust slightly i thought of ronda rays stockings which she hung in the closet of her dayroom i thought that if i sniffed just behind the knee of the pair of stockings she was wearing i would catch the true essence of her you know why she wears them franny asked me no i said some man spilled hot coffee on her legs franny said he did it on purpose he tried to boil her how do you know i asked ive seen the scars franny said and she told me at the squawkbox controls we switched off all the rooms and listened to ronda rays room she was humming then we heard her smoke we imagined how shed sound with a man noisy franny said we listened to rondas breathing intermixed with the crackles of the intercom systeman ancient system that ran on the power from an automobile battery like a clever electric fence when lilly and egg and father came home from the game franny and i put egg in the dumbwaiter and hauled him up and down the fourstorey shaft until frank ratted on us and father told us that the dumbwaiter would be used only for removing linen and dishes and other thingsnot humansfrom the rooms it wasnt safe father said if we let go of the rope the dumbwaiter fell at the speed imposed by its own response to gravity that was fastif not for a thing at least for a human but egg is so light franny argued i mean were not going to try it with frank youre not going to try it at all father said then lilly got lost and we stopped unpacking for almost an hour trying to find her she was sitting in the kitchen with mrs urick who had seized lillys attention by telling her stories of the various ways shed been punished when shed been a girl her hair had been cut out in hunks to humiliate her when she forgot to wash before supper shed been told to go stand barefoot in the snow whenever she swore when shed snitched food shed been force to eat a tablespoon of salt if you and mother go away lilly said to father you wont leave us with mrs urick will you frank had the best room and franny complained she had to share a room with lilly a doorway without a door connected my room to eggs max urick dismantled his intercom when we listened to his room all we heard was staticas if the old sailor were still far out to sea mrs uricks room bubbled like the stockpots on the back of her stovethe sound of life held steadily at a simmer we were so restless for more guests and for the hotel new hampshire to actually be open that we couldnt keep still father paced us through two fire drills to tire us out but it only roused us to wanting more action when it was dark we realized the electricity hadnt been turned onso we hid from each other and searched for each other through the empty rooms with candles i hid in ronda rays dayroom on the second floor i blew my candle out and with my sense of smell located the drawers where shed put her nightclothes away i heard frank scream from the third floorhed put his hand on a plant in the darkand what could only be franny laughing in the echo chamber that the stairwell was have your fun now father roared from our apartment when there are guests here you cant have the run of the place lilly found me in ronda rays room and helped me put rondas clothes back in the chest of drawers father caught us leaving rondas room and took lilly back to our apartment and put her to bed he was irritable because hed just tried to call the electric company to complain that the power was off and had discovered that our phones werent connected either mother had volunteered to take a walk with egg and make the call from the railroad station i went looking for franny but she had made it back to the lobby undetected she switched all the intercoms to broadcasting and broadcast an announcement throughout the hotel now hear this franny boomed now hear this everyone out of bed for a sex check whats a sex check i wondered running down the stairwell to the lobby frank fortunately missed the message he was hiding in the fourthfloor utility closet where there was no squawk box installed when he heard frannys announcement the message was garbled he probably thought that father was pacing us through another fire drill in his haste to leave the utility closet frank stepped in a pail and fell on all fours his head hitting the floor and one hand touching this time a dead mouse we heard him scream again and max urick opened his door at the end of the fourthfloor hall and bellowed as if he were out to sea and going down shut up your godawful screeching or ill hang you by your little fingers off the fire escape that put frank in a bad mood he declared that our games were childish and he went to his room franny and i watched out over elliot park from the big corner window in f that would be coach bobs bedroom but bob was out at an athletic department banquet celebrating all but the last gameyet to be played elliot park was typically deserted and the unused playground facilities stuck up like dead trees against the dull glow from the one streetlight the last of the construction equipment was still there the diesel machines and the workmens shack but the hotel new hampshire was finished now except for landscaping and the only machine that had been in use for days was the backhoe that crouched near the front flagstone path like a starving dinosaur there were still a few stumps from the dead elms to dig out of the ground and a few holes to fill around the periphery of the new parking lot a soft glossy light came from the windows of our apartment where father was putting lilly to bed by candlelight and frank was no doubt looking at himself in his band uniform in the mirror of his room franny and i saw the squad car come into elliot parklike a shark cruising forsaken waters for an unlikely meal we speculated that the old patrolman howard tuck would arrest mother and egg as they were walking back from the railroad station we speculated that the candlelight in the hotel new hampshire would convince patrolman tuck that there were ghosts of old thompson female seminary students haunting the hotel but howard parked the patrol car behind the most obvious pile of construction rubble and shut off his engine and his lights we saw the head of his cigar like the shimmering red eye of an animal in the dark car we saw mother and egg crossing the playground undetected they came out of the darkness and out of the scant light as if their time on earth were that brief and that dimly illuminated it gave me a twinge to see them like that and i felt franny shudder beside me lets go turn all the lights on franny suggested in all the rooms but the electricity is out i said it is now dummy she said but if we turn on all the lights the whole hotel will light up when they turn the power on that sounded like a fine idea so i helped her do iteven the hall lights outside max uricks roomand the outdoor floodlights which would one day illuminate a patio extending from the restaurant but now would shine only on the backhoe and a yellow steel hard hat that dangled by its chin strap from a small tree the backhoe had left alone the workman whose hat it was seemed gone forever the abandoned hat reminded me of struthers strong and dull i knew franny hadnt seen him in a while i knew she had no favourite boyfriends and she seemed sullen on the subject franny was a virgin shed told me not because she wanted to be but because there wasnt a boy at the dairy school who was as she put it worth it i dont mean i think im so great she told me but i dont want some clod ruining it for me and i dont want someone whod laugh at me either its very important john she told me especially the first time why i asked it just is franny said its the first time thats why it stays with you forever i doubted it i hoped not i thought of ronda ray what had the first time meant to her i thought of her nightclothes smellingambiguouslylike her wrist under her watchband like the back of her knee howard tuck and the patrol car hadnt moved by the time franny and i accomplished turning on all the lights we snuck outdoors when the power went on we wanted to see the whole hotel ablaze we climbed into the drivers seat of the backhoe and waited howard tuck sat so still in the squad car he looked as if he were waiting for his retirement in fact iowa bob was fond of saying that howard tuck always looked at deaths door when howard tuck cranked the ignition of the squad car the hotel lit up as if hed done it when the patrol cars headlights bunked on every light in the hotel came to life and howard tuck seemed to lurch the car forward and stallas if the sight of the bright hotel had dazed him and his foot had slipped off the gas or off the clutch actually the sight of the hotel new hampshire blazing with light the instant he started his car had been too much for old howard tuck his life in elliot park had been less illuminatedonly occasional sexual discoveries inexpert teenagers caught in his spotlight and the odd vandal interested in doing trivial damage to the thompson female seminary once the dairy school students had stolen one of the schools token cows and tied it to the goal at one end of the fieldhockey field what howard tuck saw when he started his car had been a fourstorey shock of lightthe way the hotel new hampshire might look the precise second it was bombed max uricks radio came on with a blast of music that caused max to shriek in alarm a stove tuner chimed in mrs uricks underground kitchen lilly cried out in her sleep frank came to life in the dark mirror egg anxious at the hum of electricity he felt throb through the hotel shut his eyes franny and i in the backhoe held our hands over our earsas if the sight of this much sudden light could only be accompanied by an explosion and the old patrolman howard tuck felt his foot slip off the clutch at the moment his heart stopped and he departed a world where hotels could spring to life so easily franny and i were the first to get to the squad car we saw the policemans body slumped against the steering wheel and heard the horn blaring father and mother and frank ran out of the hotel new hampshire as if the police car were sounding the signal for another fire drill jesus howard youre dead father said to the old man shaking him we didnt mean to we didnt mean to franny said father thumped old howard tuck on the chest and stretched him out on the police cars front seat then he struck him on the chest again call somebody father said but there was no working phone in our unlikely house father looked at the puzzling maze of wires and switches and earand mouthpieces in the squad car hello hello he said into something pushing something else how the fuck does this thing work he cried whos this said a voice out of the tubes of the car get an ambulance to elliot park my father said halloween alert said the voice halloween trouble hello hello jesus god its halloween father said goddamn silly machine he cried slamming the dashboard of the squad car with one hand he gave a fairly hard thump to the quiet chest of howard tuck with his other hand we can get an ambulance franny said the school ambulance and i ran with her through elliot park which was now glowing in the stunning light that poured from the hotel new hampshire holy cow said iowa bob when we ran into him at the pine street entrance to the park he was looking at the bright hotel as if the place had opened for business without him in the unnatural light coach bob looked years older to me but i suppose he really looked only as old as he wasa grandfather and a retiring coach with one more game to play howard tuck had a heart attack i told him and franny and i ran on toward the dairy schoolwhich was always up to heartattack tricks of its own especially on halloween franny loses a fight on halloween the police department of the town of dairy sent old howard tuck to elliot park as usual but the state police sent two cars to cruise the campus of the dairy school and the campus security force was doubled although short on tradition the dairy school had a considerable halloween reputation it had been halloween when one of the token cows had been tied to the goal at the thompson female seminary it had been another halloween when another cow had been led to the dairy school field house and indoor swimming pool where the beast suffered a violent reaction to the chlorine in the water and drowned it had been halloween when four little kids from the town had made the mistake of going trickortreating in one of the dairy dorms the children were kidnapped for the night they had their heads shaved by a student costumed as an executioner and one child was unable to speak for a week i hate halloween franny said as we noted there were few trickortreaters on the streets the little kids of dairy were frightened of halloween an occasional cringing child with a paper bag or a mask on its head cowered as franny and i ran by and a group of small childrenone dressed as a witch one as a ghost and two as robots from a recent film about a martian invasionfled into the safety of a lit doorway as we charged up the sidewalk toward them cars with anxious parents were parked here and there along the streetspotting for wouldbe attackers as their children cautiously approached a door to ring a bell the usual anxieties about the razor blades in apples the arsenic in the chocolate cookies were no doubt passing through the parked parents minds one such anxious father put his headlights on franny and me and leaped from his car to give chase hey you he yelled howard tuck had a heart attack i called to him and that seemed to stop himcold franny and i ran through the open gate like the gate to a cemetery that admitted us to the playing fields of the dairy school past the pointed iron bars i tried to imagine the gate for the exeter weekendwhen they would be selling pennants and blankets and cowbells to bash together at the game it was a rather cheerless gate now and as we ran in a small horde of children rushed by us running outthe other way they were running for their lives it seemed and a few of their terrified faces were as shocking as the halloween masks some of the other kids had managed to keep on their plastic blackandwhite and pumpkincoloured costumes were in shreds and tatters and they wailed like a childrens hospital wardgreat gagging snivels of fear jesus god franny said and they fled away from heras if she were in costume and i wore the worst mask of all i grabbed a small boy and asked him whats happening but he writhed and screamed in my hands he tried to bite my wristhe was wet and trembling and he smelled strange and his skeleton costume came away in pieces in my hands like soggy toilet paper or a decomposing sponge giant spiders he cried witlessly i let him go whats happening franny called to the children but they were gone as suddenly as theyd appeared the playing fields stretched in front of us dark and empty at the end of them like tall ships across a harbour shrouded by fog the dorms and buildings of the dairy school seemed sparsely litas if everyone had gone to bed early and only a few good students were burning as they say the midnight oil but franny and i knew that there were very few good students at dairy and on a halloween saturday night we doubted that even the good ones were studyingand we doubted that any of the dark windows meant that anyone was sleeping perhaps they were drinking in the blackness of their rooms perhaps they were violating each other and some captured children in their dark dorms perhaps there was a new religion the rage of the campus and the religion required total night for its ritualsand halloween was its day of reckoning something was wrong the white wooden goal at the near end of the soccer field seemed too white to me although it was the darkest night i had been in something was too stark and apparent about the goal i wish sorrow was with us franny said sorrow will be with us i thoughtknowing what franny didnt know that father had taken sorrow to the vets this very day to have the old dog put to sleep there had been a sober discussionin frannys absenceof the need for this lilly and egg werent with us either father had told mother frank and meand iowa bob franny wont understand father had said and lilly and egg are too young theres no point in asking their opinion they wont be rational frank did not care for sorrow but even frank seemed saddened by the death sentence i know he smells bad frank said but thats not exactly a fatal disease in a hotel it is father said that dog has terminal flatulence and he is old mother said when you get old i told mother and father we wont put you to sleep and what about me iowa bob said i suppose im the next one to go got to watch my farting or its off to the nursing home youre no help at all father told coach bob its only franny who really loves the dog shes the one whos really going to be upset and well just have to make it as easy for her as we can father no doubt thought that anticipation was ninetenths of suffering he was not really being cowardly by not seeking frannys opinion he knew what her opinion would be of course and he knew that sorrow had to go and so i wondered how long we would be moved into the hotel new hampshire before franny would notice the old farters absence before she would start sniffing around for sorrowfather would have to put all his cards on the table well franny i could imagine father beginning you know that sorrow wasnt getting any youngeror any better at controlling himself passing the deadwhite soccer goal under the black sky i shuddered to think how franny would take it murderers she would call us all and we would all look guilty franny franny father would say but franny would make an awful fuss i pitied the strangers in the hotel new hampshire who would waken to the variety of sounds franny was capable of then i realized what was wrong about the soccer goal the net was gone end of the season i thought but no if there was one week more of football surely there was a week more of soccer too and i recalled in past years how the nets would stay on the goals until the first snow as if it took the first storm to remind the maintenance crew what they had forgotten the nets in the goals held the drifted snowlike spider webs so dense that they trap dust the nets goneoff the goal i said to franny big deal she said and we veered into the woods even in the dark franny and i could find the shortcut the path the football players always usedand everyone else because of them stayed off it a halloween prank i thought stealing a net to a soccer goal and then of course franny and i ran right into it suddenly the net was over us and under us and there were two other people trapped like us a dairy school freshman named firestone his face as round as a tyre and as soft as a kind of cheese and a small trickortreater from town the trickortreater was wearing a gorilla suit though he was closer in size to a spider monkey his gorilla mask was backwards on his head so that when you saw the back of his head you saw a monkey and when you saw his screaming face you saw him for the frightened little boy he was it was a jungle trap and the monkey thrashed in it wildly firestone tried to he down but the net kept jiggling him out of positionhe collided with me and said sorry then he collided with franny and said god awfully sorry every time i tried to get back on my feet the net would jerk my feet out from under me or the net over my head would jerk my head back and id fall franny crouched on all fours keeping her balance inside the net with us was a large brown paper bag spewing forth the halloween hoardings of the child in the gorilla suitcandy corn and sticky balls of coagulated popcorn breaking apart under us and lollipops with their crinkly cellophane wrappers the child in the gorilla suit was screaming in that breathless hysterical way as if he were about to choke and franny got her arms around him and tried to calm him down its all right its just a dirty trick she said to him theyll let us go giant spiders cried the child slapping himself all over and twitching in frannys grasp no no franny said no spiders theyre just people but i thought i knew what people they were i would have preferred the spiders got four of them said someonea voice with a lockerroom familiarity to it got fucking four of them at once got a little one and three big ones said another familiar voice a ballcarriers voice or a blocking backs voiceit was hard to tell flashlights like the blinking eyes of rather mechanical spiders in the night looked us over well look whos here said the voice in command said the quarterback called chipper dove got pretty little feet said harold swallow got beautiful skin said chester pulasik she has a nice smile too said lenny metz and the best ass in the whole school said chipper dove franny rested on her knees howard tuck had a heart attack i told them all weve got to get an ambulance let the fucking monkey go said chip dove the net shifted the thin black arm of harold swallow snatched the kid in the gorilla suit out of the spiders web and released him into the night trick or treat said harold and the little gorilla was gone is that you firestone dove asked and the flashlight shone on the bland boy named firestone who looked as if he were trying to fall asleep at the bottom of the net his knees drawn fetustight up to his chest his eyes closed his hand over his mouth you fag firestone said lenny metz what are you doing hes suckin his thumb said harold swallow let him go the quarterback said and chester pulaskis painful complexion blossomed momentarily in the flashlight he dragged the dormant firestone from the net after a slight pounding sound of flesh on flesh we heard the awakened firestone trot away now look whos left said chipper dove a man had a heart attack franny said we really are going to the infirmary for the ambulance youre not going there now said dove hey kid he said to me holding a flashlight on my face you know what i want you to do kid no i said and someone kicked me through the net what i want you to do kid chipper dove said is stay right here in our giant spider web until one of the spiders tells you you can go you understand no i said and someone kicked me again a little harder be smart franny said to me thats right said lenny metz be smart and you know what i want you to do franny said chipper dove but franny didnt respond i want you to show me that place again he said that place where we can be alone remember i tried to crawl closer to franny but someone was tightening the net around me she stays with me i yelled franny stays with me i was down on my hip then with the net growing tighter and someone was kneeling on my back leave him alone franny said ill show you the place just stay here and dont move franny i said but she let lenny metz pull her out from under the net remember what you said franny i cried to her rememberabout the first time it probably isnt true she said dully it probably isnt anything then she must have made a break for it because i heard a scuffle in the dark and lenny metz cried out nuff son of a bitch you bitch and there was that familiar sound of poundingflesh on flesh againand i heard franny say all right all right you bastard lenny and chester are going to help you show me the place franny chipper dove said okay you turd in a birdbath franny said you rats asshole she said but i heard flesh on flesh again and franny said okay okay it was harold swallow who was kneeling on my back if the net hadnt been all tangled around me i might have been a match for him but i couldnt move well be back for you harold chipper dove called hang in there harold said chester pulaski youll get your turn harold said lenny metz and they all laughed i dont want no turn said harold swallow i dont want no trouble he said but they were gone franny occasionally cursingbut farther and farther away from me youre going to get in trouble harold i said you know what theyre going to do to her i dont want to know he said i dont get in no trouble i come to this shitass school to get outa trouble well youre in trouble now harold i said theyre going to rape her harold that happens said harold swallow but not to me i struggled briefly under the net but it was easy for him to keep me pinned down i dont like to fight either he said they think youre a crazy nigger i told him thats what they think you are thats why theyre with her and youre here harold but its the same trouble i told him youre in the same trouble theyre in they never get in no trouble harold said nobody ever tells franny will tell i said but i felt the candy corn pressed against my face and into the damp ground it was another halloween to remember for sure and i felt as weak and small as id ever felton every dairy halloween i could recall scared to death by bigger always bigger kids stuffing my head in my trickortreat bag and rattling it until all i heard was cellophane and then the bag bursting around my ears what did they look like father would always ask us but every year they looked like ghosts gorillas skeletons and worse of course it was a night for disguises and nobody ever was caught not for tying frank to the fire escape of the biggest dorm where he wet his pants no one ever caught anyone for that not for the three pounds of cold wet pasta someone threw on franny and me crying live eels run for your lives and we lay writhing on the dark sidewalk the spaghetti sticking to us beating each other and screaming theyre going to rape my sister harold i said you got to help her i cant help nobody harold said somebody can help i said we could run and get somebody i know you can run harold yeah he said but whos going to help you with those guys not howard tuck i knew and by the sound of sirens which i heard nowfrom the campus and the towni guessed that father had figured out the police car enough to use its radio for help so there would be no authorities available to help franny anyway i started to cry and harold swallow shifted his weight on my shoulder it was quiet for a second between the deep breaths the sirens take and we heard franny flesh on flesh i thoughtbut it was different now franny made a sound that moved harold swallow to remember whomight help her junior jones could handle those guys harold said junior jones dont take no shit from nobody yes i said and hes your friend isnt he he likes you better than them doesnt he he dont like nobody said harold swallow admiringly but suddenly his weight was off me and he was pawing at the net unwinding it from around me get up off your ass he said junior does like somebody whos he like i asked he likes everybodys sister said harold swallow but this thought did not reassure me what do you mean i asked him get up on your feet said harold swallow junior jones likes everybodys sisterhe told me so man he said everybodys sister is a good girlthats just what he said but whats he mean i said trying to keep up with him now because he was the fastest organization of human flesh at the dairy school as coach bob said harold swallow could fly we ran toward the light at the end of the footpath we ran past where i knew id last heard from frannywhere the ferns were where iowa bobs backfield was taking turns i stopped there i wanted to run into the woods there and find her but harold swallow pulled me along you cant do nothing to those guys man he said we got to get junior why junior jones would help us i didnt know i only thought that i would die before i found outtrying to keep up with harold swallowand i thought that if jones indeed liked everybodys sister as he apparently claimed that didnt necessarily mean good news for franny how does he like everybodys sister i panted to harold swallow he likes them like he likes his own sister harold swallow said man he said to me why are you so slow junior jones has got a sister himself man harold said and some dudes raped her shit he said i thought everybody knew that theres a lot you miss not living in the dorms frank was always saying did they catch them i asked harold swallow did they catch the guys who raped juniors sister shit said harold swallow junior caught them i thought everybody knew that whatd he do to them i asked harold swallow but harold had beaten me to junior jones dorm he was flying up the stairwell and i was easily a full flight of stairs behind him dont ask harold swallow yelled down to me shit he said nobody knows what he did to them man and nobody asks where the hell does junior jones live i wondered passing the third floor and climbing higher my lungs breaking harold swallow nowhere in sight but harold was waiting for me at the landing of the fifth and topmost floor junior jones lives in the sky i thought but harold explained to me that most of the black athletes at the dairy school were quartered on the top floor of this one dorm where were out of sight you know harold asked me like fucking birdies in the nests in the tippytops of the trees man said harold swallow thats where the black people get put at this shitass school the fifth floor of the dorm was dark and hot heat rises dont you know said harold swallow welcome to the fuckin jungle every light in every room was out but music was playing and escaping from under the doors the fifth floor of that dorm was like a tiny street of nightclubs and bars in a city observing blackout conditions and from the rooms i heard the unmistakable shuffling of feetdancing and dancing in the dark harold swallow pounded on a door what you want said the terrifying voice of junior jones you want to die junior junior said harold swallow pounding harder you do want to die dont you said junior jones and we heard a series of locks as if from a jail cell unlocking the door from inside if some mother wants to die said junior jones ill help him more locks unlocked harold swallow and i stepped back from the door which one of you wants to die first said junior jones heat and a saxophone throbbed from his room he was backlit by a candle burning on his desk which was drapedlike the coffin of a presidentwith the american flag we need your help junior said harold swallow you sure do said junior jones theyve got my sister i said to him theyve got franny i said and theyre raping her junior jones seized me by my armpits and hoisted me up to him face to face he leaned me gently against the wall my feet felt a foot or two off the floor i didnt struggle did you say rape man he asked yeah rape rape said harold swallow darting around us like a bee theyre raping his sister man they really are your sister junior asked me letting me slide to the floor against the wall my sister franny i said and for a moment i feared he would say again shes just another white girl to me but he didnt say anything he was cryinghis big face as shiny and wet as the shield of a warrior left out in the rain please i said to him we have to hurry but junior jones started shaking his head his tears spraying harold swallow and me were not gonna be in time junior said no way are we going to be in time theres three of them said harold swallow three times takes time and i felt sicki felt like halloween again and again with a bellyful of junk and trash and i know which three of them dont i said junior jones i noticed he was getting dressed i hadnt noticed hed been naked he pulled on a baggy grey pair of sweat pants he pulled on his hightopped white basketball shoes over his huge bare feet he put on a baseball cap with the visor turned backwards that was all he was going to wear apparently because he stood in the fifthfloor hall of the dorm and shouted suddenly black arm of the law he said doors opened lion hunt jones yelled the black athletes quarantined on the top floor peered out at him get your shit together said junior jones lion hunt cried harold swallow flying up and down the hall get your shit together black arm of the law it was then that it occurred to me that i didnt know any black students at the dairy school who werent athletesof course our shitass school wouldnt take them if they couldnt be of some use whats a lion hunt i asked junior jones your sisters a good girl jones said i know she is everybodys own sister is a good girl he said and i agreed with him of course and harold swallow bumped my arm and said you see man everybodys sister is a good girl and we flew down the stairwell with remarkable silence considering how many of us there were harold swallow led us waiting impatiently on every landing junior jones was surprisngly quick for his size on the secondfloor landing we encountered two white students coming home from somewhere they saw the black athletes descending the stairs and fled down the hall on their floor lion hunt they cried fucking black arm of the law not a door opened two lights went out and then we were outside in the halloween night heading for the woods and the place just off the footpath that i would recognize and remember all my life theres not a day when i couldnt locate those ferns where franny and i were first and always alone franny i cried out but there was no answer i led jones and harold swallow into the woods behind us the black athletes fanned out along the footpath and entered the woods all up and down the pathshaking the trees kicking the dead leaves some of them humming a little tune all of them i suddenly noticed wearing those baseball caps turned backwards all of them barechested two of them wore catchers masks the sound they made coming through the woods was like the whirring of a large rotary blade cutting through a field flashlights blinked and like a swarm of large fireflies we came upon the ferns where lenny metz his pants still off held my sisters head pinched between his knees metz was kneeling on frannys arms stretched over her head while chester pulaskiwho no doubt had been third in linewas finishing his turn chipper dove was gone he had been first of course and like the careful quarterback he was he hadnt held the ball too long of course i knew what he was going to do franny told me much later i was prepared for him id even imagined itwith him i always knew it would be himthe first timesomehow but i never thought hed let the others even see me with him i even told him that they didnt have to force me that id let him but when he left me with themi wasnt prepared for that at all i never even imagined that it seemed to my sister that shed been made to pay disproportionately for her mischief with the lights in the hotel new hampshire and her inadvertent contribution to howard tucks departure from our world boy are you ever made to pay for a little fun franny said and it seemed to me that lenny metz and chester pulaski hardly paid enough for the fun theyd had metz released my sisters arms when he first caught sight of junior jones he pulled his pants up and made a break for itbut he was a running back used to good blocking in front of him and a relatively open field in the dark woods he could barely see the dark bodies of the humming black athletes and although he ran with power and with some speed he struck a tree as big around as his thigh and it broke his collarbone he was surrounded rather quickly then and was dragged back to the holy ground in the ferns where junior jones ordered all his clothes stripped off him and had him tied to a lacrosse stick he was then carried naked to the dean of men i learned later that the lion hunters always delivered up their prey with a certain flair once theyd caught an exhibitionist whod been bothering the girls dorm they hung him by his ankles to the shower head in the most populated of the girls bathroomswrapped naked in a transparent shower curtain then they called the dean this is the black arm of the law said junior jones this is the sheriff of the fucking fifth floor yes junior what is it the dean asked theres a male nudist in the females dorm firstfloor bathroom on your right jones said the lion hunters captured him in the act of exhibiting himself thus lenny metz was lugged to the dean of men chester pulaski got there ahead of him lion hunt harold swallow had screamed in the woods and when lenny let go of frannys arms chester pulaski slipped out of my sister and made a break for it too he was completely undressed however and on his tender bare feet he trotted slowly between the trees not striking them every twenty yards or so he was scared to death by the black arm of the law the black athletes who crept through the woods swishing the trees snapping sticks and humming their tune it had been chester pulaskis first gang bang and the jungle ritual had completely coloured the night for himhe thought the woods were suddenly full of natives cannibals he imaginedand he stumbled whimpering and bent over appropriate to my imagination of early man not quite upright mostly on all fours when he arrived at the dormitory apartment of the dean of men the dean of men had not been happy at the dairy school since the school had admitted women before then hed been dean of studentsa prim fit man with a pipe and a fondness for racquet sports he had a pert fit wife of the youthful cheerleader variety her age betrayed only by an alarming pouchiness about her eyes they had no children the boys the dean of students liked to say are all my children when the girls arrived he never felt the same about them and quickly appointed to assist himself his wife in the role of dean of women his new title dean of men pleased him but he despaired at all the new sorts of trouble his boys got into now that there were girls at dairy oh no he probably said when he heard chester pulaski clawing at his door i hate halloween ill get it his wife said and the dean of women went to open the door i know i know she said cheerfully trick or treat and there was a naked and cringing chester pulaski the blocking backblazing with boils smelling of sex the scream of the dean of women was said to have awakened the bottom two floors of the dorm the two deans lived inand even mrs butler the night nurse who was sleeping at her desk in the infirmary next door i hate halloween she probably said to herself she went to the infirmary door and saw junior jones and harold swallow and me junior was carrying franny i had helped franny get dressed in the ferns and junior jones had tried to untangle her hair while she cried and cried and finally hed said to her you want to walk or ride it was a question father used to ask us children when we were years younger which meant did we want to walk or did we want to take the car junior of course meant he would carry her and thats what franny wantedso he did he carried her past the spot in the ferns where lenny metz was being lashed to a lacrosse stick and prepared for a different land of travel franny cried and cried and junior said hey youre a good girl i have very good judgement about that but franny kept crying hey listen said junior jones you know what when someone touches you and you dont want to be touched thats not really being touchedyou got to believe me its not you they touch when they touch you that way they dont really get you you understand youve still got you inside you nobodys touched younot really youre a really good girl you believe me youve still got you inside you you believe that i dont know franny whispered and went on crying one of her arms lolled down juniors side and i took her hand she squeezed i squeezed back harold swallow darting through the trees guiding us like a hush up the path found the infirmary and opened the door whats all this said the night nurse mrs butler im franny berry said my sister and ive been beaten up beaten up would remain frannys euphemism for it although everyone knew she had been raped beaten up was all franny would admit to although no one missed the point this way it would never be a legal point however she means she was raped junior jones told mrs butler but franny kept shaking her head i think that her way of interpreting juniors kindness to her and his version of how the her in her had not been touched was to convert her sexual abuse into the terms of a mere fight she had lost she whispered to himhe still held her against his chest and in his armsand then he put her down on her feet and said to mrs butler okay she was beaten up mrs butler knew what was meant she was beaten up and raped said harold swallow who couldnt stand still but junior jones cooled him down with a look and said to him why dont you fly away harold why dont you fly off and find mr dove that put the gleam back in harolds eye and he flew away i called father before i remembered there was no working phone in the hotel new hampshire then i called campus security and asked them to give father the message franny and i were at the dairy school infirmary franny had been beaten up its just another halloween kid franny said holding my hand the worst one franny i said to her the worst one so far she said mrs butler took franny off to fix heramong other thingsa bath and junior jones explained to me that if franny cleaned herself there would be no evidence that she was raped and i went after mrs butler to explain it to her but mrs butler had already explained this to franny who wanted to let it go ive been beaten up she said although she would listen to mrs butlers advice about checking later to see if she was pregnant she wasntor infected with a venereal disease someone had passed on a little something which was eventually cured when father arrived at the infirmary junior jones had gone to lend his assistance to the delivery of lenny metz to the dean harold swallow was combing the campus like a hawk looking for a doveand i was sitting in an allwhite hospital room with franny fresh from her bath her hair in a towel an ice pack on her left cheekbone her right ring finger bandaged shed torn out a nail she wore a white hospital smock and was sitting up in bed i want to go home she told father tell mother i just need some clean clothes what did they do to you darling father asked her and sat beside her on the bed they beat me up franny said where were you father asked me he got help franny said did you see what happened father asked me he didnt see anything franny said i saw the third act i wanted to tell father but although we all knew what beaten up meant i would remain faithful to frannys term for it i just want to go home franny said although the hotel new hampshire seemed to me to be a large and unfamiliar place to curl up in father went to get her clothes it was a pity he missed seeing lenny metz trussed up on the lacrosse stick and carried through the campus to the dean like a poorly prepared piece of meat on a spit and a pity father didnt witness the precociousness of harold swallow searching for dove gliding up to every dorm room like a shadow until harold ascertained that chipper dove could only be in the girls dorm after that he thought it would be just a matter of time until he found whose room dove was hiding in the dean of men covering chester pulaski with his wifes camelshair coatit was the nearest thing handycried out chester chester my boy why only a week before the exeter game the woods are full of niggers chester pulaski said mournfully theyre taking over run for your life the dean of women had locked herself in the bathroom and when the second set of clawing sounds and banging reached her ears she cried to her husband you can answer the goddamned door this time its the niggers dont let them in chester pulaski cried clutching the dean of womens coat around him the dean of men bravely opened the door for some time hed had an arrangement with junior joness secret police which was dairys highly underground and very good arm of the law for gods sake junior the dean said this is going too far who is it cried the dean of women from the bathroom as lenny metz was brought into the deans living room and stretched out on the hearth before the fireplace his broken collarbone was killing him and when he saw the fire he must have thought it was meant for him i confess he cried you bet you do said junior jones i did it cried lenny metz you sure did said junior jones i did it too cried chester pulaski and who did it first asked junior jones chipper dove sang the boys in the backfield dove did it first there you have it said junior jones to the dean of men you got the picture what did they doand to whom the dean asked they gangbanged franny berry said junior jones just as the dean of women emerged from the bathroom she saw the black athletes swaying in the doorway like a choral society from an african country and she screamed again she shut herself back up in the bathroom now well bring you dove said junior jones gently junior cried the dean for gods sake gently i stayed with franny mother and father came to the infirmary with her clothes coach bob was left to babysit with lilly and egglike the old days i thought but where was frank frank was out on a mission father said mysteriously when father had heard that franny was beaten up hed never doubted the worst and he knew that sorrow would be the first thing shed ask for when she was home in her own bed i want to go home she would say and then shed say i want sorrow to sleep with me maybe its not too late father had said hed left sorrow at the vets before the football game if it had been a busy day for the vet perhaps the old farter was still alive in some cage frank had undertaken the mission to go and see but it was like the rescue mission of junior jones frank arrived too late he woke up the vet with his pounding on the door i hate halloween the vet probably said but his wife told him it was one of the berry boys asking about sorrow ohoh the vet said im sorry son the vet told frank but your dog passed away this afternoon i want to see him frank said ohoh the vet said the dog is dead son have you buried him frank asked its so sweet the vets wife told her husband let the boy bury his own dog if thats what he wants ohoh the vet said but he led frank to the hindmost room of the kennel where frank was treated to the sight of three dead dogs in a pile with a pile of three dead cats beside them we dont bury things on the weekends the vet explained which one is sorrow frank spotted the old evilsmeller instantly sorrow had begun to stiffen up but frank was still able to force the dead black labrador into a large trash bag the vet and his wife couldnt have known that frank had no intention of burying sorrow too late frank whispered to father when mother and father and franny and i arrived homeat the hotel new hampshire jesus god i can walk by myself you know franny said because all of us were trying to walk next to her here sorrow she called come on boy mother started to cry and franny took her arm im okay mom she said really i am nobody touched the me inside me i guess father started to cry and franny took his arm too i had been crying all night it seemed and i was all cried out frank pulled me aside what the fuck is it frank i said come see he said sorrow still in the trash bag was under the bed in franks room jesus god frank i said im going to fix him for franny he said in time for christmas christmas frank i said fix him im going to have sorrow stuffed frank said franks favourite course at the dairy school was biology a weird course taught by an amateur taxidermist named foit frank with foits help had already stuffed a squirrel and an odd orange bird holy cow frank i said i dont know if franny will like that its the nextbest thing to being alive frank said i didnt know by the sudden outburst we heard from franny we knew that father had broken the news to her a slight distraction to frannys grief was caused by iowa bob he insisted on going out and finding chipper dove himself and it took some persuading to talk him out of it franny wanted another bath and i lay in bed listening to the tub filling then i got up and went to the bathroom door and asked her if there was anything i could get her thank you she whispered just go out and get me yesterday and most of today she said i want them back is that all i said just yesterday and today thats all she said thank you i would if i could franny i told her i know she said i heard her sinking slowly in the tub im okay she whispered nobody got the fucking me in me i love you i whispered she didnt answer me and i went back to bed i heard coach bob in his rooms above usdoing pushups and then some situps and then a little work with the onearm curls the barbells rhythmic clanks and the old mans enraged breathsand i wished he had been allowed to find chipper dove who would have been no match for the old iowa lineman unfortunately dove was a match for junior jones and the black arm of the law dove had gone straight to the girls dorm and to the room of a doting cheerleader named melinda mitchell she was called mindy and she was gaga over dove he told her hed been fooling around with franny berry but that when she started fooling around with lenny metz and chester pulaski too it had put him off a cock tease he called my sister and mindy mitchell agreed she had been jealous of franny for years but now frannys got the black bunch after me dove told mindy shes pals with them especially junior jones dove said that goodygoody spade whos a fink for the dean so mindy mitchell tucked dove into her bed with her and when harold swallow came whispering at her door dove dovehave you seen dove black arm of the law wants to know she said she didnt let any boy into her room and she wouldnt let harold in either so they didnt find him he was expelled from the dairy school in the morningalong with chester pulaski and lenny metz the parents of the gangbangers when they heard the story were grateful enough that nothing criminal was being charged that they accepted the expulsion from school rather graciously some of the faculty and most of the trustees were upset that the incident couldnt have been suppressed until after the exeter game but it was pointed out that iowa bobs backfield was a less embarrassing loss than losing iowa bob himselffor the old man surely would have refused to coach in a game with those three still on his team it was an incident that was hushed up in the best private school tradition it was remarkable really how a school as unsophisticated as the dairy school could at times imitate exactly the decorum of silence in dealing with distasteful matters that the more sophisticated schools had learned like a science for beating up franny berryin what was implied to be merely an extension of the general roughhouse quality of a dairy school halloweenchester pulaski lenny metz and chipper dove were expelled dove it appeared to me got off scotfree but franny and i had not seen the last of him and perhaps franny already knew that we had not seen the last of junior jones either he became frannys friend if not exactly her bodyguard for the duration of his stay at dairy they went everywhere together and it was clear to me that junior jones was responsible for helping franny feel that she was indeed a good girlas he was always telling her we had not seen the last of jones when we left dairy althoughonce againhis style of rescuing franny would distinguish itself by his late arrival junior jones as you know would play college football at penn state and professional football for the brownsuntil someone would mess up his knee he would then go to law school and become active in an organization in new york citywhich would be called at his suggestion the black arm of the law as lilly would sayand one day she would make this clear to useverything is a fairy tale chester pulaski would suffer his racist nightmares most of his life which would be over in a car the police would say that he must have had his hands all over someone while he was supposed to be paying attention to the steering wheel the woman was killed too and lenny metz said he knew her when his collarbone healed metz went right back to carrying the ball he played college football somewhere in virginia and introduced chester pulaski to the woman he killed over one christmas vacation metz would never be drafted by the prosfor a pronounced lack of quicknessbut he was drafted by the us army who didnt care how slow he was and he died for his country as they say in vietnam actually he was not shot by the enemy he did not step on a mine it was another kind of combat that lenny metz succumbed to he was poisoned by a prostitute whom he had cheated harold swallow was both too crazy and too fast for me to keep up with god knows what became of him good luck to you harold wherever you are perhaps because it was halloween and halloweens atmosphere pervades my memory of iowa bobs winning season they have all become like ghosts and wizards and devils and creatures of magic to me remember too it was the first night we slept in the hotel new hampshirenot that we slept for most of it any night in a new place is a little uneasythere are the different sounds of the beds to get used to and lilly who always woke up with the same dry cough as if she were a very old personand wed be constantly surprised to see how small she waswoke up coughing differently almost as if she were as exasperated with her own poor health as mother was egg never woke up unless someone woke him and then he behaved as if hed been awake for hours but the morning after halloween egg woke up by himselfalmost peacefully and i had heard frank masturbate in his room for years but it was different hearing him do it in the hotel new hampshireperhaps because i knew that sorrow was in a trash bag under his bed the morning after halloween i watched the early light fall in elliot park thered been a frost and through the frozen rinds of someones mangled pumpkin i saw frank trudging to the bio lab with sorrow in the trash bag over his shoulder father saw him out the same window where the hell is frank going with the garbage father asked he probably couldnt find the trash barrels i said so that frank could make good his escape i mean we dont have a phone that works and we were out of electricity there probably arent any trash barrels either there are so father said the barrels are out at the delivery entrance he stared after frank and shook his head the damn fool must be going all the way to the dump father said jesus that boy is queer i shivered because i knew that father didnt know that frank really was queer when egg was finally out of the bathroom father went to use the facilities and found that franny had beaten him to the door she was drawing another bath for herself and mother told father dont you say a word to her she can take all the baths she wants and they went away arguingwhich they rarely did i told you wed need another bathroom mother said i listened to franny drawing her bath i love you i whispered at the locked door butover the sound of the healing waterit is unlikely that franny ever heard me merry christmas i remember the rest of from halloween to christmas as the length of time it took franny to stop taking three baths a dayand to return to her natural fondness for her own good ripe smell franny always smelled nice to mealthough at times she gave off a very strong smellbut from halloween to christmas franny did not smell nice to herself and so she took so many baths that she did not smell at all in the hotel new hampshire our family took over another bathroom and sharpened our skills at fathers first family business mother took charge of the cranky pride of mrs urick and the plainbutgood production of mrs uricks kitchen mrs urick took charge of max in spite of his being well hidden from her on the fourth floor father handled ronda raynot literally as franny would say ronda had a curious energy she would strip and make up all the beds in a single morning she could serve four tables in the restaurant without botching an order or making anyone wait she could spell father at the bar we were open every evening except monday until eleven and have all the tables set before breakfast at seven but when she retired to her dayroom she seemed either in hibernation or in a deep stupor and even at the peak of her energywhen she was getting everything done on timeshe looked sleepy why do we say its a dayroom iowa bob asked i mean if ronda goes back to hampton beach when does she do it i mean its all right that she lives here but why dont we say she lives herewhy doesnt she say so shes doing a good job father said but shes living in her dayroom mother said whats a dayroom egg asked it seemed everyone wanted to know that franny and i listened to ronda rays room on the intercom for hours but it would be weeks before we learned what a dayroom was at midmornings we would switch on rondas room and franny would say after listening to the breathing for a while asleep or sometimes smoking a cigarette late at night franny and i would listen and i would say perhaps shes reading are you kidding franny would say bored we would listen to the other rooms one at a time or all together checking out max uricks static over which we couldoccasionallyhear maxs radio checking the stockpots in mrs uricks basement kitchen we knew that f was iowa bob and we would tune in the sound of his barbells every once in a whileoften interrupting him with our own comments like come on grandpa a little quicker lets really snap those babies upyoure slowing down you damn kids bob would grunt or at other times he would slap two iron weights together right next to the speakerreceiver box so that franny and i would jump and hold our ringing ears ha coach bob would cry got you little buggers that time didnt i lunatic in f franny would broadcast on the intercom lock your doors lunatic in f ha iowa bob would gruntover the bench presses over the pushups the situps the onearm curls this hotel is for lunatics it was iowa bob who encouraged me to lift weights what happened to franny had somehow inspired me to make myself stronger by thanksgiving i was running six miles a day although the crosscountry course at dairy was only two and a quarter miles bob put me on a heavy dose of bananas and milk and oranges and pasta rice fish lots of greens hot cereal and ice cream the old coach told me i lifted twice a day and in addition to my six miles i ran wind sprints every morning in elliot park at first i just put on weight lay off the bananas father said and the ice cream said mother no no said iowa bob muscles take a little time muscles father said hes fat you look like a cherub dear mother told me you look like a teddy bear franny told me just keep eating said iowa bob with all the lifting and running youre going to see a change in no time before he explodes franny said i was going on fifteen as they say between halloween and christmas i gained twenty pounds i weighed but i was still only five feet six inches tall man junior jones told me if we painted you black and white and put circles around your eyes youd look like a panda one day soon said iowa bob youre going to drop twenty pounds and youll be hard all over franny gave an exaggerated shiver and kicked me under the table hard all over she cried its gross frank said all of it the weight lifting the bananas the panting up and down the stairs in the mornings when it rained i refused to run wind sprints in elliot park i sprinted up and down the stairs of the hotel new hampshire instead max urick said he was going to throw grenades down the stairwell and on a very rainy morning ronda ray stopped me on the secondfloor landing she was wearing one of her nightgowns and looking especially sleepy let me tell you its like listening to lovers go at it in the room next to mine she said her dayroom was nearest the stairwell she liked to call me johno i dont mind the sound of the feet johno she told me its the breathing that gets me she said i dont know if youre dying or trying to come but it curls my hair let me tell you dont listen to any of them said iowa bob youre the first member of this family whos taken a proper interest in his body youve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed bob told me and we have to beef you up before we can strip you down thus it was and so it is i owe my body to iowa boban obsession that has never left meand bananas it would be a while before those extra twenty pounds came off but they would come off and they have stayed off ever since i weigh pounds all the time and i would be seventeen before i finally grew another two inches and stopped for life thats me five feet eight inches tall and pounds and hard all over in a little while i will be forty but even now when i work out i remember the christmas season of now they have such fancy weight machines theres no more sliding the weights on the bar and forgetting to tighten the screws and having the weights slide together and mash your fingers or fall off the end of the bar on your toes but no matter how modern the gymnasium or the equipment it only takes a little light lifting to bring back iowa bobs roomgood old f and the worn oriental rug where his weights were the rug sorrow used to sleep on after weight lifting on that rug bob and i would be covered with the dead dogs hair and after ive been pushing the weight for a while and that longlasting luxurious ache starts creeping over me i can bring to mind every scruffy person and every stain on the canvas that dotted the horsehair mats in the weight room of the dairy school gym where we would always be waiting for junior jones to finish his turn jones took all the weights in the room and put them on one barbell and we would stand there with our empty bars waiting and waiting in his days with the cleveland browns junior jones weighed and could benchpress he was not that strong when he was at the dairy school but he was already strong enough to suggest to me a proper goal for the bench press what you weigh hed ask me do you even know and when id tell him what i weighed hed shake his head and say okay double it and when id doubled itand had put pounds or so on the barbellhed say okay down on the mat on your back there were no benches for doing bench presses at the dairy school so id lie down on the mat on my back and junior jones would pick up the pound barbell and place it gently across my throatthere was just enough room so that the bar depressed my adams apple only slightly i gripped the bar in both hands and i felt my elbows sink down into the mat now lift it over your head said junior jones and hed walk out of the weight room to get a drink of water or go take his shower and id lie there under the barbelltrapped nothing happened when i tried to lift pounds other bigger people would come into the weight room and see me lying there under the pounds and theyd respectfully ask me uh you gonna be through with that after a while yeah just resting id say puffing up like a toad and theyd go away and come back later junior jones would always come back later too hows it going hed ask hed take off twenty pounds then fifty then one hundred try that hed keep saying he kept going away and coming back until i could extricate myself from under the barbell and all pounds of me has never benchpressed pounds of course although twice in my life i have done and i believe that doubling my own weight is not impossible i can get in a marvellous trance under all that weight sometimes when im really pumping i can see the black arm of the law moving through the trees humming their tune and sometimes i can recall the smell of the fifth floor of the dorm where junior jones livedthat hot jungle nightclub in the skyand when i run about the third mile or the fourth or sometimes not until the sixth my own lungs remember vividly the feeling of keeping up with harold swallow and the sight of a slash of frannys hair fallen across her open mouthno sound coming from heras lenny metz knelt on her arms and pinched her head between his heavy runningbacks thighs and chester pulaski on top of her an automaton i sometimes can duplicate his rhythm exactly when i am counting out the pushups seventyfive seventysix seventyseven or the situps one hundred and twentyone one hundred and twentytwo one hundred and twentythree iowa bob simply introduced me to the equipment junior jones added his advice and his own marvellous example father had already taught me how to runand harold swallow how to run harder the technique and routineand even coach bobs dietwere easy the hard part for most people is the discipline as coach bob said youve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed but for me this was also easy because i did it all for franny im not complaining but it was all for frannyand she knew it listen kid she told mefrom halloween to christmas youre going to throw up if you dont stop eating bananas and if you dont stop eating oranges youre going to have a vitamin overdose what the hell are you pushing so hard for youll never be as fast as harold swallow youll never be as big as junior jones kid i can read you like a book franny told me no way is it going to happen again you know and if it doesand you actually are strong enough to save mewhat makes you think youll even be there if it happens again ill be someplace far away from youand ill hope you never know about it anyway i promise but franny took the purpose of my workouts too literally i wanted strength stamina and speedor i desired their illusions i never wanted to feel again the helplessness of another halloween there was still the evidence of a mangled pumpkin or twoone at the curb of pine street and elliot park and another that had been thrown from the bleachers and burst upon the cinder track around the football fieldwhen dairy hosted exeter for the last game of iowa bobs winning season halloween was still in the air although chipper dove lenny metz and chester pulaski were gone the secondstring backfield appeared under the influence of a spell they did everything in slow motion they ran to the holes that junior jones had opened after the holes had closed they lobbed passes into the sky and the passes took forever to come down waiting for one such pass harold swallow was knocked unconscious and iowa bob wouldnt let him play the rest of the long day somebody rang your bell harold coach bob told the speedster i aint got no bell harold swallow complained who rang he asked what somebody at the half exeter led junior jones playing both offence and defence had been involved in a dozen tackles he caused three fumbles and recovered two but the secondstring dairy backfield had coughed up the ball three times and two looping passes had been intercepted in the second half coach bob started junior jones at a runningback position and jones made three consecutive first downs before the exeter defence adjusted the adjustment was simply recognizing that as long as junior jones was in the backfield he would carry the ball so iowa bob put junior back in the line where he had more fun and dairys only score which came late in the fourth quarter was properly credited to jones he broke into the exeter backfield and took the ball away from an exeter running back and ran into the exeter end zone with itand with two or three exeter players clinging to him the extra point was wide to the left and the final score was exeter dairy franny missed juniors touchdown she had come to the game only because of him and she had gone back to being a cheerleader for the exeter game only to yell her lungs out for junior jones but franny got involved in an altercation with another cheerleader and mother had to take her home the other cheerleader was chipper doves hiding place mindy mitchell cock tease mindy mitchell called my sister dumb cunt franny said and whacked mindy with her cheerleaders megaphone it was made of cardboard and it looked like a large shitbrown ice cream cone with a deathgrey d for dairy painted on it d is for death franny always said smack in the boobs another cheerleader told me franny hit mindy mitchell with the megaphone smack in the boobs of course i told junior jones after the game why franny wasnt there to walk with him back to the gym what a good girl she is junior said you tell her wont you and of course i did franny had taken another bath and was all dressed up to help ronda ray wait on tables she was in a pretty good mood despite the rather landslide conclusion to iowa bobs winning season nearly everyone seemed in a good mood it was opening night at the hotel new hampshire mrs urick had outdone herself at plainnessbutgoodness even max was wearing a white shirt and tie and father was absolutely beaming behind the barthe bottles winking in the mirror under his fastmoving elbows and over his shoulders were like a sunrise father had always believed was coming there were eleven couples and seven singles for overnight guests and a divorced man from texas had come all the way to see his son play against exeter the kid had gone out of the game in the first quarter with a sprained ankle but even the texan was in a good mood compared to him the couples and the singles seemed a little shynot knowing each other just having children at the dairy school in commonbut after the kids went back to their dorms the texan got everyone talking to each other in the restaurant and bar isnt it great having kids he asked god its something how they all grow up isnt it everyone agreed the texan said why dont you all pull your chairs over here to my table and have a drink on me and mother stood anxiously in the kitchen doorway with mrs urick and max and father stood poised but confident behind the bar frank ran out of the room franny held my hand and we held our breath iowa bob looked as if he were suppressing an enormous sneeze and one by one the couples and the singles got up from where they were sitting and attempted to pull their chairs over to the texans table mines stuck said a woman from new jersey whod had a little too much to drink she had a sharp squeaky giggle of the mindless quality of hamsters running miles and miles on those little wheels in their cages a man from connecticut turned bright red in the face trying to lift his chair until his wife said its nailed down there are nails that go right into the floor a man from massachusetts knelt on the floor by his chair screws he said those are screwsfour or five of them for each chair the texan knelt down on the floor and stared at his chair everythings screwed down here iowa bob shouted suddenly he had not spoken to anyone since after the game when he told the scout from penn state that junior jones could play anywhere his face was unfamiliarly red and shining as if hed had one more drink than he usually allowed himselfor the sense of his own retirement had finally come to him were all on a big ship said iowa bob were on a big cruise across the world yahoo the texan shouted ill drink to that the woman from new jersey clutched the back of her screweddown chair some of the others sat down were in danger of being swept away at any time coach bob said and ronda ray came swishing back and forth between bob and the dairy parents poised at their wellfastened seats she was passing out the coasters and the cocktail napkins again and flicking a damp towel over the edges of the tables frank peeked in from the door to the hall mother and the uricks seemed paralyzed in the kitchen doorway father had lost none of the glitter he absorbed from the bar mirror but he stared at his father old iowa bob as if he feared that the retired coach was about to say something crazy of course the chairs are screwed down bob said sweeping his arm toward the sky as if he were giving his last halftime speechand this were the game of his life at the hotel new hampshire said iowa bob when the shit hits the fan nobody gets blown away yahoo the texan cried again but everyone else seemed to have stopped breathing just hold on to your seats said coach bob and nothing will ever hurt you here yahoo thank god the chairs are screwed down the bighearted texan cried lets all drink to that the wife of the man from connecticut gave an audible sigh of relief well i guess well just have to speak up if were all going to be friends and talk to each other the texan said yes said the new jersey woman a little breathlessly father was still staring at iowa bob but bob was just finehe turned and winked at frank in the hall doorway and bowed to mother and the uricks and ronda ray came through the room again and gave the old coach a saucy stroke across his cheek and the texan watched ronda as if hed forgotten all about chairsscrewed down or not screwed down who cares if the chairs cant be moved he was thinking to himselfbecause ronda ray had more moves than harold swallow and she was into the spirit of opening night like everyone else yahoo franny whispered in my ear but i sat at the bar watching father make the drinks he looked more concentrated with energy than i had ever seen him before and the gradual volume of voices came over meand always would i will remember that restaurant and bar in that hotel new hampshire as a place that was always so loud with talk even if there werent many people there like the texan said everyone had to speak up if they were going to sit so far apart and even after the hotel new hampshire had been open long enough so that we recognized many of our customers from the town as regularsthose who were at the bar every night until closing time just before which old iowa bob would appear for a nightcap before he turned ineven during those familiar evenings with those familiar few bob could still pull his favourite trick hey pull up your chair hed say to someone and someone would always be fooled for a moment forgetting where he or she was someone would give a little lift a little grunt a little perplexed strain would pass across a face and iowa bob would laugh and cry out nothing moves at the hotel new hampshire were screwed down herefor life that opening night after the bar and restaurant was closed and everyone had gone to bed franny and frank and i met at the switchboard and did a bed check on each of the rooms with the unique squawkbox system we could hear who slept soundly and who snored we could detect who was still up reading and we were surprised and disappointed to discover no couples were talking or making love iowa bob slept like a subway rumbling miles and miles underground mrs urick had left a stockpot simmering and max was playing his usual static the new jersey couple was reading or one of them was the slow turning of pages the short breaths of the nonsleeper the connecticut pair wheezed and whinnied and whooped in their sleep their room was a boiler room of sound massachusetts rhode island pennsylvania new york and maine all gave off the sounds of their various habits of repose then we switched on the texan yahoo i said to franny whoopee she whispered back we expected to hear his cowboy boots striking the floor we expected to hear him drinking out of his hat or sleeping like a horsehis long legs cantering under the covers his big hands strangling the bed but we heard nothing hes dead frank said making franny and me jump jesus frank franny said maybe hes just out of his room hes had a heart attack frank said hes overweight and he drank too much we listened nothing no horse no creaking of boots not a breath franny switched the texans room from receiving to broadcasting yahoo she whispered and then it came to usall three of us even frank seemed to grasp it it took franny about one second to switch to ronda rays dayroom you want to know what a dayroom is frank she asked and on came the unforgettable sound as iowa bob said we are on a big cruise across the world and were in danger of being swept away at any time frank and franny and i gripped our chairs oooooooooo gasped ronda ray hoo hoo hoo the texan cried and later he said i sure appreciate this phooey ronda said no i do i really do he said we heard him peeinglike a horse it went on forever you dont know how hard it is for me to hit that little bitty toilet up on the fourth floor he said its so far down the texan said i have to take aim before i shoot ha cried ronda ray yahoo the texan said disgust ing frank said and went to bed but franny and i stayed up until the only sounds on the squawk box were the sounds of sleep in the morning it was raining and i made a point of holding my breath every time i ran by the secondfloor landingnot wanting to disturb ronda and knowing what she thought of my breathing blue in the face i passed the texan climbing between three and four yahoo i said morning morning he cried staying in shape huh he said good for you your bodys got to last you all your life you know yessir i said and ran up and down some more about the thirtieth trip i was beginning to bring back the black arm of the law and the sight of frannys missing fingernailhow so much pain seemed focused at this bleeding tip of her hand and perhaps distracted her from the rest of her bodywhen ronda ray blocked my way on the secondfloor landing whoa boy she said and i stopped she was wearing one of her nightgowns and if the sun had been shining the light would have shot right through the material and lit her up for mebut it was a gloomy light that morning and the dim stairwell revealed very little of her just her moves and her absorbing odour good morning i said yahoo yahoo to you johno she said i smiled and ran in place youre breathing again ronda told me i was trying to hold my breath for you i panted but i got too tired i can hear your fucking heart she said its good for me i said its not good for me ronda said she put her hand on my chest as if she were reading my heartbeat i stopped running in place i needed to spit johno said ronda ray if you like to breathe this hard and make your heart pound you should come see me the next time it rains and i ran up and down the stairs about forty more times it will probably never rain again i thought i was too tired to eat anything at breakfast just have a banana said iowa bob but i looked away from it and an orange or two bob said i excused myself egg was in the bathroom and he wouldnt let franny in why dont franny and egg take their baths together father asked egg was six and in another year he would probably be too embarrassed to take a bath with franny he was fond of baths now because of all the tub toys he possessed when you used the bathroom after egg had been there the bathtub looked like a childrens beachabandoned during an air raid hippos boats frogmen rubber birds lizards alligators a shark with a windup mouth a seal with windup flippers a ghastly yellow turtleevery conceivable imitation of amphibious life sodden and dripping on the tub floor and crunching on the bathmat underfoot egg i would scream come clean up your shit what shit egg would cry honestly your language mother saidrepeatedly to us all frank had taken to peeing against the trash barrels at the delivery entrance in the morning he claimed he could never get to the bathroom when he wanted to i went upstairs and used the bathroom attached to iowa bobs room and used the weights there too of course what a racket to wake up to old bob complained i never thought this is how retirement would be listening to someone peeing and weightlifting what an alarm clock you like to get up early anyway i told him its not when that i mind said the old coach its how and we slipped through november that waya freak snowfall early in the month it really should have been rain i knew what did it mean that it wasnt rain i wondered thinking of ronda ray and her dayroom it was a dry november egg had a run of ear infections he seemed partially deaf most of the time egg what did you do with my green sweater franny asked what egg said my green sweater franny screamed i dont have a green sweater egg said its my green sweater franny shouted he dressed his bear in it yesterdayi saw it franny told mother and now i cant find it egg wheres your bear mother asked franny doesnt have a bear egg said thats my bear wheres my running hat i asked mother it was on the radiator in the hall last night eggs bear is probably wearing it frank said and hes out doing wind sprints what egg said lilly also had medical problems we had our annual physicals just before thanksgiving and our family doctoran old geezer named dr blaze whose fire franny remarked was almost outdiscovered during a routine check that lilly hadnt grown in a year not a pound not a fraction of an inch she was exactly the same size shed been when she was nine which was not much bigger than shed been at eightor checking the records at seven shes not growing father asked ive said so for years franny said lilly doesnt growshe just is lilly seemed unimpressed by the analysis she shrugged so im small she said everyones always saying so so whats the matter with being small nothing dear mother said you can be as small as you want but you should be growingjust a little shes going to be one of those who shoots up all at once said iowa bob but even he looked doubtful lilly didnt impress you as the sort who would ever shoot up we made her stand back to back with egg at six egg was almost as big as lilly at ten and he certainly looked more solid stand still lilly said to egg stop standing on your toes what said egg stop standing on your toes egg franny said theyre my toes egg said maybe im dying lilly said and everyone shivered especially mother you are not dying father said sternly franks the only one whos dying franny said no said frank i have already died and the living bore me to death stop it mother said i went to lift weights in iowa bobs room every time the weights rolled off the end of the barbell one of them struck the closet door and it opened and out fell something coach bob was terrible about the closet he just threw everything in there loose and one morning when iowa bob dropped a few weights one of them rolled into the closet and out rolled eggs bear the bear was wearing my running hat frannys green sweater a pair of mothers nylons egg i screamed what egg screamed i found your damn bear i yelled its my bear egg yelled back jesus god father said and egg went to dr blaze to have his ears checked again and lilly went to dr blaze to have her size checked again if she hasnt grown in two years franny said i doubt shes grown in the last two days but there were tests that could be run on lilly and old dr blaze was apparently trying to figure out what the tests were you dont eat enough lilly i said dont worry about it but just try to eat a little more i dont like to eat lilly said and it wouldnt rainnot a drop or when it rained it was always in the afternoon or in the evening i would be sitting in algebra ii or in the history of tudor england or in beginning latin and i would hear the rain fall and despair or i would be in bed and it was darkdark in my room and throughout the hotel new hampshire and all of elliot parkand i would hear it raining and raining and id think tomorrow but in the morning the rain would have turned to snow or would have petered out or it would be dry and windy again and i would run my wind sprints in elliot parkfrank passing me en route to the bio lab nuts nuts nuts frank would grumble whos nuts i asked youre nuts he said and frannys always nuts and egg is deaf and lillys weird frank said and youre perfectly normal frank i asked running in place at least i dont play with my body as if i were a rubber band frank said i knew of course that frank played with his bodyplentybut father had already assured me in one of his hearttoheart talks about boys and girls that everyone masturbated and ought to from time to time and so i decided to be friendly to frank and not tease him about his beating off hows it coming with stuffing the dog frank i asked him and he became immediately serious well he said there are a few problems the pose for example is very important im still deciding on the best possible pose he said the actual body has been properly treated but the pose really worries me the pose i said trying to imagine what poses sorrow ever had he seemed to have slept and farted in a variety of casual positions well frank explained there are certain classic poses in taxidermy i see i said theres the cornered pose frank said and he recoiled from me suddenly putting his forepaws up to defend himself and raising his hackles you know he asked god frank i said i dont think that one would be too appropriate to sorrow well its a classic frank said and this one he said turning sideways to me and appearing to sneak along the limb of a tree snarling over his shoulder this is the stalking pose he said i see i said wondering if in this pose poor sorrow would be supplied with a branch to stalk on you know he was a dog frank i said not a cougar frank frowned personally he said i favor the attack pose dont show me i said surprise me dont worry he said you wont recognize him that is precisely what worried methat no one would recognize poor sorrow least of all franny i think frank had forgotten the purpose of what he was doinghe was so carried away with the project of it he was getting three credits of independent study in biology for the task and sorrow had taken on the proportions of a term paper for a course i could not imagine sorrow ever in an attack pose why not just curl sorrow up in a ball the way he used to sleep i said with his tail over his face and his nose in his asshole frank looked disgusted as usual and i was tired of running in place i did a few more wind sprints across elliot park i heard max urick yell at me from his fourthfloor window in the hotel new hampshire you goddamn fool max cried across the frozen ground the dead leaves and startled squirrels in the park off the fire escape at her end of the second floor a pale green nightgown waved in the grey air ronda ray must have been sleeping in the blue one this morning or in the black oneor in the shockingorange one the pale green one flapped at me like a flag and i ran a few more wind sprints when i went to f iowa bob was already up he was doing his neck bridge routine down on his back on the oriental rug a pillow under his head he was into a high neck bridgewith the barbell at about pounds held straight over his head old bob had a neck as big as my thigh good morning i whispered and his eyes rolled back and the barbell tilted and he hadnt screwed the little things that hold the weights on tight enough so that a few of the weights rolled off one end and then the other and coach bob shut his eyes and cringed as the weights dropped on either side of his head and went rolling off everywhere i stopped a couple with my feet but one of them rolled into the closet door and it opened of course and out came a few things a broom a sweat shirt bobs running shoes and a tennis racquet with his sweatband wrapped around the handle jesus god said father from downstairs in our familys kitchen good morning bob said to me do you think ronda ray is attractive i asked him oh boy said coach bob no really i said really he said go ask your father im too old i havent looked at girls since i broke my nosethe last time that must have been in the line at iowa i knew because old bobs nose had quite a number of wrinkles in it he never put his teeth in until breakfast too so that his head in the early mornings looked astonishingly baldlike some strange featherless bird his empty mouth gaping like the lower half of a bill under his bent nose iowa bob had the head of a gargoyle on the body of a lion well do you think shes pretty i asked him i dont think about it he said well think about it now i said not exactly pretty said iowa bob but shes sort of appealing appealing i asked sexy said a voice over bobs intercomfrannys voice of course she had been listening to the squawk boxes at the switchboard as usual damn kids said iowa bob damn it franny i said you should ask me franny said oh boy said iowa bob so it was that i came to tell franny the story of ronda rays apparent offer on the stairwell her interest in my hard breathing and in my beating heartand the plan for a rainy day so do it said franny but why wait for the rain do you think shes a whore i asked franny you mean do i think she charges money franny said that thought had not occurred to mewhore being a word that was used all too loosely at the dairy school money i said how much do you think she charges i dont know if she charges franny said but if i were you thats something id want to find out at the intercom we switched to rondas room and listened to her breathing it was her awakebutjustlyingtherebreathing sound we listened to her a long while as if we would understand from what we heard the possible price attached to her franny finally shrugged im going to take a bath she said and she gave a twirl to the room dial and the intercom listened to the empty rooms a not a sound a nothing a nothing at all ib nothing b max urick and his static franny was leaving the switchboard to go draw her bath and i gave the room dial a twirl to c c c then switching fast to e e and there it was and on to e where there was nothing wait a minute i said what was that franny said three e i think i said try it again she said it was the floor above ronda ray and at the opposite end of the hall from her it was across the hall from iowa bob who was out do it franny said we were scared we had no guests in the hotel new hampshire but there had been one hell of a sound from e it was sunday afternoon frank was in the bio lab and egg and lilly were at the movie matinee ronda ray was just sitting in her room and iowa bob was out mrs urick was in the kitchen and max urick was playing his radio behind the static i put on e and franny and i heard it again oooooooooo went the woman hoo hoo hoo went the man but the texan had gone home long ago and there was no woman staying in e yike yike yike said the woman muff muff muff said the man it was as if the crazy intercom system had made them up franny held my hand tightly i tried to switch it off or move it to another calmer room but franny wouldnt let me eeeep the woman cried nup said the man a lamp fell then the woman laughed and the man began to mutter jesus god my father said another lamp mother said and went on laughing if we were guests father said wed have to pay for it they laughed at this as if father had said the funniest thing in the world turn it off franny said i did its kind of funny isnt it i ventured to say they have to use the hotel franny said just to get away from us i couldnt see what she was thinking god franny said they really love each otherthey really do and i wondered why i had taken such a thing for granted and why it seemed to surprise my sister so much franny dropped my hand and wrapped her arms around herself she hugged herself as if she were trying to wake herself up or get warm what am i going to do she said whats it going to be like what happens next she asked but i could never see as far as franny could see i was not really looking beyond that moment i had even forgotten ronda ray you were going to take a bath i reminded franny who seemed in need of remindingor some other advice what she said a bath i said thats what was going to happen next you were going to take a bath ha franny cried the hell with that she said fuck the bath said franny and went on hugging herself and moving in place as if she were trying to dance with herself i couldnt tell whether she was happy or upset but when i began to fool with herto dance with her and push her and tickle her under the arms she pushed and tickled and danced back and we ran out of the switchboard room and up the stairwell to the secondfloor landing rain rain rain franny started yelling and i became terribly embarrassed ronda ray opened the door to her dayroom and frowned at us were having a rain dance franny told her want to dance with us ronda smiled she had on a shockingorange nightgown there was a magazine in her hand not right now she said rain rain its going to rain franny went off dancing ronda shook her head at mebut nicelyand then shut her door i chased franny outside into elliot park we could see mother and father at the window by the fire escape in e mother had opened the window to call to us go get egg and lilly at the movies she said what are you doing in that room i called back cleaning it said mother rain rain rain franny screamed and we ran downtown to the matinee egg and lilly came out of the movies with junior jones its a kids movie franny said to jones how come you went im just a big kid junior said he held her hand while we all walked home and franny took a stroll with him through the dairy school grounds i continued toward home with egg and lilly does franny love junior jones lilly asked seriously well shelikes him anyway i said he is her friend what said egg it was almost thanksgiving junior was staying with us for thanksgiving vacation because his parents didnt send him enough money to go home and several of the foreign students at the dairy schoolwho lived too far away to go home for thanksgivingwould be joining us for thanksgiving dinner everyone liked having junior around but the foreign students whom nobody knew had been fathers ideaand mother had gone along saying it was the kind of thing thanksgiving was originally for maybe but we children did not care for the invasion guests in the hotel were one thing and there was one of those staying with usa famous finnish doctor supposedly who was there to visit his daughter at the dairy school she was one of the foreigners coming to dinner the others included a japanese whom frank knew from his taxidermy project the japanese had been sworn to secrecy over the stuffing of sorrow frank had told me but the boys english was so bad that he could have blurted out the truth and no one would have understood him then there were two korean girls whose hands were so pretty and small lilly would never take her eyes from themnot for the entire dinner they perhaps kindled an interest in eating that had been absent in lilly before however because they ate lots of things with their little fingersin such a delicate and beautiful way that lilly began to play with her food in this fashion and eventually even ate some egg of course would spend the day shouting what to the tragically incomprehensible japanese boy and junior jones would eat and eat and eatmaking mrs urick nearly detonate with pride now there is an appetite said mrs urick admiringly if i was as big as that id eat like that too max said no you wouldnt said mrs urick you dont have it in you ronda ray did not wear her waitress uniform she sat and ate with the family jumping up to clear the dishes and serve things from the kitchen along with franny and mother and the big blonde girl from finland whose famous father was visiting her the finnish girl was enormous and made swooping movements around the table that made lilly cringe she was a big blueandwhite skisweater sort of girl who kept hugging her father a big blueandwhite skisweater sort of man ho he kept crying at the arrival of new food from the kitchen yahoo franny whispered holy cow said junior jones iowa bob sat next to jones at the table their end of the table was nearest the television above the bar so that they could watch the football game in progress through our dinner if thats a clip ill eat my plate jones would say eat your plate coach bob would say whats a clip the famous finnish doctor would ask only it sounded like wots a clop iowa bob would then offer to demonstrate a clip on ronda who was willing and the korean girls giggled shyly to themselves and the japanese struggledwith his turkey with his butter knife with franks mumbling explanations with eggs shouts of what all the time with apparently everything this is the loudest dinner ive ever eaten franny said what egg cried jesus god said father lilly mother said please eat then youll grow whats that said the famous finnish doctor only it sounded like wots dot he looked at mother and lilly whos not growing he asked oh its nothing mother said its me said lilly ive stopped growing no you havent dear mother said her growth appears to be arrested father said ho arrested the finn said staring at lilly not growing eh he asked her she nodded in her small way the doctor put his hands on her head and peered into her eyes everyone stopped eating except the japanese boy and the korean girls how do you say the doctor asked and then said something unpronounceable to his daughter tape measure she said ho a tape measure the doctor cried max urick ran and got one the doctor measured lilly around her chest around her waist around her wrists and ankles around her shoulders around her head shes all right father said its nothing be quiet mother said the doctor wrote down all the figures ho he said eat up your food dear mother told lilly but lilly was staring at the figures the doctor had written on his napkin how do you say the doctor asked his daughter and said another unpronounceable word this time the daughter drew a blank you dont know her father asked her she shook her head wheres the dictionary he asked her in my dorm she said ho he said go and get it now she said and looked wistfully at her second serving of goose and turkey and stuffing heaped upon her plate go go her father said of course now go ho go he said and the big blueandwhite skisweater girl was gone itshow you saya pathological condition the famous finnish doctor said calmly a pathological condition father said a pathological condition of arrested growth said the doctor its common and theres a variety of causes a pathological condition of arrested growth mother repeated lilly shrugged she imitated the way the korean girls skinned a drumstick when the big blonde outofbreath girl was back she looked stricken to see that ronda ray had cleared her plate she handed the dictionary to her father ho franny whispered across the table to me and i kicked her under the table she kicked me back i kicked back at her and kicked junior jones by mistake ow he said sorry i said ho said the finnish doctor putting his finger on the word dwarfism he exclaimed it was quiet at the table except for the sound of the japanese struggling with his creamed corn are you saying shes a dwarf father asked the doctor ho yes a dwarf the doctor said bullshit said iowa bob thats no dwarfthats a little girl thats a child you moron what is moron the doctor asked his daughter but she wouldnt tell him ronda ray brought out the pies youre no dwarf dear mother whispered to lilly but lilly just shrugged so what if i am she said bravely im a good kid bananas said iowa bob darkly and no one knew if he meant that as a curejust feed her bananasor if he was stating a euphemism for bullshit anyway that was thanksgiving and we careened on toward christmas in that fashion pondering size listening to love giving up baths hoping to properly pose the deadrunning and lifting and waiting for rain it was a morning in early december when franny woke me it was still dark in my room and the snorkling sound of eggs breathing reached me through the open connecting doorway egg was still asleep there was someones softer controlled breathing nearer to me than egg and i was aware of frannys smella smell i hadnt known for a while a rich but never rank smell a little salty a little sweet strong but never syrupy and in the darkness i knew that franny had been cured of taking baths it was overhearing my mother and father that did it i think that made her own smell seem perfectly natural to franny again franny i whispered because i couldnt see her her hand brushed my cheek over here she said she was curled against the wall and the headboard of my bed how she could squeeze in beside me without waking me ill never know i turned toward her and smelled that shed brushed her teeth listen she whispered i heard frannys heartbeat and mine and egg deepsea diving in the adjoining room and something else as soft as frannys breath its rain dummy franny said and wormed a knuckle into my ribs its raining kid she told me its your big day its still dark i said im still sleeping its dawn franny hissed in my ear then she bit my cheek and started tickling me under the covers cut it out franny i said rain rain rain she chanted dont be chicken frank and i have been up for hours she said that frank was at the switchboard playing with the squawkbox system franny dragged me out of bed and made me brush my teeth and put on my track clothes as if i were going to run wind sprints on the stairs as usual then she took me to frank at the switchboard and the two of them counted out the money and told me to hide it in one of my running shoesa thick wad of bills mostly ones and fives how can i run with that in my shoe i asked youre not going to run remember franny said how much is it i asked first find out if she charges franny said then worry if you have enough frank sat at the controls of the switchboard like the crazed operator of some flightcontrol tower at an airport under attack and what are you guys going to do i asked were just looking out for you frank said if you really start embarrassing yourself well call for a fire drill or something oh great i said i dont need this look kid franny said we got the money we have a right to listen oh boy i said youll do just fine franny said dont be nervous what if its all a misunderstanding i asked thats actually what i think it is frank said in which case he said just take the money out of your shoe and run your wind sprints up and down the stairs you pill frank franny said shut up and give us the bed check click click click click iowa bob was a subway again miles underground max urick slept behind his static with a static all his own mrs urick and a stockpot or two were simmering the guest in hthe grim aunt of a student at the dairy school whose name was bowerslept with a snore like the sound of a chisel being sharpened and good morning ronda franny whispered as frank turned on her room oh the delicious sound of ronda ray asleep a sea breeze blowing through silk i felt my armpits start to sweat get the hell up there franny said to me before it stops raining fat chance of that i knew glancing out the portal windows on the stairwell elliot park was submerged the water flooding over the curbs and carving ditches through the playground equipment the grey sky was teeming rain i pondered running a few laps up and down the stairsnot necessarily for old times sake but thinking that this might be the most familiar way to wake ronda up but when i was standing in the hall outside her door my fingers tingled and i was already breathing hardharder than i knew franny told me later she said that she and frank could hear me over the intercom even before ronda got up and opened the door its either johno or a runaway train ronda whispered before she let me in but i couldnt talk i was already out of breath as if id been running the stairs all morning it was dark in her room but i could see that she was wearing the blue one her morning breath was slightly sourbut it smelled nice to me and she smelled nice to me although i would think later that her smell was simply frannys smell taken several stages too far goodness what cold kneesfrom wearing those pants without the legs said ronda ray come in here and get warm i stumbled out of my shorts and she said goodness what cold armsfrom wearing that shirt without the sleeves and i struggled out of that too i got out of my running shoes managing to conceal the wad of money by stuffing it into the toe of one shoe and i wonder if it wasnt making love under the squawkbox system that coloured my feelings about sexual intercourse from that moment on even nowwhen im almost fortyi am inclined to whisper i remember begging ronda ray to whisper too i could have screamed at you to speak up franny told me later it made me so damn madall that silly whispering but there were other things i might have told ronda ray if i hadnt known that franny could hear i never really thought about frank although i would always tend to see himthroughout our lives together and apartas stationed at an intercom somewhere listening in on love i imagine frank as listening in on love with the same displeased expression he wore for most of his tasks a vague but widespread distaste even bordering on disgust youre quick johno youre very quick ronda ray told me please whisper i told her talking in a muffled voice into her wildly colourful hair i owe my sexual nervousness to this initiationa feeling i have never quite escaped that ive got to watch what i say and do somehow or risk betraying franny is it because of ronda ray in that first hotel new hampshire that i always imagine franny is listening in it sounded a little subdued franny told me later but im sure thats okayfor the first time thank you for not coaching from the sidelines i told her did you really think i would she asked me and i apologized but i never knew what franny would or wouldnt do hows it coming with the dog frank i kept asking as christmas bore down upon us all hows it coming with the whispering frank asked i notice its been raining a lot lately or if it didnt really rain a lotthat year just before christmasi admit i took the liberty of interpreting snow as almost rain or even a cloudy morning that threatened to be rain or snow sometime later and it was one of those times very near to christmaswhen id long ago given frank and franny back the wad of money id stuffed in my shoethat ronda ray asked me do you know johno that its customary to tip a waitress and i got the picture i wondered if franny overheard me that morningor overheard the subsequent crinkling of bills i spent my christmas money on ronda ray i bought a little something for mother and father of course we were not big on gifts at christmasthe idea was to give something silly i think i got father an apron to wear behind the bar at the hotel new hampshire it was one of those aprons with a stupid slogan on it i think i got mother a china bear frank always got father a tie and mother a scarf and mother gave the scarves to franny who wore them every which way and father gave the ties back to frank who liked ties for christmas we made something special for iowa bob a framed blownup photograph of junior jones scoring dairys only touchdown against exeter that was not so silly but everything else was franny bought mother a sexy dress that mother would never wear franny was hoping mother would give it to her but mother would never have allowed franny to wear it either she can wear it for father when they visit old three e franny told me in a grouchy mood father bought frank a bus drivers uniform because frank was so fond of uniforms frank would wear it when he played doorman at the hotel new hampshire on those rare occasions when we had more than one overnight guest frank liked to pretend that there was always a doorman at the hotel new hampshire the bus drivers uniform was the good old dairy deathgrey colour the pants and the jacket sleeves were too short for frank and the cap was too large so that frank had an ominous seedyfuneralparlour look to him when he let in the guests welcome to the hotel new hampshire he practiced saying but it always sounded as if he didnt mean it no one knew what to get lillycertainly not a dwarf or an elf or anything little give her food iowa bob suggested a few days before christmas my family never went in for all this organized christmas shopping shit either it was always downtothelastminute with us although iowa bob made a big deal about the tree that he chopped down in elliot park one morning it was too large to stand up in the restaurant of the hotel new hampshire without being cut in half you chopped down that lovely tree in the park mother said well we own the park dont we coach bob said what else do you do with trees he was from iowa after all where you can see for milessometimes without a tree in sight it was on egg that we lavished the most presents because he was the only one of us who was the prime age for christmas that year and egg was very fond of things everyone got him animals and balls and tub toys and outdoor equimentmost of it junk that would be lost or outgrown or broken or under the snow before the winter was over franny and i found a jar of chimpanzee teeth in an antique store in dairy and we bought the teeth for frank he can use them in one of his stuffing experiments franny said i was just as glad that we would not be giving frank the teeth before christmas because i feared that frank might try to use them in his version of sorrow sorrow iowa bob screamed aloud one night just before christmas and we all sat up in our beds with our hair itching sorrow the old man called and we heard him bellow down the deserted thirdfloor hall sorrow he called the old fool is having a bad dream father said thumping upstairs in his bathrobe but i went into franks room and stared at him dont look at me frank said sorrows still down at the lab hes not finished and we all went upstairs to see what was the matter with iowa bob he had seen sorrow he said coach bob had smelled the old dog in his sleep and when he woke up sorrow was standing on the old oriental rughis favouritein bobs room but he looked at me with such menace old bob said he looked like he was going to attack i stared at frank again but frank shrugged father rolled his eyes you were having a nightmare he told his old dad sorrow was in this room coach bob said but he didnt look like sorrow he looked like he wanted to kill me hush hush mother said and father waved us out of the room i heard him start talking to iowa bob that way id heard father talk to egg or to lillyor to any of us children when we were youngerand i realized that father often talked to bob that way as if he thought his father was a child its that old rug mother whispered to us kids its got so much dog hair on it that your grandfather can still smell sorrow in his sleep lilly looked frightened but lilly often looked frightened egg was staggering around as if he were asleep on his feet sorrow is dead isnt he egg asked yes yes franny said what egg said in such a loud voice that lilly jumped okay frank i whispered in the stairwell what pose did you put sorrow in attack he said and i shuddered i thought that the old dog in resentment for the terrible pose hed been condemned to had come back to haunt the hotel new hampshire hed gone to iowa bobs room because bob had sorrows rug lets put sorrows old rug in franks room i suggested at breakfast i dont want that old rug frank said i do want that old rug said coach bob its perfect for my weights that was some dream you had last night franny ventured to say that was no dream franny bob said grimly that was sorrowin the flesh said the old coach and lilly shivered so hard at the word flesh that she dropped her cereal spoon with a clatter what is flesh egg asked look frank i said to frank out in frozen elliot parkthe day before christmas i think you better let sorrow stay down at the lab frank looked ready to attack at this suggestion hes all ready frank said and hes coming home tonight do me a favour and dont giftwrap him okay i said giftwrap him frank said with only mild disgust do you think im crazy i didnt answer him and he said look dont you understand whats going on ive done such a good job with sorrow that grandfather has had a premonition that sorrows come home frank said it would always amaze me how frank could make pure idiocy sound logical and so we came to the night before christmas not a creature was stirring as they say just a stockpot or two max uricks everpresent static ronda ray was in her room and there was a turk in ba turkish diplomat visiting his son at the dairy school he was the only student at the dairy school who had not gone home or to someones home for christmas all the presents were hidden with care it was our family tradition to bring everything out and put it under the bare tree on christmas morning mother and father we knew had hidden all our presents in ea room they visited happily and often iowa bob had stored his gifts in one of the tiny fourthfloor bathrooms which were not called fit for dwarfs not anymorenot since the dubious diagnosis of lillys possible affliction franny showed me all the presents she gotincluding modelling for me the sexy dress she bought for mother that prompted me to show her the nightgown i bought for ronda ray and franny promptly modelled it when i saw it on her i knew i should have gotten it for franny it was snowwhite a colour not available in rondas collection you should have gotten this for me franny said i love it but i would never catch on to what i should do about franny in time as franny said ill always be a year ahead of you kid lilly hid her gifts in a small box all her gifts were small egg didnt get anyone any gifts but he searched endlessly through the hotel new hampshire for all the gifts people had gotten for him and frank hid sorrow in coach bobs closet why i would ask him and ask him later it was just for one night frank said and i knew that franny would never look there on christmas eve everyone went to bed early and no one sleptanother family tradition we heard the ice groaning under the snow in elliot park there were times when elliot park could creak like a coffin changing temperaturebeing lowered into the ground why is it that even the christmas of felt a little like halloween there was even a dog barking late at night and although the dog could not have been sorrow all of us who were awake thought of iowa bobs dreamor his premonition as frank called it and then it was christmas morningclear windy and coldand i ran my forty or fifty wind sprints across elliot park naked i was no longer as chubby as i looked with my running clothes onas ronda ray was always telling me some of the bananas were turning hard and christmas morning or no christmas morning a routine is a routine i joined coach bob for a little weight lifting before the family gathered for christmas breakfast you do your curls while i do my neck bridges iowa bob told me yes grandfather i said and i did as i was told feet to feet on sorrows old rug we did our situps head to head our pushups there was only one long barbell and the two short dumbbells for the onearm curls we traded the weights back and forthit was a kind of wordless morning prayer for us your upper arms your chest your neckthat all looks pretty good grandpa bob told me but your forearms could stand some work and put maybe a flat twentyfivepounder on your chest when you do your situpsyoure doing them too easily and bend your knees yup i said out of breath in my ronda ray way bob put the long barbell up he cleaned it neatly about ten times then he pumped a few standing presses with itit seemed to me he had about or on the bar when the weights slid off one end and i got out of their way and then about fifty or seventyfive pounds came sliding off the other end of the bar and old iowa bob cried shit goddamn thing the weights rolled across the room father downstairs hollered up at us jesus god you crazy weight lifters he yelled tighten those screws and one of the weights rolled into the door of bobs closet and the door opened of course and out came the tennis racquet bobs laundry bag a vacuum cleaner hose a squash ball and sorrowstuffed i tried to say something although the dog alarmed me nearly as much as it must have alarmed iowa bob at least i knew what it was it was sorrow in franks attack pose it was a pretty good attack pose all right and a better job of stuffing a black labrador retriever than i would have thought frank capable of sorrow was screwed down to a pine boardas coach bob would have said everything is screwed down in the hotel new hampshire in the hotel new hampshire were screwed down for life the fierce dog slid rather gracefully out of the closet landing firmly on all four feet and looking ready to spring his black fur was so glossy it must have been recently oiled and his yellow eyes caught the bright morning lightand the light caught the gleam in his old yellow teeth which frank had polished white for the occasion the dogs hackles were drawn back farther than i ever saw old sorrows hackles drawn back when sorrow had been alive and a shiny sort of spittlevery convincing stuffseemed to brighten the dead dogs gums his black nose looked wet and healthy and i could almost smell his fetid halitosis reaching out to iowa bob and me but this sorrow looked much too serious to fart this sorrow meant business and before i could get my breath back and tell my grandfather that it was only a christmas present for frannythat it was only one of franks awful projects from down at the bio labthe old coach slung his barbell at the savage attack dog and threw his wonderful linemans body back against me to protect me no doubt that must have been what he meant to do holy cow said iowa bob in a strangely small voice and the weights clattered on all sides of sorrow the snarling dog was unfazed he remained poised for the kill and iowa bob who was past the end of his last season dropped dead in my arms jesus god are you throwing those weights around on purpose father screamed upstairs to us jesus god father cried take a day off will you its christmas for christs sake merry christmas merry christmas merry fucking christmas shouted franny from downstairs merry christmas said lilly and eggand even frank merry christmas mother called softly and was it ronda ray i heard chiming in and the uricksalready setting up for christmas breakfast in the hotel new hampshire and i heard something unpronounceableit might have been the turk in b in my arms which i realized had grown very strong i held the former big ten star who was as heavy and meaningful to me as our family bear and i stared into the short distance that separated us from sorrow father hears from freud coach bobs christmas presentthe framed blownup photograph of junior jones scoring dairys only touchdown against exeterwas given to franny who also inherited f iowa bobs old room franny wanted nothing to do with franks version of sorrow which egg dragged to his room he hid the stuffed dog under his bed where mother discovered it with a shriek several days after christmas i know that frank would have liked to have sorrow backfor further experimenting with the facial expression or the posebut frank had kept to himself and to his room since scaring his grandfather to death iowa bob was sixtyeight when he died but the old lineman was in firstrate shape without a fright of sorrows magnitude he might have lived for another decade our family made every effort not to let the responsibility for the accident weigh too heavily on frank nothing weighs too heavily on frank franny said but even franny tried to cheer him up stuffing sorrow was a sweet idea frank franny told him but you must realize not everybody has your taste what she might have told him was that taxidermy like sex is a very personal subject the manner in which we impose it on others should be discreet franks guilt if guilt was what he felt was apparent only by his exaggerated absence frank was always more absent than the rest of us but his usual silence grew even quieter even so franny and i felt that only franks sulking prevented him from asking for sorrow mother against eggs protests instructed max urick to dispose of sorrow which max accomplished by merely upending the paralyzed beast in one of the trash barrels at the delivery entrance and one rainy morning from ronda rays room i was startled to see the soggy tail and rump of sorrow protruding from the mouth of the barrel i could imagine the rubbish man with his department of sanitation truck being similarly startledthinking suddenly to himself my god when theyre through with their pets at the hotel new hampshire they just throw them out with the garbage come back to bed johno said ronda ray but i just stared through the rain which was turning to snowfalling over the row of barrels crammed with christmas wrappings ribbons and tinsel the bottles and cartons and cans of the restaurant business the bright and dull scraps of food of interest to the birds and dogs and one dead dog of interest to no one well almost no one it would have broken franks heart to see sorrow come to this degrading end and i looked out at the snow thickening over elliot park and saw another member of my family who was still keenly interested in sorrow i saw egg in his ski parka and ski hat dragging his sled to the delivery entrance he moved quickly over the slick coating of snow his sled grating on the driveway which was still bare and dotted with puddles egg knew where he was goinga quick look into the basement windows and he was safely past mrs uricks scrutiny a glance to the fourth floor but max was not guarding the trash barrels our familys rooms didnt overlook the delivery entrance and egg knew that left only ronda ray who could see him but she was in bed and when egg glanced up at her window i ducked out of sight if youd rather be out running johno ronda groaned go run and when i looked out the window again egg was gone sorrow had gone with him the efforts to bring sorrow back from the grave were not over i knew i could only guess where the beast might reappear when franny moved to iowa bobs room mother rearranged the rest of us she put egg and me together where franny and lilly had been and she gave lilly my old room and eggs adjoining roomas if illogically lillys socalled dwarfism needed to be accommodated not only with privacy but with a large space i complained but father said i would have a maturing influence on egg franks secret quarters were unchanged and the barbells still resided in iowa bobs room which gave me more reason to visit franny who liked to watch me lift so when i lifted now i was not thinking just of frannymy only audiencebut with a little extra effort i could bring back coach bob i was lifting for both of us i suppose that by salvaging sorrow from the inevitable journey to the dump egg might have been resurrecting iowa bob in the only way egg could do it what maturing influence i was expected to have on egg remained a mystery to me though it was tolerable sharing a room with him his clothes bothered me most of all or not his clothes but his habits with clothes egg didnt dress himself he costumed himself he changed costumes several times a day the discarded clothing always dominating a central area of our room and accumulating there after several days before mother would rampage through the room and ask me if i couldnt urge egg to be more tidy perhaps father meant tidying when he said maturing for my first week of sharing a room with egg i was less concerned with his messiness than i was anxious to discover where he had hidden sorrow i did not want to be startled by that shape of death again although i think the shape of death is always startling to usit is meant to be startlingand not even proper anticipation can prepare us enough for it this at least was true of egg and sorrow the night before new years eve with iowa bob not dead a week and sorrow missing from the garbage for only two days i whispered across the darkness of our room to egg i knew he wasnt asleep okay egg i whispered where is he but it would always be a mistake to whisper to egg what egg said mother and dr blaze said that eggs hearing was improving although father referred to eggs deafness not to his hearing and concluded that dr blaze must be deaf himself to think of eggs condition as improving it was rather like dr blazes opinion of lillys dwarfism that it was improving too because lilly had grown a little but everyone else had grown much more and the impression therefore was that lilly was growing smaller egg i said more loudly where is sorrow sorrow is dead egg said i know hes dead damn it i said but where egg where is sorrow sorrow is with grandpa bob said egg who was right about that of course and i knew there would be no cajoling the whereabouts of the stuffed terror out of egg tomorrow is new years eve i said who egg said new years eve i said were having a party where he asked here i said in the hotel new hampshire what room he said the main room i said the big room the restaurant dummy were not having a party in this room egg said with eggs costumes all around there was hardly room for a party in our room i knew but i let this observation pass i was almost asleep when egg spoke again how would you dry something thats wet egg asked and i thought to myself of the likely condition of sorrow after god knows how many hours in the open trash barrel in the rain and snow what is it thats wet egg i asked hair he said how would you dry hair your hair egg anybodys hair egg said lots of hair more hair than mine well with a hair dryer i suppose i said that thing franny has egg asked mother has one too i told him yeah he said but frannys is bigger i think its hotter too got a lot of hair to dry huh i said what egg said but it wasnt worth repeating an aspect of eggs deafness was eggs ability to choose when not to hear in the morning i watched him take off his pajamas under which he woreand had slept ina full suit of clothes its good to be readyright egg i asked ready for what he asked there isnt any school todayits still vacation then whyd you wear your clothes to bed i asked him but he let that pass he was rummaging through various piles of costumes what are you looking for i asked him youre already dressed but whenever egg detected that the tone i took toward him was a teasing one he ignored me see you at the party he said egg loved the hotel new hampshire perhaps he loved it even more than father because father loved most of all the idea of it in fact father seemed daily more and more unsure of the actual success of his venture egg loved all the rooms the stairwells the great unoccupied emptiness of the former allgirls school father knew we were unoccupied a little too much of the time but that was fine with egg guests would occasionally bring odd things they had found in their rooms to breakfast the room was very clean they would begin but someone must have left this this something the right rubber arm of a cowboy the wrinkled webbed foot of a dried toad a playing card with a face drawn over the face of the jack of diamonds the five of clubs with the word yuck written across it a small sock with six marbles in it a costume change eggs policemans badge pinned to his baseball uniform hanging in the closet of g on the day of new years eve the weather was that thawing kinda mist spreading over elliot park and yesterdays snow already melting and revealing the grey snow of a week ago where were you this morning johno ronda ray asked me as we were fussing with the restaurant for the new years eve party it wasnt raining i pointed out a weak excuse i knewand she knew i was hardly being unfaithful to rondathere was no one to be unfaithful withbut i dreamed of an imaginary someone else about frannys age all the time i had even asked franny for a date with one of her friends someone she would recommendalthough franny was in the habit of saying that her friends were too old for me now by which she meant that they were sixteen no weight lifting this morning franny asked me arent you afraid youll get out of shape im in training for the party i said for the party we expected that three or four dairy students who were cutting their christmas break short would be spending the night in the hotel among them junior jones who was frannys date and a sister of junior jones who was not a dairy student junior was bringing her with him for mei was terrified that junior joness sister was going to be as big as junior jones and i was also eager to know if this was the sister whod been raped as harold swallow had told me it seemed unjustly important to know was i to have a large raped girl for a date or a large unraped girlfor either way i was sure she would have to be huge dont be nervous franny said to me we dismantled the christmas tree which brought tears to my fathers eyes because it had been iowa bobs tree mother had to leave the room the funeral had seemed so subdued to us childrenit was the first funeral we had ever seen being too young to remember what was done about latin emeritus and my mothers mother the bear called state omaine had not been given a funeral i think that considering the noise attached to the death of iowa bob we expected the funeral to be louder tooat least the sound of barbells falling i said to franny be serious she said she seemed to think she was growing much older than me and i was afraid she was right is this the sister who was raped i asked franny suddenly i mean which sister is junior bringing by frannys look at me i guessed that this question also put years between us he only has one sister franny said looking straight at me does it matter to you that she was raped of course i didnt know what to say that it did that one would not discuss rape with someone whod been raped as opposed to launching into the subject right away with someone who hadnt that one would look for the lasting scars in the personality or not look for them that one would assume lasting scars in the personality and speak to the person as to an invalid and how did one speak to an invalid that it didnt matter but it did i knew why too i was fourteen in my inexpert years and i would always be inexpert on the subject of rape i imagined that one would touch a person whod been raped a little differently or a little less or that one would not touch her at all i said that to franny finally and she stared at me youre wrong she said but it was the way she said to frank youre an asshole and i felt that i would probably always be fourteen too where is egg father bellowed egg egg never does any work frank complained sweeping the dead needles from the christmas tree aimlessly about the restaurant egg is a little boy frank franny said egg could be more mature than he is father said and i who was to be the maturing influence i knew very well why egg was out of earshot he was in some empty room of the hotel new hampshire contemplating the terrible mass of wet black labrador retriever which was sorrow when the last of christmas had been swept and dragged out of the hotel new hampshire we considered what decorations would be appropriate for new years eve no one feels very much like new years eve franny said lets not decorate anything at all a party is a party said father gamely although we suspected he felt the least like a party of us all everyone knew whose idea a new years eve party had been iowa bobs there wont be anybody coming anyway frank said well speak for yourself frank franny said i have some friends coming there could be a hundred people here and youd still stay in your room frank i said go eat another banana frank said go take a runto the moon well i like having a party lilly said and everyone looked at herbecause of course we had not seen her until she spoke she was getting so small lilly was almost eleven but she now seemed substantially smaller than egg she barely came up to my waist and she weighed less than forty pounds so we all rallied to the occasion as long as lilly was looking forward to a party we would try to get in the mood so how should we decorate the restaurant lilly frank asked her he had a way of bending over when he spoke to lilly as if he were addressing a baby in a carriage and what he had to say were pure gibberish lets not decorate anything at all lilly said lets just have a good time we all stood still facing this prospect as we might face a death sentence but mother said thats a wonderful idea im going to call the matsons the matsons father said and the foxes and maybe the calders mother said not the matsons father said and the calders already asked us to a partythey have a new years party every year well well just have a few friends mother said well there will be the usual customers too father said but he didnt look too sure and we looked away from him the usual customers were such a small cluster of cronies for the most part they were the drinking friends of coach bob we wondered if theyd ever show up againand on new years eve we doubted it mrs urick didnt know how much food to have on hand max wondered if the entire parking lot should be plowed or just the usual few spaces ronda ray seemed in the spirit for a new years party of her own she had a dress she wanted to wearshed told me all about it i already knew the dress it was the sexy dress franny had bought mother for christmas mother had given it to ronda having seen franny model it i was anxious about how ronda would ever cram herself into it mother had arranged to have a live band an almost live band franny said because shed heard the band before they played to the hampton beach crowd in the summers but during the regular year most of them were still in high school the electric guitarist was a high school hood named sleazy wales his mother was the lead singer and acoustic guitarista strapping loud woman named doris whom ronda ray fervently called a slut the band was named either after doris or after the mild hurricane of some years beforewhich was also named doris the band was called naturally hurricane doris and it featured sleazy wales and his mother and two of sleazys high school pals acoustic bass and drums i think that the boys worked in the same auto garage after school because the bands uniforms consisted of garage mechanics clotheson the boyswith their names sewn on the breast alongside the gulf insignia their names were danny jake sleazyand all of them were gulf doris wore whatever she wanted todresses that even ronda ray would have thought immodest frank of course called hurricane doris disgusting the band favoured elvis presley numberswith lots of slow stuff if theres a lot of grownups in the crowd doris told my mother over the phone and the faster shit if the crowdsyoung oh boy franny said i cant wait to hear what junior thinks of hurricane doris and i dropped several glass ashtrays that i was supposed to be distributing to the tables because i couldnt wait to see what junior joness sister would think of me how old is she i asked franny if youre lucky kid franny teased me shell be about twelve frank had returned the mop and broom to the firstfloor utility closet and had discovered in the closet a clue to the existence of sorrow it was the board the cuttosize plank upon which sorrow had been mounted in his attack pose there were four neat screw holes in the board and the trace of the dogs paw prints hed been screwed by his paws to the plank egg frank screamed you little thief egg so egg had removed sorrow from his stand and was perhaps at this very moment refashioning sorrows pose into something closer to his own version of our old pet its a good thing egg never got hold of state omaine lilly said its a good thing frank didnt get hold of state omaine franny noted theres not going to be much room for dancing said ronda ray wearily we cant move any of the chairs out of the way well dance around the chairs father cried optimistically screwed down for life franny murmured but father heard her and he wasnt ready to hear any of iowa bobs old lines played back to himnot just yet he looked very hurt then he looked away i remember new years eve of as a time when everyone did a lot of looking away oh damn franny whispered to me and lookedactuallyashamed ronda ray gave franny a quick hug you just got a grow up a little honey she said to her you got to find out grownups dont bounce back as fast as kids we could hear frank wailing for egg in the stairwell frank didnt bounce back so well either i thought but frank in a way was never a kid shut up your noise yelled max urickfrom the fourth floor come down and help us with the partyboth of you father cried kids max bellowed what does he know about kids mrs urick grumbled then harold swallow called from detroit he wasnt coming back to dairy early after all he was going to miss the party he said that he just remembered that new years eve depressed him and he always ended up watching the whole thing on television i might as well do that in detroit he said i dont have to take no airplane to boston and ride in no car with junior jones and a whole crowd just to stay in a funny hotel to watch new years eve on tv we wont turn on the tv i told him it would conflict with the band anyway well he said then id miss it i better stay in detroit there was never very much logic to the conversations one had with harold swallow i never knew what to say next to him sorry about bob harold said and i thanked him and reported to the others nasty isnt coming either franny said nasty was the boston boyfriend of frannys friend ernestine tuck of greenwich connecticut ernestine was called bitty by everyone but franny and junior jones apparently her mother had called her a little bitty one terrible night and the name as they say stuck ernestine didnt seem to mind it and she tolerated junior joness version of her name too she had wondrous breasts and junior called her titsie tuck and franny did too bitty tuck idolized franny so much that she would endure any insult from her and everyone in the world i used to think would simply have to accept insults from junior jones bitty tuck was rich and pretty and eighteen and not a bad personshe was just so easy to teaseand she was coming for new years eve because she was what franny called a party girl and frannys only female friend at the dairy school at eighteen bitty was very sophisticatedin frannys opinion the plan franny explained to me was that junior jones and his sister were driving their own car from philadelphia they would pick up titsie tuck in greenwich en route and then pick up titsies boyfriend peter nasty raskin in boston but now franny said nasty was not allowed to comebecause he had insulted an aunt at a family wedding titsie had decided to come with junior and his sister anyway then there will be an extra girlfor frank father said in his wellmeaning way and several shapes of death passed above us all in silence just so there isnt a girl for me said egg egg frank yelled making us all jump none of us knew that egg was with us or when hed arrived but he had changed his costume and was pretending to straighten up things in a busy fashion about the restaurant as if hed been working right along with the rest of us all day i want to talk to you egg frank said what said egg dont shout at egg lilly said and drew egg aside in her irritating motherly fashion we noticed that lilly had taken an interest in mothering egg as soon as egg grew bigger than she was frank followed them into a corner of the room hissing at egg like a barrel of snakes i know youve got him egg frank was hissing what egg said frank didnt dare say sorrow with father in the restaurant and none of us would allow egg to be bullied egg was safe and he knew it egg was wearing his infantry combat uniform franny had told me that she thought frank probably wished he had a uniform like that and that it made frank mad every time egg wore a uniformand egg had several if franks love of uniforms seemed odd it seemed natural enough for egg to love them no doubt frank resented this then i asked franny how junior joness sister was going to get back to philadelphia once new years was over and the dairy school started again franny looked puzzled and i explained that i didnt think junior was going to drive his sister all the way back to philadelphia and then come right back to dairy for school and he wouldnt be allowed to keep a car at dairy that was against school rules shell drive herself back i suppose franny said i mean its her caror i think it is then it dawned on me that junior joness sister since they were bringing her car had to be old enough to drive shes got to be at least sixteen i said to franny dont be frightened franny said how old do you guess ronda is she whispered but the thought of an older girl was intimidating enough without imagining a huge older girl a bigger older onceraped girl its reasonable to assume that shell be black too franny said to me or didnt that occur to you either that doesnt bother me i said oh everything bothers you franny said titsie tuck is eighteen and she bothers the hell out of you and shell be here too that was true titsie tuck referred to me publicly as cutein her rich rather condescending way but i dont mean that she was niceshe just never regarded me at all unless it was to joke with me she was intimidating to me in the way someone who never remembers your name can be intimidating in this world franny once observed just when youre trying to think of yourself as memorable there is always someone who forgets that theyve met you it was an upanddown day at the hotel new hampshire getting ready for new years eve i remember that something more pronounced than even the usual weave of silliness and sadness seemed to hang over us all as if wed be conscious from time to time of hardly mourning for iowa bob at alland conscious at other times that our most necessary responsibility not just in spite of but because of iowa bob was to have fun it was perhaps our first test of a dictum passed down to my father from old iowa bob himself it was a dictum father preached to us over and over again it was so familiar to us we wouldnt dream of not behaving as if we believed it although we probably never knewuntil much laterwhether we believed it or not the dictum was connected with iowa bobs theory that we were all on a big shipon a big cruise across the world and in spite of the danger of being swept away at any time or perhaps because of the danger we were not allowed to be depressed or unhappy the way the world worked was not cause for some sort of blanket cynicism or sophomoric despair according to my father and iowa bob the way the world workedwhich was badlywas just a strong incentive to live purposefully and to be determined about living well happy fatalism frank would speak of their philosophy later frank as a troubled youth was not a believer and one night when we were watching a wretched melodrama on the tv above the bar in the hotel new hampshire my mother said i dont want to see the end of this i like happy endings and father said there are no happy endings right cried iowa boban odd mixture of exuberance and stoicism in his cracked voice death is horrible final and frequently premature coach bob declared so what my father said right cried iowa bob thats the point so what thus the family maxim was that an unhappy ending did not undermine a rich and energetic life this was based on the belief that there were no happy endings mother resisted this and frank was morose about it and franny and i were probably believers of this religionor if at times we doubted iowa bob the world would always come up with something that seemed to prove the old lineman right we never knew what lillys religion was no doubt it was a small idea kept to herself and egg would be the retriever of sorrow in more than one sense retrieving sorrow is a kind of religion too the board that frank had found with the paw prints on it and the sorrow holes in it looking like the abandoned crucifix of a fourfooted christ seemed ominous to me i talked franny into a bed check although she said frank and i were nutsegg she said had probably wanted to keep the board and had thrown the dog away of course the intercom revealed nothing since sorrowwhether he was thrown away or hiddenwas no longer breathing there was a strange blowing sound like the rushing of air from aat the opposite end of the hall from max uricks staticbut franny said there was probably a window open ronda ray had made up that bed for bitty tuck and the room had probably been stuffy why are we putting bitty way up on the fourth floor i asked because mother thought shed be here with nasty franny said and that waystuck up on the fourth floorthey could have some privacy from you kids from us kids you mean i said wheres junior sleeping not with me franny said crisply junior and sabrina have their own rooms on the second floor sabree na i said thats it franny said sabrina jones i thought and experienced a catacylsmic closing of the throat seventeen and sixfootsix i imagined goes about stripped and toweldriedand she can benchpress pounds theyre here lilly came and told us at the switchboard in her wispy voice the sight of the size of junior jones always took lillys breath away how big is she i asked lilly but of course everyone looked enormous to lilly i would have to see sabrina jones for myself frank indulging in a moment of overt selfconsciousness had dressed himself in his bus drivers uniform and was playing doorman at the hotel new hampshire he was carrying bitty tucks luggage into the lobby bitty tuck was the kind of girl who had luggage she wore a sort of mans suit but it had been tailored for a woman and even a sort of mans dress shirt with a buttondown collar and tie and everythingexcept the breasts which were extraordinary as junior jones had observed they were impossible to conceal even in the most mannish costume she flounced into the lobby behind frank who was sweating with her luggage hi johnjohn she said hi titsie i said not meaning to let her nickname slip out because only junior and franny could call her titsie and not receive her scorn she looked at me scornfully and rushed past me embracing franny with the strange shrieks her kind of girl seems to have been born making the bags go to a frank i said jesus not now they dont frank said collapsing with bittys luggage in the lobby it will take a team effort he said maybe some of you fools will get excited enough to actually have fun doing it during the party junior jones loomed in the lobby looking capable of hurling bitty tucks luggage up four floorsincluding frank with the bags i thought hey the fun is here said junior jones heres the fun man i tried to see past him or around him to the doorway for a terrified second i actually looked above him as if his sister sabrina might be towering there hey sabrina said junior jones heres your weight lifter in the doorway was a slender negress about my height her high floppybrimmed hat perhaps made her appear a little tallerand she wore heels her suita womans suitwas every ounce as fashionable as bitty tucks attire she wore a creamcoloured silky blouse with a wide collar and it was open down her long throat to just a glimpse of the red lace of her bra she wore rings on every finger and bracelets and she was a wondrous bitterchocolate color with wide bright eyes and a wide mouth smiling full of strange but handsome teeth she smelled so nice and from so far away that even bitty tucks shrieks were diminished by the scent of sabrina jones she was i guessed about twentyeight or thirty and she looked a little surprised to be introduced to me junior jones who was awfully quick for his size moved far away from us fast youre the weight lifter said sabrina jones im only fifteen years old i lied i would be fifteen very soon after all holy cow said sabrina jones she was so pretty i couldnt look at her junior she yelled but junior jones was hiding from herall the many pounds of him he had obviously needed a ride from philadelphia and not wanting to disappoint franny by not showing up for new years eve he had acquired his older sister and his sisters car under the pretense of getting her a date with me he told me franny had an older brother sabrina said sorrowfully i suppose junior might have been thinking of frank sabrina jones was a secretary in a law firm in philadelphia she was twentynine fifteen she whistled through her teeth which were not the bright white of her brothers gleaming mouth sabrinas teeth were perfectly sized and very straight but they had a pearly oyster hue to them they were not unattractive teeth but they were the only visibly flawed part of her in my insecurity i needed to notice them i felt cloddishfull of bananas as frank would say theres going to be a live band i said and regretted saying so immediately hot dog said sabrina jones but she was nice she smiled do you dance she asked no i admitted oh well she said she was really trying to be a good sport you do lift weights she asked not as much as junior i said id like to drop a few weights on juniors head she said frank lurched through the lobby struggling with a trunk full of junior joness winter clothes he couldnt seem to navigate successfully past bitty tucks luggage at the foot of the stairs and so he dropped the trunk therestartling lilly who was sitting on the bottom step watching sabrina jones this is my sister lilly i said to sabrina and that was frank i said pointing to franks back as he slunk away we could hear franny and bitty tuck shrieking somewhere and i knew that junior jones would be speaking to my fatheroffering his condolences for coach bob hello lilly sabrina said im a dwarf lilly said im not ever going to grow any bigger this information must have seemed to sabrina jones to fit rather perfectly with her disappointment at discovering my age sabrina did not appear shocked well thats interesting she said to lilly you are going to grow lilly i said at least youre going to grow a little and youre not a dwarf lilly shrugged i dont mind she said a figure passed swiftly across the landing at the turn of the staircasehe had a tomahawk he wore war paint and little else a black loincloth with coloured beads decorating the hips that was egg i said watching the dazzled eyes of sabrina jones her pretty mouth partedas if attempting speech that was a little indian boy she said whys he called egg i know why lilly volunteered sitting on the stairs she raised her handas if she were in class waiting to be called on i was glad she was there i never liked explaining eggs name egg had been egg from the beginning dating from mothers pregnancy when franny had asked her what the name of the new baby was going to be right now its just an egg frank had said darklyhis wisdom of biology was always shocking to us all and so as mother grew and grew the egg was called egg with increasing conviction mother and father were hoping for a third girl only because it was going to be an april baby and they both liked the name april for a girl they were undecided about a boys name father not caring for his own name win and motherdespite her fondness for iowa bobnot really liking the idea of a robert jr by the time it was clear that the egg was a boy he wasin our familyalready an egg and the name as they say stuck egg had no other name he began as an egg and hes still an egg lilly explained to sabrina jones holy cow sabrina said and i wished that something powerfully distracting would happen in the hotel new hampshire to distract me from my embarrassment at how it always struck me our family must appear to outsiders you see franny would explain years later we arent eccentric were not bizarre to each other franny would say were as common as rain and she was right to each other we were as normal and nice as the smell of bread we were just a family in a family even exaggerations make perfect sense they are always logical exaggerations nothing more but my embarrassment with sabrina jones made me embarrassed for us all my embarrassment even included people beyond my family i was embarrassed for harold swallow every time i spoke with him i was always afraid someone would make fun of him and hurt his feelings and on new years eve at the hotel new hampshire i was embarrassed for ronda ray wearing the dress franny bought for mother i was even embarrassed for the almost live band the terrible rock group called hurricane doris i recognized sleazy wales as a punk who had threatened me years ago in the saturday matinee he had wadded up a ball of bread grey with the oil and grime from his automechanic life hed stuck the wad of bread under my nose wanna eat that kid he asked no thanks i said frank leaped up and ran into the aisle but sleazy wales gripped my arm and held me in my seat dont move he said i promised i wouldnt and he took a long nail out of his pocket and drove it through the wad of bread then he made a fist around the bread with the nail protruding savagely between his middle and ring fingers wanna get your fucking eyes poked out he asked me no thanks i said then get the fuck out of here he said even then i was embarrassed for him i went to find frankwho whenever he was frightened at the movies always stood by the water cooler frank frequently embarrassed me too at the hotel new hampshire on new years eve saw at once that sleazy wales didnt recognize me too many miles too much weight lifting too many bananas had come between us if he threatened me with bread and nails again i could simply hug him to death he didnt seem to have grown since the saturday matinee scrawny and greyskinned his whole face the tone of a dirty ashtray he hunched his shoulders forward in his gulf shirt and tried to walk as if each arm weighed one hundred pounds i estimated that his whole body plus wrenches and a few other heavy tools couldnt weigh more than could have benchpressed him an easy halfdozen times hurricane doris didnt seem especially disappointed at the absence of a crowd and perhaps the boys were even grateful to have fewer people staring at them as they dragged their bright cheap equipment from outlet to outlet plugging in the first thing i heard doris wales say was move the mike back jake and dont be an asshole the acoustic bass called jake another greasy splinter in a gulf shirt cringed over the microphone as if he lived in terror of electrical shockand of being an asshole sleazy wales gave the other boy in the band a lovable punch in the kidneys a fat drummer named danny the boy absorbed the punch with dignitybut with obvious pain doris wales was a woman with strawblonde hair whose body appeared to have been dipped in corn oil then she must have put her dress on wet the dress grabbed at all her parts and plunged and sagged over the gaps in her body a lovers line of hickeys or love biteslovesucks franny called themdotted doriss chest and throat like a violent rash the welts were like wounds from a whip she wore plumcoloured lipstick some of which was on her teeth and she said to sabrina jones and me you want hotdancin music or slowneckin music or both both said sabrina jones without missing a beat but i felt certain that if the world would stop indulging wars and famines and other perils it would still be possible for human beings to embarrass each other to death our selfdestruction might take a little longer that way but i believe it would be no less complete doris wales some months after the hurricane that was her namesake first heard elvis presleys heartbreak hotel when she was actually in a hotel she told sabrina and me that this had been a religious experience you understand doris said i was shacked up with this guy in an actual hotel when this song comes over the radio that song told me how to feel doris explained that was about half a year ago she said i havent been the same since i wondered about the guy whod been shacked up with doris wales when she had her experiences where was he now had he been the same since doris wales sang only elvis presley songs when it was appropriate she changed the hes to shes and vice versa this improvisation and the fact as junior jones noted that she was no negro made listening to her almost unbearable in a gesture of making peace with his sister junior jones asked sabrina to dance the first dance the song i remember was baby lets play house during which sleazy wales several times overpowered his mothers voice with his electricity jesus god father said how much are we paying them never mind mother said everyone can have a good time it seemed unlikely although egg appeared to be having a good time he was wearing a toga and mothers sunglasses and he was keeping clear of frank who lurked at the edge of light among the empty tables and chairsno doubt grumbling to himself his disgust i told bitty tuck that i was sorry id called her titsiethat it had just slipped out okay johnjohn she said feigning indifferenceor worse feeling true indifference for me lilly asked me to dance but i was too shy then ronda ray asked me and i was too shy to refuse lilly looked hurt and refused a gallant invitation from father ronda ray swung me violently around the floor i know im losing you ronda told me my advice when youre going to pull out on someone tell them first i was hoping franny would cut in but ronda wheeled us into junior and sabrina who were clearly arguing switch ronda cried gaily and took junior away hurricane doris in an unforgettable transition of sloppedtogether sound crushed instruments and doriss strident voice switched gears and gave us i love you becausea slow closedancing number through which i trembled in the steady arms of sabrina jones youre not doing so bad she said why dont you put a move on that tuck girlyour sisters friend she asked me shes about your age shes eighteen i said and i dont know how to put a move on anybody i wanted to tell sabrina that although my relationship with ronda ray was carnal it had hardly been a learning experience with ronda there was no foreplay sex was immediate and genital but ronda refused to let me kiss her on the mouth thats how the worst germs get spread around ronda assured me mouths i dont even know how to kiss anybody i told sabrina jones who seemed puzzled at whatfor herwas a non sequitur franny who didnt care for the way ronda ray was dancing the slow number with junior cut in on them and i held my breathhoping ronda wasnt going to come after me relax said sabrina jones you feel like a ball of wire im sorry i said never apologize to the opposite sex she said not if you want to get anywhere get anywhere i said beyond the kissing sabrina said i cant get to the kissing i explained to her thats easy sabrina said to get to the kissing all you have to do is act like you know how to kiss then someone will let you start but i dont know how i said thats easy sabrina said just practice nobody to practice with i saidbut i thought fleetingly of franny try it with bitty tuck sabrina whispered laughing but i have to look like i know how i said and i dont were back to that sabrina said im too old to let you practice with me it wouldnt be good for either of us ronda ray cruising the dance floor spotted frank behind the empty tables but frank fled before she could ask him to dance egg was gone so frank had probably been waiting for an excuse to go corner egg alone lilly was dancing stoically with one of father and mothers friends mr matson an unfortunately tall manalthough if he had been short he couldnt have been short enough for lilly they looked like an awkward perhaps unmentionable animal act father danced with mrs matson and mother stood at the bar talking with an old crony who was at the hotel new hampshire nearly every nighta drinking friend of coach bobs his name was merton and he was the foreman at the lumberyard merton was a wide heavy man with a limp and mighty swollen hands he listened halfheartedly to my mother his face stricken with the absence of iowa bob his eyes feasting on doris wales seemed to think that the band was inappropriate so soon after bobs ultimate retirement variety said sabrina jones in my ear thats the secret to kissing she said i love you for a hundred thousand reasons crooned doris wales egg was back he was in his big chicken costume then he was gone again bitty tuck looked bored she seemed unsure about cutting in on junior and franny and she was so sophisticated as franny would say that she did not know how to talk with ronda ray who had fixed herself a drink at the bar i saw max urick gawking out of the kitchen doorway little bites and a little bit of tongue said sabrina jones but the important thing is to move your mouth around do you want a drink i asked her i mean youre old enough father put a case of beer in the snow out at the delivery entrance for us kids he said he couldnt let us drink at the bar but you can show me the delivery entrance said sabrina jones ill have a beer with you just dont get fresh we left the dance floor fortunately just in time to miss doris waless slamming transition to i dont care if the sun dont shinethe speed of which prompted bitty tuck to cut in on franny for a dance with junior ronda looked sullenly upon my leaving sabrina and i startled frank who was pissing on the trash barrels at the delivery entrance in a gesture of franklike awkwardness frank pretended to be pointing out the beer to us got an opener frank i asked but he had vanished into the mist of elliot parkthe everdreary fog which in the winter was our dominant weather sabrina and i opened our beers at the reception desk in the lobby where frank had permanently hung a bottle opener from a nail on a length of twine it was for opening his pepsicolas when he was on phone duty at the desk in a clumsy effort to sit beside sabrina on the trunk of juniors winter clothes i spilled some beer on bitty tucks luggage you could introduce yourself to her affections sabrina was saying by offering to take all those bags to her room where are your bags i asked sabrina for one night sabrina said i dont pack a bag and you dont have to offer to show me to my room i can find it i could show it to you anyway i said well do it she said i got a book to read this is one party i dont need she added i might as well get ready for a long drive back to philadelphia i walked with her to her room on the second floor i had no illusions of making a move on her as she would say i wouldnt have had the courage anyway good night i mumbled at her door and let her slip away she was not gone long hey she said opening her door before i had left the hall youll never get anywhere not trying you didnt even try to kiss me she added im sorry i said never apologize sabrina said she stood close to me in the hallway and let me kiss her first things first she said your breath smells nicethats a start but stop shaking and you shouldnt make tooth contact at the beginning and dont try to ram me with your tongue we tried again keep your hands in your pockets she told me watch the tooth contact better she said hands in the pockets at all times two feet on the floor i stumbled toward her we made tooth contact quite violently she snapped her head back away from me and when i looked at her incredibly i saw that she held a row of her front upper teeth in her hand shit she cried watch the tooth contact for a horrible moment i thought i had knocked her teeth out but she turned her back to me and said dont look at me false teeth turn out the light i did and it was dark in her room im sorry i said hopelessly never apologize she murmured i was raped yes i said knowing all along that this would surface so was franny so i heard said sabrina jones but they didnt knock her teeth out with a pipe am i right yes i said its the kissing that gets me every fucking time sabrina said just when it gets good my uppers loosen upor some clod makes too much tooth contact i didnt apologize i reached to touch her but she said keep your hands in your pockets then she came up close to me and said im going to help you if you help me ill teach you all about kissing she said but youve got to tell me something i always wanted to know i was never with anyone i dared to ask i try to keep it a secret yes i agreed terrifiednot knowing to what i was agreeing i want to know if its better with my damn teeth out she said or if its gross i always thought it would be gross so i never tried it she went into the bathroom and i waited for her in the dark watching the line of light framing the bathroom dooruntil the light went out and sabrina was back beside me warm and mobile her mouth was a cave in the worlds heart her tongue was long and round and her gums were hard but never painful in the nips she took a little less lip she mumbled a little more tongue no not that much thats disgusting yes a little biting is fine thats nice hands back in the pocketsi mean it do you like this oh yes i said really she asked is it really better its deeper i said she laughed but better too she asked wonderful i confessed hands back in the pockets sabrina said dont get out of control dont be sloppy ouch sorry dont apologize just dont bite so hard hands in the pockets i mean it dont get fresh in the pockets and so forth until i was pronounced initiated and ready for bitty tuck and the world and sent on my way from sabrina joness room hands still in my pockets i collided with the door to b thank you i called to sabrina in the hall light without her teeth she dared to smile at mea rosebrown roseblue smile so much nicer than the odd pearly cast of her false teeth she had sucked on my lips to make them swell she had told me and i walked pouting into the restaurant of the hotel new hampshire aware of the powers of my mouth ready to make kissing history with bitty tuck but hurricane doris was groaning its way through i forgot to remember to forget ronda ray slumped at the bar in a stupor mothers new dress slipped up to the knot of muscle at rondas hip on which a bruise in the shape of a thumbprint stared at me merton the lumberyard foreman was swapping stories with my fatheri knew the stories would be about iowa bob i forgot to remember to forget moaned doris wales poor lilly who would always be too small to feel comfortable at a partyalthough she would continue to anticipate parties with pleasurehad gone to bed egg wearing ordinary clothes sat sulking in one of the screweddown chairs his little face was grey as if he had eaten something that had disagreed with him as if he was willing himself to stay awake till midnightas if he had lost sorrow frank i imagined was out drinking the cold beer in the snow stacked by the delivery entrance or sucking pepsicolas at the reception desk in the lobby or perhaps at the intercomlistening to sabrina jones reading a book and humming with her marvellous mouth mother and the matsons were watching doris wales without reserve only franny was free for dancingbitty tuck was out on the floor with junior jones dance with me i said to franny grabbing her you cant dance franny said but she allowed me to drag her out on the floor i can kiss i whispered to franny and tried to kiss her but she pushed me away switch she cried to junior and bitty tuck and bitty was in my arms and instantly bored just be dancing with her when its midnight sabrina jones had advised at midnight you get to kiss who youre with once you kiss her shell be hooked just dont blow the first one have you been drinking johnjohn bitty asked me your lips are all puffy and doris wales hoarse and sweating gave us tryin to get to you one of those clumsy numbers not slow and not fast forcing bitty tuck to decide whether or not to dance close before shed made her choice max urick leaped out of the kitchen in his sailors cap with a referees whistle clenched in his teeth he blew the whistle so shrilly that even ronda ray moved a little at the bar happy new year shrieked max and franny stood on her toes and gave junior jones the sweetest kiss and mother ran to find father merton the lumberyard foreman looked once at the dozing ronda ray he then thought better of it and bitty tuck with a bored shrug gave me her superior smile again and i remembered every lustiness of the cavernous mouth of sabrina jones i made as they say my move a little tooth contact but nothing offensive the penetration of the tongue past the teeth but only a flicker of ramming it farther and the teeth skating under the upper lip there were bitty tucks wondrous muchdiscussed breasts like soft fists pushing my chest away but i kept my hands in my pockets forcing nothing she was always free to pull away but she didnt choose to break contact holy cow observed junior jones momentarily breaking bitty tucks concentration titsie franny said what are you doing to my brother but i held titsie tuck in touch a little longer lingering over her lower lip and nipping her tongue which shed given me suddenly too much of there was a slight awkwardness as i removed my hands from my pockets because bitty had decided that tryin to get to you was suitable for close dancing whered you learn how to do that she whispered her breasts like two warm kittens curled against my chest we left the dance floor before hurricane doris could change the tempo there was a draught in the lobby where frank had left the door to the delivery entrance open we could hear him outside in the dark slush urinatingwith great forceagainst a trash barrel the floor beneath the bottle opener on the braid of twine was littered with beerbottle caps as i lifted bitty tucks luggage in my arms she said arent you going to make two trips i heard franks sharp belch a primitive gong announcing that the turn of the year was past and i seized the luggage tighter and started climbingfour storeys up bitty following geez she said i knew you were strong johnjohn but you could get a job on televisionkissing like that and i wondered what she imagined my mouth as an advertisement smooching a camera pointblank i thus distracted myself from my lowerback pain was grateful i had skipped this mornings bench presses and onearm curls and bore bitty tucks luggage to a the windows were open but i couldnt hear the rushingofair sound i had heard over the intercom hours before i guessed that the wind had dropped the luggage seemed to explode from my arms which felt pounds lighter and bitty tuck angled me toward her bed do it again she said i bet you cant i bet it was beginners luck so i kissed her again encouraging a little more tooth contact and more mischief with the tongue jesus mumbled bitty tuck touching me get your hands out of your pockets she said oh wait i have to use the bathroom and when she flicked on the bathroom light she said oh it was nice of franny to leave me her hair dryer and i for the first time smelled the rooman odor more distinctive than a swamp it was a burnt smell yet strangely wet as if fire and water had joined unpleasantly i knew that the rushingofair sound i had heard on the intercom had been the hair dryer but before i could get to the bathroom to prevent bitty tuck from looking farther she said whats that wrapped up in the shower curtain gaaaaaaaaa her scream froze me in motion between her bed and the bathroom door even doris wales four floors below and wailing her way through youre a heartbreaker must have heard it sabrina jones told me later that her book flew from her hands ronda ray jerked bolt upright on the barstool for at least a passing second sleazy wales junior jones told me thought the source of the scream was his amplifier but nobody else was fooled titsie franny cried jesus god said father holy cow said junior jones i was the first to get bitty out of the bathroom she had fainted sideways against the childsized toilet and had wedged herself under the childsized sink the grownupsized bathtub halffull of water had caught her eye as she was inserting her diaphragmwhich in those days was very sophisticated floating in the tub of water was the shower curtain and bitty had leaned forward and raised the curtain just enough to sue the grizzly submerged head of sorrowlooking like a murder victim a drowned dog the ghastly fierceness of his last snarling fight with death slipping from his face under the water the discoverer of the body is rarely spared it was fortunate bittys heart was young and strong i could feel it pounding through her bosom when i put her on the bed thinking it a plausible way to revive her i kissed her and although it roused her eyes open for a bright moment she only screamed againeven louder its just sorrow i told her as if this would explain everything sabrina jones was the first to get to a since she was only travelling from the second floor she glared at me as if id been clearly a part of a rape case and she said to me you must have done something i never showed you she no doubt thought bitty was the victim of bad kissing it had been egg whod done the wrong of course he had turned the hair dryer on sorrow in bittys bathroom and the terrible dog had caught fire in a panic egg had thrown the burning beast in the bathtub and covered it with water the fire thus extinguished egg had opened the windows to clear the scorched smell from the room and at the peak of his tiredness just before midnightand fearing capture from the everprowling frankegg had covered the carcass with the shower curtain for the sodden dog was now too heavy with water for egg to be able to lift him egg had gone to our room and changed into ordinary clothes to await his eventual punishment my god frank said morosely when he saw sorrow i think hes really ruined i think hes beyond repair even the boys from hurricane doris trooped into bittys bathroom to pay their respects to the dreadful sorrow i wanted to make him nice again egg cried he was nice once egg insisted and i wanted him to be nice again frank with a sudden wealth of pity seemed to understand something about taxidermy for the first time egg egg frank reasoned with the sobbing child i can make him nice again you should have let me i can make him anything frank claimed i still can he said you want him nice egg ill make him nice but franny and i stared into the bathtub and felt great doubt that frank had taken a harmless farting labrador retriever and made him a killer was one thing but to reassemble this truly disgusting body matted and burned and bloated in the bathtub was a miracle of perversion that we doubted even frank was capable of father on the other hand was ever the optimist he seemed to think all of this would be excellent therapy for frankand no doubt a further maturing influence on egg if you can restore the dog and make him nice son father told frank with inappropriate solemnity that would make us all very happy i think we should throw it away mother said ditto said franny i tried max urick complained but egg and frank began to whoop and cry perhaps father saw that in the restoration of sorrow lay franks forgiveness salvaging sorrow could possibly restore franks selfesteem and perhaps by refashioning sorrow for eggby making sorrow nicefather thought that a bit of iowa bob would be returned to us all but as franny would say years later there was never any such thing as nice sorrow by definition sorrow would never be nice could i blame my father for trying or frank for being the agent of such depressing optimism and there was no blaming egg of course we would none of us ever blame egg only lilly had slept through it all perhaps already inhabiting a world not quite like ours doris wales and ronda ray had not climbed four flights of stairs to see the body but when we found them in the restaurant they seemed almost sobered by the experienceeven secondhand whatever hopes for even a miniseduction that might have been on junior joness mind were dashed by the interruption to the music franny kissed junior good night and went to her own room and bitty tuck although she loved my kisses could not forgive the intrusion upon her privacy in the bathroomboth sorrows and mine i suppose she resented most of all the ungainly position id discovered her infainted while diaphragming herself as franny would later characterize the scene i found myself alone with junior jones at the delivery entrance drinking up the cold beer and watching out into elliot park for any other new years eve survivors sleazy wales and the boys in the band had gone home doris and ronda were draped upon the bara kind of camaraderie had suddenly risen in a blurry fashion between them and junior jones said no offence to your sister man but i am very horny ditto i said and no offence to yours the laughter of the women in the restaurant reached us and junior said want to try to hustle them ladies at the bar i didnt dare tell junior the repugnance of that idea to mehaving already been hustled by one of thembut i felt badly later at how quickly i was willing to betray ronda ray i told junior that she could be hustled very easily and it would only cost him money later i drank another beer and listened to junior carrying ronda to the stairwell at the halls far end away from me and after another beer or two i heard doris wales all alone start to sing heartbreak hotel without the music and occasionally forgetting the words of her religionand occasionally slurring the rest lastly came the unmistakable sound of her throwing up in the bar sink after a while she found me in the lobby at the open door to the delivery entrance and i offered the last cold beer sure why not she said it helps to cut the phlegm that damn heartbreak hotel she added it always moves me too much doris wales was wearing her kneehigh cowboy boots and carrying her thinstrapped green high heels in her hand in her other hand she dallied her coat a sadflecked tweed with a skimpy fur collar its just muskrat she said rubbing it against my cheek she gripped the throat of her beer bottle in the hand with her highheeled shoes and drank nearly all of it down the hickey on her tilted throat appeared to have been made by a redhot fiftycent piece she dropped the beer bottle at her feet and kicked it out the door where it rolled toward the trash barrels at the delivery entrance she stepped closer to me and thrust her thigh between my legs she kissed me on the mouth a kiss like nothing sabrina jones had shown me it was a kiss like a wedge of soft fruit being mashed past my teeth and tongue until i gagged her kiss tasted lingeringly of vomit and beer im picking sleazy up at this party she said wanna come it reminded me of when sleazy offered to forcefeed me the ball of bread or poke out my eyes with the nail in the movies no thanks i said chicken shit she said and belched sharply kids today have no spunk then she slammed me to her chest and hugged me to her body hard as a mans but with her breasts sliding between us like two freshcaught fish in loose bags her tongue lolled along my jawline before skidding into my ear you squirrel dink she whispered then pushed me from her she fell in the slush near the delivery entrance but when i helped her to her feet she shoved me into the trash barrels and walked into the darkness of elliot park unassisted i waited for her to pass out of the darkness and into the pale lamplight from the single streetlight and then pass into the darkness again when she came briefly under the light i called to her good night mrs wales and thank you for the music she gave me the finger slipped almost fell again and lurched out of the lightcursing at something or someone she encountered there what the fuck she said cram it will you i turned away from the light and threw up in the emptiest trash barrel when i looked back at the streetlight again a figure was just veering under it and i thought it was doris wales returning to abuse me but it was someone from another new years eve party for whom home was in another direction it was a man or a reasonably grownup teenager and although he was weaving under the spell of alcohol he maintained slightly better footing in the slush than doris wales cram it yourself lady he cried into the darkness chicken shit called doris from the dark and far away whore the man yelled then lost his balance and sat down in the slush shit he said to no one in particular he couldnt see me it was then that i noticed how he was dressed black slacks and shoes black cummerbund and bow tieand a white dinner jacket of course i knew he was not the man in the white dinner jacket he was lacking the necessary dignity and whatever voyage he was on or interrupting it was not an exotic voyage also it was new years eve and not the seasonin new englandfor white dinner jackets the man was inappropriately dressed and i knew this was no eccentric habit of distinction in dairy new hampshire it could only mean that the moron had gone to the rental tuxedo shop after all the black jackets had been taken or else he didnt know the difference between summer and winter formal dress in our town he was either a young clod coming from a high school dance or an older clod coming from an older dance which had been no less sad and wasteful than anything a high school could engender he was not our man in the white dinner jacket but he reminded me of him then i noticed that the man had stretched out in the slush under the streetlight and had gone to sleep there the temperature was right around freezing i felt at last that new years eve had come to something there seemed to be a purpose for my having taken part in it at alla purpose beyond the simultaneously vague and concrete sensations of lust i lifted the man in the white dinner jacket and carried him to the lobby of the hotel new hampshire he was easier to carry than bitty tucks luggage he didnt weigh much although he was a man not a teenagerin fact he looked older than my father to me and when i searched him for some identification i found i had been right about the rental clothes property of chesters mens store said the label in the white dinner jacket the man although he looked reasonably distinguishedat least for dairy new hampshirecarried no wallet but he had a silver comb perhaps doris wales had mugged him in the dark and that was what theyd been yelling about but no i thought doris would have taken the silver comb too it seemed a good trick to me to arrange the man in the white dinner jacket on the couch in the lobby of the hotel new hampshireso that early in the morning i might be able to surprise father and mother i could say theres someone who came for the last dancelast nightbut he was too late hes waiting to see you in the lobby i thought that was a terrific idea but i feltsince i had been drinkingthat i should really wake up franny and show her the man in the white dinner jacket who was peacefully passed out on the couch franny would inform me if she thought this was a bad idea she would like it too i was sure i straightened the black bow tie of the man in the white dinner jacket and folded his hands upon his chest i buttoned the waist button of his jacket and straightened his cummerbund so that he wouldnt look sloppy the only thing missing was the tan and the black cigarette boxand the white sloop outside the arbuthnotbythesea that was not the sound of the sea outside the hotel new hampshire i knew it was the sound of the slush in elliot park freezing and thawing and refreezing and those were not the gulls calling but dogsalley dogs ripping into the trash which was everywhere i hadnt noticed until i arranged the man in the white dinner jacket on the couch how shabby our lobby washow the presence of an allgirls school had never left the building the ostracism the anxiety of being considered sexually secondbest the tooearly marriages and other disappointments that waited ahead the almost elegant man in the white dinner jacket lookedin the hotel new hampshirelike someone from another planet and i suddenly didnt want my father to see him i ran into the restaurant for some cold water doris wales had broken a glass at the bar and ronda rays oddly sexless working shoes were scuffed under a table where she must have kicked themwhen she started dancing and making her move for junior jones if i woke up franny i thought franny might catch on that junior was with ronda and wouldnt that hurt her i listened at the stairwell and felt a flash of interest in bitty tuck returning to methe thought of seeing her asleepbut when i listened to her on the intercom she was snoring as deep and wallowing a sound as a pig in mud the book of reservations hadnt a single name marked down there was nothing until the summer when the circus called fritzs act would arrive and no doubt appall us all the pettycash box at the reception desk wasnt even lockedand frank in his boredom during phone duty had used the sharp end of the bottle opener to gouge his name into the armrest of the chair in the grey aftertheparty stench of new years day i felt that i should spare my father the vision of the man in the white dinner jacket i thought that if i could wake the man i could employ junior jones to scare the man away but i would have been embarrassed to disturb junior with ronda ray hey get up i hissed at the man in the white dinner jacket snorf he shouted in his sleep ack a whore be quiet i whispered fiercely to him gick he said i seized him around the chest and squeezed him fuh he moaned god help me youre all right i said but you have to leave he opened his eyes and sat up on the couch a young thug he said where have you taken me you passed out outside i said i brought you in so you wouldnt freeze now you have to leave i have to use the bathroom he said with dignity go outside i said can you walk of course i can walk he said he went toward the delivery entrance but stopped on the threshold its dark out there he said youre setting me up arent you how many of them are thereout there i led him to the front lobby door and turned on the outside light im afraid that this was the light that woke up father goodbye i told the man in the white dinner jacket and happy new year this is elliot park he cried indignantly yes i said well this is that funny hotel then he concluded if its a hotel i want a room for the night i thought it best not to tell him that he didnt have any money on him so i said instead were full no vacancies the man in the white dinner jacket stared at the desolate lobby gawked at the empty mail slots and at the abandoned trunk of junior joness winter clothes lying at the foot of the dingy stairs youre full he said as if some truth about life in general had occured to him for the first time holy cow he said id heard this place was going under it wasnt what i wanted to hear i steered him toward the main door again but he bent down and picked up the mail and handed it to me in our haste to prepare for the party no one had been to the mail slot at the front lobby door all day no one had picked up the mail the man walked only a little way out of the door then came back i want to call a cab he informed me theres too much violence out there he said gesturing again to life in general he couldnt have meant elliot parkat least not now not since doris wales had gone you dont have enough money for a cab i informed him oh the man in the white dinner jacket said he sat down on the steps in the cold foggy air i need a minute he said what for i asked him have to remember where im going he said home i suggested but the man waved his hand above his head he was thinking i looked at the mail the usual bills the usual absence of letters from unknowns requesting rooms and one letter that stood out from the rest it had pretty foreign stamps österreich said the stampsand a few other exotic things the letter was from vienna and it was addressed to my father in a most curious way win berry graduate of harvard class of usa the letter had taken a long time to reach my father but the postal authorities had found one among them who knew where harvard was my father would say later that getting that letter was the most concrete thing going to harvard ever did for him if hed gone to some lessfamous school the letter would never have been delivered thats a good reason franny would say later to wish hed gone to a lessfamous school but of course the alumni network at harvard is efficient and vast my fathers name and class of was all they needed to discover the right class and the correct address whats going on i heard my father calling he had come out of our familys secondfloor rooms and was on the landing calling down the stairwell to me nothing i said kicking the drunk on the steps in front of me because he was falling asleep again whys the front light on father called get going i said to the man in the white dinner jacket im happy to meet you the man said cordially ill just be trotting along now good good i whispered but the man walked only to the bottom step before he seemed overcome with thought again who are you talking to father called no one just a drunk i said jesus god said father a drunk isnt no one i can handle it i called wait till i get dressed father said jesus god get going i yelled at the man in the white dinner jacket goodbye goodbye the man called happily waving to me from the bottom step of the hotel new hampshire i had a wonderful time the letter of course was from freud i knew that and i wanted to see what it said before i let my father see it i wanted to talk with franny about it for hoursand even with motherbefore i let father see it but there wasnt time the letter was brief and to the point if you got this then you went to harvard like you promised me freud wrote you good boy you good night god bless you cried the man in the white dinner jacket but he would walk no farther than the perimeter of light where the darkness of elliot park began he stopped and waved i flicked off the light so that if father came father couldnt spot the apparition in formal attire i cant see the drunk wailed and i turned the light on again get out of here or ill beat the shit out of you i screamed at him thats no way to handle it i heard father yelling good night bless you all cried the man he was still in the circle of light when i cut the light off him again and he made no protest i kept the light off i finished freuds letter i finally got a smart bear freud wrote it made all the difference i had a good hotel going but i got old it could still be a great hotel freud added if you and mary come help me run it i got a smart bear but i need a smart harvard boy like you too father stormed into the wretched lobby of the hotel new hampshire in his slippers he stumbled over a beer bottle which he kicked and his bathrobe flapped in the wind from the open door hes gone i said to father just some drunk but father snapped on the outside lightand there waving on the rim of the light was the man in the white dinner jacket goodbye he called hopefully goodbye good luck goodbye the effect was stunning the man in the white dinner jacket stepped out of the light and was goneas gone as if he were gone to seaand my father gaped into the darkness after him hello father screamed hello come back hello goodbye good luck goodbye called the voice of the man in the white dinner jacket and my father stood staring into the darkness until the wind chilled him and he shivered in his bathrobe and slippers he let me pull him inside like any storyteller i had the power to end the story and i could have but i didnt destroy freuds letter i gave it to father while the vision of the man in the white dinner jacket was still upon him i handed over freuds letterlike any storyteller knowing more or less where we would all be going sorrow strikes again sabrina jones who taught me how to kisswhose deep and mobile mouth will have a hold on me alwaysfound the man who could fathom her teethinorout mystery she married a lawyer from the same firm in which she was a secretary and had three healthy children bang bang bang as franny would say bitty tuck who fainted while diaphragming herselfwhose wondrous breasts and modern ways would one day seem not nearly as unique as they seemed to me in survived her encounter with sorrow in fact i heard not long ago that she is still unmarried and still a party girl and a man named frederick worter who was only a hair over four feet tall and fortyone years old and who was better known to our family as fritzwhose circus called fritzs act was an advance booking for a summer that we looked forward to with curiosity and dreadbought the first hotel new hampshire from my father in the winter of for a son ill bet franny said but we children never knew how much father sold the hotel new hampshire for since fritzs act was the only advance booking for the summer of my father had written to fritz firstwarning the diminutive circus king of our familys move to vienna vienna mother kept muttering and shaking her head at my father what do you know about vienna what did i know about motorcycles father asked or bears or hotels and what have you learned mother asked him but my father had no doubt freud had said that a smart bear made all the difference i know that vienna isnt dairy new hampshire father said to mother and he apologized to fritz of fritzs actsaying that he was putting the hotel new hampshire up for sale and that the circus might need to seek other lodgings i dont know if the circus called fritzs act made my father a good offer but it was the first offer and father took it vienna said junior jones holy cow franny might have protested the move for fear that she would miss junior but franny had discovered juniors infidelity with ronda ray on new years eve and she was being cool to him tell her i was just horny man junior told me he was just horny franny i said clearly franny said and you surely know all about what thats like vienna said ronda ray sighing under meprobably from boredom id like to go to vienna she said but i suppose i have to stay herewhere i might be out of a job or else work for that bald midget frederick fritz worter was the bald midget a runt figure who visited us one snowy weekend he was especially impressed with the size of the fourthfloor bathroom facilitiesand with ronda ray lilly of course was most impressed with fritz he was only a little bigger than lilly although we tried to assure lilly and mainly ourselves that she would continue to growa littleand that her features we hoped would not ever appear so out of proportion lilly was pretty tiny but nice but fritz had a head several sizes too large for his body his forearms sagged like slack calf muscles obscenely grafted to the wrong limbs his fingers were sawedoff salamis his ankles were swollen over his little dolls feetlike socks with wrecked elastic what kind of circus do you have lilly asked him boldly weird acts weird animals franny whispered in my ear and i shivered little acts little animals frank mumbled were just a small circus fritz told lilly meaningfully meaning said max urickafter fritz was gonethat theyll all fit just fine on the fucking fourth floor if theyre all like him said mrs urick they wont eat very much if theyre all like him said ronda ray and rolled her eyesbut she didnt continue she decided to let it pass i think hes cute said lilly but fritz of fritzs act gave egg nightmaresgreat shrieks that stiffened my back and tore muscles in my neck eggs arm lashed out and bashed the bedside lamp his legs thrashed under the sheets as if the bedclothes were drowning him egg i cried its just a dream youre having a dream a what he screamed a dream i yelled midgets egg shouted theyre under the bed theyre crawling all around theyre all over everywhere he howled jesus god father said if theyre just midgets why does he get so upset hush mother said ever fearful of hurting lillys little feelings and i lay under the barbell in the morning sneaking a look at franny getting out of bedor getting dressedand thinking of iowa bob what would he have said about going to vienna about freuds hotel that somehow needed a smart harvard boy about the differences a smart bear might maketo anyones prospects for success i lifted and thought it doesnt matter iowa bob would have said whether we go to vienna or stay here it wont matter under all that weight thats what i thought coach bob would have said here or there bob would have said were screwed down for life it would be fathers hotelwhether in dairy or in vienna would nothing ever make us more or less exotic than we were i wondered with the weight wonderfully taut and rising and franny in the corner of my eye i wish youd take those weights to another room franny said so i can get dressed by myself sometimesfor christs sake what do you think about going to vienna franny i asked her i think it will be more sophisticated than staying here franny said completely dressed now and always so sure of herself she looked down at me where i struggled to let my bench press down slowly and levelly i might even get a room without barbells in it she added even one without a weight lifter in it franny said blowing lightly into the armpit of my left and weaker armand getting out of the way when the weights slid first to the left then to the right off the bar jesus god father shouted upstairs to me and i thought that if iowa bob had still been with us he would have said that franny was wrong whether vienna was more sophisticated or lesswhether franny had a room with barbells or a room with lacewe were inhabitants of one hotel new hampshire after another freuds hotelor our imperfect picture of freuds hotel via air mailwas called the gasthaus freud it was unclear from freuds correspondence whether or not the other freud had ever stayed there we only knew it was centrally located according to freudin the first districtbut in the allgrey blackandwhite photograph that freud sent we could barely make out the iron double door sandwiched between the display cases of a land of candy store konditorei said one sign zuckerwaren said another schokoladen promised a third and over it allbigger than the faded letters saying gasthaus freudwas the word bonbons what said egg bonbons said franny oh boy which is the door to the candy store and which is the door to the hotel frank asked frank would always think like a doorman i think you have to live there to know franny said lilly got a magnifying glass and deciphered the name of the street in funny script under the street number on the hotels double door krugerstrasse she decided which at least matched the name of the street in freuds address father bought a map of vienna from a travel agency and we located krugerstrassein the first district as freud had promised it appeared very central its only a block or two from the opera frank cried enthusiastically oh boy franny said the map had little green areas for parks thin red and blue lines where the streetcars ran and ornate buildingsgrossly out of proportion to the streetto indicate the places of interest it looks like a kind of monopoly board lilly said we noted cathedrals museums the town hall the university the parliament i wonder where the gangs hang out said junior jones looking over the streets with us the gangs said egg the who the tough guys said junior jones the guys with guns and blades man the gangs lilly repeated and we stared at the map as if the streets would indicate their darkest alleys to us this is europe frank said with disgust maybe there arent gangs its a city isnt it junior jones said but on the map it looked like a toy city to mewith pretty places of interest and all the green spots where nature had been arranged for pleasure probably in the parks said franny biting her lower lip the gangs hang out in the parks shit i said there wont be any gangs frank cried there will be music and pastry and the people do a lot of bowing and they dress differently we stared at him but we knew hed been reading up on vienna hed gotten a head start on the books father kept bringing home pastry and music and people bowing all the time frank franny said is that what its like lilly was using her magnifying glass on the map nowas if people would spring to life in miniature on the paper and theyd either be bowing and dressed differently or theyd be cruising in gangs well franny said at least we can be pretty sure there wont be any black gangs franny was still angry with junior jones for sleeping with ronda ray shit junior said you better hope there are black gangs black gangs are the best gangs man those white gangs have inferiority complexes junior said and theres nothing worse than a gang with an inferiority complex a what said egg no doubt he thought that an inferiority complex was a weapon sometimes i guess it is well i think its going to be nice said frank grimly yes it will be lilly said with a humourlessness akin to franks i cant see it egg said seriously i cant see it so i dont know what its going to be like itll be okay franny said i dont think its going to be great but itll be all right it was odd but franny seemed the most influenced by iowa bobs philosophywhich to a degree had become fathers philosophy this was odd because franny was frequently the most sarcastic to fatherand the most sarcastic about fathers plans yet when she was raped father had said to herincredibly i thoughtthat when he had a bad day he tried to see if he could construe it as the luckiest day of his life maybe this is the luckiest day of your life he had said to her i was amazed that she seemed to find this reverse thinking useful she was a kind of parrot of other tidbits of fathers philosophy it was just a little event among so many i heard her sayto frank about scaring iowa bob to death and once about chipper dove i heard father say he probably has a most unhappy life franny actually agreed with him i felt much more nervous about going to vienna than franny seemed to feel and i was ever conscious of what feelings franny and i didnt absolutely sharebecause it mattered to me that i stay close to her we all knew that mother thought the idea was crazy but we could not ever make her disloyal to fatheralthough we tried we wont understand the language lilly said to mother the what egg cried the language lilly said they speak german in vienna youll all go to an englishspeaking school mother said there will be weird kids in a school like that i said everyone will be a foreigner well be the foreigners franny said in an englishspeaking school i said the whole place will be full of misfits and people from the government said frank diplomats and ambassadors will send their kids there the kids will be all fucked up who could be more fucked up than the kids at the dairy school frank franny asked whoa said junior jones theres fucked up and then theres foreign and fucked up franny shrugged so did mother well still be a family mother said the main part of your lives will be your familyjust like now and that seemed to please everyone we busied ourselves with the books father brought from the library and the travel agency brochures we reread the short but elated messages from freud good you coming bring all kids and pets lots of room centrally located good shopping for girls how many girls and parks for the boys and pets to play in bring money must renovatewith your assistance youll like the bear a smart bear makes all the difference now we can work on the american audience when we upgrade the clientele then well have a hotel to be proud of i hope your english still good is ha ha best to learn a little german you know remember miracles dont get built in a night but in a couple nights even bears can be queens ha ha i got oldthat was the problem now well be okay now we show the bastards sonsofbitches and cocksucker nazis what a good hotel is hope the kids dont have colds and dont forget to give pets necessary shots since sorrow was our only petand he needed help but not a shotwe wondered if freud thought we still had earl of course not father said hes just speaking generally hes just trying to be helpful make sure sorrow gets his shots frank franny said but frank was getting better about sorrow he could occasionally be teased about the new restoration and he seemed to be committed to the task of refashioning sorrowin a cheerful posefor egg we were not allowed to see the gross dogs transformation of course but frank himself seemed ever cheerfulupon returning from the bio labso that we could only hope that this time sorrow would be nice father read a book about austrian antisemitism and wondered if freud had made the right decision in naming the hotel the gasthaus freud father wondered from what he read if the viennese even jilted the other freud he also couldnt help wondering who the bastards sonsofbitches and cocksucker nazis were i cant help wondering how old freud is mother said they determined that if hed been in his middle or late forties in he would be only in his middle sixties now but mother said that he sounded older in his messages to us she meant hi quick idea you think it best to restrict certain activities to certain floors maybe have certain kind of clientele on fourth floor other kind in basement delicate matter to discriminate you think current daytime and nighttime clientele of differenti wont say warringinterests ha ha all that will change with remodeling and once they stop the fucking digging up the street just a few more years of war restoration they say wait till you meet the bear not just smart but young what a team well be together what you mean is freud a really wellliked name in vienna did you go to harvard or not ha ha he doesnt sound necessarily older said franny but he sounds crazy he just doesnt use english very well father said its not his language so we studied german franny and frank and i took courses at the dairy school and brought the records home to play to lilly mother worked with egg she started by just getting him familiar with the names of the streets and the places of interest on the tourist map lobkowitzplatz mother would say what egg would say father was supposed to be teaching himself but he seemed to be making the least progress you kids have to learn it he kept saying i dont have to go to school meet new kids all of that but were going to an englishspeaking school lilly said even so father said youll need the german more than i will but youre going to run a hotel mother said to him im going to start off going after the american audience father said were trying to drum up an american clientele firstremember better all brush up on our american too said franny frank was getting the german more quickly than any of us it seemed to suit him every syllable was pronounced the verbs fell like grapeshot at the ends of sentences the umlauts were a form of dressing up and the whole idea of words having gender must have appealed to frank by the late winter he was pretentiously chatting in german purposefully bewildering us all correcting our attempts to answer him then consoling our failures by telling us that hed take care of us when we were over there oh boy franny said thats the part that really gets to me having frank take us all to school talk to the bus drivers order in the restaurants take all the phone calls jesus now that im finally going abroad i dont want to be dependent on him but frank seemed to flower at the preparations for moving to vienna no doubt he was encouraged by having been given a second chance with sorrow but he also seemed genuinely interested in studying vienna after dinner he read aloud to us selected excerpts from what frank called the plums of viennese history ronda ray and the uricks listened toocuriously because they knew they werent going and their future with fritzs act was unclear after two months of history lessons frank gave us an oral examination on the interesting characters around vienna at the time of the crown princes suicide at mayerling which frank had earlier read to us in full detail moving ronda ray to tears franny said that prince rudolf was becoming franks herobecause of his clothes frank had portraits of rudolf hi his room one in hunting costumea thinheaded young man with an oversized moustache draped with furs and smoking a cigarette as thick as a fingerand another in uniform wearing the order of the golden fleece his forehead as vulnerable as a babys his beard as sharp as a spade all right franny frank began this one is for you he was a composer of genius perhaps the worlds greatest organist but he was a hicka complete rube in the imperial cityand he had a stupid habit of falling in love with young girls why is that stupid i asked shut up said frank its stupid and this is frannys question anton bruckner franny said he was stupid all right very said lilly your turn lilly said frank who was the flemish peasant oh come on said lilly thats too easy give it to egg its too hard for egg franny said what is egg said princess stephanie said lilly tiredly the daughter of the king of belgium and rudolfs wife now father frank said oh boy franny said because father was almost as bad at history as he was at german whose music was so widely loved that even peasants copied the composers beard frank asked jesus youre strange frank franny said brahms father guessed and we all groaned brahms had a beard like a peasants frank said whose beard did the peasants copy strauss lilly and i yelled the poor drip said franny now i get to ask frank one shoot said frank shutting his eyes tight and scrunching up his face who was jeanette heger franny asked she was schnitzlers sweet girl frank said blushing whats a sweet girl frank franny asked and ronda ray laughed you know said frank still blushing and how many acts of love did schnitzler and his sweet girl make between and franny asked jesus said frank a lot i forget four hundred and sixtyfour cried max urick whod been present at all the historical readings and never forgot a fact like ronda ray max had never been educated before it was a novelty for max and ronda they paid better attention at franks lessons than the rest of us ive got another one for father franny said who was mitzi caspar mitzi caspar father said jesus god jesus god said frank franny only remembers the sexual parts who was she frank franny asked i know said ronda ray she was rudolfs sweet girl he spent the night with her before killing himself with marie vetsera at mayerling ronda had a special place in her memory and in her heart for sweet girls im one arent i she had asked me after franks rendering of arthur schnitzlers life and work the sweetest i had told her phooey said ronda ray where did freud live beyond his means frank asked to any of us who knew which freud lilly asked and we all laughed the sühnhaus frank said answering his own question translation he asked the atonement house he answered fuck you frank said franny not about sex so she didnt know it frank said to me who was the last person to touch schubert i asked frank he looked suspicious what do you mean he asked just what i said i said who was the last person to touch schubert franny laughed i had shared this story with her and i didnt think frank knew itbecause i had taken the pages out of franks book it was a sick story is this some kind of joke frank asked when schubert had been dead for sixty years the poor hick anton bruckner attended the opening of schuberts grave only bruckner and some scientists were allowed someone from the mayors office delivered a speech going on and on about schuberts ghastly remains schuberts skull was photographed a secretary took notes at the investigationnoting that schubert was a shade of orange and that his teeth were in better shape than beethovens beethoven had been resurrected for similar studies earlier the measurements of schuberts brain cavity were recorded after nearly two hours of scientific investigation bruckner could restrain himself no longer he grabbed the head of schubert and hugged it until he was asked to let it go so bruckner touched schubert last it was franks kind of story really and he was furious not to know it bruckner again mother answered quietly and franny and i were amazed that she knew we went from day to day thinking that mother knew nothing and then she turned up knowing it all for vienna we know she had been secretly studyingknowing perhaps that father was unprepared what trivia said frank when we had explained the story to him honestly what trivia all history is trivia father said showing again the iowa bob side of himself but frank was usually the source of triviaat least concerning vienna he hated to be outdone his room was full of drawings of soldiers in their regimentals hussars in skintight pink pants and fitted jackets of a sunnylake blue and the officers of the tyrolean rifle in dawngreen in at the paris worlds fair austria won the most beautiful uniform prize for artillery it was no wonder that the fin de siècle in vienna appealed to frank it was only alarming that the fin de siècle was the only period frank really learnedand taught to us all the rest of it was not as interesting to him vienna wont be like mayerling for christs sake franny whispered to me while i was lifting weights not now who was the master of the songas an art form i asked her but his beard was plucked raw because he was so nervous he never let the hairs alone hugo wolf you asshole she said dont you see vienna isnt like that anymore hi freud wrote to us you asked for a floor plan well i hope i know what you mean the journal for the symposium on eastwest relations occupies the second floortheir daytime officesand i let the prostitutes use the third floor because theyre above the offices you see which are never used at night so nobody complains usually ha ha the first floor is our floor i mean the bear and meand you all of you when you come so theres the fourth and fifth for the guests when we get the guests why you ask you have a plan the prostitutes say we need an elevator but they make lots of trips ha ha what you mean how old am i about one hundred but viennese answer is better we say i keep passing the open windows this is an old joke there was a street clown called king of the mice he trained rodents he did horoscopes he could impersonate napolean he could make dogs fart on command one night he jumped out his window with all his pets in a box written on the box was this life is serious but art is fun i hear his funeral was a party a street artist had killed himself nobody had supported him but now everybody missed him now who would make the dogs make music and the mice pant the bear knows this too it is hard work and great art to make life not so serious prostitutes know this too prostitutes mother said what said egg whores said franny there are whores in the hotel lilly asked so what else is new i thought but max urick looked more than usually overcome with sullenness at the thought of staying behind ronda ray shrugged sweet girls said frank well jesus god father said if theyre there well just get them out wo bleibt die alte zeit und die gemütlichkeit frank went around singing where is the old time where is the gemütlichkeit it was the song bratfisch sang at the fiacre ball bratfisch had been crown prince rudolfs personal horsecab drivera dangerouslooking rake with a whip wo bleibt die alte zeit pfirt di gott mein schönes wien frank went on singing bratfisch had sung this after rudolf murdered his mistress and then blew out his own brains where is the old time fare thee well my beautiful vienna hi freud wrote dont worry about the prostitutes theyre legal here its just business that eastwest relations bunch is the bunch to watch their typewriters bother the bear they complain a lot and they tie up the phones damn politics damn intellectuals damn intrigue intrigue mother said a language problem father said freud doesnt know the language name one antisemite for whom an actual square a whole platz in the city of vienna has been named frank demanded name just one jesus god frank father said no frank said dr karl lueger mother said with such a dullness in her voice that franny and i felt a chill very good said frank impressed who thought all vienna was an elaborate job of concealing sexual reality mother asked freud said frank not our freud said franny but our freud wrote to us all vienna is an elaborate job of concealing sexual reality this is why prostitution is legal this is why we believe in bears over and out i was with ronda ray one morning thinking wearily of arthur schnitzler fucking jeanette heger times in something like eleven months and ronda asked me what does he mean its legalprostitution is legalwhats he mean its not against the law i said in vienna apparently prostitution is not against the law there was a long silence from ronda she moved awkwardly out from under me is it legal here she asked me i could see she was seriousshe looked frightened everythings legal in the hotel new hampshire i said it was an iowa bob thing to say no here she said angrily in america is it legal no i said not in new hampshire no she cried its against the law it is she screamed well but it happens anyway i said why ronda yelled why is it against the law i dont know i said you better go she said and youre going to vienna and leaving me here she added pushing me out the door you better go she said who worked for two years on a fresco and called it schweinsdreck frank asked me at breakfast schweinsdreck means pig shit jesus frank its breakfast i said gustav klimt frank said smugly and there went the winter of still lifting the weights but going easy on the bananas still visiting ronda ray but dreaming of the imperial city learning irregular verbs and the mesmerizing trivia of history trying to imagine the circus fritzs act and the hotel called gasthaus freud our mother seemed tired but she was loyal she and my father appeared to rely on more frequent visits to old e where the differences between them perhaps appeared easier to solve the uricks were wary a cautious streak had developed in them because they no doubt felt abandonedto a dwarf max said but not around lilly and one morning in early spring with the ground in elliot park still halffrozen but turning spongy ronda ray refused to take my moneybut she accepted me its not legal she whispered bitterly im no criminal it was later that i discovered she was playing for higher stakes vienna she whispered what will you do there without me she asked i had a million ideas and almost as many pictures but i promised ronda i would ask father to consider bringing her along shes a real worker i told father mother frowned franny started choking on something frank mumbled about the weather in viennalots of rain egg naturally asked what we were talking about no father said not ronda we cant afford it everyone looked relievedeven me i confess i broke the news to ronda when she was oiling the top of the bar well there was no harm in asking right she said no harm i said but the next morning when i stopped and breathed a little outside her door it seemed that there had been some harm just keep running johno she said running is legal running is free i then had an awkward and vague conversation with junior jones about lust it was comforting that he didnt seem to understand it any better than i did it was a frustration to us both that franny had so many other opinions on the subject women said junior jones theyre very different from you and me i nodded of course franny seemed to have forgiven junior for his lust with ronda ray but a part of her remained aloof to him she appeared at least outwardly indifferent to leaving junior for vienna perhaps she was torn between not wanting to miss junior jones too much and remaining hopeful but calm about the possible adventure that vienna could be for her she was detached when asked about it and i found myself that spring more often stuck with frank frank was in high gear his moustache resembled nervously the facial excesses of the departed crown prince rudolf although franny and i liked to call frank the king of mice here he comes he can make dogs fart on command who is it i would cry life is serious but art is fun franny would shout here is the hero of the street clowns keep him away from the open windows king of the mice i yelled drop dead both of you frank said hows it coming with the dog frank i asked this would win him over every time well frank said some vision of sorrow crossing his mind and making his moustache quiver i think egg will be pleasedalthough sorrow may seem a little tame to the rest of us i doubt it i said looking at frank i could imagine the crown prince moodily en route to mayerlingand the murder of his mistress and the killing of himselfbut it was easier to think of freuds street artist leaping out a window with his box of pets the king of mice dashed to the ground and a city that ignored him once now mourning him somehow frank looked the part who will make the dogs make music and the mice pant i asked frank over breakfast go lift a few weights he said and drop them on your head so frank journeyed back to the bio lab if the king of mice could make dogs fart on command frank could make sorrow live in more than one poseso perhaps he was a kind of crown prince like rudolf emperor of austria to be king of bohemia king of transylvania margrave of moravia duke of auschwitz to mention only a few of rudolfs titles where is the king of mice franny would ask with sorrow i would say teaching sorrow to fart on command and passing each other in the halls of the hotel new hampshire i would say to lilly or franny would say to frank keep passing the open windows schweinsdreck frank would say show off franny would say back to him pig shit to you frank id say what egg would shout and one morning lilly asked father will we leave before the circus called fritzs act moves in or will we get to see them i hope to miss seeing them franny said wont we overlap at least a day frank asked i mean for the passing of the keys or something what keys max urick asked what locks said ronda ray whose door was shut to me perhaps well coincide for about ten or fifteen minutes father said i want to see them lilly said seriously and i looked at mother who looked tiredbut nice she was a soft rumpled woman whom father clearly loved to touch he was always burrowing his face in her neck and cupping her breasts and hugging her from behindwhich she only pretended to resent in front of us children when he was around mother father was remindful of those dogs whose heads are always thrust in your lap whose snouts take comfort in armpits and crotchesi dont mean at all that father was crude with her but he was always making contact hugging and hanging on tight of course egg did this with mother too and lillyto a degreethough lilly was more dignified and holding back of herself since her smallness had become such an item it was as if she didnt want to appear any smaller than she was by acting too young the average austrian is three to four inches shorter than the average american lilly frank informed her but lilly appeared not to careshe shrugged it was mothers move independent and pretty in their different ways both franny and lilly had inherited the motion sometime that spring i saw franny use it just a single deft shrug with a hint of some involuntary ache behind itwhen junior jones told us that he would be accepting the football scholarship from penn state in the fall ill write you franny told him sure and ill write you he told her ill write you more said franny junior jones tried to shrug but it didnt come off shit he told me when we were throwing rocks at a tree in elliot park what does franny want to do anyway what does she think is going to happen to her over there over there was what we all called it except frank he now spoke of vienna the german way wien he said veen lilly said shuddering it sounds like something a lizard would say and we all stared at her waiting for egg to say his what then the grass came out in elliot park and one warm night when i was sure egg was asleep i opened the window and looked at the moon and the stars and listened to the crickets and the frogs and egg said keep passing the open windows you awake i said i cant sleep egg said i cant see where im going he said i dont know what itll be like he sounded ready to cry so i said come on egg it will be great youve never lived in a city i said i know he said sniffling a little well theres more to do than there is to do here i promised him i have a lot to do here he said but this will be so different i told him why do the people jump out of windows he asked me and i explained to him that it was just a story although the sense of a metaphor might have been lost on him there are spies in the hotel he said thats what lilly said spies and low women i imagined lilly thinking that low women were short like her and i tried to reassure egg that there was nothing frightening about the occupants of freuds hotel i said that father would take care of everythingand heard the silence with which both egg and i accepted that promise how will we get there egg asked its so far an airplane i said i dont know what thats like either he said there would be two airplanes actually because father and mother would never fly on the same plane many parents are like that i explained that to egg too but he kept repeating i dont know what itll be like then mother came into our room to comfort egg and i fell back to sleep with them talking together and woke up again as mother was leaving egg was asleep mother came over to my bed and sat down beside me her hair was loose and she looked very young in fact in the halfdark she looked a lot like franny hes only seven she said about egg you should talk to him more okay i said do you want to go to vienna and of course she shruggedand smiledand said your father is a good good man for the first time really i could see them in the summer of with father promising freud that he would get married and he would go to harvardand freud asking mother one thing to forgive father was this what she had to forgive him for and was rooting us out of the terrible town of dairy and the wretched dairy schooland the first hotel new hampshire which wasnt so hot a hotel though nobody said sowas that so bad a thing that father was doing really do you like freud i asked her i dont really know freud mother said but father likes him i said your father likes him mother said but he doesnt really know him either what do you think the bear will be like i asked her i dont know what the bear is for mother whispered so i couldnt guess what it could be like what could it be for i asked but she shrugged againperhaps remembering what earl had been like and trying to remember what earl could have been for well all find out she said and kissed me it was an iowa bob thing to say good night i said to mother and kissed her keep passing the open windows she whispered and i was asleep then i had a dream that mother died no more bears she said to father but he misunderstood her he thought she was asking him a question no one more bear he said just one more i promise and she smiled and shook her head she was too tired to explain there was the faintest effort of her famous shrug and the intention of a shrug in her eyes which rolled up and out of sight suddenly and father knew that the man in the white dinner jacket had taken mothers hand okay no more bears father promised but mother was aboard the white sloop now and she went sailing out to sea in the dream egg wasnt there but egg was there when i woke uphe was still sleeping and someone else was watching him i recognized the sleek black backthe fur thick and short and oily the square back of his blundering head and the halfcocked noaccount ears he was sitting on his tail as he used to doin lifeand he was facing egg frank had probably made him smiling or at least panting witlessly in that goofy way of dogs who repeatedly drop balls and sticks at your feet oh the moronic but happy fetchers of this worldthat was our old sorrow a fetcher and a farter i crept out of bed to face the beastfrom eggs point of view i could see at a glance that frank had outdone himself at niceness sorrow sat on his tail with his forepaws touching and modestly hiding his groin his face had a dippy glazed happiness about it his tongue lolled stupidly out of his mouth he looked ready to fart or wag his tail or roll idiotically on his back he looked like he was dying to be scratched behind his earshe looked like a hopelessly slavish animal forever in need of fondling attention if it werent for the fact that he was dead and that it was impossible to banish from memory sorrows other manifestations this sorrow looked as harmless as sorrow ever could have looked egg i whispered wake up but it was saturday morningeggs morning for sleeping inand i knew egg had slept badly or only a little through the night out the window i saw our car driving between the trees of elliot park treating the soggy park like a slalom courseat slow speedand i knew that meant frank was at the wheel hed just gotten his drivers license and he liked to practice by driving around the trees in elliot park also franny had just gotten her learners permit and frank was teaching her to drive i could tell it was frank at the wheel because of the stately progress of the car through the trees at limousine speed at hearse speedthat was the way frank always drove even when he drove mother to the supermarket he drove as if he were bearing the coffin of a queen past throngs of mourners seeking one last look when franny drove frank yelped beside her cringing in the passenger seat franny liked to go fast egg i said more loudly and he stirred a little there was a slamming of doors outside a changing of drivers in our car in elliot park i could tell franny had taken the wheel when the car began to careen between the trees great slithers of the spring mud flyingand the wild halfseen gestures of franks arms waving in what is popularly called the death seat jesus god i heard father yell out another window then he shut the window and i heard him raving at motherabout the way franny drove about having to replant the grass in elliot park about having to chip the mud off the car with a chiseland while i was still watching franny racing among the trees egg opened his eyes and saw sorrow his scream jammed my thumbs against the windowsill and made me bite my tongue mother ran into the room to see what was the matter and greeted sorrow with a shriek of her own jesus god said father why does frank have to spring the damn dog on everyone why cant he just say now im going to show you sorrow and carry the damn thing into a roomwhen were all ready for it for christs sake sorrow said egg peering from under his bedclothes its just sorrow egg i said doesnt he look nice egg smiled cautiously at the foolishlooking dog he does look nice father said suddenly pleased hes smiling egg said lilly came into eggs room and hugged sorrow she sat down and leaned back against the upright dog look egg she said you can use him like a backrest frank came in the room looking awfully proud its terrific frank i said its really nice said lilly a remarkable job son father said frank was just beaming franny came in the room talking before she came in honestly frank is such a chicken shit in the car she complained youd think he was giving me stagecoach lessons then she saw sorrow wow she cried and why did we all wait so quietly for what franny would say even when she was not quite sixteen my whole family seemed to regard her as the real authorityas the last word franny circled sorrow almost as if she were another dogsniffing him franny put her arm around franks shoulder and he stood tensed for her verdict the king of mice has produced a fucking masterpiece franny announced a spasm of a smile crossed franks anxious face frank franny said to him sincerely youve really done it frank this really is sorrow she said and she got down and patted the dogthe way she used to in the old days hugging his head and rubbing behind his ears this seemed completely reassuring to egg who began to hug sorrow without reserve you may be an asshole in an automobile frank franny told him but youve done an absolutely firstrate job with sorrow frank looked as if he were going to faint or just fall over and everyone began talking at once and pounding frank on the back and poking and scratching sorroweveryone but mother we suddenly noticed she was standing by the window looking out at elliot park franny she said yes franny said franny mother said youre not to drive like that in the park againdo you understand okay franny said you may go out to the delivery entrance now mother said and get max to help you find the lawn hose and get some buckets of hot soapy water youre going to wash all the mud off the car before it dries okay franny said just look at the park mother told her youve torn up the new grass im sorry franny said lilly mother said still looking out the windowshe was through with franny now yes lilly said your room lilly mother said what am i going to say about your room oh lilly said its a mess for a week its been a mess mother said today please dont leave your room until its better i noticed that father slunk quietly away with lillyand franny went to wash the car frank seemed bewildered that his moment of success had been cut so short he seemed unwilling to leave sorrow now that he had recreated him frank said mother yes frank said now that youre finished with sorrow perhaps you could straighten up your room too mother asked oh sure frank said im sorry frank mother said sorry frank said im sorry but i dont like sorrow frank mother said you dont like him frank said no because hes dead frank mother said hes very real frank but hes dead and i dont find dead things amusing im sorry frank said jesus god i said and you please mother said to me will you watch your language your language is terrible mother told me especially when you pause to consider that you share a room with a sevenyearold i am tired of the fucking this and the fucking that mother said this house is not a locker room yes i said and noticed that frank was gonethe king of mice had slipped away egg mother saidher voice winding down what egg said sorrow is not to leave your room egg mother said i dont like to be startled she said and if sorrow leaves this roomif i see him anyplace but where i expect to see him which is right herethen thats it then hes gone for good right said egg but can i take him to vienna when we go i meancan sorrow come i suppose hell have to come mother said her voice had the same resignation in it that id heard in her voice in my dreamwhen mother had said no more bears and then drifted away on the white sloop holy cow said junior jones when he saw sorrow sitting on eggs bed one of mothers shawls around sorrows shoulders eggs baseball cap on sorrows head franny had brought junior to the hotel to see franks miracle harold swallow had come along with junior but harold was lost somewhere hed made a wrong turn on the second floor and rather than come into our apartment he was wandering around the hotel i was trying to work at my deski was studying for my german exam and was trying not to ask frank for help franny and junior jones went off looking for harold and egg decided against sorrows present costume he undressed the dog and started over then harold swallow found his way to our door and peered in at egg and meand at sorrow sitting naked on eggs bed harold had never seen sorrow beforedead or aliveand he called the dog over to the doorway here dog he called come here come on sorrow sat smiling at harold his tail itching to wagbut motionless come on here doggy harold cried good dog nice doggy hes supposed to stay in this room egg informed harold swallow oh said harold with an impressive roll of his eyes to me well hes very well behaved harold swallow said he aint budging is he and i went to take harold swallow down to the restaurant where junior and franny were looking for him i saw no reason to tell harold that sorrow was dead that your little brother harold asked me about egg right i said and you got a nice dog too harold said shit junior jones said to me later we were standing outside the gymnasium which the dairy school had tried to decorate like a building of parliamentfor the weekend of juniors graduation shit junior said im really worried about franny why i asked somethings bothering her junior said she wont sleep with me he said not even as just a way of saying goodbye or something she wont even do it once sometimes i think she doesnt trust me junior said well i said frannys only sixteen you know well shes an old sixteen you know he said i wish youd speak to her me i said what should i say i wish youd ask her why she wont sleep with me junior jones said shit i said but i asked herlater when the dairy school was empty when junior jones had gone home for the summer to whip himself into shape for playing football at penn state when the old campus and especially the path through the woods that the football players always used reminded franny and me of what seemed like years ago to us why didnt you ever sleep with junior jones i asked her im only sixteen john franny said well youre an old sixteen you know i said not exactly sure what this might mean franny shrugged of course look at it this way she said ill see junior again were going to write letters and all that were staying friends now somedaywhen im older and if we do stay friendsit might be the perfect thing to do to sleep with him i wouldnt want to have used it up why couldnt you sleep with him twice i asked her you dont get it she said i was thinking it had to do with her having been raped but franny could always read me like a book no kid she said its got nothing to do with being raped sleeping with someone is very differentprovided it means something i just dont know what it would meanwith junior not yet also she said with a big sighand she paused also she said i dont have exactly a lot of experience but it seems that once someoneor some peopleget to have you you dont ever hear from them again now it seemed to me she had to be talking about her rape i was confused i said who do you mean franny and she bit her lip a while then she said it surprises me that i have not heard one wordnot a single wordfrom chipper dove can you imagine that she asked all this time and not one word now i was really confused it seemed amazing to me that she would have thought shed ever hear from him i couldnt think of anything to say except a stupid joke so i said well franny i dont suppose youve written to him either twice franny said i think thats enough enough i cried why the fuck did you write him at all i yelled she looked surprised why to tell him how i was and what i was doing she said i just stared at her and she looked away i was in love with him john she whispered to me chipper dove raped you franny i said dove and chester pulaski and lenny metzthey gangbanged you its not necessary to say that she snapped at me im talking about chipper dove she said just him he raped you i said i was in love with him she said keeping her back to me you dont understand i was in loveand maybe i still am she said now she added brightly would you like to tell junior that do you think i should tell junior that she asked wouldnt junior just love that she asked no i said no i thought not too franny said so i just thought thatunder the circumstancesi wouldnt sleep with him okay she asked okay i said but i wanted to tell her that certainly chipper dove had not loved her dont tell me franny said dont tell me that he didnt love me i think i know but do you know what she asked me one day franny said chipper dove might fall in love with me and you know what she asked no i said maybe if that happens if he falls in love with me franny said maybeby theni wont love him anymore and then ill really get him wont i she asked me i just stared at her she was as junior jones had observed a very old sixteen indeed i felt suddenly that we all couldnt get to vienna soon enoughthat we all needed time to grow older and wiser if thats what really was involved in the process i know that i wanted a chance to pull even with franny if not ever ahead of her and i thought i needed a new hotel for that it suddenly occurred to me that franny might have been thinking of vienna in somewhat the same way of using itto make herself smarter and tougher and somehow grownup enough for the world that neither of us understood keep passing the open windows was all i could say to her at the moment we looked at the stubbly grass on the practice field and knew that in the fall it would be punctured everywhere with cleats churned by knees striking the ground and clawing fingersand that this fall we would not be in dairy to see it or to look away from it somewhere else all thator something like itwould be going on and we would be watching or taking part in whatever it was i took frannys hand and we walked along the path the football players always used pausing only briefly by the turn we rememberedthe way into the woods where the ferns were we didnt need to see them byebye franny whispered to that holy and unholy place i squeezed her handshe squeezed back then she broke our gripand we tried to speak only german to each other all the way back to the hotel new hampshire it would be our new language very soon after all and we werent very good at it we both knew that we needed to get better in order to be free of frank frank was taking his hearsedriving tour through the trees when we returned to elliot park want a lesson he asked franny she shrugged and mother sent them both on an errandfranny driving frank praying and flinching beside her that night when i went to bed egg had put sorrow in my bedand dressed him in my running clothes getting sorrow out of my bedand getting sorrows hair out of my bedi thoroughly woke myself up again i went down to the restaurant and bar to read max urick was having a drink sitting in one of the screweddown chairs how many times did old schnitzler give it to jeanette whats her name max asked me four hundred and sixtyfour i said isnt that something he cried when max stumbled upstairs to bed i sat listening to mrs urick putting away some pans ronda ray was not around she was outor maybe she was in it hardly mattered it was too dark to take a runand franny was asleep so i couldnt lift weights sorrow had ruined my bed for a while so i just tried to read it was a book about the fluabout all the famous and the unfamous people who were wiped out by it it seemed like one of the saddest times in vienna gustav klimt who once called his own work pig shit died he had been schieles teacher schieles wife diedher name was edithand then schiele himself died when he was very young i read a whole chapter in the book about what pictures schiele might have painted if the flu hadnt got him i was beginning to get the rather fuzzy idea that the whole book was about what vienna might have become if the flu hadnt come to town when lilly woke me up why arent you sleeping in your room she asked i explained about sorrow i cant sleep because i cant imagine what my room over there is going to be like lilly explained i told her about the flu but she wasnt interested im worried lilly admitted im worried about the violence what violence i asked her in freuds hotel lilly said theres going to be violence why lilly i asked sex and violence lilly said you mean the whores i asked her the climate of them lilly said sitting pretty in one of the screweddown chairs rocking slightly in her seather feet of course not reaching the floor the climate of whores i said the climate of sex and violence lilly said thats what it sounds like to me that whole city she said look at rudolfkilling his girl friend then killing himself that was in the last century lilly i reminded her and that man who fucked that woman four hundred and sixtyfour times lilly said schnitzler i said almost a century ago lilly its probably worse now lilly said most things are that would have been frankwho told her thati knew and the flu said lilly and the wars and the hungarians she said the revolution i asked her that was last year lilly and all the rape in the russian sector lilly said franny will get raped again or i will she said adding if someone small enough catches me the occupation is over i said a violent climate lilly repeated all the repressed sexuality thats the other freud lilly i said and what will the bear do lilly asked a hotel with whores and bears and spies not spies lilly i said i knew she meant the eastwest relations people i think theyre just intellectuals i told her but this didnt appear to comfort her she shook her head i cant stand violence lilly said and vienna reeks of it she said it was as if shed been studying the tourist map and had found all the corners where junior joness gangs hung out the whole place shouts of violence lilly said it absolutely broadcasts it lilly said it was as if she had taken these words into her mouth to suck on them reeks shouts broadcasts the whole idea of going over there just shivers with violence lilly said shivering her tiny knees gripped the seat of the screweddown chair her slender legs whipped back and forth violently fanning the floor she was only eleven and i wondered where shed found all the words she used and why her imagination seemed much older than she was why were the women in our family either wise like mother or an old sixteenas junior jones said of frannyor like lilly small and soft but bright beyond her years why should they get all the brains i wondered thinking of father although mother and father were both thirtyseven father seemed ten years younger to meand ten years dumber franny said and what was i i wondered because frannyand even lillymade me feel i would be fifteen forever and egg was immaturea sevenyearold with fiveyearold habits and frank was frank the king of mice able to bring back dogs from the dead able to master a different language and able to put the oddities of history to his personal use but in spite of his obvious abilities i felt that frankin many other categorieswas operating with a mental age of four lilly sat with her head down and her little legs swinging i like the hotel new hampshire lilly said in fact i love it i dont want to leave here she said the predictable tears in her eyes i gave her a hug and picked her up i could have benchpressed lilly while the seasons changed i carried her back to her room think of it this way i told her well just be going to another hotel new hampshire lilly the same thing but another country but lilly cried and cried id rather stay with the circus called fritzs act she bawled id rather stay with them and i dont even know what they do soon wewould know what they did of course too soon it was summer then and before we were packedbefore wed even made the airplane reservationsthe fourfoot fortyoneyearold named frederick fritz worter paid us a visit there were some papers to sign and some of the other members of fritzs act wished to have a look at their future home one morning when egg was sleeping beside sorrow i looked out our window at elliot park at first nothing seemed strange some men and women were getting out of a volkswagen bus they were all more or less the same size we were still a hotel after all and i thought they might be guests then i realized that there were five women and eight menyet they quite comfortably spilled out of one volkswagen busand when i recognized frederick fritz worter as one of them i realized that they were all the same size as him max urick whod been shaving while looking out his fourthfloor window screamed and cut himself a fucking busload of midgets he told us later its not what you expect to see when youre just getting up it is impossible to say what ronda ray might have done or said if she had seen them but ronda was still in bed franny and my barbells were lying untouched in frannys room frankwhether he was dreaming studying german or reading about viennawas in a world of his own egg was sleeping with sorrow and mother and fatherwho would be embarrassed about it laterwere having fun in old e i ran into lillys room knowing she would want to see the arrival of at least the human part of fritzs act but lilly was already awake and watching them through her window she was wearing an oldfashioned nightgown that mother had bought her in an antique storeit completely enveloped lillyand she was hugging her raggedy ann doll to her chest its a small circus just like mr worter said lilly whispered adoringly in elliot park we watched the midgets gathering beside the volkswagen bus they were stretching and yawning one of the men did a handstand one of the women did a cartwheel one of them started moving on all fours like a chimpanzee but fritz clapped his hands scolding such foolishness they drew together like a miniature football team having a huddle with two extra players then they started marching in an orderly fashion toward our lobby door lilly went to let them in i went to the switchboard to make the announcement to e for example new owners arrivingall thirteen of them over and out to frank guten morgen fritzs act ist hier angekommen wachs du auf and to franny midgets go wake up egg so he wont be frightened hell think he dreamed them tell him thirteen midgets are here but its safe then i ran up to ronda rays room i was better at giving her messages in person theyre here i whispered outside her door keep running johno ronda said theres thirteen of them i said only five women and eight men i said theres at least three men for you what size are they ronda ray asked thats a surprise i said come see keep running ronda said all of youkeep running max urick went and hid with mrs urick in the kitchen they were shy about being introduced but father dragged them out to meet the midgets and mrs urick marched the midgets through her kitchenshowing off her stockpots and how plainbutgood everything smelled they are small mrs urick conceded later but theres a lot of them theyll have to eat something theyll never reach all the lights max urick said ill have to change all the switches grumpily he moved off the fourth floor it was clear that the fourth floor was the one the midgets wantedsuited to their tiny washing and tiny peeing max grumbled but not around lilly franny thought max was only angry that he was moving closer to mrs urick but he moved no nearer to her than the third floor where i imagined he would be forever blessed to hear the patter of little feet above him where will the animals go lilly asked mr worter fritz explained that the circus would use the hotel new hampshire only for their summer quarters the animals would stay outside what kind of animals are they egg asked clutching sorrow to his chest live ones said one of the lady midgets who was about eggs size and appeared to be intrigued with sorrow she kept patting him it was the end of june when the midgets made elliot park look like a fairground the oncebrightlycolored canvases now faded to pastels flapped over the little stalls fringed the merrygoround domed the big tent where the main acts would be performed kids from the town of dairy came and hung around our park all day but the midgets were in no hurry they set up the stalls they changed the position of the merrygoround three timesand refused to hook up the engine that ran it even to test it out one day a box arrived the size of a diningroom table it was full of large spools of differentcoloured tickets each spool as big as a tyre and frank drove carefully through the now crowded park circling the little tents and the one big tent telling the kids from the town to move on it opens the fourth of july kids frank would say officiouslyhis arm hanging out the window of the car come back then we would be gone by then we hoped that the animals might arrive before we had to leave but we knew in advance we were going to miss opening night weve seen all the things they do anyway franny said mainly frank said they just go around looking small lilly burned she pointed out the handstands the juggling acts the water and fire dance the eightman standing pyramid the blind baseball team skit and the smallest of the lady midgets said she could ride barebackon a dog show me the dog said frank he was sour because father had sold fritz the family car and frank now needed fritzs permission to drive the car around elliot park fritz was generous about the car but frank hated to ask franny liked to take her driving lessons with max urick in the hotel pickup because max was nervy about franny driving fast gun it he would encourage her pass that suckeryouve got plenty of room and franny would come back from a lesson proud that she had laid nine feet of rubber around the bandstand or twelve feet around the corner of front street verging with court laying rubber was what we said in dairy new hampshire for leaving a black stain on the road with squealing tyres its disgusting frank said bad for the clutch bad for the tyres nothing but juvenile showing offyoull get in trouble youll get your learners permit revoked max will lose his license which he probably should youll run over someones dog or a small child some dumb hoods from the town will try to dragrace you or follow you home and beat the shit out of you or theyll beat the shit out of me frank said just because i know you were going to vienna frank franny said get in your licks at the town of dairy while you can licks said frank disgusting hi freud wrote you almost here good time to come plenty of time for kids to get adjusted before school starts everyone looking forward to you coming even prostitutes ha ha whores happy to take maternal interest in kidsreally i show them all the pictures summer a good time for whores lots of tourists everyone in good mood even eastwest relations assholes seem content they not so busy in summerdont start typing until am politics take summer vacations too ha ha it nice here nice music in parks nice ice cream even bear is happierglad you coming too bears name by the way is susie love from susie and me freud susie franny said a bear named susie frank said he seemed irritated that it wasnt a german name or that it was a female bear it was a disappointment to most of us i thinka kind of anticlimax before wed really gotten started but moving is like that first the excitement then the anxiety then the letdown first we took a cram course on vienna then we started missing the old hotel new hampshirein advance then there was a period of waitinginterminable and perhaps preparing us for some inevitable disappointment on that day of simultaneous departure and arrival which the invention of the jet plane makes possible on the first of july we borrowed the volkswagen bus belonging to fritzs act it had funny hand controls for braking and acceleration because the midgets couldnt reach the foot pedals father and frank argued over who would be more dexterous at driving the unusual vehicle finally fritz offered to drive the first shift to the airport father frank franny lilly and i were in the first shift mother and egg would meet us in vienna the next day sorrow would fly with them but the morning we were leaving egg was up before me he was sitting on his bed in a white dress shirt and with his best dress pants and black dress shoes and wearing a white linen jacket he looked like one of the midgetsin their skit about crippled waiters in a fancy restaurant egg was waiting for me to wake up so that i could help him tie his tie on the bed beside him the great grinning dog sorrow sat with the frozen idiot glee of the truly insane you go tomorrow egg i said we go today but you and mother dont go until tomorrow i want to be ready egg said anxiously i tied his tie for himto humour him he was dressing up sorrowin an appropriate flying costumewhen i brought my bags down to the volkswagen bus egg and sorrow followed me downstairs if youve room mother said to father i wish one of you would take the dead dog no egg said i want sorrow to stay with me you know you can check him through with the bags fritz said its not necessary to carry him on board he can sit in my lap egg said and that was that the trunks had been sent ahead of us the carryon and checkthrough bags were packed the midgets were waving hanging from the fire escape at ronda rays window was her orange nightgownonce shocking now faded like the canvas for fritzs act mrs urick and max stood at the delivery entrance mrs urick had been scouring pansshe had her rubber gloves onand max was holding a leaf basket four hundred and sixtyfour max called frank blushed he kissed mother see you soon he said franny kissed egg see you soon egg franny said what said egg he had undressed sorrow the beast was naked lilly was crying four hundred and sixtyfour max urick screamed witlessly ronda ray was there a little orange juice on her white waitress uniform keep running johno she whispered but nicely she kissed meshe kissed everyone but frank who had crawled into the volkswagen bus to avoid the contact lilly kept crying one of the midgets was riding lillys old bicycle and just as we were leaving elliot park the animals for fritzs act arrived we saw the long flatbed trailers the cages and the chains fritz had to stop the bus for a moment he ran around giving everyone directions in our own cagein the volkswagen buswe peered at the animals we had been wondering if they would be dwarf species ponies lilly said blubbering and a chimpanzee in a cage with red elephants painted on its sidelike a childs bedroom wallpapera big ape was shrieking perfectly ordinary animals frank said a sled dog circled the bus barking one of the lady midgets began to ride the dog no tigers said franny disappointed no lions no elephants see the bear said father in a grey cage with nothing painted on it a dark figure sat swaying in place rocking to some sad inner tuneits nose too long its rump too broad its neck too thick its paws too short to ever be happy thats a bear franny said there was a cage that looked full of geese or chickens it was mostly a dog and pony circus it seemedwith one ape and one disappointing bear mere tokens toward the exotic hopefulness in us all looking back on them in elliot park as fritz returned to the bus and drove us forwardto the airport and to viennai saw that egg still held in his arms the most exotic animal of them all with lilly crying beside me i imagined i sawin the chaos of moving midgets and unloading animalsa whole circus called sorrow instead of fritzs act mother waved and mrs urick and ronda ray waved with her max urick was yelling but we couldnt hear him frannys lips in time with his whispered four hundred and sixtyfour frank was already reading the german dictionary and fatherwho was not a man for looking backsat up front with fritz and talked rapidly about nothing at all lilly wept but as harmlessly as rain and elliot park disappeared my last look caught egg in motion struggling to run among the midgets sorrow held like an idol above his headan animal for all those other ordinary animals to worship egg was excited and yelling and frannys lipsin time with hiswhispered what what what fritz drove us to boston where franny had to shop for what mother called city underwear lilly wept her way through the lingerie aisles frank and i cruised the escalators we were at the airport much too early fritz apologized for not being able to wait with us his animals needed him he said and father wished him wellthanking him in advance for driving mother and egg to the airport tomorrow frank was approached in the mens room at logan international but he refused to describe the incident to franny and me he continued to say only that he had been approached he was indignant about it and franny and i were furious with him for not spelling it out to us in more detail father bought lilly a plastic carryon flight bag to cheer her up and we boarded the plane before dark i think we took off about or pm the lights of boston on a summer night were half on and half off and there was enough daylight left to see the harbour clearly it was our first time on an airplane and we loved it we flew all night across the ocean father slept the whole way lilly would not sleep she watched the darkness and reported sighting what she said were two ocean liners i dozed and woke dozed and woke again with my eyes shut i watched elliot park turning into a circus most places we leave in childhood grow less not more fancy i imagined returning to dairy and wondered if fritzs act would improve or run down the neighbourhood we landed in frankfurt at quarter to eight in the morning maybe it was quarter to nine deutschland frank said he led us through the frankfurt airport to our connecting flight to vienna reading all the signs out loud speaking amiably to all the foreigners were the foreigners franny kept whispering guten tag frank hailed all the passing strangers those people were french frank franny said im sure of it father almost lost the passports so we attached them with two stout rubber bands to lillys wrist then i carried lilly who seemed exhausted from her tears we left frankfurt at quarter to nine or maybe quarter to ten and arrived in vienna about noon it was a short choppy flight in a smaller plane lilly saw some mountains and was frightened franny said she hoped it would be smoother weather the next day for mother and egg frank vomited twice say it in german frank franny said but frank felt too terrible to answer her we had a day and a night and the next morning to get the gasthaus freud ready for mother and egg our flight had totaled about eight hours in the airabout six or seven from boston to frankfurt and another hour or so to vienna the flight that mother and egg were taking was supposed to leave boston slightly later in the evening of the next day and fly to zurich their connecting flight to vienna would take about an hour and boston to zurichlike our flight to frankfurtwas scheduled for about seven hours but mother and eggand sorrowlanded short of zurich less than six hours out of boston they struck the atlantic ocean a glancing blowoff the coastline of that part of the continent called france in my imagination later and illogically it was some slight consolation to know that they did not fall in darkness and to imagine that there mightin their mindshave been some hopefulness implied by the vision of solid ground in the distance though they did not reach the ground it is too unlikely to imagine that egg was sleeping although anyone would hope so knowing egg he would have been wideawake the whole waysorrow jouncing on his knees egg would have had the window seat what went wrong we were told went wrong quickly but surely there would have been time to blurt out some advicein some language and time for mother to kiss egg and squeeze him time for egg to ask what and though we had moved to the city of freud i must say that dreams are vastly overrated my dream of mothers death was inexact and i would never dream it again her deathby some considerable stretch of the imaginationmight have been initiated by the man in the white dinner jacket but no pretty white sloop sailed her away she shot from the sky to the bottom of the sea with her son beside her screaming sorrow hugged to his chest it was sorrow of course that the rescue planes saw searching for the sunken wreckage trying to spot the first debris upon the surface of the grey morning water someone saw a dog swimming closer examination convinced the rescue crew that the dog was just another victim there were no survivors and how could the rescue crew have known that this dog was already dead this knowledge of what led the rescue crew to the bodies came as no surprise to my surviving family we had learned this fact of sorrow previously from frank sorrow floats it was franny who said later that we must all watch out for whatever form sorrow would take next we must learn to recognize the different poses frank was silent pondering the responsibilities of resurrectionalways a source of mystery to him and now a source of pain father had to identify the bodies he left us in freuds care and travelled by train later he wouldnt speak often of mother or egg he was not a backwardlooking man and his need to care for us no doubt prevented him from such indulgent and dangerous reflection no doubt it would have crossed his mind that this was what freud wanted mother to forgive my father for lilly would weep knowing all along that fritzs act would have been smaller and easier to live withall around and i with egg and mother goneand sorrow in an unknown pose or in disguisei knew we had arrived in a foreign country sorrow floats ronda ray whose breathing first seduced me over an intercomwhose warm strong heavy hands i can still feel occasionally in my sleepwould never leave the first hotel new hampshire she would remain faithful to fritzs act and serve them wellperhaps discovering as she grew older that waiting on midgets and making their beds were altogether preferable to the services shed rendered to more fully grown adults one day fritz would write us that ronda ray had diedin her sleep after losing mother and egg no death would ever strike me as appropriate though franny said that rondas was it was more appropriate at least than the unfortunate passing of max urick who succumbed to life in the hotel new hampshire in a bathtub on the third floor perhaps max never got over his irritation at having to give up the smaller bathroom equipment and his cherished hideaway on the fourth floor because i imagine him plagued by the sense if not by the actual sound of the midgets living over his head i always thought it was probably the same bathtub where egg attempted to conceal sorrow that finally did in maxhaving come close to doing the job on bitty tuck fritz never explained which tub it was just that it was on the third floor max had appeared to suffer a stroke while bathinghe subsequently drowned that an old sailor whod come back from the deep so many times should end it all in a bathtub was a source of anguish to poor mrs urick who found maxs leaving so inappropriate four hundred and sixtyfour franny would go on saying whenever we mentioned max mrs urick is still the cook for fritzs act todayperhaps a testament to the food and to the life of plainness but goodness one christmas lilly would send her a pretty handwritten scroll with these words from an anonymous poet translated from the anglosaxon they who live humbly have angels from heaven to carry them courage and strength and belief amen fritz of fritzs act surely had similar angels looking after him he would retire in dairy making the hotel new hampshire his yearround home when he no longer hit the road and the winter circus circuit with the younger midgets lilly would get sad whenever she thought of him because if it had been fritzs size that first impressed her it was the vision of staying in fritzs hotel new hampshire instead of going to vienna that lilly imagined whenever she thought of fritzand lilly would therefore imagine how all our lives might have been different if we had not lost mother and egg no angels from heaven had been on hand to save them but of course we had no such vision of the world when we first saw vienna freuds vienna as frank would sayand we knew which freud he meant all over vienna in were the gaps between the buildings were the buildings collapsed and airy the buildings left as the bombs had left them in some rubbled lots often the perimeters of playgrounds abandoned by children one had the feeling of unexploded bombs buried in the raked and orderly debris between the airport and the outer districts we passed a russian tank that had been firmly arrangedin concreteas a kind of memorial the tanks top hatch was sprouting flowers its long barrel was draped with flags its red star faded and speckled by birds it was permanently parked in front of what looked like a post office but our cab flew by too fast for us to be sure sorrow floats but we arrived in vienna before our bad news arrived and we were inclined toward a cautious optimism the war damage was more contained as we approached the inner districts on occasion even the sun shone through the elaborate buildingsand a row of stone cupids leaned off a roof over us their bellies pockmarked by machinegun fire more people appeared in the streets though the outer districts resembled one of those old sepia photographs taken at a time of day before everyone was upor after everyone had been killed its spooky lilly ventured out of fright she had finally stopped crying its old franny said wo ist die geműtlichkeit frank sang cheerfullylooking around for some i think your mother will like it here father said optimistically egg wont like it franny said egg wont be able to hear it frank said mother will hate it too lilly said four hundred and sixtyfour franny said our driver said something unintelligible even father could tell it wasnt german frank struggled to talk with the man and discovered he was hungarianfrom the recent revolution we searched the rearview mirror and our drivers dull eyes for signs of lasting woundsimagining them if not seeing them then a park burst beside us on our right and a building as lovely as a palace it was a palace and out a courtyard gate came a cheerful fat woman in a nurses uniform clearly a nanny pushing in front of her a doubleseater baby carriage someone had had twins and frank read an idiot statistic from a mindless travel brochure a city of fewer than one and a half million people frank read to us vienna still has more than three hundred coffeehouses we stared out of our cab at the streets expecting them to be stained with coffee franny rolled down her window and sniffed there was the diesel rankness of europe but no coffee it would not take us long to learn what coffeehouses were for for sitting a long time for homework for talking to whores for darts for billiards for drinking more than coffee for making plansfor our escapeand of course for insomnia and for dreams but then we were dazzled by the fountain at the schwarzenbergplatz we crossed the ringstrasse jolly with streetcars and our driver began chanting to himself krugerstrasse krugerstrasse as if by this repetition the little street would leap out at us it did and then gasthaus freud gasthaus freud the gasthaus freud did not leap out at us our driver slowly drove right by it and frank ran into the kaffe mowatt to ask directions it was then pointed out to usthe building we had missed gone was the candy store although the signs for the former konditoreibonbons and so forthwere leaning against the window inside father assumed this meant that freudin preparation for our arrivalhad begun the expansion plans had bought out the candy store but upon closer inspection we realized that a fire had destroyed the konditorei and must have at least threatened the inhabitants of the adjacent gasthaus freud we entered the small dark hotel passing the new sign by the gutted candy store the sign frank translated said dont step on the sugar dont step on the sugar frank franny said thats what it says frank said and indeed entering cautiously into the lobby of the gasthaus freud we felt a certain stickiness on the floor no doubt from those feet that had already trafficked on the sugarthe hideous glaze from the candy melted in the fire and now the ghastly smell of burnt chocolate overwhelmed us lilly staggering with her little bags stumbled into the lobby first and screamed we were expecting freud but we had forgotten freuds bear lilly had not expected to see it in the lobbyloose and none of us expected to see it on the couch by the reception desk its short legs crossed while it rested its heels on a chair it appeared to be reading a magazine an apparently smart bear as freud had claimed but lillys scream startled the pages right out of its paws and it gathered itself together in a bearlike fashion it swung itself off the couch and ambled sideways toward the reception desk not really looking at us and we saw how small it wassquat but short no longer or taller than a labrador retriever we all were thinking but considerably denser thickwaisted bigassed stoutarmed it rose up on its hind legs and gave the bell on the reception desk a terrible clout bashing the bell so violently that the little ping was muffled by the thump of the animals paw jesus god said father is that you cried a voice is that win berry the bear impatient that freud had still not emerged picked up the bell on the reception desk and whistled it across the lobby the bell struck a door with great forcewith the sound of a hammer banging an organ pipe i hear you freud cried jesus god is that you and he came out of the room with open armsa figure as strange to us children as any bear it was the first time we children realized that father had learned his jesus god from freud and perhaps the contrast this information made with freuds body was what surprised us freuds body bore no resemblance to my fathers athletic shape and movements if fritz had allowed his midgets to vote freud might have been admitted to their circushe was only slightly larger than they were his body seemed stricken with something like an abridged history of his former power he was now simply solid and compact the black hair wed been told about was white and long with the flyaround quality of corn silk he had a cane like a club like a baseball batwhich we realized later was a baseball bat the strange patch of hair that grew on his cheek was still the size of an average coin but its colour was as grey as a sidewalkthe nondescript and neglected colour of a city street but the main thing about how freud had aged was that he was blind is that you freud called across the lobby facing not father but the ancient iron post that began the banister of the staircase over here my father said softly freud opened his arms and groped toward my fathers voice win berry freud cried and the bear swiftly rushed to him caught the old mans elbow with its rough paw and propelled him in my fathers direction when freud slowed his pace fearful of chairs out of place or feet to trip over the bear butted him with its head from behind not just a smart bear we children thought here was a seeing eye bear freud now had a bear to see for him unquestionably this was the kind of bear who could change your life we watched the blind gnome hugging my father we watched their awkward dance in the dingy lobby of the gasthaus freud as their voices softened we could hear the typewriters going at it from the third floorthe radicals making their music the leftists writing up their versions of the world even the typewriters sounded sure of themselvesat odds with all those other flawed versions of the world but sure they were right absolutely believing it every word taptaptapping into place like fingers drumming impatiently on tabletops fingers marking time between speeches but wasnt this better than arriving at night admittedly the lobby would have looked better cared for under the mellow glow of inadequate lighting and the forgiveness of darkness but wasnt it better for us children to hear the typewriters and see the bearbetter than to hear or imagine the lunging of beds the traffic of the prostitutes going up and down the stairs the guilty greetings and goodbyes going on all night in the lobby the bear nosed between us children lilly was wary of it it was bigger than she was i felt shy frank tried to be friendlyin germanbut the bear had eyes only for franny the bear pressed its broad head against frannys waist the bear jabbed its snout in my sisters crotch franny jumped and laughed and freud said susie are you being nice are you being rude susie the bear turned to him and made a short run at him on all fours the bear butted the old man in the stomachknocking him to the floor my father seemed inclined to intervene but freudleaning on the baseball batgot back to his feet it was hard to tell if he was chuckling oh susie he said in the wrong direction susies just showing off she dont like criticism freud said and shes not so fond of men as she is of the girls where are the girls the old man said his hands held out in two directions and franny and lilly went to himsusie the bear following franny nudging her affectionately from behind frank suddenly obsessed with making friends with the bear tugged the animals coarse fur stammering uh you must be susie the bear weve all heard a lot about you im frank sprechen sie deutsch no no said freud not german susie dont like german she speaks your language freud said in franks general direction frank oafishly bent down to the bear tugging its fur again do you shake hands susie frank asked bending down but the bear turned to face him the bear stood up shes not being rude is she freud cried susie be nice dont be rude standing up the bear wasnt as tall as any of usexcept she was taller than lilly and she was taller than freud the bears snout came to franks chin they stood face to face for a moment the bear shifting its weight on its hind legs shuffling like a boxer im frank frank said nervously to the bear holding out his hand then with both hands he tried to grasp the bears right paw and shake it keep your hands to yourself kid the bear said to frank cuffing franks arms apart with a swift short blow frank reeling backwards stumbled on the reception bellwhich made a quick ping howd you do that franny asked freud howd you make it talk nobody makes me talk honey susie the bear said nuzzling frannys hip lilly screamed again the bear talks the bear talks she cried shes a smart bear freud shouted didnt i tell you the bear talks lilly screamed hysterically at least i dont scream susie the bear said then she dropped all semblance of bearlike mannerisms she walked upright and sullenly back to the couchwhere lillys first scream had disturbed her she sat down and crossed her legs and put her feet on the chair it was time magazine that she was reading a rather outofdate issue susies from michigan freud said as if this explained everything but she went to college in new york shes very smart i went to sarah lawrence the bear said but i dropped out what an elitist crock of shit she saidof sarah lawrencethe world of time magazine passing impatiently through her paws shes a girl father said its a girl in a bear suit a woman susie said watch it it was only susie was a bear ahead of her time a woman in a bear suit frank said with lilly sliding against me and clutching my leg there are no smart bears freud said ominously except this kind upstairs the typewriters were quarreling over our stunned silence we regarded susie the beara smart bear indeed and a seeing eye bear too knowing she was not a real bear suddenly made her appear larger she took on new power before us she was more than freuds eyes we thought she might be his heart and mind too father viewed the lobby while his old blind mentor leaned on him for support and what was father seeing this time i wondered what castle what palace what deluxeclass possibility looming larger and largeras he passed over the sagging couch where the shebear sat passed over the imitation impressionists the pink bovine nudes fallen in flowers of light on the clashing floral wallpaper and the easy chair with its stuffing exploding like the bombs to be imagined under all the debris in the outer districts and the one reading lamp too dim to dream by too bad about the candy store father said to freud too bad freud cried nein nein nicht too bad its good the place is gone and they had no insurance we can buy them upcheap give ourselves a lobby people will noticefrom the street freud cried though of course there was nothing his own eyes would notice or could a very fortunate fire freud said a fire perfectly timed for your arrival freud said squeezing my fathers arm a brilliant fire freud said a smart bears sort of fire said susie the bear cynically tearing her way through the old issue of time did you set it franny asked susie the bear you bet your sweet ass honey susie said oh there once was a woman who had also been raped but when i told her frannys story and how it seemed to me that franny had handled itby not handling it perhaps or by denying the worst of itthis woman told me that franny and i were wrong wrong i said you bet your ass this woman said franny was raped not beaten up and those bastards did get the her in heras your bullshit black friend calls it whats he know a rape expert because hes got a sister your sister robbed herself of the only weapon she had against those punkstheir semen and nobody stopped her from washing herself nobody made her deal with itso shes going to be dealing with it all her life in fact she sacrificed her own integrity by not fighting her attackers in the first placeand you this woman said to me you conveniently diffused the rape of your sister and robbed the rape of its integrity by running off to find the hero instead of staying on the scene and dealing with it yourself a rape has integrity frank asked i went to get help i said they just would have beaten the shit out of me and raped her anyway ive got to talk to your sister honey this woman said shes into her own amateurish psychology and it wont work believe me i know rape whoa iowa bob said once all psychology is amateurish fuck freud and all that that freud anyway my father had added and i would think later maybe our freud too anyway this rapeexpert woman said that frannys apparent reaction to her own rape was bullshit and knowing that franny still wrote letters to chipper dove made me wonder the rapeexpert woman said that rape simply wasnt like that that it didnt have that effectat all she knew she said it had happened to her and in college shed joined a kind of club of women whod all been raped and they had agreed among themselves exactly what it was like and what were the exactly correct responses to have to it even before she started talking to franny i could see how desperately important this womans private unhappiness was to her and howin her mindthe only credible reaction to the event of rape was hers that someone else might have responded differently to a similar abuse only meant to her that the abuse couldnt possibly have been the same people are like that iowa bob would have said they need to make their own worst experiences universal it gives them a kind of support and who can blame them it is just infuriating to argue with someone like that because of an experience that has denied them their humanity they go around denying another kind of humanity in others which is the truth of human varietyit stands alongside our sameness too bad for her she probably has had a most unhappy life iowa bob would have said indeed this woman had had a most unhappy life this rapeexpert woman was susie the bear whats this little event among so many bullshit susie the bear asked franny whats this luckiest day of my life bullshit susie asked her those thugs didnt just want to fuck you honey they wanted to take your strength away and you let them any woman who accepts a violation of herself so passively how you can actually say that you knew somehow chip dove would be the first sweetheart you have minimized the enormity of what has happened to youjust to make it a little easier to take whose rape is it franny asked susie the bear i mean youve got yours ive got mine if i say nobody got the me in me then nobody got it you think they get it every time you bet your sweet ass honey susie said a rapist is using his prick as a weapon nobody uses a weapon on you without getting you for example said susie the bear hows your sex life these days shes only sixteen i said shes not supposed to have such a great sex lifeat sixteen im not confused franny said theres sex and then theres rape she said day and night then how come you keep saying chipper dove was the first franny i asked her quietly you bet your assthats the point said susie the bear look franny said to uswith frank uncomfortably playing solitaire and pretending not to listen with lilly following our conversation like a championship tennis match that demanded reverence for every stroke look franny said the point is i own my own rape its mine i own it ill deal with it my way but youre not dealing with it susie said you never got angry enough youve got to get angry youve got to get savage about all the facts youve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed said frank rolling his eyes and quoting old iowa bob im serious said susie the bear she was too serious of coursebut more likable than she at first appeared susie the bear would finally get rape right after a while she would run a very fine rape crisis center later in her life and she would write in the very first line of advice in the rapecounseling literature that the matter of who owns the rape is the most important matter she would finally understand that although her anger was essentially healthy for her it might not have been the healthiest thing for franny at the time allow the victim to ventilate she would wisely write in her counseling newsletterand keep your own problems separate from the problems of the victim later susie the bear would really become a rapeexpert womanshe of the famous line watch out the real issue of each rape may not be your real issue kindly consider there might be more than one and to all her rape counselors she would impart this advice it is essential to understand that there is no one way that victims respond and adjust to this crisis any one victim might exhibit all none or any combination of the usual symptoms guilt denial anger confusion fear or something quite different and problems might occur within a week a year ten years or never very true iowa bob would have liked this bear as much as he liked earl but in her first days with us susie was a bear on the rape issueand on a lot of other issues too and we were forced into an intimacy with her that was unnatural because we would suddenly turn to her as we would turn to a mother in the absence of our own mother after a while we would turn to susie for other things almost immediately this smart though harsh bear seemed more allseeing than the blind freud and from our first day and night in our new hotel we turned to susie the bear for all our information who are the people with the typewriters i asked her how much do the prostitutes charge lilly asked her where can i buy a good map frank asked her preferably one that indicates walking tours walking tours frank franny said show the children their rooms susie freud instructed his smart bear somehow we all went first to eggs room which was the worst rooma room with two doors and no windows a cube with a door connecting it to lillys room which was only one window better and a door entering the groundfloor lobby egg wont like it lilly said but lilly was predicting that egg wouldnt like any of it the move the whole thing i suspect she was right and whenever i think of egg now i tend to see him in his room in the gasthaus freud that he never saw egg in an airless windowless box a tiny trapped space in the heart of a foreign hotela room unfit for guests the typical tyranny of families the youngest child always gets the worst room egg would not have been happy in the gasthaus freud and i wonder now if any of us could have been of course we didnt have a fair start we had only a day and a night before the news of mother and egg would settle over us before susie became our seeing eye bear too and father and freud began their duet in the direction of a grand hotela successful hotel at the very least they hoped if not a great hotel at least a good one on the day of arrival father and freud were already making plans father wanted to move the prostitutes to the fifth floor and move the symposium on eastwest relations to the fourth floor thereby clearing floors two and three for guests why should the paying guests have to climb to the fourth and fifth floors father asked freud the prostitutes freud reminded my father are also paying guests he didnt need to add that they also made a number of trips every night and some of their clients are too old for all those stairs freud added if theyre too old for the stairs susie the bear said theyre too old for the dirty action too better to have one croak on the stairs than to have one give up the ship in bedon top of one of the smaller girls jesus god said father maybe give the prostitutes the second floor then and make the damn radicals move to the top intellectuals freud said are in notorious bad shape not all these radicals are intellectuals susie said and we should have an elevator eventually she added im for keeping the whores close to the ground and letting the thinkers do the climbing yes and put the guests in between father said what guests franny asked she and frank had checked the registration the gasthaus freud had no guests its just the candy fire freud said it smoked out the guests once we get the lobby right the guests will pour in and the fucking will keep them awake all night and the typewriters will wake them up in the morning said susie the bear a kind of bohemian hotel frank said optimistically what do you know about bohemians frank franny asked in franks room was a dressmakers dummy formerly the property of a prostitute who had kept a permanent room in the hotel it was a stoutish dummy upon which perched the chipped head of a mannequin freud claimed had been stolen from one of the big department stores on the kärntnerstrasse a pretty but pitted face with her wig askew perfect for all your costume changes frank franny said frank sullenly hung his coat on it very funny he said frannys room adjoined mine we shared a bath with an ancient bathtub in it the tub was deep enough to stew an ox in the wc was down the hall and directly off the lobby only fathers room had its own bath and its own wc it appeared that susie shared the bath franny and i shared although she could enter it only through one of our rooms dont sweat it susie said i dont wash a whole lot we could tell the odor was not exactly bear but it was acrid salty rich and strong and when she took her bears head off and we saw her dark damp hairher pale pockmarked face and her haggard nervous eyeswe felt more comfortable with her appearance as a bear what you see susie said are the ravishments of acnemy teenage misery i am the original notbadifyouputabagoverherhead girl dont feel bad said frank im a homosexual im not in for such a hot time as a teenager either well at least youre attractive said susie the bear your whole family is attractive she said darting a mean look at us all you may get discriminated against but let me tell you theres no discrimination quite like the ugly treatment i was an ugly kid and i just get uglier every fucking day we couldnt help staring at her in the bear costume without the head we wondered of course if susies own body was as burly as a bears and when we saw her later in the afternoon sweating in her tshirt and gym shorts doing squats and knee bends against the wall of freuds officewarming up for her role when the radicals checked out for the day and the prostitutes came on at nightwe could see she was physically suited to her particular form of animal imitation pretty chunky huh she said to me too many bananas iowa bob might have said and not enough road work butto be fairit was hard for susie to go anywhere not dressed and performing as a bear exercise is difficult when dressed as a bear i cant blow my cover or were in trouble she said because how could freud ever keep order without her susie the bear was the enforcer when the radicals were bothered by troublemakers from the right when there were violent shouting matches in the hall and on the staircase when some newwave fascist started screaming nothing is freewhen a small mob came to protest in the lobby carrying the banner that said the symposium on eastwest relations should move farther eastit was at these times that freud needed her susie said get out youre making the bear hostile freud would shout sometimes it took a low growl and a short charge its funny susie said im not really so tough but no one tries to fight a bear all i have to do is grab someone and they roll into a ball and start moaning i just sort of breathe on the bastards i just kind of lay a little weight on them no one fights back if youre a bear because of the radicals gratitude for this bearish protection there was really no problem telling the radicals to move upstairs my father and freud explained their case in midafternoon father offered me as a typewriter mover and i began carrying the machines up to the empty fifthfloor rooms there were a halfdozen typewriters and a mimeograph machine the usual office supplies a seeming excess of telephones i got a little tired with the third or fourth desk but i hadnt been doing my usual weight liftingwhile we were travelingand so i appreciated the exercise i asked a couple of the younger radicals if they knew where i could get a set of barbells but they seemed very suspiciousthat we were americansand either they didnt understand english or they chose to speak their own language there was a brief protest from an older radical who struck up what appeared to be quite a lively argument with freud but susie the bear started whining and rolling her head around the old mans anklesas if she were trying to blow her nose on the cuffs of his pantsand he calmed down and climbed the stairs even though he knew susie wasnt a real bear what are they writing franny asked susie i mean is it one of those newsletter kind of things is it propaganda why do they have so many phones i asked because we hadnt heard the phones ringing not oncenot all day they make a lot of outgoing calls susie said i think theyre into threatening phone calls and i dont read their newsletters im not into their politics but what are their politics frank asked to change fucking everything susie said to start again they want to wipe the slate clean they want a whole new ball game so do i said frank that sounds like a good idea theyre scary said lilly they look right over you and they dont see you when theyre looking right at you well youre pretty short said susie the bear they sure look at me a lot and one of them looks at franny a lot i said thats not what i mean said lilly i mean they dont see people when they look at you thats because theyre thinking about how everything could be different frank said people too frank franny asked do they think people could be different do you yeah said susie the bear like we could all be dead grief makes everything intimate in our grieving for mother and egg we got to know the radicals and whores as if we had always known them we were the bereft children motherless to the whores our golden brother slain to the radicals and soto compensate for our gloom and the added gloom of the conditions in the gasthaus freudthe radicals and whores treated us pretty well and despite their dayandnight differences they bore more similarities to each other than they might have supposed they both believed in the commercial possibilities of a simple ideal they both believed they could one day be free they both thought that their own bodies were objects easily sacrificed for a cause and easily restored or replaced after the hardship of the sacrifice even their names were similarif for different reasons they had only code names or nicknames or if they used their real names they used only their first names two of them actually shared the same name but there was no confusion since the radical was male the whore was female and they were never at the gasthaus freud at the same time the name was old billigbillig in german means cheap the oldest whore was called this because her prices were substandard for the district of the city she strolled the krugerstrasse whores although krugerstrasse was in the first district were themselves a sort of subdistrict to the kärntnerstrasse whores around the corner if you turned off the kärntnerstrasse onto our tiny street it was as if you were lowering yourself by comparison into a world without light one street off the kärntnerstrasse you lost the glow of the hotel sacher and the grand gleam of the state opera and you noticed how the whores wore more eyeshadow how their knees buckled slightly or their ankles appeared to cave in from standing too long or how they appeared to be thicker in the waistlike the dressmakers dummy in franks room old billig was the captain of the krugerstrasse whores her namesake among the radicals was the old gentleman who had argued most ferociously with freud about moving to the fifth floor this old billig had earned his cheap designation for his reputation of leading a handtomouth existenceand his history of being what the other radicals called a radicals radical when there were bolsheviks he was one when the names changed he changed his name he was at the forefront of every movement butsomehowwhen the movement ran amok or into terminal trouble old billig took up the rear position and discreetly trailed away out of sight waiting for the next forefront the idealists among the younger radicals were both suspicious of old billig and admiring of his endurancehis survival this was not unlike the view held of old billig the whore by her colleagues seniority is an institution that is revered and resented in and out of society like old billig the radical old billig the whore was the most argumentative with freud about changing floors but youre going down freud said youll have to climb one less flight of stairs in a hotel with no elevator the second floor is an improvement over the third i could follow freuds german but not old billigs answer frank told me that she protested on the grounds of having too many mementos to move look at this boy freud said groping around for me look at his muscles freud of course looked at my muscles by feeling them squeezing and punching me he shoved me in the general direction of the old whore feel him freud cried he can move every memento you got if we gave him a day he could move the whole hotel and frank told me what old billig said i dont need to feel any more muscles old billig told freud declining the offer to squeeze me i feel muscles in my frigging sleep she said sure he can move the mementos she said but i dont want nothing broken and so i moved old billigs mementos with the greatest of care a collection of china bears that rivaled mothers collection and after mothers death old billig would invite me to visit her room in the daylight hourswhen she was off duty and gone from the gasthaus freudand i could spend a quiet time alone with her bears remembering mothers collection which perished with her old billig also liked plantsplants that leaped out of those pots designed to resemble animals and birds flowers springing from the backs of frogs ferns sprawling over a grove of flamingos an orange tree sprouting from the head of an alligator the other whores mostly had changes of clothes and cosmetics and medicines to move it was strange to think of them as having only night rooms at the gasthaus freudas opposed to ronda ray having her dayroom it struck me how dayrooms and night rooms were used for similar purposes we met the whores that first night we helped them move from the third to the second floor there were four whores on the krugerstrasse plus old billig their names were babette jolanta dark inge and screaming annie babette was called babette because she was the only one who spoke french she tended to get most of the french customers the french being most sensitive about speaking any language but french babette was smalland therefore lillys favoritewith a pixie face that the somber light in the lobby of the gasthaus freud could cause to look at certain angles unpleasantly rodentlike in later years i would think of babette as probably anoretic without knowing itnone of us knew what anorexia was in she wore flowery prints very summerlike dresseseven when it wasnt summerand she had a funny kind of overpowdered sense about her as if if you touched her a small puff of powder would blast through her pores at other times her skin had a waxiness about it as if if you touched her your finger might leave a dent lilly told me once that babettes smallness was an important part of her lillys growing up because babette helped lilly realize that small people could actually have sex with large people and not be altogether destroyed thats how lilly liked to put it not altogether destroyed jolanta called herself jolanta because she said it was a polish name and she was fond of polish jokes she was squarefaced stronglooking as big as frank and nearly as awkward she gave off a heartiness that you suspected of being falseas if in the middle of a booming good joke she might turn suddenly sour and produce a knife from her handbag or grind a wineglass into someones face she was broadshouldered and heavybreasted solid in her legs but not fatjolanta had the robust charm of a peasant whod been strangely corrupted by a sneaky sort of city violence she looked erotic but dangerous in my first days and nights at the gasthaus freud it was her image i most often masturbated toit was jolanta i had the greatest trouble speaking to not because she was the most coarse but because i was the most afraid of her how can you recognize a polish prostitute she asked me i had to ask frank for a translation because she pays you to fuck her jolanta said this i understood without franks help did you get it frank asked me jesus yes frank i said then laugh frank said youd better laugh and i looked at jolantas handsshe had the wrists of a farmer the knuckles of a boxerand laughed dark inge was not a laugher shed had a most unhappy life more important she had not lived very much of her life yet she was only eleven a mulattowith an austrian mother and a black american g i for her fathershed been born at the start of the occupation her father had left with the occupying powers in and nothing hed told inge or her mother about the treatment of black people in the united states had made them want to go with him dark inges english was the best among the whores and when father left for franceto identify the bodies of mother and eggit was dark inge we spent most of our sleepless nights with she was as tall as i was although she was only lillys age and the way they dressed her up made her look as old as franny lithe and pretty and mochacolored she worked as a tease she was not a real whore she was not allowed to stroll the krugerstrasse without another whore beside her unless she strolled the krugerstrasse with susie the bear when any man wanted her he was told he could only look at herand touch himself dark inge was not old enough to be touched and no man was allowed to be alone in a room with her if a man wanted to be with her susie the bear kept them company it was a simple system but it worked if a man looked as if he was about to touch dark inge susie the bear would make the necessary sounds and gestures preparatory to a charge if the man asked dark inge to take off too many clothes or if he insisted she look at him while he masturbated susie the bear would get restless youre making the bear hostile dark inge would warn the man who would leaveor else finish masturbating quickly while dark inge looked away all the whores knew that susie the bear could get to their rooms in a matter of seconds all it required was some cry of distress because susielike any welltrained animalknew all their voices by heart babettes nasal little yelp jolantas violent bellow old billigs shattering mementos but to us children the worst customers were the shamefaced men who masturbated to only the most modest glimpses of dark inge i dont think i could beat off with a bear in my room frank said i dont think you could beat off with susie in your room frank franny said lilly shuddered and i joined her with father in francewith those bodies most important to uswe viewed the body traffic in the gasthaus freud with that detachment peculiar to mourners when i get old enough dark inge told us i can charge for the real thing it surprised us children that the real thing cost more money than beating off while watching inge dark inges mother was planning to get inge out of the business by the time her daughter was old enough dark inges mother planned to retire her daughter before her daughter came of age dark inges mother was the fifth lady of the night in the gasthaus freudthe one called screaming annie she made more money than any other whore on the krugerstrasse because she was working for a respectable retirement for her daughter and for herself if you wanted a frail flower or a little french you asked for babette if you wanted experience and a bargain you got old billig if you courted dangerif you liked a touch of violenceyou could take your chances with jolanta if you were ashamed of yourself you could pay to steal a look at dark inge and if you desired the ultimate deception you went with screaming annie as susie the bear said screaming annies got the best fake orgasm in the business screaming annies fake orgasm could jar lilly out of her worst nightmares it could cause frank to sit bolt upright in bed and howl in terror at the dark figure of the dressmakers dummy lurking at the foot of his bed it could rip me out of the deepest sleepsuddenly wideawake with an erection or grabbing my own throat to feel where it was slashed screaming annie in my opinion was an argumentall by herselffor not having the whores occupy the floor most immediately above our own she could even stir father out of his griefeven upon his immediate return from france jesus god he would say and come to kiss each of us and see if we were safe only freud could sleep through it leave it to freud frank said to not be fooled by a fake orgasm frank thought himself very clever for this oftrepeated remarkbecause of course he meant the other freud not our blind manager screaming annie could sometimes fool even susie the bear who would grumble god thats got to be a real one or worse susie would occasionally confuse a fake orgasm with a possible scream for help thats nobody coming for christs sake susie would roar reminding me of ronda ray that is somebody dying and she would go bawling down the secondfloor hall throw herself against screaming annies door charge the wrecked bed with her terrifying snarlscausing screaming annies mate to fly or faint or wither on the spot and screaming annie would say mildly no no susie nothings wrong hes a nice man by which time it was often too late to revive the manat the very least reduced to a cringing shrunken shape of fear thats the ultimate guilt trip franny used to say just when some guys about to get off a bear busts into the room and starts mauling him actually honey susie told franny i think some of them get off on that were there actually some customers at the gasthaus freud who could only come when attacked by a bear i wondered but we were too young we would never know some things about that place like the ghouls of all our halloweens past the clientele in the gasthaus freud would never be quite real for us at least not the whores and their customersand not the radicals old billig the radical old billig was the first to arrive like iowa bob he said he was too old to waste what was left of his life asleep he got there so early in the morning that he occasionally passed the last whore on his way in her way out this was inevitably screaming annie working the hardest hoursto save herself and her dark daughter susie the bear slept in the early morning hours there was little whore trouble after dawn as if the light kept people safeif not always honestand the radicals never started quarreling before midmorning most of the radicals were late sleepers they wrote their manifestos all day and made their threatening phone calls they harassed each otherin the absence of more tangible enemies father would say of them father after all was a capitalist who else could even imagine the perfect hotel who but a capitalist and a basic nonrocker of the boat would even want to live in a hotel to manage a nonindustry to sell a product that was sleepnot worka product that was at least rest if not recreation my father thought the radicals were more ludicrous than the whores i think that after the death of my mother my father felt familiar with the confusions of lust and loneliness perhaps he was even grateful for the businessas the whores called their work he was less sympathetic to the worldchangers to the idealists bent on altering the unpleasantries of human nature this surprises me now because i think of father as simply another kind of idealistbut of course father was more determined to outlive unpleasantries than change them that my father would never learn german also kept him isolated from the radicals by comparison the whores spoke better english the radical old billig knew one phrase of english he liked to tickle lilly or give her a lollipop while he teased her yankee go home he would say to her lovingly hes a sweet old fart franny said frank tried to teach old billig another english phrase that frank thought billig would like imperialist dog frank would say but billig got this hopelessly confused with nazi swine and it always came out strange the radical who spoke the best english used the code name fehlgeburt it was frank who first explained to me that fehlgeburt means miscarriage in german as in miscarriage of justice frank franny asked no frank said the other kind the baby kind of miscarriage frank said fräulein fehlgeburt as she was calledmiss miscarriage to us childrenhad never been pregnant thus had never miscarried she was a university student whose code name was miscarriage because the only other woman on the staff of the symposium on eastwest relations had the code name pregnant she had been fräulein schwangerfor schwanger means pregnant in germanwas an older woman fathers age who was famous in viennese radical circles for a past pregnancy she had written a whole book about being pregnant and another booka kind of sequel to the firstabout having an abortion when she was first pregnant she had worn a bright red sign saying pregnant on her chestschwangerunder which in letters of the same size was the question are you the father it had made a sensational book jacket too and she had donated all her royalties to various radical causes her subsequent abortionand that bookhad made her a popular subject for controversy she could still draw a crowd when she gave a speech and she was a loyal donator of the proceeds schwangers abortion bookpublished in simultaneously with the end of the occupationhad made the expulsion of this unwanted child symbolic of austrias freeing herself from the occupying powers the father schwanger wrote could have been russian french british or american at least to my body and to my way of thinking he was an unwanted foreigner schwanger was close to susie the bear the two shared a great many rape theories together but schwanger would also befriend my father she appeared to be the most consoling to him after my mothers loss not because there was anything between them as they say but because the calmness of her voicethe steady soft cadence of her speechwas the most like my mothers of all the voices in gasthaus freud like my mother schwanger was a gentle persuader im just a realist she had a way of saying so innocentlythough her hopes for wiping the slate clean for starting a new world from scratch were as fervent as the fire dreams of any of the radicals schwanger took us children with her several times a day for coffee with milk and cinnamon and whipped cream at the kaffee europa on kärntnerstrasseor to the kaffee mozart at albertinaplatz zwei just behind the state opera in case you dont know it frank would say laterand over and over the third man was filmed at the kaffee mozart schwanger couldnt have cared less it was the whipped cream that drove her away from the clatter of typewriters and the heat of debate it was the calm of the coffeehouse that got to her the only worthwhile institution in our societya shame that the coffeehouse will have to go too schwanger told frank franny lilly and me drink up dears when you wanted whipped cream you asked for schlagobers and if schwanger meant pregnant to the other radicals she meant pure schlagobers to us children she was our motherlike radical with a weakness for whipped cream we really liked her and young fräulein fehlgeburt whose major at the university of vienna was american literature adored schwanger we thought she seemed actually proud to be codenamed miscarriage perhaps because we thought that fehlgeburt in german could also mean abortion im sure this cant be true but in franks dictionary at least the word for miscarriage and abortion was the same word fehlgeburtwhich symbolizes perfectly our outofitness with the radicals our failure to ever understand them every misunderstanding has at its center a breakdown of language we never actually understood what these two women meantthe tough and motherlike schwanger marshaling forces and money for causes that struck us children as left of reason but able to soothe us with her gentle and most logical voice and her schlagobers and the waiflike stuttering shy university student of american literature miss miscarriage who read aloud to lilly not just to comfort a motherless child but to improve her english she read so well that franny frank and i would almost always listen in fehlgeburt liked to read to us in franks room so it appeared that the dressmakers dummy was listening too it was from fräulein fehlgeburt in the gasthaus freudwith our father in france with our mother and egg dragged from the cold sea under the marker buoy that was sorrowthat we first heard the whole of the great gatsby it was that ending with miss miscarriages lilting austrian accent that really got to lilly gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us it eludes us then but thats no matter fehlgeburt read excitedly tomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms farther miss miscarriage read and one fine morning fehlgeburt paused her saucerlike eyes seemed glazed by that green light gatsby sawmaybe by the orgiastic future too what lilly said breathlessly and a little echo of egg was in franks room with us so we beat on fehlgeburt concluded boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past is that it frank asked is it over he was squinting his eyes were shut so tight of course its over frank franny said dont you know an ending when you hear one fehlgeburt looked drained of her blood her childlike face with a sad grownups frown a strand of her lank blond hair wrapped nervously around a neat pink ear then lilly started in and we couldnt stop her it was late afternoon the whores hadnt come around but when lilly started in susie the bear thought screaming annie was faking an orgasm in a room she didnt belong in susie burst into franks room knocking the dressmakers dummy over and causing poor fräulein fehlgeburt to yip in alarm but even that intrusion couldnt stop lilly her cry seemed caught in her throat her grief seemed to be something she was sure to choke on we could not believe such a small body could generate so much trembling could orchestrate so much sound of course we were all thinking its not that the book moved her so muchits that bit about being borne back ceaselessly into the past its our past thats moving her we were all thinking its mother its egg and how we wont ever be able to forget them but when we calmed her down lilly blurted out suddenly that it was father she was crying for father is a gatsby she cried he is i know he is and we all started in on her at once frank said lilly dont let that orgiastic future stuff get you down its not exactly what iowa bob meant when he was always saying how father lives in the future its a rather different future lilly i said lilly franny said whats the green light lilly i mean for father whats his green light lilly you see lilly frank said as if he were bored gatsby was in love with the idea of being in love with daisy it wasnt even daisy he was in love with not anymore and father hasnt got a daisy lilly frank said choking up just a littlebecause it had probably just occurred to him that father didnt have a wife anymore either but lilly said its the man in the white dinner jacket its father hes a gatsby it eluded us then but thats no matter lilly quoted to us dont you see she shrieked theres always going to be an itand it is going to elude us every time its going to always get away lilly said and fathers not going to stop she said hes going to keep going after it and its always going to get away oh damn it she howled stamping her little foot damn it damn it lilly wailed and she was off again unstoppablea match for screaming annie who could only fake an orgasm lilly we suddenly understood could fake death itself her grief was so real that i thought susie the bear was going to take the bears head off and pay a little human reverence but susie prowled through franks room in her strictly bearish fashion she bumped out the door leaving us to deal with lillys anguish lillys weltschmerz as frank would come to call it the rest of us have anguish frank would say the rest of us have grief the rest of us merely suffer but lilly frank would say lilly has true weltschmerz it shouldnt be translated as worldweariness frank would lecture us thats much too mild for what lillys got lillys weltschmerz is like worldhurt frank would say literally worldthats the welt partand hurt because thats what the schmerz part really is pain real ache lillys got a case of worldhurt frank concluded proudly kind of like sorrow huh frank franny asked kind of frank said stonily sorrow was no friend of franks not anymore in fact the death of mother and eggwith sorrow in eggs lap and rising from the deep to mark the graveconvinced frank to give up trying to properly pose the dead frank would give up taxidermy in all its forms all manifestations of resurrection were to be abandoned by him including religion frank said according to frank religion is just another kind of taxidermy as a result of sorrows tricking him frank would come down very hard on belief of any kind he would become a greater fatalist than iowa bob he would become a greater nonbeliever than franny or me a nearviolent atheist frank would turn to believing only in fatein random fortune or random doom in arbitrary slapstick and arbitrary sorrow he would become a preacher against every bill of goods anyone ever sold from politics to morality frank was always for the opposition by which frank meant the opposing forces but what exactly do these forces oppose frank franny asked him once just oppose every prediction frank advised anything anybodys for be against it anything anybodys against be for it you get on a plane and it doesnt crash that means you got on the right plane frank said and thats all it means frank in other words went off after mother and egg went away frank went ever farther awaysomewherehe went into a religion more vastly lacking in seriousness than even the established religions he joined a kind of antieverything sect or maybe frank founded it lilly said once meaning nihilism meaning anarchy meaning trivial silliness and happiness in the face of gloom meaning depression descending as regularly as night over the most mindless and joyful of days frank believed in zap he believed in surprises he was in constant attack and retreat and he was equally constantly wideeyed and goofily stumbling about in the sudden sunlighttripping across the wasteland littered with bodies from the darkness of just a moment ago he just went crazy lilly said and lilly should know lilly went crazy too she seemed to take mothers and eggs deaths as a personal punishment for some failure deep within herself and so she resolved she would change she resolved among other things to grow at least a little she said grimly determined franny and i were worried about her growth seemed unlikely for lilly and her strenuousness with which we imagined lilly pursuing her own growth was frightening to franny and me i want to change too i said to franny but lillyi dont know lilly is just lilly everyone knows that franny said everyone except lilly i said precisely franny said so how are you going to change you know something better than growing no not better i said i was just a realist in a family of dreamers large and small i knew i couldnt grow i knew i would never really grow up i knew my childhood would never leave me and i would never be quite adult enoughquite responsible enoughfor the world the goddamn welt as frank would say i couldnt change enough and i knew it all i could do was something that would have pleased mother i could give up swearing i could clean up my languagewhich had upset mother so and so i did you mean youre not going to say fuck or shit or cocksucker or even up yours or in the ear or anything anymore franny asked me thats right i said not even asshole franny asked right i said you asshole franny said it makes as much sense as anything else frank reasoned you dumb prick franny baited me i think its rather noble lilly said small but noble he lives in a secondrate whorehouse with people who want to start the world over and he wants to clean up his language franny said cunthead she told me you wretched fart franny said beat your meat all night and dream of tits but you want to sound nice is that it she asked come on franny lilly said you little turd lilly franny said lilly started to cry weve got to stick together franny frank said this sort of abuse is not helpful youre as queer as a cat fart frank she told him and what are you honey susie the bear asked franny what makes you think youre so tough im not so tough franny said you dumb bear youre just an unattractive girl with zitswith zit scars youre scarred by zitsand youd rather be a dumb bear than a human being you think thats tough its fucking easier to be a bear isnt it franny asked susie and to work for an old blind man who thinks youre smartand beautiful too probably franny said im not so tough franny said but i am smart i can get by i can more than get by she said i can get what i wantwhen i know what it is she added i can see how things are franny said and you she said speaking to us alleven poor miss miscarriageyou keep waiting for things to become something else you think father doesnt franny asked me suddenly he lives in the future lilly said still sniffling hes as blind as freud franny said or he soon will be so you know what im going to do she asked us im not going to clean up my language im going to aim my language wherever i want she told me its the one weapon ive got and im only going to grow when im ready to or when its time she told lilly and im not ever going to be like you frank no one else will ever be like you she added affectionately and im not going to be a bear she told susie you sweat like a pig in that stupid costume you get your rocks off making people uneasy but thats because youre uneasy just being you well im easy being me franny said lucky you frank said yes lucky you franny lilly said so what if youre beautiful said susie youre also a bitch from now on im mainly a mother franny said im going to take care of you fuckersyou you and you franny said pointing to frank and lilly and me because mothers not here to do itand iowa bob is gone the shit detectors are gone franny said so im left to detect it i point out the shit thats my role father doesnt know whats going on franny said and we noddedfrank lilly and i even susie the bear nodded we knew this was true father was blind or he soon would be even so i dont need you to mother me frank said to franny but he didnt look so sure lilly went and put her head in frannys lap she cried therecomfortably i thought franny of course knew that i loved herhopelessly and too muchand so i didnt have to make a gesture or say anything to her well i dont need a sixteenyearold straightening me out said susie the bear but her bears head was off she held it in her big paws her ravaged complexion her hurt eyes her toosmall mouth betrayed her she put her bears head back on that was her only authority the student miss miscarriage serious and well intentioned seemed at a loss for words i dont know she said i dont know say it in german frank encouraged her just spit it out any way you can franny said well fehlgeburt said that passage that lovely passage that endingto the great gatsbythats what i mean she said get to it fehlgeburt franny said spit it out well fehlgeburt said i dont know butsomehowit makes me want to go to the united states i mean its against my politicsyour countryi know that but that ending all of itsomehowis just so beautiful it makes me want to be there i mean theres no sense to it but i would just like to be in the united states so you think youd like to be there franny said well i wish wed never left can we go back franny lilly asked well have to ask father frank said oh boy franny said and i could see her imagining that moment waltzing a little reality into fathers dreams your country if youll forgive me said one of the other radicalsthe one they called simply arbeiter arbeiter means worker in german your country is really a criminal place arbeiter said if youll forgive me he added your country is the ultimate triumph of corporate creativity which means it is a country controlled by the group thinking of corporations these corporations are without humanity because there is no one personally responsible for their use of power a corporation is like a computer with profit as its source of energyand profit as its necessary fuel the united states isyoull forgive mequite the worst country in the world for a humanist to live in i think fuck what you think franny said you raving asshole she said you sound like a computer you think like a transmission frank told arbeiter four forward gearsat predetermined speeds one speed for reverse arbeiter stared his english was a little ploddinghis mind it would occur to me later was about as versatile as a lawn mower and about as poetic susie the bear would say no one liked arbeiternot even the impressionable miss miscarriage her weaknessamong the radicalswas her fondness for literature especially for the romance that is american literature your silly major dear schwanger always chided her but fehlgeburts fondness for literature was her strengthto us children it was the romantic part of her that wasnt quite dead at least not yet in time god forgive me i would help to kill it literature is for dreamers old billig would tell poor fehlgeburt old billig the radical i mean old billig the whore liked dreams she told frank once that dreams were all she likedher dreams and her mementos study economics dear schwanger told fehlgeburtthats what miss pregnant told miss miscarriage human usefulness arbeiter lectured to us is directly related to the proportion of the whole population involved in decisions in the power old billig corrected him in the powerful decisions arbeiter saidthe two men stabbing like hummingbirds at a single small blossom bullfuck franny said arbeiters and old billigs english was so bad it was easy to say things like take it in the ear to them all the timethey didnt get it and despite my vow to clean up my language i was sorely tempted to say these things to them i had to content myself vicariously by listening to franny speak to them the eventual race war in america arbeiter told us will be misunderstood it will actually be a war of class stratification when you fart arbeiter franny asked him do the seals in the zoo stop swimming the other radicals were rarely a part of our group discussions one spent himself on the typewriters the other on the single automobile that the symposium on eastwest relations owned among themselves all six of them they could just fit the mechanic who labored over the decrepit carthe everailing car useless in any getaway we imagined and probably never to be called upon for a getaway father thoughtwas a sullen smudgefaced young man in coveralls and a navyblue streetcar conductors cap he belonged to the union and worked the mainline mariahilfer strasse strassenbahn all night he looked sleepy and angry every day and he clanked with tools appropriately he was called schraubenschlüssela schraubenschlüssel is a wrench frank liked to roll schraubenschlüssels name off his tongue to show off but franny and lilly and i insisted on the translation we called him wrench hi wrench franny would say to him as he lay under the car cursing hope youre keeping your mind clean wrench franny would say wrench knew no english and the only thing we knew about wrenchs private life was that he had once asked susie the bear for a date i mean virtually nobody asks me out susie said what an asshole what an asshole franny repeated well hes never actually seen me you know susie said does he know youre female frank asked jesus god frank franny said well i was just curious frank said that wrench is a real weirdo i can tell franny said dont go out with him susie franny advised the bear are you kidding susie the bear said honey i dont go out with men this seemed to settle almost passively at frannys feet but i could see frank edging uncomfortably near to and then away from its presence susie is a lesbian franny i told franny when we were alone she didnt exactly say that franny said i think she is i said so franny said whats frank the grand banana and franks okay watch out for susie franny i said you think about me too much she repeated and repeated leave me alone will you franny asked me but that was the one thing i could never do all sexual acts actually involve maybe four or five different sexes the sixth member of the symposium on eastwest relations told us this was such a garbling of freudthe other freudthat we had to beg frank for a second translation because we couldnt understand the first thats what he said frank assured us all sexual acts actually involve a bunch of different sexes four or five franny asked when we do it with a woman the man said we are doing it with ourselves as we will become and with ourselves in our childhoods and it goes without saying with the self our lover will become and with the self of her childhood it goes without saying frank asked so every time theres one fuck theres four or five people actually at it franny asked that sounds exhausting the energy spent on sex is the only energy that doesnt require replacement by the society the rather dreamy sixth radical told us frank struggled to translate this we replace our sexual energy ourselves the man said looking at franny as if hed just said the most profound thing in the world no kidding i whispered to franny but she seemed a little more mesmerized than i thought she should have been i was afraid she liked this radical his name was ernst just ernst a normal name but just a first name he didnt argue he crafted isolated meaningless sentences spoke them quietly went back to the typewriter when the radicals left the gasthaus freud in the late afternoon they seemed to flounder for hours in the kaffee mowatt across the streeta dark and dim place with a billiard table and dart boards and an everpresent solemn row of teawithrum drinkers playing chess or reading the newspapers ernst rarely joined his colleagues at the kaffee mowatt he wrote and wrote if screaming annie was the last whore to go home ernst was the last radical to leave if screaming annie often met old billig when the old radical was arriving for his mornings work she often met ernst when ernst was finally calling it quits he had an eerie otherworldliness about him when he talked with schwanger their two voices would get so quiet that they would almost always end up whispering whats ernst write franny asked susie the bear hes a pornographer susie said hes asked me out too and hes seen me that quieted us all for a moment what sort of pornography franny asked cautiously how many sorts are there honey susie the bear asked the worst susie said kinky acts violence degradation degradation lilly said not for you honey susie said tell me frank said too kinky to tell susie said to frank you know german better than i do frankyou try it unfortunately frank tried it frank translated ernsts pornography for us i would ask frank later if he thought pornography was the start of the real troubleif we had been able to ignore it somehow would things have gone downhill just the same but franks new religionhis anti religionhad already taken over all his answers to all the questions downhill frank would say well that is the eventual direction of coursei mean regardless if it hadnt been the pornography it would have been something else the point is we are bound to roll downhill what do you know that rolls up what starts the downward progress is immaterial frank would say with his irritating offhandedness look at it like this frank would lecture me why does it seem to take more than half a lifetime to get to be a lousy teenager why does childhood take foreverwhen youre a child why does it seem to occupy a solid threequarters of the whole trip and when its over when the kids grow up when you suddenly have to face facts well frank said to me just recently you know the story when we were in the first hotel new hampshire it seemed wed go on being thirteen and fourteen and fifteen forever for fucking forever as franny would say but once we left the first hotel new hampshire frank said the rest of our lives moved past us twice as fast thats just how it is frank claimed smugly for half your life youre fifteen then one day your twenties begin and theyre over the next day and your thirties blow by you like a weekend spent with pleasant company and before you know it youre thinking about being fifteen again downhill frank would say its a long up hillto that fourteenyearold fifteenyearold sixteenyearold time of your life and from then on frank would say of course its all downhill and anyone knows downhill is faster than uphill its upuntil fourteen fifteen sixteenthen its down down like water frank said down like sand he would say frank was seventeen when he translated the pornography for us franny was sixteen i was fifteen lilly who was eleven wasnt old enough to hear but lilly insisted that if she was old enough to listen to fehlgeburt reading the great gatsby she was old enough to hear frank translating ernst with typical hypocrisy screaming annie wouldnt allow her daughter dark inge to hear a word of it ernst was his gasthaus freud name of course in the pornography he went by a lot of different names i do not like to describe the pornography susie the bear told us that ernst taught a course at the university called the history of eroticism through literature but ernsts pornography was not erotic fehlgeburt had taken ernsts erotic literature course and even she admitted that ernsts own work bore no resemblance to the truly erotic which is never pornographic ernsts pornography gave us headaches and dry throats frank used to say that even his eyes got dry when he read it lilly stopped listening after the first time and i felt cold sitting in franks room the dead dressmakers dummy like a curiously nonjudgmental schoolmistress overhearing franks recitationi got cold from the floor up i felt something cold passing up my pants legs through the old drafty floor through the foundation of the building from the soil beneath all lightwhere i imagined were the bones from ancient vindobona and instruments of torture popular among invading turks whips and cudgels and tonguedepressors and dirks the vogue chambers of horror of the holy roman empire because ernsts pornography was not about sex it was about pain without hope it was about death without a single memory it made susie the bear storm out to take a bath it made lilly cry of course it made me sick to my stomach twice it made frank hurl one of the books at the dressmakers dummy as if the dummy had written itit was the one called the children on the ship to singapore they never got to singapore not even one precious child but all it did to franny was make her frown it made her think about ernst it made her seek him out and ask himfor starterswhy he did it decadence enhances the revolutionary position ernst told her slowlyfrank fumbling to translate him exactly everything that is decadent speeds up the process the inevitable revolution at this phase it is necessary to generate disgust political disgust economic disgust disgust at our inhuman institutions and moral disgustdisgust at ourselves as weve allowed ourselves to become speaking for himself i whispered to franny but she was just frowning she was concentrating too hard on him the pornographer is of course most disgusting ernst droned on but you see if i were a communist who would i want for the government in power the most liberal no i would desire the most repressive the most capitalistic the most anti communist government possiblefor then i would thrive where would the left be without the help of the right the more stupid and rightwing everything is the better for the left are you a communist lilly asked ernst in dairy new hampshire lilly knew this was not such a hot thing to be that was just a necessary phase ernst said speaking of communism and himselfand to us childrenas if we all were past history as if something vast were in motion and we were either being dragged after it or being blown away in its exhaust i am a pornographer ernst said because i am serving the revolution personally he added with a limp wave of his hand well personally i am an aesthete i reflect upon the erotic if schwanger mourns for her coffeehousesif she is sad about her schlagobers which the revolution must also consumei mourn for the erotic for it must be lost too sometime after the revolution ernst sighed the erotic might reappear but it will never be the same in the new world it will never mean as much the new world lilly repeated and ernst shut his eyes as if this were the refrain in his favorite piece of music as if with his minds eye he could already see it the new world a totally different planetbrandnew beings dwelling there i thought he had rather delicate hands for a revolutionary his long slender fingers probably were a help to him at the typewriterat his piano where ernst played the music for his opera of gigantic change his cheap and slightly shiny navyblue suit was usually clean but wrinkled his white shirts were well washed but never pressed he wore no tie when his hair grew too long he cut it too short he had an almost athletic face scrubbed youthful determineda boyish kind of handsomeness susie the bear and fehlgeburt told us that ernst had a reputation as a ladykiller among his students at the university when he lectured on erotic literature miss miscarriage remarked ernst was quite passionate he was even playful he was not the limp lowkey sort of lazyweary sluggish or at least lethargic talker he was when his subject was the revolution he was quite tall though not solid he was not frail either when i saw him hunch his shoulders and turn the collar of his suit jacket upabout to go home from the gasthaus freud after a nodoubt saddening and disgusting days worki was struck how in profile he reminded me of chipper dove doves hands never looked like a quarterbacks hands eithertoo delicate again and i could remember seeing chipper dove shrug his shoulder pads forward and trot back to the huddle thinking about the next signalthe next order the next commandhis hands like songbirds lighting on his hip pads of course i knew then who ernst was the quarterback of the radicals the signal caller the dark planner the one the others gathered around and i knew then too what it was that franny saw in ernst it was more than a physical resemblance to chipper dove it was that cocksure quality the touch of evil that hint of destruction that icy leadershipthat was what could sneak its way into my sisters heart that was what captured the her in her that was what took frannys strength away we all want to go back home i told father to the united states we want america we dont like it here lilly held my hand we were in franks room againfrank nervously boxing with the dressmakers dummy franny on franks bed looking out the window she could see the kaffee mowatt across the krugerstrasse it was early morning and someone was sweeping the cigarette butts out the door of the coffeehouse across the sidewalk and into the gutter the radicals were not the nighttime company of the kaffee mowatt at night the whores used the place to get off the streetto take a break to play some billiards to drink a beer or a glass of wine or get picked upand father allowed frank and franny and me to go there to throw some darts we miss home lilly said trying not to cry it was still summer and mother and egg had departed too recently to permit our dwelling for long on phrases that concerned missing anyone or anything its not going to work here dad frank said it looks like an impossible situation and nows the time to leave i said before we start school before we all have our various commitments but i already have a commitment father said softly to freud did an old blind man equal us we wanted to shout at him but father didnt allow us to linger on the subject of his commitment to freud what do you think franny he asked her but franny continued to stare out the window at the early morning street here came old billig the radicalthere went screaming annie the whore both of them looked tired but both of them were very viennese in their attention to form they both managed a hearty greeting we could hear through the open summer window in franks room look frank said to father for sure were in the first district but freud neglected to tell us that we live on just about the worst street in the whole district a kind of oneway street i added no parking either said lilly there was no parking because the krugerstrasse seemed to be used for delivery trucks making backdoor deliveries to the fancy places on the kärntnerstrasse also the district post office was on our streeta sad grimy building that hardly attracted potential customers to our hotel also the prostitutes lilly whispered secondclass said frank no hope for advancement were only a block off the kärntnerstrasse but well never be the kärntnerstrasse frank said even with a new lobby i told father even if its an attractive lobby theres no one to see it and youre still putting people between whores and revolution between sin and danger daddy lilly said of course it doesnt matter in the long run i suppose frank said i could have kicked him i mean its downhill either wayit doesnt matter exactly when we leave its just evident that we will leave this is a downhill hotel we can leave when its sinking or after its sunk but we want to leave now frank i said yes we all do lilly said franny father asked but franny looked out the window there was a mail truck trying to get around a delivery truck on the narrow street franny watched the mail come and go waiting for letters from junior jonesand i suppose from chipper dove she wrote them both a lot but only junior jones wrote her back frank continuing with his philosophical indifference said i mean we can leave when the whores all fail their medical checkups we can leave when dark inge is finally old enough we can leave when schraubenschlüssels car blows up we can leave when were sued by the first guest or the last but we cant leave father interrupted him until we make it work even franny looked at him i mean father said when its a successful hotel then we can afford to leave we cant just leave when we have a failure on our hands he said reasonably because we wouldnt have anything to leave with you mean money i said father nodded youve already sunk the money in here franny asked him theyll be starting the lobby before the summer is over father said then its not too late cried frank i mean is it un sink the money daddy lilly said father smiled benevolently shaking his head franny and i looked out the window at ernst the pornographer he was moving past the kaffee mowatt he looked full of disgust he kicked some garbage out of his way when he crossed the street he moved as purposefully as a cat after a mouse but he looked forever disappointed in himself for arriving at work later than old billig he had at least three hours of pornography in him before he broke for lunch before he gave his lecture at the university his aesthetic hour he called it and then he would face the tired meanspirited hours of the late afternoon which he told us children he reserved for ideologyfor his contribution to the newsletter of the symposium on eastwest relations what a day he had ahead of himself he was already full of hate for it i could tell and franny couldnt take her eyes off him we should leave now i said to father whether were sunk or unsunk no place to go father said affectionately he raised his hands it was almost a shrug going to no place is better than staying here lilly said i agree i said youre not being logical frank said and i glared at him father looked at franny it reminded me of the looks he occasionally gave mother he was looking into the future again and he was looking for forgivenessin advance he wanted to be excused for everything that would happen it was as if the power of his dreaming was so vivid that he felt compelled to simply act out whatever future he imaginedand we were being asked to tolerate his absence from reality and maybe his absence from our lives for a while that is what pure love is the future and thats the look father gave to franny franny father asked her what do you think frannys opinion was the one we always waited for she looked at the spot in the street where ernst had beenernst the pornographer ernst the aesthete on the subject of erotica ernst the ladykiller i saw that the her in her was in trouble something was already amiss in frannys heart franny father said softly i think we should stay franny said we should see what its like she said facing us all we children looked away but father gave franny a hug and a kiss atta girl franny he said franny shrugged she gave father mothers shrug of courseit could get to him every time someone has told me that the krugerstrasse today is mostly closed to all but pedestrian traffic and that there are two hotels on the street a restaurant a bar and a coffeehouseeven a movie theater and a record store someone has told me that its a posh street now well thats just so hard to believe and i wouldnt ever want to see the krugerstrasse again no matter how much it has changed someone has told me that there are fancy places on the krugerstrasse itself now a boutique and a hairdresser a bookstore and a record store a place that sells furs and a place that sells bathroom fittings this is utterly amazing someone has told me that the post office is still there the mail goes on and there are still prostitutes on the krugerstrasse no one has to tell me that prostitution still goes on the next morning i woke up susie the bear earl she said fighting out of sleep what the fuck is it now i want your help i said to her youve got to save franny frannys real tough said susie the bear shes beautiful and tough said susie rolling over and she doesnt need me you impress her i said this was a hopeful lie susie was only twenty only four years older than franny but when youre sixteen four years is a big difference she likes you i said this was true i knew youre at least older like an older sister to her you know i said earl susie the bear said staying in disguise maybe you are weird frank told susie but franny can be more influenced by you than she can be influenced by us save franny from what susie the bear asked from ernst i said from pornography itself said lilly shuddering help her get the her in her back frank begged susie the bear i dont normally mess with underage girls susie said we want you to help her not mess with her i said to susie but susie the bear only smiled she sat up in her bed her costume disheveled on the floor of her room her own hair like bear hair with its stiff and erratic directions her hard face like a wound above her ratty tshirt helping someone is the same as messing with someone said susie the bear will you please try i asked her and you ask me where the real trouble began frank would say to me later well it didnt start with the pornographynot in my opinion frank would say not that it matters of course but i know what started the trouble that got to you frank would tell me like the pornography i dont wish to describe it but frank and i had only a very brief picturewe had only the quickest glimpse of it though we saw more than enough it started one evening in august when it was so hot lilly had woken up frank and me and asked for a glass of wateras if she were a baby againone evening when it was too quiet in the gasthaus freud there were no customers to make screaming annie scream there was no one even interested enough to grunt with jolanta to whimper with babette to strike a bargain with old billig or even look at young dark inge it was too hot to sit in the kaffee mowatt the whores sat on the stairs in the cool dark lobby of the gasthaus freudnow under construction freud was in bed asleep of course he could not see the heat and father who saw the future more clearly than the moment was asleep too i went in franks room and boxed the dressmakers dummy around for a while jesus god frank said ill be glad when you find some barbells and you leave my dummy alone but he couldnt sleep either we shoved the dressmakers dummy back and forth between us there was no mistaking the sound for screaming annieor for any of the whores the sound seemed to bear no relationship to sorrow there was too much light in the sound to have anything to do with sorrow there was too much of the music of water in the sound to make frank and me think of fucking for money or even of lust there was too much light and water music for lust either frank and i had never heard this sound beforeand in my memory which is a fortyyearolds memory now i do not remember another recording of this song no one would ever sing quite exactly this song to me it was the song susie the bear made franny sing susie went through frannys room to use the bathroom frank and i went through my room to get to the same bathroom through the bathroom door we could peek into frannys room the head of the bear on the rug at the foot of frannys bed was at first unnerving as if someone had severed susie from her head when shed first intruded but the bears head was not the focal point of franks and my attention it was frannys sound that drew usboth keen and soft as nice as mother as happy as egg it was a sound almost without sex in it although sex was the songs subject because franny lay on her bed with her arms flung over her head and her head thrown back and between her long slightly stirring legs treading water as if she were very buoyant in my sisters dark lap which i shouldnt have seen was a headless beara headless bear was lapping there like an animal eating from a fresh kill like an animal drinking in the heart of a forest this vision frightened frank and me we didnt know where to go after seeing this and for no reason with nothing on our mindsor with too much on themwe stumbled into the lobby there all the whores on the stairs greeted us the heat and their own boredom their inactivity seemed to make them unusually glad to see us although they always seemed to be pretty glad to see us only screaming annie looked disappointed to see usas if shed thought for a moment we might be business dark inge said hey you guys you look like you seen a ghost something you ate dears asked old billig its too late for you to be up your hardons keeping you awake jolanta asked oui oui sang babette bring us your hardons stop that said old billig its too hot to fuck anyway never too hot jolanta said never too cold said screaming annie do you want to play cards dark inge asked us crazy eights but frank and i like windup soldiers did a few awkward turns at the foot of the stairs reversed direction made our way back to franks roomand then like magnets we were drawn to father we want to go home i said to him he woke up and took both frank and me into his bed with him as if we were still small please lets go home dad frank whispered as soon as were successful here father assured us just as soon as we make iti promise when i hissed at him but father put a headlock on me and kissed me soon he said this place is going to take offsoon i can feel it but we would be in vienna until we would stay there seven years i grew old there lilly would say she would be eighteen years old by the time we left vienna older but not a whole lot biggeras franny would say sorrow floats we knew that we shouldnt have been so surprised but the night that susie the bear made franny forget about pornographythat night she made my sister sing so wellfrank and i were struck by a resemblance stronger than the resemblance ernst the pornographer bore to chipper dove in franks room with the dressmakers dummy pushed against franks door frank and i lay whispering in the darkness did you see the bear i said you couldnt see her head frank said right i said so it was just the bear suit reallysusie was sort of hunched up why was she still wearing the bear suit frank asked i dont know i said probably they were just starting frank reasoned but the way the bear looked i said did you see i know frank whispered all that fur the body sort of curled i said i know what youre saying frank said stop it in the darkness we both knew what susie the bear had looked likewe had both seen whom she resembled franny had warned us shed told us to be on the lookout for sorrows new poses for sorrows new disguises sorrow frank whispered susie the bear is sorrow she looked like him anyway i said shes sorrow i know it frank said well for the moment maybe i said for now she is sorrow frank kept repeating until he fell asleep its sorrow he murmured you cant kill it frank mumbled its sorrow it floats the second hotel new hampshire the last renovation in the new lobby of the gasthaus freud was my fathers idea i imagine him standing one morning in front of the post office on the krugerstrasse looking up the street at the new lobbythe candy store completely absorbed the old signs like tired soldiers rifles leaning against the scaffolding that the workmen were taking down the signs said bonbons konditorei zuckerwaren schokoladen and gasthaus freud and my father saw then that they should all be thrown away no more candy store no more gasthaus freud the hotel new hampshire said screaming annie always the first whore to arrive and the last to leave change with the times said old billig the radical roll with the punches come up smiling the hotel new hampshire sounds okay to me another phase another phase said ernst the pornographer a brilliant idea freud cried think of the american clientelehow it will hook them and no more antisemitism the old man said no more guests staying away because of their antifreudian tendencies i suppose frank said what the fuck else did you think hed call it franny asked me its fathers hotel isnt it she asked screwed down for life as iowa bob would have said i think its sweet lilly said its a nice touch sort of small but sweet sweet franny said oh boy were in trouble lilly thinks its sweet its sentimental frank said philosophically but it doesnt matter i thought that if frank said something didnt matter again i would scream i thought i could fake more than an orgasm if frank said that again but once more i was saved by susie the bear look kids susie said your old mans made a step in a practical direction do you realize how many tourists from the us and england are going to find that name reassuring this is true schwanger said pleasantly this is a city of the east to the british and to the americans the very shape of some of the churchesthe dreaded onionshaped dome schwanger said and its implications of a world incomprehensible to westerners depending on how far west you come from even central europe can look east schwanger said its the timid souls wholl be attracted here schwanger predicted as if she were composing another pregnancy and abortion book the hotel new hampshire will ring bells for thembells that sound like home brilliant freud said bring us the timid souls freud said sighing reaching his hands out to pat the heads that were nearest to him he found frannys head and patted it but the big soft paw of susie the bear brushed freuds hand away i would get used to thatthat possessive paw this is a world where what strikes us at first as ominous can grow to become commonplace even reassuring what seems at first reassuring can grow to become ominous too but i had to accept that susie the bear was a good influence on franny if susie could keep franny from ernst i had to be gratefuland was it too much to hope that susie the bear might even convince franny that she should stop writing to chipper dove do you think you are a lesbian franny i asked her in the safety of the darkness on the krugerstrassefather was having trouble with the pink neon flasher hotel new hampshire hotel new hampshire hotel new hampshire over and over again i doubt it franny said softly i think i just like susie i was thinking of course that since frank knew he was a homosexual and now franny was involved with susie the bear maybe it was only a matter of time before lilly and i discovered our similar inclinations but as usual franny was reading my mind its not like that she whispered frank is convinced im not convinced of anythingexcept maybe that this is easier for me right now i mean its easier to love someone of your own sex theres not quite so much to commit yourself to theres not so much to risk she said i feel safer with susie she whispered thats all i think men are so different franny said a phase ernst went around sayingabout everything while fehlgeburt encouraged by everyones response to the great gatsby started reading mobydick to us because of what happened to mother and egg hearing about the ocean was difficult for us but we got over that we concentrated on the whale especially on the different harpooners we each had our favorite and we kept a sharp eye on lilly waiting for her to identify father with ahabor maybe shell decide frank is the white whale franny whispered but it was freud lilly identified for us one night when the dressmakers dummy stood at attention and fehlgeburt was droning like the sealike the tidelilly said can you hear him ssshhh what frank said like a ghostlike egg would have said we all knew cut it out lilly franny whispered no listen lilly said and for a moment we thought we were below decks in our seamens bunks listening to ahabs artificial leg restlessly pacing above us a wooden whack a bonelike thud it was just freuds baseball bat he was limping his blind way on the floor above ushe was visiting one of the whores which one does he see i asked old billig said susie the bear the old for the old franny said its sort of sweet i think lilly said i mean its old billig tonight said susie the bear he must be tired he does it with all of them frank said not jolanta susie said she scares him she scares me i said and not dark inge of course susie said freud cant see her it did not occur to me to visit the whoresone or all ronda ray had not really been like them with ronda ray it was just sex with a fee attached in vienna sex was a business i could masturbate to my imagination of jolanta that was exciting enough and for love well for love there was always my imagination of franny and in the late summer nights there was also fehlgeburt mobydick being such a monster of a reading experience fehlgeburt had taken to staying later in the evenings frank and i would walk her home she rented a room in an illkept building behind the rathaus near the university and she did not like crossing the karntnerstrasse or the graben alone at night because she would occasionally be mistaken for a whore anyone who mistook fehlgeburt for a whore must have had a great imagination she was so clearly a student it was not that she wasnt pretty it was that her prettiness clearly wasnt an issuefor her what plain good looks she hadand she had themshe either suppressed or neglected her hair was straggly on the rare occasions when it was clean it was simply uncared for she wore blue jeans and a turtleneck or a tshirt and about her mouth and eyes was the kind of tiredness that suggests too much reading too much writing too much thinkingtoo many of those things larger than ones own body and its care or pleasures she seemed about the same age as susie but she was much too humorless to be a bearand her loathing for the nighttime activities in the hotel new hampshire surely bordered on what ernst would have called disgust when it was raining frank and i would walk her no farther than the streetcar stop on the ringstrasse at the opera when it was nice we walked her through the plaza of heroes and up the ring toward the university we were just three kids fresh from thinking about whales walking under the big buildings in a city too old for all of us most nights it was as if frank werent there lilly is only eleven fehlgeburt would say its wonderful that she loves literature it could be her salvation that hotel is no place for her wo ist die gemütlichkeit frank was singing youre very good with lilly i told miss miscarriage do you want a family of your own someday four hundred and sixtyfour frank sang i wouldnt want children until after the revolution fehlgeburt said humorlessly do you think fehlgeburt likes me i asked frank when we were walking home wait till we start school frank suggested find a nice young girlyour own age and so although i lived in a viennese whorehouse my sexual world was probably like the sexual world for most americans who were fifteen in i beat off to images of a dangerously violent prostitute while i kept walking a young older girl to her homewaiting for the day i might dare to kiss her or even hold her hand i expected that the timid soulsthe guests who schwanger had predicted would be drawn to the hotel new hampshirewould remind me of myself they didnt they came occasionally in buses odd groups on organized toursand some of the tours were as odd as the groups librarians from devon kent and cornwall ornithologists from ohiothey had been observing storks at rust they were so regular in their habits that they all went to bed before the whores started working they slept right through the nightly rumpus and were often off on a tour in the morning before screaming annie wrapped up her last orgasm before the radical old billig walked in off the streetthe new world shining in his old minds eye the groups were the oblivious ones and frank could sometimes make extra money by marching them off on walking tours the groups were easyeven the japanese male choral society who discovered the whores as a group and used them as a group what a loud strange time that wasall that screwing all that singing the japanese had a great many cameras with them and took everyones pictureall of our family pictures too in fact frank would always say its a shame that the only photographs we have of our time in vienna come from that one visit of the japanese male choral society there is one of lilly with fehlgeburtand a book of course theres a touching one of the two old billigs they look like what lilly would call a sweet old couple theres franny leaning on the stout shoulder of susie the bear franny looking a little thin but sassy and strongstrangely confident is how frank describes franny in this period theres a curious one of father and freud they appear to be sharing the baseball bator they appear to have been squabbling over the bat it is as if theyd been fighting over who was up next and theyd interrupted their brawl only long enough for the picture to be taken im standing with dark inge i remember the japanese gentleman who asked inge and me to stand beside each other we had been sitting down playing crazy eights but the japanese said the light wasnt right and so we had to stand its a slightly unnatural moment screaming annie is still sitting downat that part of the table where the light was generousand overly powdered babette is whispering something to jolanta who is standing a little back from the table with her arms folded across her impressive bosom jolanta could never learn the rules to crazy eights in this picture jolanta looks like shes about to break up the game i remember that the japanese were afraid of her tooperhaps because she was so much bigger than any of them and what distinguishes all these photographsour only pictorial record of vienna is that all these people familiar to us have to share the photographs with a japanese or two with a total stranger or two even the photograph of ernst the pornographer leaning against the car outside arbeiter is leaning against the fender with himand those legs protruding from under the grille of the old mercedes those legs belong to the one called wrench schraubenschlüssel never got more than his legs in a picture and surrounding the car are japanesestrangers none of us would see again might we have known thenhad we looked at that photograph closelythat this was no ordinary car who ever heard of a mercedes even an old one that needed so much mechanical attention herr wrench was always under the car and crawling around in it and why did the one car belonging to the symposium on eastwest relations need so much care when it was so rarely driven anywhere looking at it now of course well the photograph is obvious it is hard to look at that photograph and not recognize that old mercedes for what it was a bomb a constantly wired and rewired everready bomb the whole car was a bomb and those unrecognizable japanese that populate all of our only photographs well now its easy to see these strangers those foreign gentlemen as symbolic of the unknown angels of death which would accompany that car to think that for years we children told each other jokes about how bad a mechanic schraubenschlüssel must be in order to be constantly fussing with that mercedes when all the while he was an expert mr wrench the bomb expert for almost seven years that bomb was readyevery day we never knew what they were waiting foror what moment would have been ripe for it had we not forced their hand we have only the japanese pictures to go on and they make a murky story what do you remember of vienna frank i asked himi ask him all the time frank went into a room to be alone with himself and when he came out he handed me a short list franny with susie the bear going to buy your damn barbells walking fehlgeburt home the presence of the king of mice frank handed me this list and said of course theres more but i dont want to get into it i understand and of course i remember going to buy my barbells too we all went father freud susie and we children freud went because he knew where the sports shop was susie went because freud could help her remember where the shop was by shouting at her in the streetcar are we past that hospitalsupply place on mariahilfer freud would cry its the second left or the third after that earl susie would say looking out the window the strassenbahn conductor would caution freud saying i hope its safeits not tied the bear we dont usually let them on if theyre not tied earl susie said its a smart bear frank told the conductor in the sports shop i bought pounds of weights one long barbell and two dumbbell bars for the onearm curls deliver them to the hotel new hampshire father said they dont deliver frank said they dont deliver franny said well we cant carry them earl susie said be nice susie freud shouted dont be rude the bear would really appreciate it if these weights were delivered frank told the man in the sports shop but it didnt work we should have seen then that the power of a bear in getting things to work out for us was diminishing we distributed the weights as best we could i put seventyfive on each of the short dumbbell bars and carried one in each hand father and frank and susie the bear struggled with the long bar and another pounds franny opened doors and cleared the sidewalk and lilly held on to freud she was his seeing eye bear for the trip home jesus god father said when they wouldnt let us on the strassenbahn they let us on to get out here franny said its not the bear they mind freud said its the long barbell it looks dangerous the way youre carrying it franny told frank susie and father if youd kept working with the weights like iowa bob i told father you could carry it by yourself you wouldnt make it look so heavy lilly had noticed that the austrians permitted bears on streetcars but not barbells she also noticed that the austrians were liberal in regard to skis she suggested we buy a ski bag and put the long barbell in it then the streetcar conductor would think the barbell was just some very heavy pair of skis frank suggested someone go get schraubenschlüssels car it never runs father said it must be ready to run by now franny said that assholes been fixing it for years father hopped the streetcar and went home to ask for the car and shouldnt we have known by the radicals quick refusal that a bomb was parked outside our new hotel but we thought it was all merely an aspect of the rudeness of the radicals we carried all that weight home i finally had to leave the others and the long barbell at the kunsthistorisches museum they wouldnt let a barbell in the museum eithernor would they let in a bear brueghel wouldnt have minded frank said but they had to kill time on the street corner susie danced a little freud tapped his baseball bat lilly and franny sang an american songthey passed the time by making a little money street clowns viennese specialties the presence of the king of mice as frank would sayfrank passed the hat it was the hat from the bus drivers uniform father had bought frankthe seedyfuneralparlor cap that frank wore when he played doorman at the hotel new hampshire frank wore it all the time in viennaour imposter king of mice frank we all thought often of the sad performer with his unwanted rodents who one day stopped passing the open windows who made the leap taking his poor mice with him life is serious but art is fun he made his statement the open windows he had kept passing for so longthey finally drew him i jogged home with the pounds hi wrench i said to the radical under the car i ran back to the kunsthistorisches museum and trotted home with seventyfive more pounds father frank susie the bear franny lilly and freud brought home the remaining seventyfive so then i had weights then i could evoke the first hotel new hampshireand iowa boband some of the foreignness of vienna disappeared we had to go to school of course it was an american school near the zoo in hietzing near the palace at schönbrunn for a while susie would accompany us on the streetcar each morning and meet us when school was over it was a great way to meet the other kidsto be delivered and brought home by a bear but father or freud had to come with susie because bears were not allowed on the streetcars alone and the school was near enough to the zoo so that people in the suburbs were more nervous about seeing a bear than were the people in the city it would only occur to me later that we all did frank a great disservice by not acknowledging his sexual discretion for seven years in vienna we never knew who his boyfriends were he told us that they were boys at the american schooland being the oldest of us and in the most advanced german course frank was often at school the longest and alone his proximity to the excess of sex in the second hotel new hampshire must have inclined frank to discretion in much the same manner that i was convinced of whispering by my intercom initiation with ronda ray and franny had her bear for the momentand her rape to get over susie kept telling me shes over it i said youre not susie said youve still got chipper dove on your mind and so does she then its chipper dove frannys not done with i said the rapes over well see said susie im a smart bear and the timid souls kept coming not in overwhelming numbers overwhelming numbers of timid souls would probably have been a contradictionalthough we could have used the numbers even so we had a better guest list than we had in the first hotel new hampshire the tour groups were easier than the individuals theres something about an individual timid soul that is much more timid than a group of them the timid souls who traveled alone or the timid couples with the occasional timid childrenthese seemed to be the most easily upset by the dayandnight activity between which they were anxious guests but in our first three or four years in the second hotel new hampshire only one guest complainedthat was how truly timid these timid souls were the complainer was an american she was a woman traveling with her husband and her daughter who was about lillys age they were from new hampshire but not from the dairy part of the state frank was working the reception desk when they checked inlate afternoon after school right away frank noticed the woman started braying about missing some of the clean plain old honesttogoodness decency that she apparently associated with new hampshire its the old plainnessbutgoodness bullshit franny would say recalling mrs urick weve been robbed all over europe the new hampshire womans husband told frank ernst was in the lobby explaining to franny and me some of the weirder positions of tantric union this was pretty hard to follow in german but although franny and i would never catch up to franks germanand lilly was conversationally almost as good as frank within a yearfranny and i learned a lot at the american school of course they didnt teach coitus there that was ernsts line and although ernst gave me the creeps i couldnt stand to see him talking to franny alone so whenever i saw him talking to her i tried to listen in susie the bear liked to listen in toowith a paw touching my sister somewhere a nice big paw that ernst could see but the day the americans from new hampshire checked in susie the bear was in the wc and hair in the bathrooms the woman said to frank you wouldnt believe some of the filth weve been exposed to weve thrown the guidebooks away her husband said to frank theres no trusting them were trusting our instincts now the woman said looking over the new lobby of the hotel new hampshire were looking for some american touches i cant wait to get home the daughter said in a mousy little voice ive got a nice pair of rooms on the third floor frank said adjoining rooms frank added but he was worrying if that wasnt too close to the whores underneathonly a floor away then again frank said the view from the fourth is better the heck with the view the woman said well take the adjoining rooms on three and no hair she added menacingly just as susie the bear shuffled into the lobbysaw the little girl guest and gave a showoff toss of her head and a low bearish huff and snort look a bear the little girl said holding her fathers leg frank hit the bell a sharp ping luggage carrier frank hollered i had to tear myself away from ernsts description of the tantric positions the vyanta group has two main positions he was saying blandly the woman leans forward till she touches the ground with her hands while the man takes her from behind standingthats the dhenukavyantaasana or cow position ernst said with his liquid stare at franny cow position franny said earl susie said disapprovingly putting her head in frannys lapplaying the bear for the new guests i started upstairs with the luggage the little girl couldnt take her eyes off the bear i have a sister about your age i told her lilly was out taking freud for a walkfreud no doubt lecturing to her about all the sights he couldnt see that was how freud gave us tours the baseball bat on one side one of us children or susie on the other we steered him through the city shouting out the names of the street corners when we arrived freud was getting deaf too are we on blutgasse freud would cry out are we on blood lane he would ask and lilly or frank or franny or i would holler ja blutgasse take a right freud would direct us when we get to domgasse children hed say we must find number five this is the entrance to the figaro house where mozart wrote the marriage of figaro what year frank freud would cry seventeen eightyfive frank would shout back and more important than mozart freud would say is the first coffeehouse in vienna are we still on blutgasse children ja blood lane we would say look for number six freud would cry the first coffeehouse in vienna even schwanger doesnt know this she loves her schlagobers but shes like all these political people freud said shes got no sense of history it was true that we learned no history from schwanger we learned to love coffee chased with little glasses of water we learned to like the soft dirt of newspapers on our fingers franny and i would fight over the one copy of the international herald tribune in our seven years in vienna there was always news of junior jones in there penn state thirtyfive navy six franny would read and wed all cheer and later it would be the cleveland browns the new york giants the baltimore colts the poor browns although junior rarely imparted any more news than this to frannyin his occasional lettersit was somehow special hearing about him so indirectly through the football scores several days late in the herald tribune at judengasse turn right freud would instruct and we would follow jews lane to the church of st ruprecht the eleventh century frank would murmur the older the better for frank and down to the danube canal at the foot of the slope on franz josefskai was the monument freud led us to rather often the marble plaque memorializing those murdered by the gestapo whose headquarters had been on that spot right here freud screamed stamping and whacking with the baseball bat describe the plaque to me he cried ive never seen it of course because it was in one of the camps that he went blind they had performed some failed experiment on his eyes in the camp no not summer camp franny had to tell lilly who had always been afraid of being sent to summer camp and was unsurprised to hear that they tortured the campers not summer camp lilly frank said freud was in a death camp but herr tod never found me freud said to lilly mr death never found me at home when he called it was freud who explained to us that the nudes in the fountain at the neuer markt the providence fountainor the donner fountain after its creatorwere actually copies of the original the originals were in the lower belvedere designed to portray water as the source of life the nudes had been condemned by maria theresa she was a bitch freud said she founded a chastity commission he told us what did they do franny asked the chastity commission what could they do freud asked what can those people ever do they couldnt do anything to stop the sex so they fucked around with a few fountains even the vienna of freudthe other freudwas notorious for being unable to do anything to stop the sex though this didnt stop the victorian counterparts of maria theresas chastity commission from trying in those days freud pointed out admiringly whores were allowed to make arrangements in the aisles of the opera at intermissions frank added in case we didnt know franks favorite tour with freud was the imperial vaultthe kaisergruft in the catacombs of the kapuzinerkirche the hapsburgs have been buried there since maria theresa is there the old prude but not her heart the corpses in the catacombs are heartlesstheir hearts are kept in another church their hearts are to be found on another tour history separates everything eventually freud would intone in the heartless tombs goodbye maria theresaand franz josef and elizabeth and the unfortunate maximilian of mexico and of course franks prize lies with them the hapsburg heir poor rudolf the suicidehes also there frank always got especially gloomy in the catacombs franny and i got gloomiest when freud directed us along wipplingerstrasse to füttergasse turn hed cry the baseball bat trembling we were in the judenplatz the old jewish quarter of the city it had been a kind of ghetto as long ago as the thirteenth century the first expulsion of the jews there had been in we knew only slightly more about the recent expulsion what was hard about being there with freud was that this tour was not so visibly historical freud would call out to apartments that were no longer apartments he would identify whole buildings that were no longer there and the people he used to know therethey werent there either it was a tour of things we couldnt see but freud saw them still he saw and before when hed last been in the judenplatz with a working pair of eyes the day the new hampshire couple and their child arrived freud had taken lilly to the judenplatz i could tell because she was depressed when she came back i had just taken the bags and the americans to their rooms on the third floor and i was depressed too i had been thinking all the way upstairs about ernst describing the cow position to franny the bags werent especially heavy because i was imagining that they were ernst and i was carrying him up to the top of the hotel new hampshire where i was going to drop him out a window on the fifth floor the woman from new hampshire ran her hand briefly up the banister and said dust schraubenschlüssel passed us on the landing of the second floor he was smeared with grease from his fingertips to his bicepses he had a coil of copper wire around his neck like a hangmans noose and in his arms he lugged an obviously heavy boxshaped thing that resembled a giant batterya battery too big for a mercedes i would recall much later hi wrench i said and he grunted past us in his teeth he held quite delicatelyfor himsome kind of glasswrapped little fuse the hotels mechanic i explained because it was the easiest thing to say not very clean said the woman from new hampshire is there an automobile on the top floor her husband asked as we turned down the thirdfloor corridor searching in the halfdark for the correct rooms a door opened up on the fifth floor the clamor of a kind of eleventhhour typing reached usfehlgeburt perhaps either bringing a manifesto to a close or writing her thesis on the romance that is at the heart of american literatureand arbeiter screamed down the stairwell compromise arbeiter shrieked you represent nothing so strongly as you represent compromise each time is its own time old billig hollered back old billig the radical was leaving for the day he crossed the thirdfloor landing while i was still fumbling with the luggage and keys you blow the way the wind blows old man arbeiter yelled this was in german of course and i supposefor the americans who didnt understand germanit might have seemed more ominous in that language than it was i thought it was pretty ominous and i understood it one day old man arbeiter concluded the winds going to blow you away old billig the radical stopped on the landing and yelled back up to arbeiter youre crazy he screamed youll kill us all you have no patience he shouted and somewhere between the third and fifth floors moving softly her gentle figure generous with schlagobers the good schwanger tried to soothe them both trotting downstairs a few steps toward old billig and talking in a whisper trotting upstairs a few steps toward arbeiterwith whom she had to speak up a little shut up arbeiter snapped at her go get pregnant again he said to her go get another abortion go get some schlagobers he abused her animal old billig cried he started back upstairs it is possible to remain a gentleman but not you he screamed up at arbeiter you are not even a humanist please schwanger was soothing bitte bitte you want schlagobers arbeiter roared at her i want schlagobers running all over the kärntnerstrasse he said crazily i want schlagobers stopping the traffic on the ring schlagobers and blood he said thats what youll see over everything oozing over the streets said arbeiter schlagobers and blood and i let the timid americans from new hampshire into their dusty rooms soon it would be dark i knew and the shouting matches upstairs would cease and downstairs the groaning would start the bedrocking the constant flushing of the bidets the pacing of the bearpolicing the second floorand the baseball bat of freud whumping steadily room to room would the americans go to the opera would they return to see jolanta muscling a brave drunk upstairsor rolling him down would someone be kneading babette like dough in the lobby where i played cards with dark inge and told her about the heroics of junior jones the black arm of the law made her happy when she was old enough she said she was going to make a bundle then go visit her father and see for herself how bad it was for blacks in america and at what hour of the night would screaming annies first fake orgasm send the daughter from new hampshire scurrying into her parents room through the adjoining door would they three huddle in one bed until morningoverhearing the tired bargains made with old billig the mean thudding of jolanta wrecking someone screaming annie had told me what she would do to me if i ever touched dark inge i keep inge away from the men in the street she confided but i dont want her thinking shes in love or something i mean in a way thats worsei know that really fucks you up i mean im not letting anyone pay her for itnot everand im not letting you sneak in for free shes only my sister lillys age i said to me who cares how old she is screaming annie said im watching you youre old enough to get a rod occasionally jolanta told me ive seen it i got an eye for seeing rods if you get a hardon you might use it screaming annie said and im just telling you if you want to use it dont use it on dark inge use it on her and you lose it screaming annie told me thats right jolanta said use it with us never with the kid use it with the kid and well finish you lift all the weights you want sometime you got to fall asleep and when you wake up said screaming annie your rod will be gone got it jolanta asked sure i said and jolanta leaned close to me and kissed me on the mouth it was a kiss as threatening with lifelessness as the new years eve kiss tinged with vomit that i had received from doris wales but when jolanta finished this kiss she pulled away suddenly with my lower lip trapped in her teethjust until i screamed then her mouth released me i felt my arms lift up all by themselvesthe way they do when ive been curling the onearm dumbbells for half an hour or so but jolanta was backing away from me very watchfully her hands in her purse i looked at the hands and the purse until she was out of my room screaming annie was still there sorry about the bite she said i really didnt tell her to do it shes just mean all by herself you know what shes got in the purse i didnt want to know screaming annie would know she lived with jolantadark inge had told me in fact dark inge told me not only were her mother and jolanta girl friends of the lesbian kind but babette also lived with a woman a whore who worked the mariahilfer strasse only old billig actually preferred men and dark inge told me old billig was so old she preferred nothing at allmost of the time so i stayed strictly nonsexual with dark inge in fact it wouldnt have occurred to me to even think of her sexually if her mother hadnt brought it up i stayed strictly to my imagination of franny of jolanta and of course my shy stumbling courtship of fehlgeburt the reader the girls at the american school all knew i lived in that hotel on the krugerstrasse i was not in the same class of americans that they were in people say that in america most americans are not at all classconscious but i know about the americans who live abroad and they are wildly conscious about what kind of americans they are franny had her bear and i suppose she had her imagination as much as i had mine she had junior jones and his football scores she must have had to work hard to imagine him past the ends of the games and she had her correspondence with chipper dove she had her rather onesided imagination concerning him susie had a theory about frannys letters to chipper dove shes afraid of him susie said shes actually terrified of ever seeing him again its fear that makes her do itwrite to him all the time because if she can address him in a normal voiceif she can pretend that shes having a normal relationship with himwell then hes no rapist then he never did actually do it to her and she doesnt want to deal with the fact that he did because susie said shes afraid that dove or someone like him will rape her again i thought about that susie the bear might not have been the smart bear freud had in mind but she was a smart bear on her own terms what lilly once said about her has stayed with me you can make fun of susie because shes afraid to simply be a human being and have to dealas she would saywith other human beings but how many human beings feel that way and dont have the imagination to do anything about it it may be stupid to go through life as a bear lilly would say but youll have to admit it takes imagination and we were all familiar with living with imagination of course father thrived there imagination was his own hotel freud could see only there franny composed in the present was also looking aheadand i was always for the most part looking at franny for signals for some vital signs for directions of us all frank was perhaps the most successfully imaginative he made up his own world and kept to himself there and lilly in vienna had a missionwhich was to keep her safe for a while lilly had decided to grow it had to be with her imagination that she would do this because we noted few physical changes what lilly did in vienna was write fehlgeburts reading had gotten to her lilly wanted to be a writer of all things and we were embarrassed enough for her that we never accused her of italthough we knew she was doing it all the time and she was embarrassed enough by it so that she never admitted it either but each of us knew that lilly was writing something for nearly seven years she wrote and wrote we knew the sound of her typewriter it was different from the radicals lilly wrote very slowly what are you doing lilly someone would ask her knocking on her everlocked door trying to grow lilly would say and that was our euphemism for it too if franny managed to say she was beaten up when shed been rapedif franny could get away with that i thoughtthen lilly ought to be allowed to say she was trying to grow when she was we all knew trying to write and so when i told lilly that the new hampshire family included a little girl just her age lilly said so what ive got some growing to do maybe ill introduce myself after supper one of the curses of timid peoplein bad hotelsis that theyre often too timid to leave theyre so timid they dont even dare to complain and with their timidity comes a certain politeness if they check out because a schraubenschlüssel has frightened them on the stairs because a jolanta has bitten someone in the face in the lobby because a screaming annie has inched them closer to death with her howlseven if they find bear hair in the bidet they still apologize not the woman from new hampshire however she was more feisty than your average timid guest she lasted through the early evening pickups of the whores the family must have been dining out the family lasted past midnight without a complaint not even an inquiring phone call to the front desk frank was studying with the dressmakers dummy lilly was trying to grow franny was at the desk in the lobby and susie the bear was cruising thereher presence made the whores customers their usual peaceful selves i was restless i was restless for seven years but this night i was especially restless i had been playing darts at the kaffee mowatt with dark inge and old billig it was another slow night for old billig screaming annie found a customer crossing the kärntnerstrasse and turning down krugerstrasse a little past midnight i was waiting my turn at the darts when screaming annie and her furtive male companion peeked into the mowatt screaming annie saw dark inge with me and old billig its after midnight she said to her daughter you go get some rest its a school day tomorrow so we all walked back to the hotel new hampshire more or less together screaming annie and her customer a little ahead of us inge and i on either side of old billig who was talking about the loire valley in france its where id like to retire she said or go for my next holiday dark inge and i knew that old billig always spent her holidaysevery holidaywith her sisters family in baden she took a bus or a train from a stop opposite the opera baden would always be much more accessible to old billig than france when we walked into the hotel franny said that all the guests were in the new hampshire family had gone to bed about an hour ago a youthful swedish couple had gone to bed even earlier some old man from burgenland hadnt left his room all night and some british bicycle enthusiasts had come in drunk doublechecked their bicycles in the basement attempted to be sportive with susie the bear until she growled and were now no doubt passed out in their rooms i went to my room to lift weightspassing lillys door at the magical instant her light went out she had stopped growing for the night i did some forearm curls with the long barbell but i didnt have much interest in it it was too late i was just lifting because i was bored i heard the dressmakers dummy slam off the wall between my room and franks something frank was studying had made him cross and he was taking it out on the dummyor he was just bored too i knocked on the wall keep passing the open windows frank said wo ist die gemütlichkeit i sang halfheartedly i heard franny and susie the bear slipping past my door four hundred and sixtyfour franny i whispered i heard the solid thock of freuds baseball bat falling out of a bed above me babettes bed i could tell father as usual was sleeping soundlydreaming well no doubt dreaming on and on a mans voice blurted out something on the landing of the second floor and i heard jolanta respond she responded by throwing him down the stairs sorrow i heard frank murmur franny was singing the song susie could make her sing so i tried to concentrate on the fight in the lobby it was an easy fight for jolanta i could tell all the pain came from the man you got a cock like a wet sock and you tell me its my fault jolanta was saying this was followed by the sound of the man absorbing a blowthe heel of the hand into the jowl i guessed hard to be sure but there was the sound of the man falling againthat was clear he said something but his words seemed strangled was jolanta choking him i wondered should i interrupt frannys song was this a job for susie the bear and then i heard screaming annie i think everyone on the krugerstrasse heard screaming annie i think that even some fashionable people whod been to the opera and who were just leaving the sacher bar and walking home along the kärntnerstrasse must have heard screaming annie one november day in five years after we left viennatwo seemingly unrelated bits of news made morning headlines in the city as of the seventeenth of november it was announced prostitutes were to be barred from strolling on the graben and the kärntnerstrasseand from all the side streets off the kärntnerstrasse too except the krugerstrasse the whores had owned these streets for years but after they would be given only the krugerstrasse in my opinion the people in vienna gave up on trying to save the krugerstrasse before in my opinion it was screaming annies fake orgasm on the night the new hampshire family was staying with us that determined the official decision that particular fake orgasm finished the krugerstrasse and on the same day in when the austrian officials made their announcements about limiting the kärntnerstrasse prostitutes to the krugerstrasse the newspapers also revealed that a new bridge over the danube had cracked a few hours after the ceremonies that opened the bridge the bridge cracked the official word on the fault of the crack put the blame on the poor sun in my opinion the sun was not to blame only screaming annie could crack a bridgeeven a new bridge there must have been a window open somewhere where she was working i believe that screaming annie faking an orgasm could raise the corpses of the heartless hapsburgs out of their tombs and that night when the timid new hampshire family was visiting us screaming annie got off what was surely the record fake orgasm for the duration of our stay in vienna it was a sevenyear orgasm it was followed so closely by the single short yelp of her male companion that i reached a hand out of my bed and grabbed one of my barbells for support i felt the dressmakers dummy in franks room fly off the wall and frank himself stumbled clumsily toward his door frannys fine song was nipped in the upswing and susie the bear i knew would be frantically searching for her head for all the growing lilly might have accomplished before she turned out her light i knew she probably lost an inch in the single moment of recoiling from screaming annies terrible sound jesus god father called out the man jolanta was beating up in the lobby found the sudden strength necessary to break free and lunge out the door and other prostitutes passing by on the krugerstrassei can only imagine them reconsidering their profession whoever called this the gentle occupation they must have been thinking someone was whimpering babette frightened and thrown out of rhythm with freud freud seeking his baseball bat as a weapon dark inge finally afraid for her mother and it seemed that one of the radicals typewriters way up on the fifth floorall by itself moved itself off a typing table and crashed to the floor in less than a minute we were in the lobby moving up the stairs to the second floor i had never seen franny look so deeply disturbed lilly went to her and hung on her hip frank and i fell in line like soldiers wordlessly drawn to the devastating cry it was over now and the silence screaming annie left behind was almost as bloodcurdling as her bellow jolanta and susie the bear led the way upstairslike bouncers moving in grimly on some unsuspecting rowdies trouble father was muttering that sounded like trouble on the secondfloor landing we met freud and his baseball bat leaning on babette we cant have any more of that freud was saying no hotel can survive it no matter what class of clientelethats too much its just more than anyone can bear earl said susie bristling for a fight jolanta had her hands in her purse again the whimpering continued and i realized it was dark inge too frightened even to investigate her mothers incredible noise when we got to screaming annies door we saw that the new hampshire family were not as timid as they had first appeared the daughter certainly looked halfdead with fright but she was standing almost on her own leaning only slightly on her trembling father he was in his pajamas and a redandblackstriped robe he held the shaft of a bedside lamp in his hand the electrical cord wrapped around his wrist the light bulb and shade removedto make it a more efficient weapon i suppose the woman from new hampshire stood closest to the door it came from there she announced to us all pointing to screaming annies door now its stopped they must be dead stand back her husband said to her the lamp leaping up and down in his hand its not a sight for women or children im sure the woman glared at frank becausei guesshe had been the man at the desk who had officially admitted her to this madhouse were americans she said defiantly weve never been exposed to anything this sordid before but if one of you doesnt have the guts to go in there i will you will father said its clearly a murder the husband said nothing could be clearer the woman said with a knife the daughter said and cringed involuntarilyshe twitched against her father it must have been a knife she almost whispered the husband dropped the lamp then snatched it up again well the woman said to frank but susie the bear pushed forward let the bear in freud said dont mess with the guests just let the bear in earl said susie the husband thinking susie might attack him and his family poked the lamp threateningly in susies face dont make the bear hostile frank warned him and the family retreated be careful susie franny said murder murmured the new hampshire woman something unspeakable her husband said a knife the daughter said it was just a fucking orgasm freud said havent you ever had one for christs sake freud blundered forward with his hand on susies back he struck the door a blow with his baseball bat then fumbled for the knob annie he called i noticed jolanta close behind freud like his larger shadowher fierce hands in her dark purse susie made a convincing snorfle at the base of the door an orgasm said the woman from new hampshireher husband automatically covered the daughters ears my god franny would say later they would bring their daughter to see a murder but they wouldnt even let her hear about an orgasm americans sure are strange susie the bear shouldered the door knocking freud off balance the end of his louisville slugger skidded along the hall floor but jolanta caught the old man and propped him up against the doorjamb and susie roared into the room screaming annie was naked except for her stockings and her garter belt she was smoking a cigarette and she leaned over the completely unmoving man on his back on the bed and blew smoke into his face he didnt flinch or cough and he was naked except for his anklelength dark green socks dead gasped the woman from new hampshire tod whispered freud somebody tell me jolanta took her hands out of her purse and sunk a fist in the mans groin his knees snapped up all by themselves and he coughed then he went flat again hes not dead jolanta said and muscled her way out of the room he just passed right out on me screaming annie said she seemed surprised but i would think later that there was no way you could keep both sane and conscious when you were deluded into thinking that screaming annie was coming it was probably safer to pass out than to hang on and go home crazy is she a whore the husband asked and this time it was the woman from new hampshire who covered her daughters ears she tried to cover the girls eyes too what are you blind freud asked of course shes a whore were all whores dark inge said coming from nowhere and hugging her motherglad to see she was all right whats wrong with that okay okay father said everyone back to bed these are your children the new hampshire woman asked father she wasnt sure which of us to indicate with her sweep of the hand well some of them are father said amiably you should be ashamed the woman told him exposing children to this sordid life i dont think it had occurred to father that we were being exposed to anything particularly sordid nor was the new hampshire womans tone of voice anything father ever would have heard from my mother but nonetheless my father seemed suddenly stricken by this accusation franny said later that she could see in the genuine bewilderment on his faceand then the growing look of something as close to guilt as we would ever see in himthat despite the sorrow fathers dreaming might cause us we would always prefer him dreamy to guilty we could accept him as being out of it but we couldnt like him as much if he were truly a worrier if he had been truly responsible in the way that fathers are expected to be responsible lilly you shouldnt be here darling father said to lilly turning her away from the door i should think not said the husband from new hampshire now struggling to keep both his daughters eyes and ears covered at the same timebut unable to tear himself away from the scene frank take lilly to her room please father said softly franny father asked are you okay dear sure franny said im sorry franny father said steering her down the hall for everything he added hes sorry said the woman from new hampshire facetiously he exposes his children to such disgusting filth as this and hes sorry but franny turned on her we might criticize father but no one else could you dead cunt franny said to the woman franny father said you useless twat franny told the woman you sad wimp she told the man i know just the man to show you whats disgusting she said aybha or gajâsana franny said to them you know what that is but i knew i could feel my hands start to sweat the woman lies prone franny said and the man lies on top of her pressing his loins forward and curving the small of his back the woman from new hampshire shut her eyes upon mention of the word loins the poor husband seemed to be trying to cover the eyes and ears of his entire family at once thats the elephant position franny said and i shuddered the elephant position was one of the two main positions with the cow position in the vyanta group it was the elephant position that ernst spoke of in the dreamiest way i thought i was going to be sick and franny suddenly started to cry father took her down the hall quicklysusie the bear worriedly but ever bearlike went whining after them the customer whod passed out when screaming annie finished the krugerstrasse came to he was awfully embarrassed to find freud me the new hampshire family screaming annie her daughter and babette all looking at him at least i thought he was spared the bearand the rest of my family late as usual old billig wandered in shed been asleep whats going on she asked me didnt screaming annie wake you too i asked her screaming annie doesnt wake me up anymore old billig said its those damn world planners up on the fifth floor i looked at my watch it was still before two in the morning youre still asleep i whispered to old billig the radicals dont come this early im wideawake old billig said some of the radicals never went home last night sometimes they stay all night and theyre usually quiet but screaming annie must have disturbed them they dropped something then they were hissing like snakes trying to pick whatever it was up they shouldnt be here at night freud said ive seen enough of this sordidness the new hampshire woman said seeming to feel ignored ive seen it all freud said mysteriously all the sordidness he said you get used to it babette said shed had enough for one night she went home screaming annie put dark inge back to bed screaming annies embarrassed male companion tried to leave as inconspicuously as possible but the new hampshire family watched him all the way out of the hotel jolanta joined freud and old billig and me at the secondfloor landing we listened up the stairwell but the radicalsif they were therewere quiet now im too old for the stairs old billig said and too smart to poke my nose where im not wanted but theyre up there she said go see then she turned back to the streetto the gentle occupation im blind freud admitted it would take me half the night to climb those stairs and i wouldnt see anything if they were there give me your baseball bat i said to freud ill go see just take me with you jolanta said fuck the bat i need the bat anyway freud said jolanta and i said good night to him and started up the stairs if theres anything to it freud said wake me up and tell me about it or tell me about it in the morning jolanta and i listened for a while on the thirdfloor landing but all we could hear was the new hampshire family sliding every object of furniture against their doors the youthful swedish couple had slept through it allapparently used to some kind of orgasm or used to murder the old man from burgenland had possibly died in his room shortly after checking in the bicyclists from great britain were on the fourth floor and probably too drunk to be aroused i thought but when jolanta and i paused on the fourthfloor landing and listened for the radicals we encountered one of the british bicyclists there bloody strange he whispered to us what is i said thought i heard a bloody scream he said but it was down stairs now i hear them dragging the body round up stairs bloody odd he looked at jolanta does the tart speak english he asked me the tarts with me i said why not just go back to bed i was perhaps eighteen or nineteen on this night i think the effects of the weight lifting i noticed were beginning to impress people the british bicyclist went back to bed what do you think is going on i asked jolanta nodding upstairs toward the silent fifth floor she shrugged it was nowhere near mothers shrug or frannys shrug but it was a womans shrug she put her big hands in the deadly purse what do i care whats going on she asked they might change the world jolanta said of the radicals but they wont change me this somehow reassured me and we climbed to the fifth floor i hadnt been up there since id helped move the typewriters and office equipment three or four years ago even the hall looked different there were a lot of boxes in the hall and jugsof chemicals or wine i wondered more chemicals than they needed for the one mimeograph machine anywayif they were chemicals fluids for the car i might have thought i didnt know i did the unsuspecting thing i knocked on the first door jolanta and i came to ernst opened it he was smiling whats up he asked cant sleep too many orgasms he saw jolanta just behind me looking for a more private room he asked me then he asked us in the room adjoined two othersi remembered that it was once joined to only one otherand its furnishings looked substantially different although over the years i had not seen a single large item carried in or out just those things i assumed schraubenschlüssel needed for the car schraubenschlüssel was in the room and arbeiterthe everworking arbeiter it must have been one of the large batterytype boxes that old billig and i had heard fall off a table because the typewriters were in another part of the room clearly no one had been typing there were some mapsor maybe they were blueprintsspread about and there was the automobilelike equipment one associates with service garages not offices chemical things electrical things the radical old billig whod called arbeiter crazy was not there and my sweet fehlgeburt like a good student of american literature was either home reading or home asleep in my opinion just the bad radicals were there ernst arbeiter and wrench that was one hell of an orgasm tonight schraubenschlüssel said leering at jolanta another fake jolanta said maybe that one was real arbeiter said dream on jolanta said youve got the tough one following you around eh ernst said to me youve got the tough piece of meat with you i see all you do is write about it jolanta said to him you probably cant get it up i know just the position for you ernst told her but i didnt want to hear it i was frightened of them all were going i said sorry to disturb you we just didnt know anyone was here at night the work backs up if we dont occasionally stay late arbeiter said with jolanta at my side her strong hands hugging something in her purse we said good night and it was not my imagination thatjust as i was leavingi caught sight of another figure in the shadows of the farthest adjoining room she also had a purse but what she had in her purse was outin her hand and trained on jolanta and me it was just a glimpse i had of her and her gun before she slipped back in the shadows and jolanta closed the door jolanta didnt see her jolanta just kept watching ernst but i saw her our gentle motherlike radical schwangerwith a gun in her hand what do you have in your purse anyway i asked jolanta she shrugged i said good night to her but she slipped a big hand down the front of my pants and held me a moment id hopped out of bed and into some clothes so fast that id not taken the time for underwear you going to send me out on the street again she asked me i want just one more trick before i call it a night its too late for me i said but she could feel me growing hard in her hand it doesnt feel too late she said i think my wallets in another pair of pants i lied pay me later jolanta said ill trust you how much i asked when she squeezed harder for you only three hundred schillings she said for everyone i knew it was three hundred schillings its too much i said it doesnt feel like too much she said giving me a sharp twist i was very hard at the moment and it hurt youre hurting me i said im sorry but i dont want to you want to all right she said but she let me go she looked at her watch she shrugged again she walked down the stairs to the lobby with me i said good night to her again when i went to my room and she went out on the krugerstrasse screaming annie was coming back inwith another victim i lay in bed wondering if i could fall soundly enough asleep so that the next fake orgasm would leave me alone then i thought id never make it so i lay awake waiting for itafter which i hoped id have plenty of time for sleep but this one was a long time coming i began to imagine that it had already happened that i had dozed off and missed it and solike life itselfi believed that what was about to happen had already taken place was already over and i allowed myself to forget it only to be surprised by it moments later out of that soundest sleepright when youve first fallen offscreaming annies fake orgasm dragged me sorrow frank cried in his dreams like poor iowa bob startled by his premonition of the beast who would do him in i swear i could feel franny tense in her sleep susie snorted lilly said what the hotel new hampshire shuddered with the silence following a thunderclap perhaps it was later actually in my sleep that i heard something heavy being carried downstairs and out the lobby door to schraubenschlüssels car at first i mistook the cautious sound for jolanta carrying a dead customer out to the street but she wouldnt have bothered about trying to be quiet i am just imagining this i said in my sleep when frank knocked on the wall keep passing the open windows i whispered frank and i met in the hall we watched the radicals loading the car through the lobby window whatever they were loading looked heavy and still at first i thought it might be the body of old billigthe radicalbut they were being too careful with whatever it was for the thing to be a body whatever it was required propping up in the backseat between arbeiter and ernst then schraubenschlüssel drove whatever it was away through the window of the departing car frank and i saw the mysterious thing in silhouetteslightly slumped against ernst and bigger than him and tilting away from arbeiter whose arm was ineffectually wrapped around it as if he were hopelessly trying to reinterest a lover who was leaning toward someone else the thingwhatever it waswas quite clearly not human but it was somehow strangely animal in its appearance im sure now of course that it was completely mechanical but its shape seemed animal in the passing caras if ernst the pornographer and arbeiter held a bear between them or a big dog it was just a carload of sorrow as frank and iand all of uswould learn but its mystery plagued me i tried to describe it and what jolanta and i had seen on the fifth floor to father and freud i tried to describe the feeling of it all to franny and susie the bear too frank and i had the longest talk about schwanger im sure youre mistaken about the gun frank said not schwanger she might have been there she might have wanted you to not associate her with them and so she was hiding from you but she wouldnt have a gun and certainly she would never have pointed it at you were like her childrenshes told us youre imagining again frank said sorrow floats seven years in a place you hate is a long time at least i felt franny was safe that was always the main thing franny was in limbo she was taking it easy marking time with susie the bearand so i felt comfortable treading water too at the university lilly and i would major in american literature fehlgeburt would be so pleased lilly majored in it of course because she wanted to be a writershe wanted to grow i majored in it as yet another indirect way of courting the aloof miss miscarriage it seemed the most romantic thing to do franny would major in world dramashe was always the heavyweight among us we would never catch up and frank took schwangers motherly and radical advice frank majored in economics thinking of father and freud we all realized someone ought to and frank would be the one to save us in time so we would all be grateful to economics frank actually had a dual major although the university would give him only a degree in economics i guess i could say that frank minored in world religions know thine enemy frank would say smiling for seven years we all floated we learned german but we spoke only our native language among ourselves we learned literature drama economy religion but the sight of freuds baseball bat could break our hearts for the land of baseball though none of us was much interested in the game that louisville slugger could bring tears to our eyes we learned from the whores that outside the inner city the mariahilfer strasse was the most promising huntingground for ladies of the night and every whore spoke of getting out of the business if she was ever demoted to the districts past the westbahnhof to the kaffee eden to the onehundredschilling standing fucks in the gaudenzdorfer gürtel we learned from the radicals that prostitution wasnt even officially legalas we had thoughtthat there were registered whores who played by the rules got their medical checkups trafficked in the right districts and that there were pirates who never registered or who turned in a büchl a license but continued to practice the profession that there were almost a thousand registered whores in the city in the early s that decadence was increasing at the necessary rate for the revolution actually what revolution was supposed to take place we never learned i dont know if all the radicals were sure either got your büchl we children would ask each other going to schooland later going to the university that andkeep passing the open windows the refrain from our king of mice song our father seemed to have lost his character when our mother was lost to him in seven years i believe he grew to be more of a presence and less of a personfor us children he was affectionate he could even be sentimental but he seemed as lost to us as a father as mother and egg and i think we sensed that he would need to endure some more concrete suffering before he would gain his character backbefore he could actually become a character again in the way egg had been a character in the way iowa bob had been one i sometimes thought that father was even less of a character than freud for seven years we missed our father as if he had been on that plane we were waiting for the hero in him to take shape and perhaps doubting its final formfor with freud as a model one had to doubt my fathers vision in seven years i would be twentytwo lilly trying to grow and grow would grow to be eighteen franny would be twentythreewith chipper dove still the first and susie the bear her oneandonly frank at twentyfour grew a beard it was almost as embarrassing as lillys wanting to be a writer mobydick would sink the pequod and only ishmael would survive again and again to tell his tale to fehlgeburt who told it to us in my years at the university i used to press upon fehlgeburt my desire to hear her read mobydick aloud to me i can never read this book by myself i begged her i have to hear it from you and that at last provided me with the entrance to fehlgeburts cramped desultory room behind the rathaus near the university she would read to me in the evenings and i would try to coax out of her why some of the radicals chose to spend the night in the hotel new hampshire you know fehlgeburt would tell me the single ingredient in american literature that distinguishes it from other literatures of the world is a kind of giddy illogical hopefulness it is quite technically sophisticated while remaining ideologically naïve fehlgeburt told me on one of our walks to her room frank would eventually take the hint and no longer accompany usthough this took him about five years and the evening fehlgeburt told me that american literature was quite technically sophisticated while remaining ideologically naïve was not the evening i first tried to kiss her after the line ideologically naïve i think a kiss would have seemed out of place the night i first kissed fehlgeburt we were in her room she had just read that part when ahab refuses to help the captain of the rachel search for the lost son fehlgeburt had no furniture in her room there were too many books and a mattress on the floora mattress for a single bedand a single reading lamp also on the floor it was a cheerless place as dry and as crowded as a dictionary as lifeless as ernsts logic and i leaned across the uncomfortable bed and kissed fehlgeburt on the mouth dont she said but i kept kissing her until she kissed me back you should go she said lying down on her back and pulling me on top of her now i said no now it is not necessary to go she said sitting up she started to undress she did it the way she usually marked her place in mobydickuninterestedly i should go after i asked undressing myself if you want she said i mean you should go from the hotel new hampshire you and your family leave she said leave before the fall season what fall season i asked her completely naked now i was thinking about junior joness fall season with the cleveland browns the opera season fehlgeburt said naked herselfat last she was as thin as a novella she was no bigger than some of the shortest stories she had ever read to lilly it was as if all the books in her room had been feeding on her had consumednot nourishedher the opera season will start in the fall fehlgeburt said and you and your family must leave the hotel new hampshire by then promise me she said halting me from moving farther up her gaunt body why i asked please leave she said when i entered her i thought it was the sex that brought her tears on but it was something else am i the first i asked fehlgeburt was twentynine first and last she said crying do you have anything to protect you i asked inside her i mean you know so you dont get schwanger it doesnt matter she said in franks irritating fashion why i asked trying to move cautiously because ill be dead before the babys born she said i pulled out i sat her up beside me but shewith surprising strengthpulled me back on top of her she took me in her hand and put me back inside her come on she said impatientlybut it was not the impatience of desire it was something else fuck me she said flatly then stay the night or go home i dont care just leave the hotel new hampshire please leave itplease make sure lilly especially leaves it she begged me then she cried harder and lost what slight interest shed ever had in the sex i lay still inside her growing smaller i felt coldi felt the draft of coldness from under the ground like the coldness i remembered feeling when frank first read to us from ernsts pornography what are they doing on the fifth floor at night i asked fehlgeburt who bit into my shoulder and shook her head her eyes closed tightly in a violent squint what are they planning i asked her i grew so small i slipped completely outside of her i felt her shaking and i shook too theyre going to blow up the opera she whispered at one of the peak performances she whispered theyre going to blow up the marriage of figarosomething popular like that or something heavier she said im not sure which performancetheyre not sure but one thats fullhouse fehlgeburt said the whole opera theyre crazy i said i didnt recognize my voice it sounded creaky it was like old billigs voiceold billig the whore or old billig the radical fehlgeburt shook her head back and forth under me her stringy hair whipped my face please get your family out she whispered especially lilly she said little lilly she blubbered but theyre not going to blow up the hotel too are they i asked fehlgeburt everyone will be involved she said ominously it has to involve everyone or its no good she said and i heard arbeiters voice behind hers or ernsts allembracing logic a phase a necessary phase everything schlagobers the erotic the state opera the hotel new hampshireeverything had to go it was all decadent i could hear them intoning it was full of disgust they would litter the ringstrasse with art lovers with oldfashioned idealists silly and irrelevant enough to like opera they would make some point or other by this kind of everythingbombing promise me fehlgeburt whispered in my ear youll get them out your family everybody in it i promise i said of course dont tell anyone i told you she said to me of course not i said please come back inside me now fehlgeburt said please come inside me i want to feel itjust once she added why just once i asked just do it she said do everything to me i did everything to her i regret it i am forever guilty for it it was as desperate and joyless as any sex in the second hotel new hampshire ever was if you think youre going to die before youll even have time to have a baby i told fehlgeburt later why dont you leave when we leave why dont you get away before they do it or before they try i cant she said simply why i asked of these radicals in our hotel new hampshire i would always be asking why because i drive the car fehlgeburt said im the driver she said and the cars the main bomb its the one that starts all the rest and someone has to drive it and its mei drive the bomb fehlgeburt said why you i asked her trying to hold her trying to get her to stop shaking because im the most expendable she said and there was ernsts dead voice again there was arbeiters lawnmowerlike process of thought i realized that in order for fehlgeburt to believe this even our gentle schwanger would have had to convince her why not schwanger i asked miss miscarriage shes too important fehlgeburt said shes wonderful she said admiringlyand full of loathing for herself why not wrench i asked hes obviously good with cars thats why fehlgeburt said hes too necessary there will be other cars other bombs to build its the hostage part i dont like she blurted out suddenly its not necessary this time she added there will be better hostages who are the hostages i asked your family she said because youre americans more than austria will notice us then she said thats the idea whose idea i asked ernsts she said why not let ernst be the driver i asked hes the idea man fehlgeburt said he thinks it all up everything she added everything indeed i thought and arbeiter i asked he doesnt know how to drive hes too loyal she said we cant lose anyone that loyal i am not so loyal she whispered look at me she cried im telling you all this arent i and old billig i asked winding down hes not trustworthy fehlgeburt said he doesnt even know the plan hes too slippery he thinks of his own survival thats bad i asked her brushing her hair back off her streaked face at this phase thats bad fehlgeburt said and i realized what she was a reader only a reader she read other peoples stories just beautifully she took direction she followed the leader why i wanted to hear her read mobydick was the same reason the radicals had made her the driver we both knew she would do it she wouldnt stop have we done everything fehlgeburt asked me what i said and wincedand would wince forever to hear that echo of egg even from myself have we done everything sexually fehlgeburt asked was that it was that everything i tried to remember i think so i said do you want to do more not especially she said i just wanted to have done it all once she said if weve done it all you can go homeif you want she added she shrugged it was not mothers shrug not frannys not even jolantas shrug this was not quite a human movement it was less a twitch than it was a kind of electrical pulsation a mechanical lurch of her taut body a dim signal the dimmest i thought it was a nobodyhome sign it was an imnotin dontcallmeillcallyou signal it was a tick of a clock or of a time bomb fehlgeburts eyes blinked once at me then she was asleep i gathered my clothes i saw she hadnt bothered to mark the spot where she stopped reading in mobydick i didnt bother to mark it either it was after midnight when i crossed the ringstrasse walking from the rathausplatz down the dr karl rennerring and into the volksgarten in the beer garden some students were shouting at each other in a friendly way i probably knew some of them but i didnt stop for a beer i didnt want to talk about the art of this or that i didnt want to have another conversation about the alexandria quartetabout which was the best of those novels and which was the worst and why i didnt want to hear about who benefited the most from their correspondencehenry miller or lawrence durrell i didnt even want to talk about die blechtrommel which was the best thing there was to talk about perhaps ever and i didnt want to have another conversation about eastwest relations about socialism and democracy about the longterm effects of president kennedys assassinationand being an american what did i think of the racial question it was the end of the summer of i hadnt been in the united states since and i knew less about my country than some of the viennese students knew i also knew less about vienna than any of them i knew about my family i knew about our whores and our radicals i was an expert on the hotel new hampshire and an amateur at everything else i walked all the way through the heldenplatzthe plaza of heroesand stood where thousands of cheering fascists had greeted hitler once i thought that fanatics would always have an audience all one might hope to influence was the size of the audience i thought i must remember this perception and test it against frank who would either take it over as his own perception or revise it or correct me i wished id read as much as frank i wished id tried to grow as hard as lilly in fact lilly had sent off the efforts of her growth to some publisher in new york she wasnt even going to tell us but she had to borrow money from franny for the postage its a novel lilly said sheepishly its a little autobiographical how little frank had asked her well its really imaginative autobiography lilly said its a lot autobiographical you mean franny said oh boy i cant wait frank said i bet i come off like a real loon no lilly said everyone is a hero were all heroes i asked well you all are heroes to me lilly said so in the book you are too even father franny asked well hes the most imagined lilly said and i thought that father had to be the most imagined because he was the least realhe was the least there of any of us sometimes it seemed father was less with us than egg whats the book called dear father had asked lilly trying to grow lilly had admitted what else franny said how fars it go frank asked i mean wheres it stop its over with the plane crash lilly said thats the end the end of reality i thought just short of the plane crash seemed like a perfectly good place to stopto me youre going to need an agent frank said to lilly that will be me frank would become lillys agent he would become frannys agent and fathers agent and even my agent tooin time he hadnt majored in economics for nothing but i didnt know that on that endofthesummer evening in when i left fehlgeburt poor miss miscarriage asleep and no doubt dreaming of her spectacular sacrifice her expendable nature was virtually all i could see when i stood alone in the plaza of heroes and recalled how hitler had made so many people seem expendable to such a mob of true believers in the quiet evening i could almost hear the mindless din of sieg heil i could see the absolute selfseriousness of schraubenschlüssels face when he tightened down the nut and washer on an engineblock bolt and what else had he been tightening down i could see the dull glaze of devotion in arbeiters eyes making the statement to the press upon his triumphant arrestand our motherlike schwanger sipping her kaffee mit schlagobers the whipped cream leaving its pleasant little moustache upon her downy upper lip i could see the way schwanger braided lillys pigtail humming to lillys lovely hair the way mother had hummed how schwanger told franny that she had the worlds most beautiful skin and the worlds most beautiful hands and i had bedroom eyes schwanger saidoh i was going to be dangerous she warned me having just left fehlgeburt i felt not very dangerous there would always be a little schlagobers in schwangers kisses and frank schwanger said was a genius if only he would consider politics more thoughtfully all this affection did schwanger shower on usall this with a gun in her purse i wanted to see ernst in the cow positionwith a cow and in the elephant position with you know what they were as crazy as old billig said they would kill us all i wandered on the dorotheergasse toward the graben i stopped for a kafee mit schlagobers at the hawelka a man with a beard at the table beside me was explaining to a young girl younger than him about the death of representational painting he was describing the exact painting wherein this death of the whole art form had occurred i didnt know the painting i thought about the schieles and the klimts that frank had introduced me toat the albertina and at the upper belvedere i wished klimt and schiele were able to talk to this man but the man was now addressing the death of rhyme and meter in poetry again i didnt know the poem and when he moved on to the novel i thought id better pay up and leave my waiter was busy so i had to listen to the story of the death of plot and characterization among the many deaths the man described he included the death of sympathy i was beginning to feel sympathy die within me when my waiter finally got to my table democracy was the next death it came and went more quickly than my waiter could produce my change and socialism passed away before i could figure the tip i stared at the man with the beard and felt like lifting weights i felt that if the radicals wanted to blow up the opera they should pick a night when only this man with the beard was there i thought id found a substitute driver for fehlgeburt trotsky the young girl with the bearded man blurted out suddenlyas if she were saying thank you trotsky i said leaning over their table it was a small square table i was curling seventyfive pounds on one arm on each of the dumbbells in those days the table wasnt nearly that heavy so i picked it up carefully with one hand and lifted it over my head the way a waiter would raise a tray now good old trotsky i said if you want an easy life good old trotsky said you picked the wrong century to be born in do you think thats true i asked the man with the beard he said nothing but the young girl nudged him and he perked up a little i think its true the girl said sure its true i said i was aware of the waiters nervously watching the drinks and the ashtray sliding slightly on the table over my head but i was not iowa bob the weights never slid off the bar when i lifted not anymore i was better with weights than iowa bob trotsky was killed with a pickax the bearded fellow said morosely trying to remain unimpressed but hes not dead is he i asked insanelysmiling nothings really dead i said nothing he said is dead i said the paintings that we can still seetheyre not dead i said the characters in booksthey dont die when we stop reading about them the man with the beard stared at the place where his table was supposed to be he was really quite dignified i thought and i knew i was in a bad mood and wasnt being fair i was being a bully and i felt ashamed i gave the table back to the couple nothing spilled i see what you mean the girl called after me as i was leaving but i knew i had kept no one alive not ever not those people in the opera because sitting among them was surely that shape frank and i had seen in the car driven away between ernst and arbeiter that animal shape of death that mechanical bear that dogs head of chemistry that electrical charge of sorrow and despite what trotsky said he was dead mother and egg and iowa bob were dead toodespite everything they said and everything they meant to us i walked out on the graben feeling more and more like frank feeling antieverything i felt out of control its no good for a weight lifter to feel out of control the first prostitute i passed was not one of ours but id seen her beforeat the kaffee mowatt guten abend she said fuck you i told her up yours she told me she knew that much english and i felt lousy i was using bad language again i had broken my promise to mother it was the first and last time i would break it i was twentytwo years old and i started to cry i turned down spiegelgasse there were whores there but they werent our whores so i didnt do anything when they said guten abend i said guten abend back i didnt answer the other things they said i cut across the neuer markt i felt the vacancies in the chests of the hapsburgs in their tombs another whore called to me hey dont cry she called to me a big strong boy like youdont cry but i hoped i was crying not just for myself but for them all for freud calling out the names whod never answer in the judenplatz for what father couldnt see for franny for i loved herand i wanted her to be as faithful to me as she had proved she could be to susie the bear for susie too because franny had shown me that susie wasnt ugly at all in fact franny had almost convinced susie of this for junior jones who was suffering the first of the knee injuries that would force his retirement from the cleveland browns for lilly who tried so hard and for frank whod gone so far away in order to be closer to life he said for dark inge who was eighteenwho said she was old enough though screaming annie insisted she wasntwho before this year was over would run away with a man he was as black as her father and he took her to an armybase town in germany she would later become a whore there i would be told and screaming annie would scream a slightly different song for all of them for my doomed fehlgeburt even for the deceiving schwangerfor both old billigs they were optimists they were china bears for everyoneexcept ernst except arbeiter except that wrench of a man except for chipper dove i hated them i brushed past a whore or two signaling me off the kärntnerstrasse a tall stunning whoreout of the league of our krugerstrasse whoresblew me a kiss from the corner of the annagasse i walked right by the krugerstrasse without looking not wanting to see one of them or all of them waving to me i passed the hotel sacherwhich the hotel new hampshire would never be and then i came to the staatsoper i came to the house of gluck as frank would recite i came to the state opera which was the house of mozart the house of haydn of beethoven and schubertof strauss brahms bruckner and mahler this was the house that a pornographer playing with politics wanted to blow skyhigh it was huge in seven years i had never been in itit seemed classier than i was and i was never the music fan that frank was and never the lover of drama that franny was frank and franny went to the opera all the time freud took them he loved to listen franny and frank described it all to him like me lilly had never been to the opera the place was too big lilly said it frightened her it frightened me now it is too big to blow up i thought but it was the people they wanted to blow up i knew and people are more easily destroyed than buildings what they wanted was a spectacle they wanted what arbeiter had shouted to schwanger they wanted schlagobers and blood on the kärntnerstrasse across from the opera was a sausage vendor a man with a kind of hotdog cart selling different kinds of wurst mit senf und bauernbrota kind of sausage with mustard on rye i didnt want one i knew what i wanted i wanted to grow up in a hurry when id made love to fehlgeburt i had told her es war sehr schön but it wasnt it was very nice i had lied but it wasnt anything it wasnt enough it had been just another night of weight lifting when i turned down the krugerstrasse i had already decided that i would go with the first one who approached meeven if it was old billig even if it was jolanta i bravely promised myself it didnt matter maybe one by one i would try them all i could do anything freud could do and freud had done it allour freud and the other freud i thought they had simply gone as far as they could nobody i knew was in the kaffee mowatt and i didnt recognize the figure standing under the pink neon hotel new hampshire hotel new hampshire hotel new hampshire its babette i thought vaguely repulsedbut it was just the sicklysweet diesel breeze of the last night of summer that made me think of her the woman saw me and started walking toward meaggressively i thought hungrily too and i was sure it was screaming annie i momentarily wondered how i would hold together during her famous fake orgasm maybegiven my fondness for whisperingi could ask her not to do it at all i could simply tell her i knew it was a fake and it simply wasnt necessary not for my benefit the woman was too slender to be old billig but she was too solid to be screaming annie i realized she was too well built to be screaming annie so it was jolanta i thought at last i would find out what she kept in her evil purse in the time ahead i thoughtshudderingi might even have to use whats in jolantas purse but the woman approaching me was not solid enough for jolanta this woman was too well built in the other wayshe was too sleek too youthful in her movements she ran toward me on the street and caught me in her arms she took my breath away she was so beautiful the woman was franny where have you been she asked me gone all day gone all night she scolded me weve all been dying to find you why i asked frannys smell made me dizzy lillys going to get published franny said some publisher in new york is really going to buy her book how much i said because i was hoping it might be enough it might be our ticket out of viennathe ticket that the second hotel new hampshire would never buy us jesus god franny said your sister has a literary success and you ask how muchyoure just like frank thats just what frank asked good for frank i said i was still trembling i had been looking for a prostitute and had found my sister she wouldnt let go of me either where were you franny asked me she pushed my hair back with fehlgeburt i said sheepishly i would never lie to franny franny frowned well how was it she asked still touching mebut like a sister not so great i said i looked away from franny awful i added franny put her arms around me and kissed me she meant to kiss me on the cheek like a sister but i turned toward her though i was trying to turn away and our lips met and that was it that was all it took that was the end of the summer of suddenly it was autumn i was twentytwo franny was twentythree we kissed a long time there was nothing to say she was not a lesbian she still wrote to junior jonesand to chipper doveand i had never been happy with another woman not ever not yet we stayed out on the street out of the light cast by the neon so that no one in the hotel new hampshire could see us we had to break up our kissing when a customer of jolantas came staggering out of the hotel and we broke it up again when we heard screaming annie in a little while her dazed customer came out but franny and i still stayed on the krugerstrasse later babette went home then jolanta went home taking dark inge with her screaming annie came out and back out and back like the tide old billig the whore went across the street to the kaffee mowatt and dozed on a table i walked franny up to the kärntnerstrasse and down to the opera you think of me too much franny started to say but she didnt bother to finish we kissed some more the opera was so big beside us theyre going to blow it up i whispered to my sister the operatheyre going to blow it up she let me hold her i love you terribly much i told her i love you too damn it franny said although the weather was feeling like fall it was possible for us to stand there guarding the opera until the light came up and the real people came out to go to work there was no place we could go anywayand absolutely nothing we knew that we should do keep passing the open windows we whispered to each other when we finally went back to the hotel new hampshire the opera was still standing theresafe safe for a while anyway i thought safer than we are i told franny safer than love let me tell you kid franny said to me squeezing my hand everythings safer than love a night at the opera schlagobers and blood children children father said to us we must be very careful i think this is the turning point kids our father said as if we were still eight nine ten and so forth and he was telling us about meeting mother at the arbuthnotbytheseathat night they first saw freud with state omaine theres always a turning point frank said philosophically okay supposing there is franny said impatiently but what is this particular turning point yeah said susie the bear looking franny over very carefully susie was the only one whod noticed that franny and i were out all night franny had told her wed gone to a party near the university with some people susie didnt know and what could be safer than having your brother and a weight lifter for an escort susie didnt like parties anyway if she went as a bear there was no one she could talk to and if she didnt go as a bear no one seemed interested in talking to her she looked sulky and cross theres a lot of shit to deal with in a hurry as i see it said susie the bear exactly father said thats the typical turningpoint situation we cant blow this one freud said i dont think i got many more hotels left in me which might be a good thing i thought trying to keep my eyes off franny we were all in franks room the conference roomas if the dressmakers dummy were a soothing presence were a silent ghost of mother or egg or iowa bob somehow the dummy was supposed to radiate signals and we were supposed to catch the signals according to frank how much can we get for the novel frank father asked its lillys book franny said its not our book in a way it is lilly said precisely frank said and the way i understand publishing its out of her hands now now is where we either get taken or we make a killing its just about growing up lilly said im sort of surprised theyre interested theyre only five thousand dollars interested lilly franny said we need fifteen or twenty thousand to leave father said if were going to have a chance to do anything with it back home he added dont forget well get something for this place freud said defensively not after we blow the whistle on the fucking bombers said susie the bear there will be such a scandal frank said we wont get a buyer i told you well get the police on our ass if we blow the whistle at all freud said you dont know our police their gestapo tactics theyll find something were doing wrong with the whores too well theres a lot that is wrong franny said we couldnt look at each other when franny talked i looked out the window i saw old billig the radical crossing the street i saw screaming annie dragging herself home theres no way we cant blow the whistle father said if they actually think they can blow up the opera theres no talking to them there never was any talking to them franny said we just listened theyve always been crazy i said to father dont you know that daddy lilly asked him father hung his head he was fortyfour a distinguished gray appearing on the thick brown hair around his ears he had never worn sideburns and he had his hair cut in a uniform midear midforehead justcoveringthebackofhisneck way he never thinned it he wore bangs like a little boy and his hair fit his head so dramatically well that from a distance we were sometimes fooled into thinking that father was wearing a helmet im sorry kids father said shaking his head i know this isnt very pleasant but i feel were at the turning point he shook his head some more he looked really lost to us and it was only later that i would remember him on franks bed in that dressmakers dummy of a room as looking really quite handsome and in charge of things father was always good at creating the illusion that he was in charge of things earl for example he hadnt lifted the weights like iowa bob or like me but father had kept his athletic figure and certainly he had kept his boyishnesstoo fucking much boyishness as franny would say it occurred to me that he must be lonely in seven years he hadnt had a date and if he used the whores he was discreet about itand in that hotel new hampshire who could be that discreet he cant be seeing any of them franny had said id simply know it if he was men are sneaky susie the bear had said even nice guys so hes not doing it thats settled franny had said susie the bear had shrugged and franny had hit her but in franks room it was father who brought up the whores we should tell them what were going to do about the crazy radicals father said before we tell the police why susie the bear asked him one of them might blow the whistle on us why would they do that i asked susie we should tell them so they can make other plans father said theyll have to change hotels freud said the damn police will close us down in this country youre guilty by association freud cried just ask any jew just ask the other freud i thought but suppose we were heroes father said and we all looked at him yes that would be nice i was thinking like in lillys book frank asked father suppose the police thought that we were heroes for uncovering the bomb plot father asked the police dont think that way freud said but suppose as americans father said we told the american consulate or the embassy and someone over there passed on the information to the austrian authoritiesas if this whole thing had been a really topsecret firstclass kind of intrigue this is why i love you win berry freud said tapping time to some interior tune with his baseball bat you really are a dreamer freud told my father this is no firstclass intrigue this is a secondclass hotel freud said even i can see that he said and in case you havent noticed im blind and those arent any firstclass terrorists either freud said they cant keep a perfectly good car running he shouted i for one dont believe they know how to blow up the opera i actually think were perfectly safe if they had a bomb theyd probably fall downstairs with it the whole car is the bomb i said or its the main bombwhatever that means thats what fehlgeburt said lets talk to fehlgeburt lilly said i trust fehlgeburt she added wondering how the girl who had virtually been her tutor for seven years had actually become so convinced of destroying herself and if fehlgeburt had been lillys tutor schwanger had been lillys nanny but we wouldnt see fehlgeburt again i assumed it was me she was trying not to see i assumed she was seeing the others at the end of the summer of as the fall season loomedi was doing my best not ever to be alone with franny and franny was trying hard to convince susie the bear that although nothing had changed between them franny thought it was best that they be just good friends susies so insecure franny told me i mean shes really sweetas lilly would saybut im trying to let her down without undermining what little confidence i might have given her i mean she was just beginning to like herself just a little i had her almost believing she wasnt ugly to look at now that im rejecting her shes turning into a bear again i love you i told franny with my head down but what are we going to do were going to love each other franny said but were not going to do anything not ever franny i asked her not now anyway franny said but her hand trailed across her lap across her tighttogether knees and into my lapwhere she squeezed my thigh so hard i jumped not here anyway she whispered fiercely then let me go maybe its just desire she added want to try the desire on someone else and see if the thing between us goes away who else is there i said it was late afternoon in her room i would not dare be in frannys room after dark which one do you think about franny asked me i knew she meant the whores jolanta i said my hand involuntarily flying from my side and knocking a lampshade askew franny turned her back to me well you know who i think about dont you she asked ernst i said and my teeth chatteredi was so cold do you like that idea she asked me god no i whispered you and your damn whispering franny said well i dont like you with jolanta either so we wont i said im afraid we will she said why franny i said and i started across her room toward her no stop she cried moving so that her desk was partially between us there was a fragile standing lamp in the way years later lilly would send us both a poem when i read the poem i called up franny to see if lilly had sent her a copy of course she had the poem was by a very good poet named donald justice and i would one day hear mr justice read his poems in new york city i liked all of them but i sat holding my breath while he was reading half hoping he would read the poem lilly sent to franny and me and half fearing he would he didnt read it and i didnt know what to do after the reading people were speaking to him but they looked like his friendsor maybe they were just other poets lilly told me that poets have a way of looking like theyre all one anothers friends but i didnt know what to do if franny had been with me we would have just waltzed right up to donald justice and he would have been completely bowled over by franny i thinkeveryone always is mr justice looked like a real gentleman and i dont want to suggest that he would have been falling all over franny i thought that like his poems he would be both candid and formal austere even gravebut open even generous he looked like a man youd ask to say an elegy for someone youd loved i think he could have done a heartbreaker for iowa bob andlooking at him after his reading in new york with some very smartlooking admirers around himi wished he could have written and spoken some sort of elegy for mother and for egg in a way he did write an elegy for egg he wrote a poem called on the death of friends in childhood which i have taken rather personally as an elegy for egg frank and i both love it but franny says it makes her too sad on the death of friends in childhood we shall not ever meet them bearded in heaven nor sunning themselves among the bald of hell if anywhere in the deserted schoolyard at twilight forming a ring perhaps or joining hands in games whose very names we have forgotten come memory let us seek them there in the shadows but when i saw mr justice in new york i was thinking chiefly about franny and the poem loves stratagemsthat was the name of the poem lilly sent franny and me i didnt even know what to say to mr justice i was too embarrassed to even shake his hand i suppose i would have told him that i wished id read the poem loves stratagems when i was in vienna with franny at the dead end of the summer of but would it have mattered anyway franny would ask me later would we have believed itthen i dont even know if donald justice had written loves stratagems by but he must have it seems written for franny and me it doesnt matter as frank would say anyway years later franny and i would get loves stratagems in the mail from dear little lilly and one night we would read it aloud to each other over the telephone i tended to whisper when i read something that was good aloud but franny spoke up loud and clear loves stratagems but these maneuverings to avoid the touching of hands these shifts to keep the eyes employed on objects more or less neutral as honor for the time being commands will hardly prevent their downfall stronger medicines are needed already they find none of their stratagems have succeeded nor would have no not had their eyes been stricken blind hands cut off at the elbow stronger medicines were needed indeed had our hands been cut off at the elbow franny and i would have touched each other with the stumpswith whatever we had left stricken blind or not but that afternoon in her room we were saved by susie the bear somethings up susie said shuffling in franny and i waited we thought she meant uswe thought she knew lilly knew of course somehow she must have writers know everything lilly said once or they should they ought to or they ought to shut up lilly must have known from the beginning franny said to me long distance the night we discovered loves stratagems it was not a good connection there was crackling on the lineas if lilly were listening in or frank were listening infrank was as i have said born to the role of listening in on love somethings up you two susie the bear repeated menacingly they cant find fehlgeburt whos they i asked the porno king and his whole fucking gang susie said theyre asking us if weve seen fehlgeburt and last night they were asking the whores nobody has seen her i said and there was the growingly familiar cold draft up the pants legs again there was the whiff of dead air from the tombs holding the heartless hapsburgs how many days had we waited for father and freud to bicker over finding a buyer for the hotel new hampshire before they blew the whistle on the wouldbe bombers and how many nights had we wasted arguing about whether we should tell the american consulate or the embassy and have them tell the policeor whether we should just tell the austrian police straightaway when youre in love with your sister you lose a lot of perspective on the real world the goddamn welt as frank would say frank asked me what floor does fehlgeburt live on i mean youve seen her place how high up is she lilly the writer tuned right in on the question but it didnt make sense to meyet its the first floor i said to frank its just one flight up not high enough lilly said and then i got it not high enough to jump out the window is what she meant if fehlgeburt had at last decided not to keep passing the open windows she would have to have found another way thats it frank said taking my arm if shes pulled a king of mice shes probably still there it was more than a little shortness of breath i felt crossing the plaza of heroes and heading up the ring toward the rathaus thats a long way for a wind sprint but i was in shape i felt a little out of breath there can be no doubt of that but i felt a lot guiltythough it couldnt have been simply me i couldnt even have been fehlgeburts main reason to stop passing the open windows and there was no evidence they said later that she had done much of anything after id gone maybe shed read a little more mobydick because the police were very thorough and even noted where shed marked her place and i know of course that the place shed stopped reading was un marked when i left curiously shed marked it just where she had stopped when shed been reading to meas if she had reread that entire evening before adopting the openwindow policy fehlgeburts form of openwindow policy had been a neat little gun i never knew about the suicide note was simple and addressed to no one but i knew it was meant for me the night you saw schwanger you didnt see me i have a gun too so we beat on fehlgeburt concluded quoting lillys favorite ending i never actually saw fehlgeburt i waited in the hall outside her doorfor frank frank was not in such good shape and it took him a while to meet me outside fehlgeburts room her room had a private entrance up a back staircase that people in the old apartment house used only when they were bringing out their garbage and trash i suppose they thought the smell was from someones garbage and trash frank and i didnt even open her door the smell outside her door was already worse than sorrow ever smelled to us i told you i told you all father said were at the turning point are we ready we could see that he didnt really know what to do frank had returned lillys contract to new york as her agent he had said he could not accept so uncommitted an offer for what was clearly a work of geniusgenius still blooming frank added though hed not read trying to grow not yet frank pointed out that lilly was only eighteen shes got a lot of growing to do still he concluded any publisher would do well to get into the gargantuan building of literature that lilly was going to construct according to frankon the ground floor frank asked for fifteen thousand dollarsand another fifteen thousand dollars was to be promised for advertising lets not let a little economics stand between us frank reasoned if we know fehlgeburt is dead franny reasoned then the radicals are going to know it too it takes just a sniff frank said but i didnt say anything ive almost got a buyer freud said someone wants the hotel franny asked they want to convert it to offices freud said but fehlgeburt is dead father said now we have to tell the policetell them everything tell them tonight frank said tell the americans freud said and tell them tomorrow tell the whores tonight yes warn the whores tonight father agreed then in the morning early frank said well go to the american consulateor the embassy which is it i realized i didnt know which was for what or who was for whom we realized father didnt know either well there are a number of us after all father said sheepishly some of us can tell the consulate some of us can tell the ambassador it was apparent to me then how little any of us had really mastered about living abroad we didnt even know if the american embassy and the american consulate were in the same buildingfor all we knew a consulate and an embassy might be the same thing it was apparent to me then what the seven years had done to father he had lost the decisiveness he must have had that night in dairy new hampshire when he took my mother walking in elliot park and snowed her with his vision of converting the thompson female seminary to a hotel first hed lost earlthe provider of his education and when he lost iowa bob he lost iowa bobs instincts too iowa bob was a man trained to pounce on a loose ballvaluable instinct especially in the hotel business and now i could see what sorrow had cost father his marbles franny would say later he wasnt playing with a full deck of cards frank would say its going to be okay pop franny felt moved to tell him that afternoon in the former gasthaus freud sure dad said frank were home free im going to make millions daddy lilly said lets take a walk pop i said to him wholl tell the whores he asked bewilderedly tell one youve told them all franny said no said freud sometimes theyre secretive with each other ill tell babette freud said babette was freuds favorite ill tell old billig said susie the bear ill tell screaming annie my father said he seemed in a daze nobody offered to tell jolanta anything so i said id tell her franny looked at me but i managed to look away i saw that frank was concentrating on the dressmakers dummy he was hoping for some clear signals lilly went to her room she looked so small i thoughtshe was so small of course she must have been going to her room to try growing some moreto write and write when we had our family conferences in that second hotel new hampshire lilly was still so small that father seemed to forget she was eighteen he would occasionally just pick her up and sit her in his lap and play with her pigtail lilly didnt mind the only thing she liked about being so small she told me was that father still handled her as if she were a child our child author as frank the agent would occasionally refer to her lets take a walk pop i said again i wasnt sure if hed heard me we crossed the lobby someone had spilled an ashtray on the sagging couch that faced the reception desk and i knew it must have been susies day to clean the lobby susie was well intentioned but she was a slob the lobby looked like hell when it was susies day to clean it franny was standing at the foot of the staircase staring up the stairwell i couldnt remember when shed changed her clothes but she suddenly seemed dressed up to me she was wearing a dress franny was not a blue jeans and tshirt sort of personshe liked loose skirts and blousesbut she was not big on dresses either and she was wearing her pretty dark green one with the thin shoulder straps its fall already i told her thats a summer dress youll be cold im not going out she said still staring up the stairwell i looked at her bare shoulders and felt cold for her it was late afternoon but we both knew ernst hadnt called it quitshe was still at work up on the fifth floor franny started up the stairs im just going to reassure him she said to me but not looking at meor at father dont worry i wont tell him what we knowill play dumb im just going to try to find out what he knows she said hes a real creep franny i said to her i know she said and you think about me too much i took father out on the krugerstrasse we were too early for the whores but the working day was long over the commuters were safe in the suburbs and only the elegant people killing time before dinneror before the operawere out strolling we walked down the kärntnerstrasse to the graben and did the obligatory gawking at st stephens we wandered into the neuer markt and stared at the nudes in the donner fountain i realized that father knew nothing about them so i gave him an abbreviated history of maria theresas repressive measures he seemed genuinely interested we walked by the lush scarlet and gold entrance that the ambassador hotel made into the neuer markt father avoided looking at the ambassador or he watched the pigeons shitting in the fountain instead we walked on it wouldnt grow dark for a little while when we passed the kaffee mozart father said that looks like a nice place that looks a lot nicer than the kaffee mowatt it is i said trying to conceal my surprise that hed never been there i must remember to come here one day he said i was trying to make the walk come out another way but we ended up at the hotel sacher just as the light in the sky was beginning to goand just as they were turning on the lights in the sacher bar we stopped to watch them light the bar it is simply the most beautiful bar in the world i think in den ganzen welt frank says lets have a drink here father said and we went in i was a little worried about how he was dressed i looked all right myself that is how i always lookall right but father suddenly appeared a little shabby to me i realized that his pants were so completely unironed that his legs were as round as stovepipesonly baggy he had lost weight in vienna no more home cooking had made him a little thin and it didnt help that his belt was too longin fact i noticed it was franks belt father was just borrowing it he wore a very faded grayandwhite pinstriped shirt which was okayit had been mine i realized before the latest stages of the weight lifting had altered my upper body it wouldnt fit me now but it wasnt a bad shirt only faded and a bit wrinkled what was wrong was that the shirt was striped and the jacket was checkered thank god father never wore a necktiei shuddered to think what sort of tie father would wear but then i realized that no one in the sacher was going to be snotty to us because i saw for the first time what my father really looked like he looked like a very eccentric millionaire he looked like the richest man in the world but a man who didnt give a damn he looked like that very wealthy combination of generosity and fecklessness he could wear anything and look like he had a million dollars in his pocketeven if his pocket had a hole in it there were some terribly well dressed and welltodo people at the sacher bar but when my father and i came in they all looked at him with a heartbreaking kind of envy i think father could see that although he could see very little of the real world and certainly he was naïve about the way the women looked at him there were people at the sacher bar whod spent over an hour dressing themselves and my father was a man who had lived in vienna for seven years and had not spent a total of even fifteen minutes buying his clothes he wore what my mother had bought for him and what he borrowed from frank and me good evening mr berry the bartender said to him and then i realized that father came here all the time guten abend father said that was about it for fathers german he could also say bitte and danke and auf wiedersehen and he had a great way of bowing i had a beer and my father had the usual fathers usual was an appalling gloppedup drink that had some kind of whiskey or rum at its heart but resembled an ice cream sundae he was no drinker he just sipped a little of it and spent hours toying with the rest he was not there for the drinking the bestlooking people in vienna stopped in off the street and the guests from the hotel sacher made their plans or met their dinner companions at the sacher bar of course the bartender never knew that my father lived at the terrible hotel new hampshire a few minutesslow walkingaway i wonder where the bartender thought father was from from off a yacht i suppose from at least the bristol or the ambassador or the imperial and i realized that father had never actually needed the white dinner jacket to look the part well father said to me quietly in the sacher bar well john im a failure ive let you all down no you havent i told him now its back to the land of the free father said stirring his nauseating drink with his index finger then sucking his finger and no more hotels he said softly im going to have to get a job he said it the way someone might have said that he was going to have to have an operation i hated to see reality hemming him in and you kids are going to have to go to school he said to college he added dreamily i reminded him that we had all been to school and to college frank and franny and i even had finished our university degrees and why did lilly need to finish hersin american literaturewhen she had already finished a novel oh he said well maybe well all have to get jobs thats all right i said he looked at me and smiled he leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek he looked so absolutely perfect that no one in that bar could have possibly thoughteven for a momentthat i was this middleaged mans young lover this was a fatherandson kiss and they looked at father with even more envy than they had heaped upon their vision of him when he walked in he took forever to finish playing with his drink i had two more beers i knew what he was doing he was absorbing the sacher bar he was getting his last good look at the hotel sacher he was imagining of course that he owned itthat he lived here your mother he said would have loved all this he moved his hand only slightly then rested it in his lap she would have loved all what i wondered the hotel sacher and the sacher baroh yes but what else would she have loved her son frank growing a beard and trying to decipher his mothers messageher meaningfrom a dressmakers dummy her littlest daughter lilly trying to grow her biggest daughter franny trying to find out everything that a pornographer knew and would she have loved me i wondered the son who cleaned up his language but wanted more than anything to make love to his own sister and franny wanted to too that was why shed gone to ernst of course father couldnt have known why i started to cry but he said all the right things it wont be so bad he reassured me human beings are remarkableat what we can learn to live with father told me if we couldnt get strong from what we lose and what we miss and what we want and cant have father said then we couldnt ever get strong enough could we what else makes us strong father asked everyone at the sacher bar watched me crying and my father comforting me i guess thats just one of the reasons its the most beautiful bar in the world in my opinion it has the grace to make no one feel selfconscious about any unhappiness i felt better with fathers arm around my shoulder good night mr berry the bartender said auf wiedersehen father said he knew hed never be back outside everything had changed it was dark it was the fall the first man who passed us walking in a hurry was wearing black slacks black dress shoes and a white dinner jacket my father didnt notice the man in the white dinner jacket but i didnt feel comfortable with this omen with this reminder the man in the white dinner jacket i knew was dressed for the opera he must have been hurrying to be on time the fall season as fehlgeburt had warned me was upon us you could feel it in the weather the season of the new york metropolitan opera opened with donizettis lucia di lammermoor i read this in one of franks opera books but frank says he doubts very much that the season would have opened with lucia in vienna frank says its likely something more viennese would have opened the seasontheir beloved strauss their beloved mozart even that kraut wagner frank says and i dont even know if it was opening night when father and i saw the man in the white dinner jacket it was only clear that the state opera was open for business the italian version of lucia first opened in vienna in frank told me of course its been back a few times since then perhaps most notably frank added with the great adelina patti in the title roleand most particularly the night her dress caught fire just as she was beginning to sing the mad scene what mad scene frank i asked him you have to see it to believe it frank said and its a little hard to believe even then but pattis dress caught fire just as she was beginning to sing the mad scenethe stage was lit with gas flares in those days and she must have stood too close to one and do you know what the great adelina patti did frank asked me no i said she ripped off her burning dress and kept singing frank said in vienna he added those were the days and in one of franks opera books i read that adelina pattis lucia seemed fated for this kind of disturbance in bucharest for example the famous mad scene was interrupted by a member of the audience falling into the pitupon a womanand in the general panic someone shouted fire but the great adelina patti cried no fireand went on singing and in san francisco one weirdo threw a bomb onto the stage and once more the fearless patti riveted the audience to their seats despite the fact that the bomb exploded a small bomb frank has assured me but it was no small bomb that frank and i had seen riding to the opera between arbeiter and ernst that bomb was as weighty as sorrow that bomb was as big as a bear and its doubtful that donizettis lucia was at the vienna staatsoper the night father and i said auf wiedersehen to the sacher i like to think it was lucia for my own reasons there is a lot of blood and schlagobers in that particular operaeven frank agreesand somehow the mad story of a brother who drives his sister crazy and causes her death because he forces her on a man she doesnt love well you can see why this particular version of blood and schlagobers would seem especially appropriate to me all socalled serious opera is blood and schlagobers frank has told me i dont know enough about opera to know if that is true all i know is that i think lucia di lammermoor should have been playing at the vienna state opera the night father and i walked back to the hotel new hampshire from the hotel sacher it doesnt matter reallywhich opera it was frank is always saying but i like to think it was lucia i like to think that the famous mad scene was not yet under way when father and i arrived at the hotel new hampshire there was susie the bear in the lobbywithout her bears head onand she was crying father walked right by susie without appearing to notice how upset she wasand out of costumebut my father was used to unhappy bears he walked right upstairs he was going to tell screaming annie the bad news about the radicals the bad news for the hotel new hampshire shes probably with a customer or out on the street i said to him but father said he would just wait for her outside her room i sat down with susie shes still with him susie sobbed if franny was still with ernst the pornographer i knew it meant she was more than talking to him there was no reason to pretend to be a bear anymore i held susies bear head in my hands i put it on i took it off i could not sit there in the lobby waiting for franny like a whore to be finished with himto come down to the lobby againand i knew i was helpless to interfere i would have been too late as always there was no one around as fast as harold swallow this time there was no black arm of the law junior jones would rescue franny again but he was too late to save her from ernstand so was i if id stayed in the lobby with susie i would have just cried with her and id been crying entirely too much i thought did you tell old billig i asked susie about the bombers she was only worried about her fucking china bears susie said and went on crying i love franny too i told susie and gave her a hug not like i do susie said stifling a cry yes like you do i thought i started upstairs but susie misunderstood me theyre somewhere on the third floor susie said franny came down for a key but i didnt see which room i looked at the reception desk you could tell it was susie the bears night to watch after the reception desk because the reception desk was a big mess im looking for jolanta i said to susie not franny going to tell her huh susie asked but jolanta wasnt interested in being told ive got something to tell you i said outside her door three hundred schillings she said so i slipped it under the door okay you can come in jolanta said she was alone a customer had just left her apparently because she was sitting on her bidet naked except for her bra you want to see the tits too jolanta asked me the tits cost another hundred schillings i want to tell you something i said to her that costs another hundred too she said washing herself with the mindless lack of energy of a housewife washing dishes i gave her another hundred schillings and she took her bra off undress she commanded me i did as i was told while saying its the stupid radicals theyve ruined everything theyre going to blow up the opera so what jolanta said watching me undress your body is basically wrong she told me youre basically a little guy with big muscles i may need to borrow whats in your purse i suggested to her just until the police take care of things but jolanta ignored this you like it standing up against the wall she asked me is that how you want it if we use the bedif i have to lie downits one hundred schillings extra i leaned against the wall and closed my eyes jolanta i said theyre really serious fehlgeburt is dead i said and these crazy people have a bomb a big bomb fehlgeburt was born dead jolanta said dropping to her knees and sucking me into her mouth later she put a prophylactic on me i tried to concentrate but when she stood up against me and stuffed me inside her slamming me against the wall she immediately informed me that i wasnt tall enough to do it standing up i paid her another hundred schillings and we tried it on the bed now youre not hard enough she complained and i wondered if my failure to be hard enough would cost me another hundred schillings please dont let on to the radicals that you know about them i said to jolanta and it would probably be better for you if you got out of here for a whileno one really knows what will become of the hotel were going back to america i added okay okay she said shoving me off her she sat up in bed she crossed the floor and sat back down on the bidet auf wiedersehen she said but i didnt come i said whose fault is that she asked me washing and washing herself again and again i suppose if i had come it would have cost me another hundred schillings i watched her broad back rocking over the bidet she was rocking with slightly more intensity than she had moved with when she was under me since her back was to me i took her purse off the bedside table and looked in it it looked like susie the bear had been taking care of it there was a tube of some kind of ointment that had opened the inside of jolantas purse was sticky with a sort of creme there was the usual lipstick the usual packages of prophylactics i noticed i had forgotten to take mine off the usual cigarettes some pills perfume tissues change a fat walletand little jars of assorted junk there wasnt a knife not to mention a gun her purse was an empty threat her purse was a bluff she was mocksex and nowit seemedshe was only mockviolence too then i felt the jar that was quite a bit larger than the restit was quite an uncomfortable size really i pulled it out of her purse and looked at it jolanta turned and screamed at me my baby she screamed put my baby down i almost dropped itthis large jar and in the murky fluid swimming there i saw the human fetus the tiny tightfisted embryo that had been jolantas only flower nipped in the bud in her mindthe way an ostrich comforts its head in the sandwas this embryo a kind of mockweapon for jolanta was it what she reached in her purse for what she put her hands on when the going got rough and what unlikely comfort was it to her put my baby down she cried advancing toward me nakedand dripping from her bidet i put the bottled fetus gently on the pillow of her bed and fled i heard screaming annie announcing her false arrival when i opened and closed jolantas door it appeared that father was giving her the bad news i sat on the secondfloor landing not wanting to see susie the bear in the lobby and not daring to seek out franny on the floor above father came out of screaming annies room he wished me a good night with a hand on my shoulder and went down the stairs to go to bed did i tell her i called after him it didnt seem to matter to her father said i went and knocked on screaming annies door i already know she told me when she saw who it was but i hadnt been able to come with jolanta something else took possession of me outside screaming annies door well why didnt you say so screaming annie said when i had still said nothing she took me inside her room and shut the door like father like son she said she helped me undress she was already undressed herself no wonder she had to work so hard i realizedbecause she didnt know the system of charging for all the extras that jolanta charged for screaming annie just did it all for a flat four hundred schillings and if you dont come she told me thats my fault but youll come she assured me please i said to her if its all the same to you i wish you wouldnt come i mean i wish you wouldnt pretend to i would appreciate a quiet ending i begged her but she was already beginning to make curious sounds under me and then i heard a sound that scared me it resembled nothing id ever heard from screaming annie it was not the song susie the bear had coaxed out of franny either for an awful secondbecause there was so much pain in the soundi thought it was the song ernst the pornographer was making franny sing and then i realized it was my sound it was my own wretched singing voice screaming annie started singing with me and in the vibrating silence that followed our awesome duet i heard what was clearly frannys voice yellingso close by she must have been standing on the secondfloor landingoh christ would you hurry up and get it over with franny screamed why did you do it i whispered to screaming annie who lay panting under me do what she said the fake orgasm i said i asked you not to that was no fake she whispered but before i had a moment to even consider this news as a compliment she added i never fake an orgasm theyre all real screaming annie said why in hell do you think im such a wreck she asked me and why of course did i think she was so convinced about not wanting her dark daughter in the business im sorry i whispered i hope they do blow up the opera screaming annie said i hope they get the hotel sacher too she added i hope they wipe out all the kärntnerstrasse she added and the ringstrasse and everyone on it all the men whispered screaming annie franny was waiting for me on the secondfloor landing she didnt look any worse than i did i sat down beside her and we asked each other if we were all right neither one of us provided very convincing answers i asked franny what she found out from ernst and she shivered i put my arm around her and we leaned against the banister of the staircase together i asked her again i found out about everything i think she whispered what do you want to know everything i said and franny shut her eyes and put her head on my shoulder and turned her face against my neck do you still love me she asked yes of course i do i whispered and you want to know everything she asked i held my breath and she said the cow position you want to know about that i just held her i couldnt say anything and the elephant position she asked me i could feel her shaking she was trying very hard not to cry i can tell you a few things about the elephant position franny said the main thing about it is it hurts she said and she started to cry he hurt you i asked her softly the elephant position hurt me she said we sat quietly for a while until she stopped shaking do you want me to go on she asked me not about that i said do you still love me franny asked yes i cant help it i said poor you said franny poor you too i told her there is at least one terrible thing about loversreal lovers i mean people who are in love with each other even when theyre supposed to be miserable and comforting each other even then they will relish their every physical contact in a sexual way even when theyre supposed to be in a kind of mourning they can get aroused franny and i simply couldnt have gone on holding each other on the stairs it was impossible to touch each other at all and not want to touch everything i suppose i should be grateful to jolanta for breaking us up jolanta was on her way out to the street looking for someone else to abuse she saw franny and me sitting on the stairs and aimed her knee so that it struck me in the spine oh excuse me she said and to franny jolanta added dont get involved with him he cant come franny and i without a word more or less followed jolanta down to the lobbyonly jolanta went through the lobby and out onto the krugerstrasse while franny and i went to have a look at susie the bear susie was sleeping on the couch that had the ashtray spilled on it there was an almost serene look on her facesusie wasnt nearly as ugly as she thought she was franny had told me that susies little joke about being the original notbadifyouputabagoverherhead girl was not so funny the two men who had raped her had put a bag over her headso we dont have to look at you they told her this kind of cruelty might make a bear out of anyone rape really puzzles me i would later confess to susie the bear because it seems to me to be the most brutalizing experience that can be survived we cant for example survive our own murder and i suppose its the most brutalizing experience i can imagine because i cant imagine doing it to someone i cant imagine wanting to therefore it is such a foreign feeling i think thats what seems so brutalizing about it i can imagine doing it to someone susie said i can imagine doing it to the fuckers who did it to me she said but thats because it would be simply revenge and it wouldnt work doing it to a fucking man susie said because a man probably would enjoy it there are men who think we actually enjoy getting raped susie said they can only think that she said because they think they would like it but in the ashgray lobby of the second hotel new hampshire franny and i simply tried to put susie the bear back together again and get her to go to her own room to sleep we got her on her feet and found her head we brushed the old cigarette butts that shed been lying in off her shaggy back come on come get out of your old suit susie franny coaxed her how could youwith ernst susie mumbled to franny and how could youwith whores she asked me i dont understand either of you susie concluded im too old for this no i am too old for this susie said father gently to the bear we hadnt noticed him standing in the lobby behind the reception desk we thought he had gone to bed he wasnt alone either the gentle motherlike radical our dear schlagobers our dear schwanger was with him she had her gun out and she motioned us all back to the couch be a dear schwanger said to me get lilly and frank wake them up nicely she added dont be rough or too abrupt frank was lying in bed with the dressmakers dummy stretched out beside him he was wideawake i didnt have to wake him i knew we shouldnt have waited frank said we should have blown the whistle right away lilly was also wideawake lilly was writing here comes a new experience to write about lilly i joked with her holding her hand as we walked back to the lobby i hope its just a little experience lilly said they were all waiting for us in the lobby schraubenschlüssel was wearing his streetcar conductors uniform he looked very official arbeiter had come dressed for work he was so well dressed in fact that he wouldnt have looked out of place at the opera he was wearing a tuxedoall black and the quarterback was there the signal caller was there to lead themernst the ladykiller ernst the pornographer ernst the star was there only old billigold billig the radicalwas missing he blew the way the wind blew as arbeiter had observed old billig was smart enough to have excluded himself from this end of the movement he would still be around for the next show for ernst and arbeiter for schraubenschlüssel and schwanger this was surely the gala and maybe the final performance lilly dear schwanger said go fetch freud for us freud should be here too and lilly once again cast in the role of freuds seeing eye bear brought the old blind believer to ushis louisville slugger taptaptapping in front of him his scarlet silk robe with the black dragon on the back was all he wore chinatown new york city he had told us what dream is this the old man said whatever happened to democracy lilly seated freud on the couch next to father freud promptly whacked fathers shin with the baseball bat oh sorry freud cried whose anatomy is that win berry my father said softly it was eerie but that was the only time we children heard him speak his own name win berry freud cried well nothing too bad can happen with win berry around no one looked so sure explain yourselves freud shouted to the darkness he saw youre all here the old man said i can smell you i can hear every breath its really quite simple to explain ernst said quietly basic said arbeiter truly basic we need a driver ernst said softly someone to drive the car it runs like a dream schraubenschlüssel said worshipfully it purrs like a kitten drive it yourself wrench i said be quiet dear schwanger said to me i just looked at her gun to confirm that it was pointed at me be quiet weight lifter wrench said he had a short heavylooking tool protruding from the front pants pocket of his streetcar conductors uniform and he rested his hand on the tool as if the tool were the butt of a pistol fehlgeburt was full of doubt ernst said fehlgeburt is dead lilly saidour family realist the family writer fehlgeburt had a fatal case of romanticism ernst said she always questioned the means the ends do justify the means you know arbeiter interjected thats basic truly basic youre a moron arbeiter franny said and youre as selfrighteous as any capitalist freud told arbeiter but mainly a moron arbeiter said susie the bear a truly basic moron the bear would make a good driver schraubenschlüssel said stick it in your ear wrench said susie the bear the bear is too hostile to be trusted ernst said so logically you bet your sweet ass said susie the bear i can drive franny said to ernst you cant i said you never even got your drivers license franny but i know how to drive franny said frank taught me i know how to drive better than you franny frank said if one of us has to drive im a better driver no i am franny said you did surprise me franny ernst said you were better at following directions than i thought youd beyou were good at taking instructions dont move dear schwanger said to me because my arms were jerkingthe way they do when ive been curling the long bar for a long time whats that mean father asked ernst his german was so poor what directionswhat instructions father asked he fucked me franny told father just sit tight wrench said to my father moving near him with his tool but frank had to translate for father just stay where you are pop frank said freud was swishing the baseball bat as if he were a cat and the bat were his tail and he tapped my fathers leg with itonce twice thrice i knew that father wanted the bat he was very good with the louisville slugger occasionally when freud was napping father would take us to the stadtpark and hit us some grounders we all liked scooping up ground balls a little game of good old american baseball in the stadtpark with father whacking out the ground balls even lilly liked playing you dont have to be big to field a ground ball frank was the worst at it franny and i were good at fieldingin a lot of ways we were about the same father would whack the sharpest grounders at franny and me but freud held the bat now and he used it to calm my father down you slept with ernst franny father asked her softly yes she whispered im sorry you fucked my daughter father asked ernst ernst treated it like a metaphysical question it was a necessary phase he said and i knew that at that moment i could have done what junior jones could do i could have benchpressed twice my own weightmaybe three or four times fast i could have pumped that barbell up and not felt a thing my daughter was a necessary phase father asked ernst this is not an emotional situation ernst said this is a matter of technique he said ignoring my father although im sure you could do a good job of driving the car franny schwanger has asked us that each of you children be spared even the weight lifter arbeiter asked yes hes a dear to me too schwanger said beaming at mewith her gun if you make my father drive that car ill kill you franny screamed at ernst suddenly and wrench moved near to her with his tool if he had touched her something would have happened but he just stood near her freuds baseball bat kept time my father had his eyes closed he had such trouble following german he must have been dreaming of hard ground balls spanked cleanly through the infield schwanger has asked us franny ernst said patiently not to make you children motherless and fatherless too we dont want to hurt your father franny and we wont hurt him ernst said as long as someone else does a good job of driving the car there was a puzzled silence in the lobby of the hotel new hampshire if we children were exempt if father was to be spared and susie the bear wasnt to be trusted did ernst mean he would use one of the whores for a driver they couldnt be trustedfor sure they were only concerned with themselves while ernst the pornographer had been preaching his dialectic to us the whores had been slipping past us in the lobbythe whores were checking out of the hotel new hampshire a wordless teamfriends in any crisis thick as the thieves they werethey were helping old billig move her china bears they were bearing their salves their toothbrushes their pills perfumes and prophylactics away they were the rats abandoning the sinking ship as frank would say later they were not touched with fehlgeburts romanticism they were never anything larger than whores they left us without saying goodbye so whos the driver you super shit susie the bear asked ernst who the hells left ernst smiled it was a smile full of disgust and he was smiling at freud although freud could not see this freud suddenly figured it out its me he cried as if hed won a prize he was so excited the baseball bat tapped double time im the driver freud cried yes you are said ernst awfully pleased brilliant freud cried the perfect job for a blind man he shouted the baseball bat like a baton conducting leading the orchestrafreuds vienna state opera band and you love win berry dont you freud schwanger asked the old man gently of course i do freud cried like my own son freud yelled wrapping his arms around my father the baseball bat snug between his knees so if you drive the car properly ernst said to freud no harm will come to win berry if you fuck it up arbeiter said well kill them all one at a time schraubenschlüssel added how can a blind man drive the car you morons screamed susie the bear explain how it works schraubenschlüssel ernst said calmly and now it was wrenchs big moment the moment hed been living forto describe every loving detail of his hearts desire arbeiter looked a little jealous schwanger and ernst listened with the most benign expressions like teachers proud of their prize pupil my father of course didnt understand the language well enough to get all of it i call it a sympathy bomb wrench began oh thats brilliant freud cried out then he giggled a sympathy bomb jesus god shut up arbeiter said there are actually two bombs schraubenschlüssel said the first bomb is the car the whole car he said smiling slyly the car simply has to be detonated within a certain range of the operaquite close to the opera actually if the car explodes within this range the bomb in the opera will explode tooyou might say in sympathy with the first explosion which is why i call it a sympathy bomb wrench added moronically even father could have followed this part first the car blows and if it blows close enough to the opera then the big bombthe one in the operathen it blows the bomb in the car is what i call a contact bomb the contact is the front license plate when the front license plate is depressed the whole car blows skyhigh several people in its vicinity will be blown skyhigh too schraubenschlüssel added thats unavoidable arbeiter said the bomb in the opera said schraubenschlüssel lovingly is much more complicated than a contact bomb the bomb in the opera is a chemical bomb but a very delicate kind of electrical impulse is required to start it the fuse to the bomb in the operain a quite remarkably sensitive wayresponds to a very particular explosion within its range its almost as if the bomb in the opera has ears wrench said laughing at himself it was the first time we had heard wrench laugh it was a disgusting laugh lilly started to gag as if she was going to be sick you wont be hurt dear schwanger soothed her all i have to do is drive the car with freud in it right down the ringstrasse to the opera schraubenschlüssel said of course i have to be careful not to run into anything i have to find a safe place to pull off to the side of the streetand then i get out schraubenschlüssel said when im out freud gets behind the wheel nobody will ask us to move on before were ready nobody in vienna questions a streetcar conductor we know you know how to drive freud ernst said to the old man you used to be a mechanic right right said freud he was fascinated i stand right next to freud speaking to him through the drivers side window said wrench i wait until i see arbeiter come out of the opera and cross the kärntnerstrasseto the other side to the safe side arbeiter added and then i just tell freud to count to ten and floor it schraubenschlüssel said ill already have aimed the car in the right direction freud will simply floor ithell get up to as fast a speed as he can hell run smack into somethingalmost right away no matter which way he turns hes blind wrench cried enthusiastically he has to hit something and when he does there goes the opera the sympathy bomb will respond the sympathy bomb my father said ironically even father understood the sympathy part its in a perfect place arbeiter said its been there a long time so we know no one knows where it is its very big but its impossible to find he added its under the stage arbeiter said its built into the stage schraubenschlüssel said its right where they come out to take their fucking final bows arbeiter said of course it wont kill everyone ernst said simply everyone onstage will die and probably most of the orchestra and most of the audience in the first few rows of seats and to those sitting safely back from the stage it will be truly operatic ernst said it will provide a very definite spectacle said ernst schlagobers and blood arbeiter teased schwanger but she just smiledwith her gun lilly threw up when schwanger bent over to soothe her i might have had an opportunity to grab the gun but i wasnt thinking well enough arbeiter took the gun from schwanger as ifto my shamehe was thinking more clearly than i was lilly kept throwing up and franny tried to soothe her too but ernst went right on talking when arbeiter and schraubenschlüssel come back here and report on our success then well know we wont have to harm this wonderful american family ernst said the american family arbeiter said is an institution that americans dote on to the sentimental extreme that they dote on sports heroes and movie stars they lavish as much attention on the family as they lavish on unhealthy food americans are simply crazy about the idea of the family and after we blow up the opera ernst said after we destroy an institution that the viennese worship to the disgusting extreme that they worship their coffeehousesthat they worship the pastwell after we blow up the opera well have possession of an american family well have an american family as hostage and a tragic american family too the mother and the youngest child already the victims of an accident americans love accidents they think disasters are neat and here we have a father struggling to raise his four surviving children and well have them all captured father didnt follow this very well and franny asked ernst what are your demands if were hostages what are the demands no demands dear schwanger said we demand nothing said ernst patientlyever patiently well already have what we want when we blow up the opera and we have you as our prisoners well already have what we want an audience schwanger said almost in a whisper quite a wide audience ernst said an international audience not just a european audience not just the schlagobers and blood audience but an american audience too the whole world will listen to what we have to say about what freud asked he was whispering too about everything ernst said so logically well have an audience for everything weve got to sayabout everything about the new world frank murmured yes arbeiter said most terrorists fail ernst reasoned because they take the hostages and threaten violence but were beginning with the violence it is already established that we are capable of it then we take the hostages that way everybody listens everyone looked at ernst whichof courseernst loved he was a pornographer willing to murder and maimnot for a cause which would be stupid enough but for an audience youre absolutely crazy franny said to ernst you disappoint me ernst said to her whats that father cried to him what did you say to her he said i disappointed him pop franny said she disappoints you father cried my daughter disappoints you father shouted at ernst calm down ernst said to father calmly you fuck my daughter and then tell her she disappoints you father said father grabbed the baseball bat from freud he did this very quickly he picked up that louisville slugger as if it had lived a lifetime in his hands and he swung it levelly getting his shoulders and hips into the swing and following through with the swingit was a perfect line drive sort of swing a level low liner that would still have been rising when it cleared the infield and ernst the pornographer who ducked too slowly put his head in the position of a perfect letterhigh fast ball to my fathers fine swing of the bat crack harder than any ground ball franny or i could have handled my father caught ernst the pornographer with the louisville slugger flat on the forehead and smack between the eyes the first thing to strike the floor was the back of ernsts head his heels plopping down one at a time it seemed like a full second after the head had hit the floor that ernsts body settled down a purple swelling the size of a baseball rose up between ernsts eyes and a little blood ran out of one of his ears as if something vital but smalllike his brain like his hearthad exploded inside him his eyes were open wide and we knew that ernst the pornographer could now see everything that freud could see he had gone out the open window with one swift crack of the bat is he dead freud cried i think if freud hadnt cried out arbeiter would have pulled the trigger and killed my father freuds cry seemed to change arbeiters slowmoving mind he stuck the barrel of the gun in my little sister lillys ear lilly trembledshe had nothing more to throw up please dont franny whispered to arbeiter father held the baseball bat tightly but he held it still arbeiter had the big weapon now and my father had to wait for the right pitch everyone stay calm arbeiter said schraubenschlüssel could not take his eyes off the purple baseball on ernsts forehead but schwanger kept smilingat everyone calm calm she crooned lets stay calm what are you going to do now father asked arbeiter calmly he asked him in english frank had to translate for the next few minutes frank would be kept busy as a translator because father wanted to know everything that was going on he was a hero he was on the dock at the old arbuthnotbythesea except he was the man in the white dinner jackethe was in charge give the bat back to freud arbeiter told my father freud needs his bat back schwanger said to my father stupidly give the bat up pop said frank father gave the louisville slugger back to freud and sat down beside him he put his arm around freud and said to him you dont have to drive that car schraubenschlüssel schwanger said youre going to do it just the way we planned take freud with you and get going she said but im not at the opera arbeiter said in a panic im not there yetto see if its intermission or to make sure its not schraubenschlüssel has to see me walk out of the opera so he knows its okay so he knows its the right time the radicals stared at their dead leader as if he would tell them what to do they needed him you go to the opera arbeiter told schwanger im better with the gun he said ill stay here and you go to the opera arbeiter advised her when youre sure its not intermission walk out of the opera and let schraubenschlüssel see you but im not dressed for the opera schwanger said youre dressed for it she told arbeiter you dont have to be dressed for it to ask someone if its intermission arbeiter yelled at her you look good enough to get in the door and you can see for yourself if its intermission youre just an old ladynobody hassles an old lady for how shes dressed for christs sake stay calm schraubenschlüssel advised mechanically well our gentle schwanger said im not exactly an old lady fuck off arbeiter cried at her get going walk up there fast well give you ten minutes then freud and schraubenschlüssel are on their way schwanger stood there as if she were trying to decide whether to write another pregnancy or another abortion book get going you cunt arbeiter yelled at her remember to cross the kärntnerstrasse and look for our car before you cross the street schwanger left the hotel new hampshire composing herselfactually arranging her face in as motherly an expression as she could muster for the occasion we would never see her again i suppose she went to germany she might author a whole new book of symbols one day she might mother a new movement somewhere else you dont have to do this freud my father whispered of course i have to do it win berry freud said cheerfully he got up he tapped his way with the baseball bat toward the door he knew his way around pretty well considering his total darkness sit down you old fool arbeiter told him weve got ten minutes dont forget to get out of the car you idiot arbeiter told schraubenschlüssel but wrench was still staring at the dead quarterback on the floor i stared at him too for ten minutes i realized what a terrorist is a terrorist i think is simply another kind of pornographer the pornographer pretends he is disgusted by his work the terrorist pretends he is uninterested in the means the ends they say are what they care about but they are both lying ernst loved his pornography ernst worshiped the means it is never the ends that matterit is only the means that matter the terrorist and the pornographer are in it for the means the means is everything to them the blast of the bomb the elephant position the schlagobers and bloodthey love it all their intellectual detachment is a fraud their indifference is feigned they both tell lies about having higher purposes a terrorist is a pornographer for ten minutes frank tried to change arbeiters mind but arbeiter didnt have enough of a mind to experience a change i think frank only succeeded in confusing arbeiter frank was certainly confusing to me you know whats at the opera tonight arbeiter frank asked music arbeiter said music and singing but it matterswhich opera frank lied i mean its not exactly a fullhouse performance tonighti hope you know that its not as if the viennese have come in droves its not as if its mozart or strauss its not even wagner frank said i dont care what it is arbeiter said the front rows will be full the front rows are always full and the dumb singers will be onstage and the orchestra has to show up its lucia frank said practically an empty house you dont have to be a wagnerian to know that donizettis not worth listening to i confess to being something of a wagnerian frank confessed but you dont have to share the germanic opinion of italian opera to know that donizetti is simply insipid stale harmonies lack of any dramatism appropriate to the music frank said shut up arbeiter said organgrinder tunes frank said god i wonder if anyone will show up theyll show up arbeiter said better to wait for a big shot frank said blow the place another night wait for an important opera if you blow up lucia frank reasoned the viennese will applaud theyll think your target was donizetti or even betteritalian opera youll be a kind of cultural hero frank argued not the villain you want to be and when you get your audience susie the bear told arbeiter whos going to do the talking your talker is dead franny said to arbeiter you dont think you can hold an audience do you arbeiter susie the bear asked him shut up arbeiter said its possible to have a bear ride in the car with freud everyone knows freuds got a thing for bears it might be a nice idea to have a bear ride with himon his last trip no change in the plan not now said schraubenschlüssel nervously according to plan he said looking at his watch two minutes go now arbeiter said it will take a while to get the blind man out the door and in the car not me freud cried i know the way its my hotel i know where the door is the old man said hobbling on the baseball bat toward the door and youve parked that damn car in the same place for years go with him schraubenschlüssel arbeiter told wrench hold the old fuckers arm i dont need any assistance freud said cheerfully goodbye lilly dear freud cried dont throw up dear he urged her and keep growing lilly gagged again and shook arbeiter moved the gun about two inches away from her ear he was apparently disgusted with her puking though it was only a very small puddle that lilly had managed she was not even a big vomiter hang in there frank freud calledto the entire lobby dont let anyone tell you youre queer youre a prince frank freud cried youre better than rudolf freud yelled to frank youre more majestic than all the hapsburgs frank freud encouraged him frank couldnt speak he was crying so hard youre lovely franny my dear franny my sweetheart said freud softly one doesnt have to see to know how beautiful you are he said auf wiedersehen freud franny said auf wiedersehen weight lifter freud cried to me give me a hug he asked me holding out his arms the louisville slugger like a sword in one hand let me feel how strong you are freud said to me and i went up to him and hugged him that was when he whispered in my ear when you hear the explosion freud whispered kill arbeiter come on schraubenschlüssel said nervously he grabbed freuds arm i love you win berry freud cried but my father had his head in his hands he would not look up from where he sat sunk in the couch im sorry i got you in the hotel business freud said to my father and the bear business freud added goodbye susie freud said susie started to cry schraubenschlüssel steered freud through the door we could see the car the mercedes that was a bomb it was parked against the curb almost in front of the door to the hotel new hampshire it was a revolving door and freud and schraubenschlüssel revolved through it i dont need your assistance freud was complaining to wrench just let me feel the car just get me to the fender freud complained i can find the door by myself you idiot freud was saying just let me touch the fender arbeiter was getting a stiff back leaning over lilly he straightened up a little he glanced at me checking on where i was he glanced at franny his gun wandered around there it is ive got it we heard freud crying cheerfully outside thats the headlight right he asked schraubenschlüssel my father raised his head from his hands and looked at me of course thats the headlight you old fool schraubenschlüssel yelled at freud get in will you freud father screamed he must have known then he ran to the revolving door auf wiedersehen freud father cried at the revolving door father saw the whole thing very clearly freud with his hand feeling along the headlight slipped toward the grille of the mercedes instead of toward the door the other way you moron schraubenschlüssel advised but freud knew exactly where he was he tore his arm out of wrenchs grasp he leveled the louisville slugger and started swinging he was looking for the front license plate of course blind people have a knack for knowing exactly where things that have always been are it took freud only three swings to locate the license plate my father would always remember the first swing was a little highoff the grille lower father screamed through the revolving door auf wiedersehen the second swing hit the front bumper a little to the left of the license plate and my father yelled to your right auf wiedersehen freud schraubenschlüssel father said later was already running away he never got far enough away however freuds third swing was on the money freuds third swing was the grand slam what a lot for that baseball bat to go through in one night that louisville slugger was never found freud was never entirely found either and schraubenschlüssels own mother would fail to identify him my father was blasted back from the revolving door the white light and glass flying in his face franny and frank ran to help him and i got my arms around arbeiter just as the bomb blewjust as freud had told me to do arbeiter in his black tuxedo dressed for the opera was a little taller than i was and a little heavier my chin rested firmly between his shoulder blades my arms went around his chest pinning his arms to his side he fired the gun once into the floor i thought for a moment that he might be able to shoot my foot with it but i knew id never let him raise the gun any higher i knew lilly was out of arbeiters range he fired two more shots into the floor i held him so tightly that he couldnt even locate my foot which was right behind his foot his next shot hit his own foot and he started screaming he dropped the gun i heard it hit the floor and saw lilly grab it but i wasnt paying much attention to the gun i was concentrating on squeezing arbeiter for someone whod shot himself in the foot he stopped screaming pretty soon frank would tell me later that arbeiter stopped screaming because he couldnt breathe i wasnt paying much attention to arbeiters screaming either i concentrated on the squeezing i imagined the biggest barbell in the world i dont know exactly what i imagined i was doing to the barbellcurling it benchpressing it deadlifting it or simply hugging it to my own chest it didnt matter i was just concentrating on its weight i really concentrated i made my arms believe in themselves if i had hugged jolanta this hard she would have broken in two if i had hugged screaming annie this hard she would have been quiet once i had dreamed of holding franny this tightly i had been lifting weights since franny was raped since iowa bob showed me how with arbeiter in my arms i was the strongest man in the world a sympathy bomb i heard father yelling i knew he was in pain jesus god can you believe it a fucking sympathy bomb franny later said that she knew immediately father was blind it was not just because of where he was standing when the car blew up or the glass that was blasted into his face as he stood at the revolving door it was not all the blood in his eyes that franny saw when she wiped his face enough to see what was wrong with him i knew somehow she said i mean before i saw his eyes i always knew he was as blind as freud or he would be i knew he would be franny said auf wiedersehen freud father was crying hold still daddy i heard lilly saying to father yes hold still pop franny said frank had run up the krugerstrasse to the kärntnerstrasse and around the corner up to the opera he had to see of course if the sympathy bomb had respondedbut freud had possessed the vision to see that the mercedes parked in front of the hotel new hampshire was too far from sympathy to make the opera respond and schwanger must have just kept walking or maybe she decided simply to stay and watch the end of the opera maybe it was one she liked maybe she wanted to be there watching them all at the curtain call taking their last bows above the unexploded bomb frank said later that when he ran out of the hotel new hampshire to go see if the opera was safe he noticed that arbeiter was a very vivid magenta color that his fingers were still movingor perhaps just twitchingand that he seemed to be kicking his feet lilly told me later that while frank was gonearbeiter turned from magenta to blue a slateblue color lilly the writer said the color of the ocean on a cloudy day and by the time frank got back from seeing if the opera was safe franny told me that arbeiter was completely motionless and a deadwhite colorthe color was all gone from his face he was the color of a pearl lilly said he was dead i had crushed him you can let him go now franny finally had to tell me its okay its going to be okay she whispered to me because she knew how i liked whispering she kissed my face and then i let arbeiter go i have not felt the same about weight lifting since i still do it but im very lowkey about the lifting now i dont like to push myself a little light lifting just enough to make me start feeling good i dont like to strain not anymore the authorities told us that schraubenschlüssels sympathy bomb might even have worked if the car had been closer the bomb authorities also implied that any explosion in the area might have set the sympathy bomb off at any time i guess old schraubenschlüssel hadnt been as exact as he thought he was a lot of nonsense was written about what the radicals had meant an unbelievable amount of garbage would be written about the statement they had been trying to make and there wasnt enough about freud his blindness was noted in passing and that he had been in one of the camps there was absolutely nothing about the summer of about state omaine and the arbuthnotbythesea about dreamingor about the other freud and what he might have had to say about all this there was a lot of idiocy about the politics of what had happened politics are always idiotic as iowa bob would have said and there was not enough about fehlgeburt how she could break your heart the way she read the ending of the great gatsby they acknowledged that my father was a hero of course they seemed polite about the reputation that our second hotel new hampshire had enjoyedin its prime as frank would refer to those sordid days when father got out of the hospital we gave him a present franny had written junior jones for it junior jones had provided us with baseballs for seven years so franny knew that junior could be counted on to find father a new baseball bat a louisville slugger all his own he would need it of course and father seemed touched by our presentby frannys thoughtfulness really because the bat was frannys idea i think father must have cried a little when he first reached out his hands and we placed the bat in them and he felt what it was he held we couldnt see if he cried however because the bandages were still on his eyes and frank who had always had to translate for father had to become his interpreter in other ways when the people from the stastsoper wanted to pay us a tribute frank had to sit next to fatherat the operaand whisper to him about the action on the stage father could follow the music just fine i dont even remember what opera it was it wasnt lucia i know that much it was a particularly farcical comic opera because lilly had insisted that we wanted no schlagobers and blood it was nice that the vienna state opera wanted to thank us for saving them but we didnt want to sit through any schlagobers and blood wed already seen that opera that was the opera that played in the hotel new hampshire for seven years and so at the opening of this merry farce of an operawhatever it wasthe conductor and the orchestra and all the singers pointed out my father in one of the frontrow seats thats where father had insisted on sitting so i can be sure to see he had said and father stood up and took a bow he was great at bowing and he waved the baseball bat to the audience the viennese loved the louisville slugger part of the story and they were touched and applauded for a long time when father waved the bat at them we children felt very proud i often wonder if the new york publisher who wanted lillys book for five thousand dollars would have listened to franks demands if we hadnt all become famousif we hadnt saved the opera and murdered the terrorists in our good old american family kind of way who cares frank asks slyly the point is lilly had not signed the fivethousanddollar contract frank had gone for higher stakes and when the publishers realized that this lilly berry was the little girl whod had a gun held to her head that little lilly berry was the youngest surviving and certainly the smallest member of the berry familythe terrorist killers the opera saverswell at that point of course frank was in the drivers seat my author is already at work on a new book frank the agent said were in no hurry about any of this as far as trying to grow is concerned were interested in the best offer frank would make a killing of course you mean were going to be rich father asked sightlessly when he was first blind he had an awkward way of inclining his head too far forwardas if this might help him to see and the louisville slugger was his everrestless companion his percussion instrument we can do anything we want pop franny said you can she added to him just think of it she told father and its yours dream on daddy lilly said but father seemed stupefied by all the options anything father asked you name it i told him he was our hero again he was our fatherat last he was blind but he was in charge well ill have to think about it father said cautiously the baseball bat playing all kinds of musicthat louisville slugger in my fathers hands was as musically complicated as a full orchestra though father would never make as much noise with a baseball bat as freud had made he was more various than freud could have dreamed of being and so we left our sevenyear home away from home frank sold the second hotel new hampshire for a ridiculously high price after all it was a kind of historical landmark frank argued im coming home franny wrote to junior jones im coming home she also wrote to chipper dove why damn it franny i asked why write to chipper dove but franny refused to talk about it she just shrugged i told you susie the bear said frannys got to deal with itsooner or later youve both got to deal with chipper dove susie said and youre going to have to deal with each other too said susie the bear i looked at susie as if i didnt know what she was talking about but susie said im not blind you know i got eyes and im a smart bear too but susie wasnt being menacing you two have got a real problem she confided in franny and me no shit franny said well were being very careful i told susie for how long can anybody be that careful susie asked the bombs havent all gone off susie said you two have a bomb between you said susie the bear youve got to be more than careful susie warned franny and me the bomb between you two susie said can blow you both away for once it seemed franny had nothing to say i held her hand she squeezed me back i love you i told her when we were alonewhich we should never have allowed ourselves to be im so sorry i whispered but i love you i do i love you terribly much franny said and it was lilly who saved us that time despite the fact that we were all supposed to be packed and ready to leave lilly was writing we heard the typewriter and could imagine our sisters little hands blurring over the keyboard now that im going to get published lilly had said i have to really get better ive got to keep growing she said a little desperately my god the next book has got to be bigger than the first and the one after that she said it will have to be even bigger there was a certain despair about the way she said this and frank said stick with me kid with a good agent youve got the world by the balls but i still have to do it lilly complained i still have to write i mean now im expected to grow and the sound of lilly trying so hard to grow distracted franny and me from each other we went out in the lobby where it was somewhat more publicwhere we felt safe two men had just been killed in that lobby but it was a safer place for franny and me than in our own rooms the whores were gone i do not care anymore what became of them they didnt care what became of us the hotel was empty a dangerous number of rooms beckoned to franny and me one day i said to her well have to you know that or do you think it will changeif we wait it out it wont change she said but maybeone daywell be able to handle it one day it might be a little safer than it feels right now i doubted that it would ever be safe enough and i was on the verge of trying to convince her to do it now to use the second hotel new hampshire as it was meant to be usedto get it over with to see if we were doomed or just perversely attracted to each otherbut frank was our savior this time he brought his bags out into the lobby and startled the hell out of us jesus frank franny screamed sorry he mumbled frank had his usual queer lot of things his odd books his peculiar clothes and his dressmakers dummy are you taking that dummy back to america frank franny asked him its not as heavy as what you two are carrying frank said and its a lot safer so frank knew too we realized at that time franny and i thought lilly didnt know andregarding our own dilemmawe were grateful that father was blind keep passing the open windows frank said to franny and methe damn dressmakers dummy slung like a light log over his shoulder had a distressing resemblance about it it was the falseness of it that franny and i noticed the mannequins chipped face the obvious wig and the stiff unfleshly bust of the dummythe fake bosom the still chest the rigid waist in the bad light in the lobby of the second hotel new hampshire franny and i could be fooled into thinking we saw shapes of sorrow when we saw nothing at all but hadnt sorrow taught us to be on guard to look everywhere sorrow can take any shape in the world you keep passing the open windows too frank i saidtrying not to look too closely at his dressmakers dummy weve all got to stick together franny saidas father in his sleep cried out auf wiedersehen freud being in love with franny dealing with chipper dove love also floats and that being true love probably resembles sorrow in other ways we flew to new york city in the fall of no separate flights this time we were sticking together as franny had advised the stewardess was troubled by the baseball bat but she let father hold it between his kneeshumane concessions are made to the blind in spite of regulations junior jones was unable to meet our plane junior was playing out his last season with the brownsin a hospital in cleveland man he said to me over the phone just tell your father ill give him my eyes if hell give me his knees and what will you give me if i give you my knees i heard franny ask junior over the phone i didnt hear what he said to her but she smiled and winked at me we could have flown to boston im sure fritz would have met our plane and let us stay for free at the first hotel new hampshire but father had told us he never wanted to see dairy new hampshire or that first hotel new hampshire again of course father wouldnt have seen it if wed gone there and stayed there the rest of our lives but we understood his meaning none of us had the stomach for seeing dairy again and recalling when our family was wholewhen each of us had both eyes open new york was neutral territoryand for a while frank knew lillys publisher would put us up and entertain us enjoy yourselves frank said to us just call room service father would behave like a child with room service ordering stuff hed never eat and ordering his usual undrinkable drinks hed never stayed in a hotel with room service before he behaved as if hed never been in new york before either because he complained that all the room service personnel couldnt speak english any better than the viennesethey couldnt of course because they were foreigners theyre more foreign than the viennese ever dreamed of being my father would cry sprechen sie deutsch hed yell into the phone jesus god frank father would say order us a proper frühstück would you these people dont understand me this is new york pop franny said they dont speak german or english in new york dad frank explained what the hell do they speak father asked i order croissant and coffee and i get tea and toast nobody knows what they speak here said lilly looking out the window lillys publisher put us up at the stanhope on eightyfirst and fifth avenue lilly had asked to be near the metropolitan museum and i had asked to be near central parki wanted to run and so i ran around and around the reservoir four times around twice a daythat last lap luxurious with pain my head lolling the tall buildings of new york appearing to topple over me lilly looked out the windows of our suite on the fourteenth floor she liked watching the people flood in and out of the museum i think id like to live here she said softly its like watching a castle change kings lilly whispered and you can see the leaves change in the park too lilly noted and whenever you visit me lilly said to me you can run around the reservoir and reassure me that its still there i dont ever want to see it up close lilly said weirdly but its comforting to have you report to me on the health of the water the number of other runners in the park the amount of horse shit on the bridle path a writer has to know these things lilly said well lilly frank said i think youll be able to afford a permanent suite here but you could get an apartment instead you know you dont have to live at the stanhope lilly frank said it might be more practical to get your own apartment no lilly said if i can afford it i want to live here surely this family can understand why i might like to live in a hotel lilly said franny shivered she didnt want to live in a hotel she had told me but franny would stay with lilly for a whileafter the publisher stopped paying the tab and lilly maintained her corner suite on the fourteenth floor franny would keep lilly company for a while just so you have a chaperon lilly franny teased her but i knew it was franny who needed the chaperon and you know who i need a chaperon from franny told me frank and father would be my chaperons father and i would move in with frank he found a palatial apartment on central park south i could still run there i could run through the entirety of central park investigate the reservoir for lilly arrive dripping with sweat and panting at the stanhope to report on the health of the water and so forth and to show myself to frannyto get a glimpse of her these would not be permanent residences for franny father or me but frank and lilly would become the kind of new yorkers who affix themselves to certain parts of central park and never leave lilly would live at the stanhope for the rest of her life writing away trying to grow up to the stature of the fourteenth floor though small she was ambitious and frank the agent would wheel and deal from his apartment with its six telephones at central park south they were both terribly industriouslilly and frankand i once asked franny what she thought the difference between them was about twenty blocks and the central park zoo franny said that was the distance between them exactly but franny implied it was the difference between lilly and frank too a whole zoo and more than twenty blocks and whats the difference between us franny i asked her shortly after wed arrived in new york one difference between us is that ill get over you somehow franny told me thats just how i am i get over things and ill get over you too but you wont get over me franny warned me i know you my brother my love she told me and you wont get over meat least not without my help she was right of course franny was always rightand always one step ahead of me when franny would finally sleep with me she would engineer it she would know exactly why she was doing it tooas a fulfillment of the promise she had made to mother us children now that mother was gone as the only way to take care of us as the only way to save us you and me need saving kid franny said but especially you need it you think were in love and maybe i think so too its time to show you that im not so special its time to prick the bubble before it bursts franny told me she chose the moment in the same way she chose not to sleep with junior jonesto save it as she would say franny always had her plans and her reasons holy cow man junior jones told me on the phone tell your sister to come see a poor wreck of a man in cleveland my knees are shot but the rest of me works fine im not a cheerleader anymore franny told him get your ass to new york if you want to see me man junior jones howled to me tell her i cant walk im wearing two casts at a time theres too much of me to haul around on crutches and tell her i know what a shitass town new york is man said junior jones if i come to that town on crutches some dudes will try to mug me tell him that when he gets over his damn football phase maybe hell have time for me franny said oh man said junior jones what does franny want i want you franny whispered to me over the phonewhen she had made up her mind about it i was at central park south trying to answer all of franks phones father complained about the phonesthey interfered with the radio he listened to all dayand frank refused to get a secretary much less a legitimate office i dont need an office frank said i just need a mailing address and a few phones at least try an answering service frank i suggested which he would grudgingly acceptone day but that was after father and i moved out in our first new york days i was franks answering service i want you terribly much franny whispered to me on the phone franny was alone at the stanhope lillys out having a literary lunch franny said maybe that would be one way lilly would grow i thought having lots of literary lunches franks wheeling and dealing franny said hes at lunch with her theyll be tied up for hours and you know where i am kid franny asked me im in bed she said im naked she added and im fourteen fucking floors highim high on you franny whispered to me i want you franny said get your ass over here kid its now or never franny said we wont know if we can live without it until we try it then she hung up one of franks other phones was ringing i let it ring franny must have known i was dressed for running i was ready to run out the door im going to take a run i told father a long one one i might never come back from i thought i wont answer a single phone call father said grouchily he was having trouble at the time making up his mind what to do he would sit in franks splendid apartment with the louisville slugger and the dressmakers dummy and hed think and think all day anything he kept asking frank i can absolutelyin all sinceritydo anything i want to do father would ask frank about fifty times a week anything pop frank told him ill set it up frank had already set up a threebook contract for lilly he had negotiated an initial first printing of trying to grow copies he had optioned the film rights to warner brothers and had made a separate deal with columbia pictures for an original screenplay of the events leading up to the bomb that went off in front of the second hotel new hampshireand the famous opera bomb that didnt go off lilly was already working on the screenplay and frank had put through a contract for a television series to be based on life at the first hotel new hampshire which lilly was also authoringthe series was to be based on trying to grow and was not to be released until after the motion picture the movie would be called trying to grow the tv series would be called the first hotel new hampshire this frank pointed out left room for future deals but who i wondered would ever dare to make a tv series out of the second hotel new hampshire who would want to franny wondered if lilly had grown only a little as the result of creating trying to grow frank had grown double timefor all of us as the result of selling lillys effort it had been no little effort for lilly we knew and we were worried about how hard she was working how much she was writinghow grimly she was trying to grow take it easy lilly frank advised her the cash flow is fast and furiousyoure terrifically liquid said frank the economics major and the future looks rosy just coast for a while lilly franny advised her but lilly took literature seriouslyeven if literature would never take lilly quite seriously enough i know ive been lucky lilly said now i have to earn it she saidtrying harder but one day in the winter of it was just before christmaslilly was out at a literary lunch and franny told me it was now or never there were only about twenty blocks and a very small zoo between us any good middledistance runner can get from central park south to fifth avenue and eightyfirst in a very short time it was a winter day brisk but gray the new york city streets and sidewalks were cleared of snowgood footing for a fast wintry run the snow in central park looked old and dead but my heart was very much alive and pounding in my chest the doorman at the stanhope knew methe berry family would be welcome at the stanhope for years and years the man at the reception deskthe alert cheerful man with the british accentsaid hello to me as i waited for the elevator the elevators at the stanhope are rather slow i said hello back to him scuffing my running shoes on the rug over the years i would watch that man grow a little balder but no less cheerful he would even deal cheerfully with the complainers the european lilly and i saw in a rage at the reception desk one morning for examplea portly man in a barberpolestriped robe he was beshitted head to toe no one had told him about one of the stanhopes features their famous upwardflushing toilets you should beware of them if you ever stay at the stanhope after youve done your business in the toilet its advisable to close the lid and stand well out of the wayi recommend kicking the flush handle with your foot this portly european must have been standing directly over his messhe must have thought hed observe it all going away when it suddenly was flung up all over him and the evercheerful man with the british accent behind the reception desk looked up at the beshitted guest who was raging at him and said oh dear a little air in the pipes it was what he always said a little air in the pipes the portly european bellowed a lot of shit in my hair he howled but that was another day the day i was there to make love to franny the elevator couldnt get there fast enough i decided to run up to the fourteenth floor i must have looked awfully eager when i arrived franny opened the door just a crack and peeked at me yuck she said youll have to take a shower okay i said she told me to hold the door open just a crack and give her time to get back to bed she didnt want me to see hernot yet i heard her bound across the suite and leap back into bed okay she called and i went in putting the do not disturb sign on the door put the do not disturb sign on the door franny called to me i already did i said in the bedroom looking at her she was under the covers looking just a little nervous you dont have to take a shower she said i like you all sweaty at least im used to you that way but i was nervous and i took a shower anyway hurry up you asshole franny yelled at me i took as fast a shower as i could and used the potentially upwardflushing toilet very cautiously the stanhope is a wonderful hotel especially if you like to run in central park and enjoy watching the met and its floods of visitors but you have to watch out for the toilets coming from a family used to strange toiletsthose toilets fit for dwarfs in the first hotel new hampshire those tiny toilets used by fritzs midgets to this dayi tend to be generous in my feelings toward the toilets at the stanhope although i know some people who say theyll never stay at the stanhope again but whats a little air in the pipes or even a lot of shit in the hair if you have good memories i came out of the bathroom naked and when franny saw me she covered her head with the sheet and said jesus god i slipped into bed beside her and she turned her back to me and began to giggle your balls are all wet she said i dried myself i said you missed your balls she said nothing like wet balls i said and franny and i laughed as if we were crazy we were i love you she tried to tell me but she was laughing too hard i want you i told her but i was laughing so hard that i sneezedright in the middle of telling her that i wanted herand that broke us up for a while longer it was like that as long as she kept her back to me and we lay together like the stereotypical love spoons but when she turned to me when she lay on top of me with her breasts against my chest when she scissored her legs around meeverything changed if it had been too funny when we started now it was too serious and we couldnt stop the first time we made love we were in a more or less conventional positionnothing too tantric please franny had asked me and when it was over she said well that was okay not great but niceright well it was better than nicefor me i said but not quite greati agree you agree franny repeated she shook her head she touched me with her hair okay she whispered get ready for great at one point i must have held her too tightly she said please dont hurt me i said dont be frightened she said i am just a little i ama lot i said it is improper to describe making love to ones sister does it suffice to say that it became great and it got even greater and later it grew worse of courselater we got tired about four oclock in the afternoon lilly knocked discreetly on the door is that a maid franny called no its me lilly said im not a maid im a writer go away and come back in an hour franny said why lilly asked im writing something franny said no youre not lilly said im trying to grow franny said okay lilly said keep passing the open windows she added in a sense of course franny was writing something she was the author of how our relationship would turn outshe took a mothers responsibility for it she went too farshe made love to me too much she made me aware that what was between us was all too much i still want you she murmured to me it was fourthirty in the afternoon when i entered her she winced are you sore i whispered of course im sore she said but you better not stop if you stop ill kill you franny told me she would have too i realized later in a wayif i had stayed in love with hershe would have been the death of me we would have been the death of each other but she simply overdid it she knew exactly what she was doing we better stop i whispered to her it was almost five oclock we better not stop franny said fiercely but youre sore i protested i want to be sorer franny said are you sore she asked me a little i admitted i want you a lot sore franny said top or bottom she asked me grimly when lilly knocked at the door again i was on the verge of imitating screaming annie if thered been a new bridge around i could have cracked it come back in an hour franny yelled its seven oclock said lilly ive been away for three hours go have dinner with frank franny suggested i had lunch with frank lilly cried go have dinner with father franny said i dont even want to eat lilly said ive got to writeits time to grow take a night off franny said the whole night lilly asked give me three more hours franny said i groaned quietly i didnt think i had three more hours left in me arent you getting hungry franny lilly said theres always room service franny said and im not hungry anyway but franny was insatiable her hunger for me would save us both no more franny i begged her it was about nine oclock i think it was so dark i couldnt see anymore but you love me dont you she asked me her body like a whipher body was a barbell that was too heavy for me at ten oclock i whispered to her for gods sake franny weve got to stop were going to hurt each other franny no my love she whispered thats exactly what were not going to do hurt each other were going to be just fine were going to have a good life she promised me taking me into heragain and again franny i cant i whispered to her i felt absolutely blind with pain i was as blind as freud as blind as father and it must have hurt franny more than it hurt me yes you can my love franny whispered just once more she urged me i know youve got it in you im finished franny i told her almost finished franny corrected me we can do it just once more she said after this she told me were both finished with it this is the last time my love just imagine trying to live every day like this franny said pressing against me taking my last breath away wed go crazy franny said theres no living with this she whispered come on and finish it she said in my ear once more my love last time she cried to me okay i cried to her here i come yes yes my love franny said i felt her knees lock against my spine hello goodbye my love she whispered there she cried when she felt me shaking there there she said soothingly thats it thats all she wrote she murmured thats the end of it now were free now thats over she helped me to the bathtub the water stung me like rubbing alcohol is that your blood or mine i asked franny who was trying to save the bednow that she had saved us it doesnt matter my love franny said cheerfully it washes away this is a fairy tale lilly would writeof our familys whole life i agree with her iowa bob would have agreed with her too everything is a fairy tale coach bob would have said and even freud would have agreed with himboth freuds everything is a fairy tale lilly arrived coincidentally with the room service cart and the bewildered new york foreigner who delivered our multicourse meal and several bottles of wine at about eleven in the evening what are you celebrating lilly asked franny and me well john just finished a long run franny said laughing you shouldnt run in the park at night john lilly said worriedly i ran up fifth avenue i said it was perfectly safe perfectly safe franny said bursting out laughing whats the matter with her lilly asked me staring at franny i think its the luckiest day of my life franny said still giggling its been just a little event among so many for me i told her and franny threw a dinner roll at me we both laughed jesus god lilly said exasperated with usand seemingly revolted by the amount of food we had ordered we could have had a most unhappy life franny said i mean all of us she added attacking the salad with her fingers i opened the first bottle of wine i still might have an unhappy life lilly said frowning if i have many more days like today she added shaking her head sit down and dig in lilly said franny who sat down at the room service table and started in on the fish yes you dont eat enough lilly i told her helping myself to the frogs legs i had lunch today lilly said it was a rather gross lunch too she said i mean the food was all right but the portions were too big i only need to eat one meal a day lilly said but she sat down at the table with us and watched us eat she picked an especially slender green bean out of frannys salad eating half of it and depositing the other half on my butter plate she picked up a fork and poked at my frogs legs but i could tell she was just restlessshe didnt want any so what did you write today franny lilly asked her franny had her mouth full but she didnt hesitate a whole novel franny said it was truly terrible but it was something i just had to do when i finished it i threw it away you threw it away lilly asked maybe some of it was worth saving it was all shit franny said every word john read a little of it franny said but i made him give it back so i could throw the whole thing out i called room service and had them come pick it up you had room service throw it away for you lilly said i couldnt stand to even touch it any longer franny said how many pages was it lilly asked too many franny said and what did you think of what you read of it lilly asked me trash i said theres only one author in our family lilly smiled but franny kicked me under the table i spilled some wine and franny laughed im glad you have confidence in me lilly said but whenever i read the ending of the great gatsby i have my doubts i mean thats just so beautiful lilly said i think that if i cant ever write an ending that perfect then theres no point in beginning a book either theres no point in writing a book if you dont think it can be as good as the great gatsby i mean its all right if you failif the finished book just isnt somehow very goodbut you have to believe it can be very good before you start and sometimes that damn ending to the great gatsby just wipes me out before i can get started lilly said her little hands were fists and franny and i realized that lilly clutched what was left of a dinner roll in one of them lilly didnt like to eat but she could somehow manage to mangle a whole meal while deriving no nourishment from it whatsoever lilly the worrier franny said youve got to just do it lilly franny told her kicking me under the table again as she said do it i would go back to central park south a wounded man in fact i wouldnt realize until after our enormous meal was over that i was in no condition to run for about twenty blocks and a zoo i doubted that i could even walk my private parts were in considerable pain i saw franny grimace when she got up from the table to get her purse she was suffering the aftermath of our excesses tooit was just as she had planned of course we would feel the pain of our lovemaking for days and that pain would keep us sane the pain would convince us both that awaiting us in this particular pursuit of each other was our certain selfdestruction franny found some money for a cab in her purse when she gave me the money she gave me a very chaste and sisterly kiss to this daybetween franny and meno other kind of kiss will do we kiss each other now the way i imagine most brothers and sisters kiss it may be dull but its a way to keep passing the open windows and when i left the stanhopeon that night shortly before christmas i felt truly safe for the first time i felt fairly sure that all of us would keep passing the open windowsthat we were all survivors i guess now that franny and i had been thinking only of each other we had been thinking a little too selfishly i think franny felt that her invulnerability was infectiousmost people who are inclined toward feelings of invulnerability do think this way you know and i tended to try to follow frannys feelings as exactly as i could manage i caught a cab going downtown at about midnight and rode it down fifth avenue to central park south despite the agony of my private parts i was sure i could walk to franks from there also i wanted to look at the christmas decorations in front of the plaza i thought of walking just a little out of my way so that i could look at the toys displayed in the windows of f a o schwarz i thought of how egg would have loved those windows egg had never been to new york but i thought egg had probably imagined better windows full of more toys all the time i limped along central park south number is between the east side and the west but nearer to the westa perfect place for frank i was thinking and for us all for all of us were the survivors of the symposium on eastwest relations there is a photograph of freudof the other freudin his apartment in vienna at berggasse he is fiftyeight it is freud has an itoldyouso sort of stare he looks both cross and worried he looks as emphatic as frank and as anxious as lilly the war that would begin in august of that year would destroy the austrohungarian empire that war would also convince herr professor doktor freud that his diagnosis of the aggressive and selfdestructive tendencies in human beings had been quite correct in the photograph one can imagine where freud got his idea that the human nose was a genital formation freud got that idea from the mirror as frank says i think freud hated vienna to his credit our freud hated vienna too as franny was the first to point out franny also hated vienna she would always be a freudian in her contempt for sexual hypocrisy for example and frank would be a freudian in the sense that he was antistraussthe other strauss frank would note he meant johann the very viennese strauss the one who wrote that dippy song happy is the man who forgets what he cannot change die fledermaus but both our freud and the other freud were morbidly obsessed with what was forgottenthey were interested in what was repressed in what we dreamed that made them both very un viennese and our freud had called frank a prince freud had said that no one should call frank queer the other freud had also endeared himself to frankwhen some mother wrote the good doctor and begged him to cure her son of his homosexuality freud brusquely informed her that homosexuality was not a disease there was nothing to cure many of the worlds great men the great freud told this mother had been homosexuals thats right on target frank was fond of shouting just look at me and look at me susie the bear used to say why didnt he mention some of the worlds great women if you ask me susie used to say freuds a little suspect which freud susie franny would tease her either one susie the bear used to say take your pick one of them carried a baseball bat one of them had that thing on his lip that was cancer susie frank pointed out rather stiffly sure said susie the bear but freud called it this thing on my lip he didnt call cancer cancer but he called everyone else repressed youre too hard on freud susie franny told her hes a man isnt he susie said youre too hard on men susie franny told her thats right susie frank said you ought to try one how about you frank susie asked him and frank blushed well frank stammered thats not the way i goto be perfectly frank i think theres just someone else inside you susie lilly said theres someone else inside you who wants to get out oh boy franny groaned maybe theres a bear inside her that wants to get out maybe theres a man inside her frank suggested maybe just a nice woman is inside you susie lilly said lilly the writer would always try to see the heroes in us all that night shortly before christmas i painfully inched my way along central park south i started thinking about susie the bear and i remembered another photograph of freudsigmund freudthat i was fond of in this one freud is eighty in three years he would be dead he is sitting at his desk at berggasse it is and the nazis would soon make him abandon his old study in his old apartmentand his old city vienna in this photograph a pair of nononsense eyeglasses are seriously perched on the genital formation of freuds nose he is not looking at the camerahe is eighty years old and he hasnt much time he is looking at his work not wasting his time with us someone is looking at us in this photograph however it is freuds pet dog his chow named jofi a chow somewhat resembles a mutant lion and freuds chow has that glazed look of dogs who always stare stupidly into the camera sorrow used to do that when he was stuffed of course sorrow stared into the camera every time and old dr freuds little sorrowful dog is there in the photograph to tell us whats going to happen next we might also recognize sorrow in the fragility of the knickknacks that are virtually crowding freud out of his study off berggasse and out of vienna the city he hated the city that hated him the nazis would stick a swastika on his door that damn city never liked him and on june the eightytwoyearold freud arrived in london he had a year left to livein a foreign country our freud at the time was one summer away from getting fed up with earl he would return to vienna at the time when all those repressed suicides of the other freuds day were turning into murderers frank has shown me an essay by a professor of history at the university of viennaa very wise man named friedrich heer and thats just what heer says about the viennese society of freuds time and this may be true of either freuds time i think they were suicides about to become murderers they were all fehlgeburts trying hard to become arbeiters they were all schraubenschlüssels admiring a pornographer they were ready to follow the instructions of a pornographers dream hitler you know frank loves to remind me had a rabid dread of syphilis this is ironic frank points out in his tedious way when you remind yourself that hitler came from a country where prostitution has always thrived it thrives in new york too you know and one winter night i stood at the corner of central park south and seventh avenue looking into the darkness downtown i knew the whores were down there my own sex tingled with pain from frannys inspired efforts to save meto save us bothand i knew at last that i was safe from them i was safe from both extremes safe from franny and safe from the whores a car took the corner at seventh avenue and central park south a little too fast it was after midnight and this fastmoving car was the only car i could see moving on either street a lot of people were in the car they were singing along with a song on the radio the radio was so loud that i could hear a very clear snatch of the song even with the windows closed against the winter night the song was not a christmas carol and it struck me as inappropriate to the decorations all over the city of new york but christmas decorations are seasonal and the song i heard just a snatch of was one of those universally bleedingheart kind of country and western songs some tritebuttrue thing was being tritely but truthfully expressed i have been listening for the rest of my life for that song but whenever i think im hearing it again something strikes me as not quite the same franny teases me by telling me that i must have heard the country and western song called heavens just a sin away and indeed that one would do almost any song like that would suffice there was just this snatch of a song the christmas decorations the winter weather my painful private partsand my great feeling of relief that i was free to live my life nowand the car that was moving too fast tore by me when i started across seventh avenue when it looked safe to cross i looked up and saw the couple coming toward me they were walking on central park south in the direction of the plazathey were headed west to eastand it was inevitable i would later think that we should have met in the middle of seventh avenue on the very night of frannys and my own release they were a slightly drunk couple i thinkor at least the young woman was and the way she leaned on the man made him weave a little too the woman was younger than the man in at least we would have called her a girl she was laughing hanging on her older boyfriends arm he looked about my ageactually he was a little older he would have been in his late twenties on this night in the girls laughter was as sharp and as splintering of the frigid night air as the sound of very thin icicles breaking away from the eaves of a house encased in winter i was in a really good mood of course and although there was something too educated and insufficiently visceral in the girls cold tingling laughterand although my balls ached and my cock stungi looked up at this handsome couple and smiled we had no trouble recognizing each otherthe man and i i could never forget the quality of the quarterback in his face though i had not seen him since that halloween night on the footpath the football players always usedand everyone else would have been well advised to let them use it to let them have it for themselves some days when i was lifting weights i could still hear him say hey kid your sisters got the nicest ass at this school is she banging anybody yes shes banging me i could have told him that night on seventh avenue but i didnt say anything to him i just stopped and stood in front of him until i was sure he knew who i was he hadnt changed he looked almost exactly as hed always looked to me and although i thought i had changedi knew the weight lifting had at least changed my bodyi think that frannys constant correspondence with him must have kept our family close to chipper doves memory if not close to his heart chipper dove stopped in the middle of seventh avenue too after a second or two he said softly well look whos here everything is a fairy tale i looked at chipper doves girl friend and said watch out he doesnt rape you chipper doves girl friend laughedthat highstrung overstrenuous laugh like breaking ice that laugh of little icicles shattering dove laughed a little bit with her the three of us stayed in the middle of seventh avenue a taxi heading downtown and turning off central park south almost killed us but only the girl friend flinchedchipper dove and i didnt move hey were in the middle of the street you know the girl said she was a lot younger than he was i noticed she skipped to the east side of seventh avenue and waited for us but we didnt move ive enjoyed hearing from franny dove said why havent you written her back i asked him hey his girl friend screamed at us and another taxi turning downtown blew its horn at us and dodged around us is franny in new york too chipper dove asked me in a fairy tale you often dont know what the people want everything had changed i knew i didnt know if franny wanted to see chipper dove or not i knew i never knew what was in the letters shed written him yes shes in the city i said cautiously new york is a big place i was thinking this felt safe well tell her id like to see her he said and he started to move around me cant keep this girl waiting he whispered to me conspiratorially he actually winked at me i caught him under the armpits and just picked him up for a quarterback he didnt weigh much he didnt struggle but he looked genuinely surprised at how easily i had lifted him i wasnt sure what to do with him i thought a minuteor it must have seemed like a minute to chipper doveand then i put him back down i simply placed him back in front of me in the middle of seventh avenue hey you crazy guys his girl friend called two cabs appearing to be in a race with each other passed on either side of usthe drivers kept their hands on their horns for a long way heading downtown tell me why you would like to see franny i told chipper dove youve been doing a little work with the weights i guess dove said a little i admitted why do you want to see my sister i asked him well to apologizeamong other things he mumbled but i could never believe him he had that iceblue smile in his iceblue eyes he seemed only slightly intimidated by my muscles he had an arrogance larger than most peoples hearts and minds you could have answered just one of her letters i told him you could have apologized in writing anytime well he said shifting his weight from foot to foot like a quarterback settling himself getting ready to receive the ball well its all so hard to say he said and i almost killed him on the spot i could take almost anything from him but sincerityhearing him sound genuine was almost too much to bear i felt a need to hug himto hug him harder than i had hugged arbeiterbut fortunately for both of us he changed his tone he was getting impatient with me look he said by the statute of limitations in this country im clearshort of murder rape is short of murder in case you dont know just short i said another cab almost killed us chipper his girl friend was screaming shall i get the police look dove said just tell franny id be happy to see herthats all apparently he said with the iceblue in his eyes slipping into his voice apparently shed like to see me i mean shes written me enough he was almost complaining about it i thoughtas if my sisters letters had been tedious for him if you want to see her you can tell her yourself i told him just leave a message for herleave the whole thing up to her if she wants to see you leave a message at the stanhope i said the stanhope he said shes just passing through no she lives there i said were a hotel family i told him remember oh yes he laughed and i could see him thinking that the stanhope was a big step up from the hotel new hampshirefrom either hotel new hampshire though hed only known the first one well he said so franny lives at the stanhope we own the stanhope now i told him i have no idea why i lied but i simply had to do something to him he looked a little stunned and that was at least a mildly pleasing moment a green sports car came so close to him that his scarf was flapped by the sudden passing wind his girl friend ventured out in seventh avenue again she cautiously approached us chipper please she said softly is that the only hotel you own dove asked me trying to be cool about it we own half of vienna i told him the controlling half the stanhope is just the first of manyin new york i told him were going to take over new york and tomorrow the world he asked that iceblue lilt in his voice ask franny all about it i said ill tell her she can expect to hear from you i had to walk away from him so i wouldnt hurt him but i heard his girl friend ask him whos franny my sister i called your friend raped her he and two other guys gangbanged her i shouted neither chipper dove nor his girl friend laughed this time and i left them in the middle of seventh avenue if id heard the squeal of tires and brakes and the thud of bodies making contact with metal or with the pavement i wouldnt have turned around it was only when i recognized the pain in my private parts as actually belonging to me that i realized i had walked too far id walked past central park southi was wandering around columbus circleand i had to turn around and head east when i saw seventh avenue again i saw that chipper dove and his girl friend had gone i even wondered for a second if i had only dreamed them i would have preferred to have dreamed them i think i was worried how franny would handle it how she might deal with it as susie was always saying i was worried about even mentioning to franny that i had seen chipper dove what would it mean to her for example if dove never called it seemed unfairthat on the very evening of frannys triumph and mine i had to meet her rapist and tell him where my sister lived i knew i was out of my league i was over my headi was back to zero i had no idea what franny wanted i knew i needed some expert rape advice frank was asleep he was no rape expert anyway father was also asleep in the room i shared with him and i looked at the louisville slugger on the floor by my fathers bed and knew what fathers rape advice would bei knew that any rape advice from father would involve swinging that bat i woke father up taking off my running shoes sorry i whispered go back to sleep what a long run you had he groaned you must be exhausted i was of course but i was also wideawake i went and sat at the desk in front of franks six phones the resident rape expert in the second hotel new hampshire was only a phone call away the rape advice i wanted was actually residing in new york city now susie the bear was living in greenwich village although it was one oclock in the morning i picked up the phone at last the issue had presented itself it didnt matter that it was almost christmas because we were back to halloween all frannys unanswered letters finally deserved an answer although junior joness black arm of the law would one day provide new york city with its admirable services junior was still recovering from the thug game of football he would spend three years in law school and hed spend another six starting the black arm of the law although junior would rescue franny he could be counted upon for his late arrivals the issue of chipper dove had presented itself now although harold swallow had never found him dove was out of hiding now and in dealing with chipper dove i knew franny would need the help of a smart bear good old susie the bear is a fairy tale all by herself when she answered her telephone at am she was like a boxer springing off the ropes dumbfuck creepofthenight pervert do you know what time it is susie the bear roared its me i said jesus god susie said i was expecting an obscene call when i told her about chipper dove she decided it was an obscene call i dont think frannys going to be happy that you told him where she lives susie said i think she wrote all those letters so she wouldnt ever hear from him again susie lived in a simply terrible place in greenwich village franny liked going down there to see her and frank occasionally dropped inwhen he was in the vicinity there was a very franklike bar around the corner from where susie livedbut lilly and i hated the village susie came uptown to see us in the village susie could be a bear when she wanted to be there were people down there who looked worse than bears but when susie came uptown she had to look normal they wouldnt have let her in the stanhope as a bear and on central park south some policeman would have shot herthinking her an escapee from the central park zoo new york was not vienna and although susie was trying to break herself of the bear habit she could revert to bearishness in the village and nobody would even notice she lived with two other women in a place that had only a toilet and a coldwater sink susie came uptown to bathepreferring lillys suite at the stanhope to the opulent bathroom at franks place at central park south i think susie liked the potential danger of the upwardflushing toilets she was trying to be an actress in those days the two women she shared the terrible apartment with were both members of something called the west village workshop it was an actors workshop it was a place that trained street clowns frank said of it that if the king of mice had still been alive he could have gotten tenure at the west village workshop but i thought that if thered been such a thing as the west village workshop in vienna maybe the king of mice would still be alive there ought to be someplace where you can study street dancing animal imitations pantomime unicycling scream therapy and acts of degradation that are only acts susie said the west village workshop was basically teaching her how to be as confident as a bear without the bear suit it was a slow process she admitted and in the meantimehedging her betsshed had the bear suit refashioned by an animal costume expert in the village you ought to see the suit now susie was always telling me i mean if you think i looked like a real bear before man you havent seen the whole story it is rather remarkable frank had told me theres even a wet look about the mouth and the eyes are uncanny and the fangs frank saidalways an admirer of costumes and uniforms frank would say the fangs are great but we all want susie to get over being a bear franny said we want the bear in her to emerge lilly would say and wed all grunt and make other disgusting sounds together but when i told susie that franny and i had saved each other from each otheronly to meet up again with chipper dovesusie was all business susie was that everessential friend the one wholl be a bear for you when the going gets rough you at franks susie asked yes i said hang in there kid susie said ill be right up warn the doorman should i warn him about a bear or about you susie i asked her one day honey susie said the real me is going to surprise you one day it was true susie would surprise me but before susie got up to central park south lilly called me on one of franks six phones whats wrong i said it was nearly two in the morning chipper dove lilly whispered in a frightened little voice he called here he asked for franny that son of a bitch i thought hed call up a girl hed raped when she was sleeping he must have wanted to be sure that franny really did live at the stanhope so now he knew what did franny say to him i asked lilly franny wouldnt talk to him lilly said franny couldnt talk to him lilly said i mean she couldnt get her mouth to workno words came out lilly said i told him franny was out and he said hed call again you better come over here lilly said franny is afraid lilly whispered ive never seen franny afraid lilly added she wont even go back to bed she just keeps looking out the window i think she thinks hes going to rape her again lilly whispered i went to franks room and woke him up he sat bolt upright in bed throwing back the covers and flinging the dressmakers dummy away from him dove was all i had whispered to him chipper dove was all i had to say and frank woke up as if he were still banging the cymbals we left a message for father in the tape recorder next to his bed we just said we were at the stanhope father was pretty good on the telephone he counted the holes even so father still got a lot of wrong numbers and they made him so cross that he invariably shouted to the persons on the receiving end of his callsas if the wrong numbers had been their fault jesus god he would holler youre the wrong number thus in this small way did my father and his louisville slugger terrorize a portion of new york frank and i met susie at the door of central park south we had to run up to columbus circle to find a cab susie was not wearing the bear suit she was wearing old pants and a sweater over a sweater over a sweater of course shes afraid susie told frank and me as we sped uptown but shes got to deal with it fear is one of the first phases my dears if she can get over the fucking fear then she gets to the anger and once shes angry susie said then shes home free just look at me she declared and frank and i looked at her and didnt say anything we were over our heads and we knew it franny was sitting wrapped in a blanket her chair drawn up to the heat register she peered out the window the metropolitan museum stood in the prechristmas cold like a castle abandoned by its king and queenso abandoned it looked cursed even the peasants were staying away how can i even go out franny whispered to me he could be anywhere out there she said i dont dare go out she repeated franny franny i said he wont touch you again dont tell her things susie said to me thats not the way dont tellask her things ask her what she wants to do what do you want to do franny lilly asked her well do anything you want us to do franny frank said think about what you want to have happen susie the bear said to franny franny shivered her teeth chattered it was stifling in the suite but franny was bonecold i want to kill him franny said softly dont say anything susie the bear whispered in my ear there was nothing i could say anyway we sat in the room with franny looking out the window for about an hour susie gave her a back rub to try to warm her up franny wanted to whisper something to me so i bent down to her are you still sore she whispered she wore a little smile and i smiled back at her and nodded me too she said and smiled but she looked right back out the window again and she said i wish he were dead in a little while she repeated i simply cant go out i can take all my meals herebut one of you will have to be here all the time we assured her we would be kill him she repeated just as it was getting light above the park he could be anywhere out there she said watching the light grow the bastard she screamed suddenly i want to kill him we took turns staying with her for a couple of days we made up a story for fatherthat franny had the flu and she was staying in bed so that shed be all better in time for christmas it was a reasonable lie we thought franny had lied to father about chipper dove before shed told him she was just beaten up we didnt even have a planif chipper dove did call back we had no idea how franny even wanted to deal with it kill him she kept saying and frank waiting in the lobby with me for the stanhope elevator to arrive said maybe we should kill him that would take care of it franny was our leader when she was lost we were all lost we needed her judgment before we could settle on a plan maybe hell never call again lilly said youre a writer lilly frank said you ought to know better of course hell call frank was making one of his antiworld statementsexpressing one of his perverse theories that precisely what you dont want to happen will as a writer lilly would one day share franks weltanschauung but frank was right about chipper dove he called it was frank who answered the phone frank was very uncool about it when he heard chipper doves iceblue voice he twitchedhe underwent such a spasm on the couch that he batted the standing lamp beside him he sent the lampshade spinning and franny knew right away who it was she started screaming she ran out of the living room of the suite and into lillys bedroom it was the closest hiding place and susie the bear and i had to run after her and hold her on lillys bed trying to calm her down uh no shes not in right now frank said to chipper dove want to leave a number where she can call you chipper dove gave frank his numbertwo numbers actually his number at home and his number at work the thought that he had a job seemed to make franny suddenly sane again what does he do she asked frank well frank said he just said he was with his uncles firm you know how everyone gets their rocks off the way they say firmthe fucking firm whatever a firm is frank said it could be anything franny i said a law firm a business firm maybe its a rape firm lilly said and we had our first good sign in days franny laughed atta girl franny frank encouraged her that super shit of a human being franny yelled atta girl franny said susie the bear that fuckoff in his uncles fucking firm franny said thats right i said and finally franny said i dont care about killing him i just want to scare him she said i want him to be frightened she said shivering suddenly she started crying he really scared me she cried im still afraid of him for christs sake she said i want to scare the bastard i want to frighten him back franny said now youre talking said susie the bear now youre dealing with it lets rape him frank said whod want to lilly asked id do itfor the cause susie said but even with me i think hed like it men are creeps that way susie said they could hate your guts but their cocks will still like you we cant rape him franny said so franny was okay i thought she was our leader again we can do anything we want frank arguedfrank the agent frank the arranger even if we could figure out a way to rape him susie said even if we could find the perfect rapist for him i still say it wouldnt be the same the fucker would find a way to enjoy himself and then lilly the author spoke up our little lilly the creator she had the best imagination he wouldnt enjoy himself if he thought a bear was raping him lilly said sodomy cried frank gleefully clapping his handslike the cymbals hed once used on chipper dove sodomize the bastard frank cried wait a fucking minute said susie the bear maybe hell think its a bear but ill still know its him i mean anything for the cause susie said anything for you honey susie told franny but youll have to give me some time to think this over but i dont think youd have to really do it to him susie franny said i think you could scare him enough by almost doing it you could pretend to be a bear in heat susie lilly said a bear in heat howled frank with delight thats it he shouted wildly a bear in heat goes berserk you could wolf the bastards balls right into your terrible bears mouth frank screamed at susie make him think hes going to get blown by a bear for the last time frank added i could take him right to the edge susie the bear said but no further susie franny said i just want to frighten him scare him to death frank said exhausted not quite said lilly scare him almost to death a bear in heat thats brilliant lilly i said just give me a day lilly said for what lilly susie asked the script lilly said ill need a day to get the script right i love you lilly franny said and gave her a hug you all have to be very good actors lilly said im taking lessons for christs sake susie roared and ill bring my friends can you use two friends lilly susie asked if theyre women i can use them lilly said frowning of course theyre women susie said indignantly can i be in it frank asked youre not a woman frank i pointed out maybe lilly wants all women well im a fag frank said huffily and chipper dove knows that i can get a great costume for frank susie told lilly you can frank asked excitedly he hadnt had a chance to dress up in a while let me work on it lilly said lilly the worker she would always work a little too hard it will have to be just perfect lilly said to be believable lilly said well have to get everything just right and franny asked suddenly will i have to be in it lilly we could see she didnt want to be or she was frightened to be in it she wanted it to happenshe thought she wanted to see it but she didnt know if she could actually take a part i held frannys hand youll have to call him franny i said and she shivered again youll just have to invite him here lilly said once you get him here you wont have to say much you wont have to do anything i promise lilly said but its got to be you who calls him up franny looked out the window again i rubbed her shoulders so she wouldnt be cold frank patted her hair frank had an irritating habit of showing his affection for human beings by patting them as if they were dogs come on franny frank said you can do it franny you got to honey susie the bear told her softly putting her friendly paw on frannys arm its now or never franny remember i whispered to her lets just get this over with i told her and then we can all return to the rest of the businessto the rest of our lives the rest of our lives franny said pleased okay she whispered if lilly can write the script franny said i can make the fucking phone call then all of you get out of here lilly said ive got to get to work she said worriedly we all went to franks to have a party with father not a word about this to father franny said lets keep father out of it father i knew was out of it most of the time but when we arrived at franks father had come to a small decision from the myriad options in front of him father had failed to come up with what iowa bob would have called a game plan he still didnt know what he wanted to do good fortune was an option unfamiliar to my father but when we arrived at franks in a party mood father had at least accomplished a minidecision i want one of those seeing eye dogs father said but youve got us pop frank told him theres always someone around to take you anywhere you want i told him its not just that father said i need an animal around he said oh boy franny said why not hire susie susies got to stop being a bear father said we shouldnt keep encouraging her we all looked a little guilty and susie beamedof course father couldnt see our faces and besides father said new york is a terrible place for a bear im afraid the bear days are over he sighed but a good old seeing eye dog father said well you see he said almost a little embarrassed to admit his loneliness it would be someone for me to talk to i mean you have your own livesor you will have father said id just like a dog really the seeing eye part of the dog isnt really what matters id just like to have a nice dog can i he asked sure pop frank said franny kissed father and told him wed get him a dog for christmas so soon father asked i dont think you can rush getting a seeing eye dog father said i mean it would be a problem to get a badly trained one anythings possible pop frank said ill take care of it oh for christs sake frank franny said well all get him a dog if you dont mind one thing father said susie the bear put her paw on my hand as if even susie knew what was coming just one thing father said we were very quiet waiting for this it mustnt look like sorrow father said and youve got the eyes so youve got to pick out the dog just make sure it in no way resembles sorrow and lilly wrote the necessary fairy tale and we each acted our parts according to the fairy tale that lilly wrote we were perfect on the last working day before christmas franny took a deep breath and called chipper dove at his firm hi its me she said to him brightly i absolutely need to have lunch with you in the worst way franny said to chipper dove yes its franny berryand you can pick me up anytime franny said yes at the stanhopesuite fourteenohone then lilly grabbed the phone away from franny and said to franny in a voice as crabby as any crabby nurses voiceand plenty loud enough for chipper dove to hearwho are you making phone calls to now youre not supposed to make any more phone calls then lilly hung up the phone and we waited franny went into the bathroom and threw up she was okay when she came back out she looked awful but she was supposed to look awful the two women from the west village workshop had done the makeup job on franny those women can work wonders they took a beautiful woman and they ravaged her they gave franny a face with the lifelessness of chalk they gave her a mouth like a gash they gave my sister needles for eyes and they dressed her all in white like a bride we were worried that lillys script might be too theatrical frank stood looking out the window in his black leotard and limegreen caftan he had just a little lipstick on i dont know frank said worriedly what if he doesnt come susies two friends were therethe wounded women from the west village workshop it had been men susie had told us who had wounded them the black one was named ruthie she resembled a nearperfect cloning of junior jones ruthie wore a sleeveless sheepskin vest over nothing at all and a pair of bright green bellbottoms above which her belly wobbled she had a long silver nail almost as thick as a railroad spike jabbed into her crazy hair she held a long leather leash in one of her big black hands at the end of the leash was susie the bear it was a bear suit that was a victory of animal imagination especially the mouth as frank had pointed out especially the fangs their wet look and the sad insanity of the eyes susie actually saw out of the mouth the claws were a nice touch too they were the real thing susie proudly pointed outthe whole paws were the real thing it somehow enhanced the reality of everything that susie wore a muzzle wed bought the muzzle in an accessory shop for seeing eye dogs it was a real muzzle wed turned the thermostat on the heat register up as high as it would go because franny complained of being cold susie said she liked the heat she felt more like a bear if she sweated a lot and inside the bear suit we could tell she was hot and dripping ive never felt so much like a bear susie said to us pacing down on all fours youre all bear today susie i said to her the bear in you gets out today susie lilly told her franny sat in the bridal dress on the couch the candle burning in a sickly way on the table beside her there were candles lit throughout the suite and all the window shades were drawn frank had lit a little incense so the whole suite smelled truly terrible the other woman from the west village workshop was a pale plainlooking very girlish type with strawblond hair she was dressed in the conventional uniform of a hotel maid the same uniform worn by all the stanhope maids and she had a perfectly bored expressionless gaze that matched her dull employment her name was elizabeth something but in the village she was called scurvy she was the best actress ever to graduate from the west village workshopshe was the queen of the washington square park performers she could have taught scream therapy to a whole backyard full of moles she could have taught the moles how to scream so loud that the worms would leap right out of the ground she was what susie called a number one firstclass hysteric nobody can do hysteria better than scurvy susie the bear had told us and lilly had written up a number one firstclass hysteric role for her scurvy just sat in the suite smoking a cigarette and looking as lifeless as a park bench bum i played around with the big barbell in the middle of the living room frank and lilly had greased me all over i was oily from head to toe and i smelled like a salad but the oil made my muscles stand out in a special way i was wearing this skimpy little thing called a singletits that oldfashionedlooking onepiecebathingsuit thing that wrestlers and weight lifters wear keep warm lilly coached me keep lifting just enough to keep the veins standing out when he walks in here i want those veins popping right up there on the surface of your skin if he walks in here frank fumed he will franny said softly hes very near she said shutting her eyes i know hes very near she repeated when the phone rang everyone in the room jumpedeveryone but franny and the number one firstclass hysteric named scurvy they didnt flinch franny let the phone ring a little lilly came out of the bedroom all neatly dressed in her nurses uniform she nodded to franny at about the fourth ring and franny picked up the phone she didnt say anything hello chipper dove said franny we heard him ask franny shivered but lilly kept nodding to her come up right away franny whispered into the phone come up while my nurse is still out she hissed then she hung up she gagged and for a moment i thought shed have to go throw up in the bathroom again but she held it in she was okay lilly adjusted the tight gray mousy little bun of a wig she wore she looked like an old nurse in a home for dwarfs the women from the west village workshop had made up lillys face like a prune she stepped into the closet that was nearest the main door to the suite and shut the door when you were in the living room of the suite it was easy to confuse the closet with the entrance and exit door scurvy put a stack of clean linen on her arm and went outside the suite into the hall between five and seven minutes after he gets inside i told her i dont need reminding she said crossly i can listen outside the door for my cue she told me contemptuously im a fucking pro you know the west village workshop women had one thing in common susie had confided to me they had all been raped i started lifting the weight i did some fast lifting to pump the muscles full of blood susie the bear curled up at the foot of the couch farthest from franny and pretended to go to sleep she hid her paws and her muzzled snout from the back she looked like a sleeping dog the black woman named ruthiethe huge woman who was junior joness cloneplopped down in the dead center of the couch right next to franny when the hibernating bear began to snore frank took off the caftan and hung it on a doorknobhe now wore just the black leotardand went into lillys bedroom and put the music on from the living room you could see the bed through the bedrooms open door when the music started frank started dancing on the bed the music had been franks choice frank had no trouble making up his mind he chose the mad scene from donizettis lucia i looked at franny and saw some tears squeeze their way out of the pinholes the makeup women had given her for eyes the tears made messy tracks through the makeup caked upon her face franny knotted her fingers in her lap and i knocked lightly on the closet door and whispered to lilly a masterpiece lilly i said its got all the indications of a masterpiece just dont blow your lines lilly whispered when chipper dove knocked on the door my bicepses were standing right up therethe way lilly wanted themand the forearms were looking pretty good i had a little sweat running over the oil and in the bedroom lucia was beginning to scream frank was so incredibly awkward leaping on the bed that i almost couldnt look at him come in franny cried to chipper dove when i saw the doorknob turn i grabbed my side of the door and helped chipper dove insidefast i guess i snapped the door open a little harder than was necessary because chipper dove seemed to be propelled inside the roomon all fours i hung the do not disturb sign on the outside knob and closed the door behind him well look whos here franny said in her best iceblue voice holy cow cried frank at full height above the bouncing bed i rolled the barbell against the door but chipper dove stood upfairly calmly he had that smile that wouldnt die at least it hadnt died yet whats all this franny he asked her casually but franny had come to the end of her lines frannys part of the script was over with well look whos here that was all that was necessary for her to say were going to rape you i said to chipper dove hey look dove said that was never exactly what id call a rape he said i mean you really liked me franny he said to her but franny wasnt talking im sorry about the other guys franny dove added but frannys pinhole stare gave him nothing shit said dove turning to me whos going to rape me not me frank screamed from the bedroom bouncing higher and higher i like fucking mud puddles myself i do it all the time chipper dove still managed a smile so its the one on the couch he asked me slyly he stared at big ruthie he must have been remembering junior jones when he looked at hershe just stared back at himbut chipper dove even managed to smirk at her i have nothing against black women chipper dove said dividing his attention between ruthie and me in fact i like a black woman now and then ruthie raised up one cheek of her enormous ass and farted you aint fucking me she told chipper dove dove directed his full attention to me almost all of his smile had left him because i think he was beginning to suspect that i was the one appointed to rape him and he wasnt so fond of this idea no its not him you asshole frank yelled from the bedroom panting and leapinghigher and higher he likes girls like you do frank yelled at dove disgusting disgusting disgusting girls frank hollered he fell off the bed but he was right back up and dancing fiercely lucia was really sounding crazy are you trying to tell me its the dog chipper dove asked me do you think ill hold still for a fucking dog he snapped at me what dog man ruthie asked chipper dove ruthie had a smile that was as terrible as chipper doves that dog right there dove said pointing to susie the bear susie was curled up in a ball snoring her hairy back turned to doveher paws tucked in her head tucked down ruthie stuck her big bare foot in susies crotch she started kneading susie with her foot susie started to groan that aint no dog man ruthie said smilingand obscenely kneading kneading with her foot then ruthie twisted her foot sharply in susies crotch and susie the bear roared awake she wheeled viciously on ruthie snapping at her dove saw the muzzle barely restraining her he saw ruthie bound out of the way of the long striking claws ruthie threw the leash in susies face and ran to the far side of the room susie looked ready to charge after her but franny just reached out her hand she touched susie just once and susie calmed right down the bear put her head in frannys lap susie growled softly there earl earl she moaned thats a bear dove said you bet your ass man ruthie said and frank sailing even higher singing his way into lucias songand seemingly rising above even her madnessyelled out thats a bear in heat thats a bear that wants you i said to chipper dove when dove looked at the bear again he saw that franny had her hand on susie exactly where a bears private parts would be franny was rubbing the bear there and susie the bear got suddenly playful she lolled her head around she made the most disgusting noises the west village workshop had simply worked wonders with susie the bear shed been a smart bear before but now she was a bear to be reckoned with that bears so horny ruthie said shed even fuck me hey look said chipper dove he was holding fast to the illusion that i was the only one among them who was sane that was how he was reading it now i was his last hope we had him right where lilly wanted him when scurvy the maid knocked on the door i slung the barbell aside as if it weighed nothing at all i yanked the door open so hard that scurvy flew into the room in greater confusion and disarray than had marked chipper doves entrance susie the bear growlednot liking too much sudden movementand the terrified maid stared up at me it says do not disturb you moron i yelled at her i pulled her to her feet and tore open the front of her little maids costume she started to get hysterical right away i held her upside down and shook her frank howled with delight black panties black panties frank shrieked on the bouncing bed youre fired i told the sniveling maid you dont come in when the sign says do not disturb if you cant learn that you moron i told her then youre fired i passed her still holding her upside down to ruthie ruthie and scurvy had been practicing this routine together all year susie had told me it was a kind of apache dance it was a kind of womanrapinganotherwoman dance ruthie simply proceeded to maul scurvy right there in front of chipper dove i dont care if you do own the hotel scurvy was crying youre terrible disgusting people and i wont clean up after that bear again i wont i wont she moaned then she did an absolutely stunning job of convulsing under ruthieshe gagged herself she spewed she gibbered ruthie left her in a ball shriveled up and whiningwith an occasional absolutely chilling spasm ruthie shrugged and said to me you got to get a tougher crew of maids than this white trash man every time the bear rapes someone the maids cant handle it they just dont know how to deal with it and when i looked at chipper dove i sawat lastthat his iceblue looks had left him he was staring at the bear susie was more and more responsive under frannys touch ruthie went up to the bear and took her muzzle off susie gave us a toothy smile she was more bear than any bear for this single performance of lillys script susie the bear could have convinced a bear that she was a bear a bear in heat i dont even know if bears ever get in heat it doesnt matter as frank would say all that mattered was that chipper dove believed it ruthie started scratching susie cautiously behind the ears see him see himthat one over there ruthie said sweetly and susie the bear began to shuffle and sway she started nosing her way toward chipper dove hey look dove started to say to me better not move suddenly i told him bears dont like any sudden movement dove froze susie taking all the time in the world started sniffing him over frank lay on the bed in the bedroom exhausted ill give you some advice frank said to chipper dove you introduced me to mud puddles so ill give you some advice about bears frank said hey please chipper dove said softly to me the main thing frank said is dont move dont resist anything the bear does not appreciate resistance of any kind just kind of go with it man ruthie said dreamily i stepped up to dove and unbuckled his belt he started to stop me but i said no sudden movements susie the bear jabbed her snout into doves crotch the instant doves pants hit the rug with a soft flop i recommend holding your breath frank advised from the bedroom and that was lillys cue in she came it looked to dove as if she just walked in with her own key from the door to the hall we all stared at the dwarf nurse lilly looked cross i had the feeling you were up to this again franny lilly said to her patient franny curled up on the couch putting her back to us all youre her nurse not her mother i snapped at lilly its not good for herthis lunatic raping raping raping everyone lilly shouted at me every time that damn bear is in heat you just pull anyone you want in here and rape himand im telling you its not good for her but its all franny likes frank said peevishly its not right that she likes it lilly pointed out like a stubborn but good nurse which she was aw come on i said this one is special this one raped her i cried to lilly he made me fuck a mud puddle frank wailed if we can just rape this one i pleaded with lilly we wont rape anybody else promises promises said lilly folding her little arms across her little breasts we promise frank shouted just one more just this one earl susie snorted and i thought dove was going to faint dead away susie snorted violently into doves crotch susie the bear seemed to be saying that she was especially interested in this one too please please dove started to scream susie knocked his legs out from under him and laid her weight over his chest she put a big pawa real pawright on his private parts please dove said please dont please and that was all lilly wrote that was where we were supposed to stop nobody had any more lines except lilly lilly was just supposed to say there will be no more rapes no morethats final and i was supposed to pick dove up and dump him out in the hall but franny got up off the couch and pushed everyone away she walked over to dove thats enough susie franny said and susie got off dove put your pants back on chipper franny said to him he stood up but he fell he struggled to his feet again and pulled his pants up and the next time you take your pants off for anybody franny told chipper dove i want you to think of me think of all of us said frank coming out of the bedroom remember us i said to chipper dove if you see us again big ruthie told him better go the other way any one of us might kill you man she told him matteroffactly susie the bear took her bears head off she would never need to wear it again from now on the bear suit was just for fun she looked chipper dove right in the eye the number one firstclass hysteric named scurvy got up off the rug and came over to look at chipper dove too she looked at him as if she was committing him to memory then she shrugged and lit a cigarette and looked away dont pass any open windows frank called down the hall to dove as he left us he walked away holding the wall of the hall for support we all couldnt help but notice that hed wet his pants chipper dove moved like a man seeking the mens room in a hospital ward for the disoriented he moved with the feeble lack of sureness of a man who wasnt sure what experience awaited him in the mens roomas if even he wouldnt be sure what to do when he arrived at the urinal but there was in all of us that initial sense of letdown that should be documented in any fair study of revenge whatever we had done it would never be as awful as what he had done to frannyand if it had been as awful it would have been too much i would feel for the rest of my life as if i were still holding chipper dove by his armpitshis feet a few inches off the ground of seventh avenue there was really nothing to do with him except put him down there never would be anything to do with him toowith our chipper doves we just go on picking them up and putting them down forever and so youd think that was that lilly had proven herself with a real opera a genuine fairy tale susie the bear had played out the part she had exhausted her bears role she would keep the bear suit only for its sentimental value and for amusing childrenand of course for halloween father was about to get a seeing eye dog for christmas it would be his first of many seeing eye dogs and once he had an animal to talk to my father would finally figure out what he wanted to do with the rest of his life here comes the rest of our lives franny said with a kind of awed affection the rest of our fucking lives is finally coming up she said that day chipper dove wandered out of the stanhope and back to his firm it seemed we all would be survivorsthose of us who were left it seemed we had made it franny was now free to find a life lilly and frank had their chosen careersor as they say their careers had chosen them father needed only a little time with the animal side of himselfto help him make up his mind i knew that an american literature degree from an austrian university didnt qualify me for very much but what did i have to do but look after my fatherbut lift what weight i could lift off my brother and my sisters whenever the weight needed lifting what we had all forgotten in the prechristmas decorations in our frenzy over dealing with chipper dove was that shape that had haunted us from the beginning as in any fairy tale just when you think youre out of the woods there is more to the woods than you thought just when you think youre out of the woods it turns out youre still in them how could we so quickly have forgotten the lesson of the king of mice how could we have put away that old dog of our childhood our dear sorrow as neatly as susie folded up her bear suit and said thats it thats over now its a whole new ball game there is a song the viennese singit is one of their socalled heurigen songs the songs they sing to celebrate the first wine of the season typical of those people freud understood so well their songs are full of death wishes the king of mice himself no doubt once sang this little song verkaufts mei gwand i fahr in himmel sell my old clothes im off to heaven when susie the bear took her friends back to the village frank and franny and lilly and i called up good old room service and ordered the champagne as we tasted the very slight sweetness of our revenge on chipper dove our childhood appeared like a clear lakebehind us we felt we were free of sorrow but one of us must have been singing that song even then one of us was secretly humming the tune life is serious but art is fun the king of mice was dead butfor one of usthe king of mice was not forgotten i am not a poet i was not even the writer in our family donald justice would become lillys literary hero he replaced even that marvelous ending of the great gatsby which lilly read to us too often donald justice has most eloquently posed the question that flies to the heart of my hotelliving family as mr justice asks how shall i speak of doom and ours in special but as of something altogether common add doom to the list then especially in families doom is altogether common sorrow floats love too andin the long rundoom it floats too the king of mice syndrome the last hotel new hampshire here is the epilogue there always is one in a world where love and sorrow float there are many epiloguesand some of them go on and on in a world where doom always muscles in some of the epilogues are short a dream is a disguised fulfillment of a suppressed wish father announced to us over easter dinner at franks apartment in new yorkeaster youre quoting freud again pop lilly told him which freud franny asked by rote sigmund frank answered from chapter four of the interpretation of dreams i should have known the source too because frank and i were taking turns reading to father in the evening father had asked us to read all of freud to him so what did you dream about pop franny asked him the arbuthnotbythesea father said his seeing eye dog spent every mealtime with her head in fathers lap every time father reached for his napkin he would deposit a morsel into the dogs waiting mouth and the dog would raise her headmomentarilyallowing father access to his napkin you should not feed her at the table lilly scolded father but we all liked the dog she was a german shepherd with a particularly rich goldenbrown color that liberally interrupted the black all over her body and dominated the tone of her gentle face she was particularly longfaced and highcheekboned so that her appearance was nothing like a labrador retrievers father had wanted to call her freud but we thought there was enough confusion among us concerning which freud was meantby this remark or that a third freud we convinced father would have driven everyone crazy lilly suggested we call the dog jung what that traitor that antisemite frank protested whoever heard of naming a female after jung frank asked thats something only jung would have thought of he said fuming lilly then suggested we call the dog stanhope because of lillys fondness for the fourteenth floor father liked the idea of naming his first seeing eye dog after a hotel but he said he preferred naming the dog after a hotel he really liked we all agreed then that the dog would be called sacher frau sacher after all had been a woman sachers only bad habit was putting her head in fathers lap every time father sat down to eat anything but father encouraged thisso it was really fathers bad habit sacher was otherwise a model seeing eye dog she did not attack other animals thus dragging my father wildly out of control after her she was especially smart about the habits of elevatorsblocking the door from reclosing with her body until my father had entered or exited sacher barked at the doorman at the st moritz but was otherwise friendly if a trifle aloof with fathers fellow pedestrians these were the days before you had to clean up after your dog in new york city so father was spared that humiliating taskwhich would have been almost impossible for him he realized in fact father feared the passing of such a law years before anyone was talking about it i mean hed say if sacher shits in the middle of central park south how am i supposed to find the crap its bad enough to have to pick up dog shit but if you cant see it its positively arduous i wont do it he would shout if some selfrighteous citizen even tries to speak to me even suggests that i am responsible for my dogs messes i think ill use the baseball bat but father was safefor a while we wouldnt be living in new york by the time they passed the dog shit law as the weather got nice sacher and my father would walk unaccompanied between the stanhope and central park south and my father felt free to be blind to sachers shitting at franks the dog slept on the rug between fathers bed and mine and i sometimes wondered in my sleep if it was sacher i heard dreaming or father so you dreamed about the arbuthnotbythesea franny said to father so what else is new no father said it wasnt one of the old dreams i mean your mother wasnt there we werent young again or anything like that no man in a white dinner jacket daddy lilly asked him no no father said i was old in the dream i was even older than i am now he said he was fortyfive in the dream father said i was just walking along the beach with sacher we were just taking a stroll over the groundsaround the hotel he said all around the ruins you mean franny said well father said slyly of course i couldnt actually see if the arbuthnot was still a ruin but i had the feeling it was restoredi had the feeling it was all fixed up father said shoveling food off his plate and into his lapand into sacher it was a brandnew hotel father said impishly and you owned it ill bet lilly said to him you did say i could do anything didnt you frank father asked in the dream you owned the arbuthnotbythesea frank asked him and it was all fixed up open for business as usual pop franny asked him business as usual father said nodding sacher nodded too is that what you want to do i asked father you want to own the arbuthnotbythesea well father said of course wed have to change the name of course franny said the third hotel new hampshire frank cried lilly he shouted just think of it another tv series i havent really been working on the first series lilly said worriedly franny knelt beside father she put her hand on his knee sacher licked frannys fingers you want to do it again franny asked father you want to start all over again you understand that you dont have to but what else would i do franny he asked her smiling its the last onei promise you he said addressing all of us if i cant make the arbuthnotbythesea into something special then ill throw in the towel franny looked at frank and shrugged i shrugged too and lilly just rolled her eyes frank said well i guess its simple enough to inquire what it costs and who owns it i dont want to see himif he still owns it father said i dont want to see the bastard father was always pointing out to us the things he didnt want to see and we were usually restrained enough to resist pointing out to him that he couldnt see anything franny said she didnt want to see the man in the white dinner jacket either and lilly said she saw him all the timein her sleep lilly said she was tired of seeing him it would be frank and i who would rent a car and drive all the way to maine frank would teach me how to drive along the way we would see the ruin that was the arbuthnotbythesea again we would note that ruins dont change a lot what capacity for change is in a ruin has usually been exhausted in the considerable process of change undergone in order for the ruin to become a ruin once becoming a ruin a ruin stays pretty much the same we noted some more vandalism but its not much fun vandalizing a ruin we supposed and so the whole place looked almost exactly as it had looked to us in the fall of when we had all come to the arbuthnotbythesea to watch earl die we had no trouble recognizing the dock where old state omaine was shot although that dockand the surrounding dockshad been rebuilt and there were a lot of new boats in the water the arbuthnotbythesea looked like a small ghost town but what had once been a quaint fishing and lobstering villagealongside the hotel groundswas now a scruffy little tourist town there was a marina where you could rent boats and buy clam worms and there was a rocky public beach within sight of the private beach belonging to the arbuthnotbythesea since no one was around to care the private beach was hardly private anymore two families were having a picnic there when frank and i visited the place one of the families had arrived by boat but the other family had driven right down to the beach in their car theyd driven up the same private driveway that frank and i had driven up past the faded sign that still said closed for the season the chain that once had blocked that driveway had long ago been torn down and dragged away it would cost a fortune to even make the place habitable frank said provided they even want to sell it i said who in gods name would want to keep it frank asked it was at the realty office in bath maine that frank and i found out that the man in the white dinner jacket still owned the arbuthnotbytheseaand he was still alive you want to buy old arbuthnots place the shocked realtor asked we were delighted to learn that there was an old arbuthnot i only hear from his lawyers the realtor said theyve been trying to unload the place for years old arbuthnot lives in california the realtor told us but hes got lawyers all over the country the one i deal with most of the time is in new york we thought then that it would simply be a matter of letting the new york lawyer know that we wanted it butback in new yorkarbuthnots lawyer told us that arbuthnot wanted to see us well have to go to california frank said old arbuthnot sounds as senile as one of the hapsburgs but he wont sell the place unless he gets to meet us jesus god franny said thats an expensive trip to make just to meet someone frank informed her that arbuthnot was paying our way he probably wants to laugh in your faces franny told us he probably wants to meet someone whos crazier than he is lilly said i cant believe im so lucky father cried to imagine that its still available frank and i saw no reason to describe the ruinsand the seedy new tourism surrounding his cherished arbuthnotbythesea he wont see any of it anyway frank whispered and i am glad that father never got the chance to see old arbuthnot a terminal resident of the beverly hills hotel when frank and i arrived at the los angeles airport we rented our second car of that week and drove ourselves to meet the aged arbuthnot in a suite with its own palm garden we found the old man with an attending nurse an attending lawyer this one was a california lawyer and what would prove to be a fatal case of emphysema he sat propped up in a fancy hospital bedhe sat breathing very carefully alongside a row of airconditioners i like la arbuthnot gasped not so many jews here as there are in new york or else ive finally gotten immune to jews he added then he was flung off at a sharp angle on his hospital bed by a cough that seemed to attack him by surprise and from the side he sounded as if he were choking on a whole turkey legit seemed impossible he would recover it seemed his persistent antisemitism would finally be the death of him im sure that would have made freud happy but just as suddenly as the attack had seized him the attack left him and he was calm his nurse plumped up his pillows for him his lawyer placed some importantlooking documents upon the old mans chest and produced a pen for old arbuthnot to hold in his trembling hand im dying arbuthnot said to frank and me as if this hadnt been obvious from our first glimpse of him he wore white silk pajamas he looked about one hundred years old he couldnt have weighed more than fifty pounds they say theyre not jews the lawyer told arbuthnot indicating frank and me is that why you wanted to meet us frank asked the old man you could have found that out over the phone i may be dying he said but im not selling out to the jews my father i told arbuthnot was a dear friend of freud not the freud frank said to arbuthnot but the old man had begun coughing again and he didnt hear what frank had to say freud arbuthnot said hacking and spewing i knew a freud too he was a jewish animal trainer the jews arent good with animals though arbuthnot confided to us animals can tell you know he said they can always sense anything funny about you he said this freud i knew was a dumb jewish animal trainer he tried to train a bear but the bear ate him arbuthnot howled with delightwhich brought on more coughing a sort of antisemitic bear frank asked and arbuthnot laughed so hard i thought his subsequent coughing would kill him i was trying to kill him frank said later you must be crazy to want that place arbuthnot told us i mean dont you know where maine is its nowhere theres no decent train service and theres no decent flying service its a terrible place to drive toits too far from both new york and bostonand when you do get there the waters too cold and the bugs can bleed you to death in an hour none of the really class sailors sail there anymorei mean the sailors with money he said if you have a little money arbuthnot said theres absolutely nothing to spend it on in maine they dont even have whores there we like it anyway frank told him theyre not jews are they arbuthnot asked his lawyer no the lawyer said its hard to tell looking at them arbuthnot said i used to be able to spot a jew at first glance he explained to us but im dying now he added too bad frank said freud wasnt eaten by a bear i told arbuthnot the freud i knew was eaten by a bear arbuthnot said no said frank the freud you knew was a hero not the freud i knew old arbuthnot argued petulantly his nurse caught some spittle dribbling off his chin and wiped him as absentmindedly as she might have dusted a table the freud we both know i said saved the vienna state opera vienna arbuthnot cried vienna is full of jews he yelled theres more of them in maine than there used to be frank teased him in la too i said im dying anyway arbuthnot said thank god he signed the documents on his chest and his lawyer handed them over to us and that was how in frank bought the arbuthnotbythesea and twentyfive acres on the coast of maine for a song as franny would say an almost skyblue mole was sprouting on old arbuthnots face and both his ears were painted a vivid purple with gentian violet an oldfashioned fungicide it was as if a giant fungus were consuming arbuthnot from the inside out wait a minute he said as we were leavinghis chest made a watery echo of his words his nurse plumped up his pillows again his lawyer snapped a briefcase shut the cold of the room from all the purring airconditioners made the place feel to frank and me like the tombthe kaisergruftfor the heartless hapsburgs in vienna what are your plans arbuthnot asked us what in hell are you going to do with that place its going to be a special commando training camp frank told old arbuthnot for the israeli army i saw arbuthnots lawyer crack a smile it was the special sort of smile that would make frank and me later look up the lawyers name on the documents that had been handed over to us the lawyers name was irving rosenman and despite the fact that he came from los angeles frank and i were pretty sure he was jewish old arbuthnot didnt crack a smile israeli commandos he said rattatattattattat said frank imitating a machine gun we thought that irving rosenman was going to throw himself into the airconditioners to keep himself from laughing the bears will get them arbuthnot said strangely the bears will get all the jews in the end he saidthe mindless hatred in his old face was as oldfashioned and as vivid as the gentian violet in his ears have a nice death frank told him arbuthnot started coughing he tried to say something more but he couldnt stop coughing he motioned the nurse over to him and she seemed to interpret his coughing without very much difficulty she was used to it she motioned us out of arbuthnots room then she came outside and told us what arbuthnot had told her to tell us he said hes going to have the best death money can buy she told us whicharbuthnot had addedwas more than frank and i were going to get and frank and i could think of no message to give the nurse to pass on to old arbuthnot we were content to leave him with the idea of israeli commandos in maine frank and i said goodbye to arbuthnots nurse and to irving rosenman and we flew back to new york with the third hotel new hampshire in franks pocket thats just where you should keep it frank franny told him in your pocket youll never make that old place into a hotel again lilly told father its had its chance well start out modestly father assured lilly father and i were the we father meant i told him id go to maine with him and help him get started then youre as crazy as he is franny had told me but i had an idea i would never share with father if as freud says a dream is the fulfillment of a wish thenas freud also saysthe same holds true for jokes a joke is also the fulfillment of a wish i had a joke to play on father and i have been playing it now for more than fifteen years since father is more than sixty years old now i think its fair to say that the joke came off its fair to say that i have gotten away with it the last hotel new hampshire was neverand never will bea hotel that is the joke i have played on father for all these years lillys first book trying to grow would make enough money so that we could have restored the arbuthnotbythesea and when they made the movie version we could have bought back the gasthaus freud too maybe by then we could have afforded the sacher at least we could have bought the stanhope but i knew it wasnt necessary that the third hotel new hampshire be a real hotel after all as frank would say the first two werent real hotels either the truth is father had always been blind or freuds blindness had proved to be contagious we had the debris cleaned off the beach we had the grounds more or less restored which is to say we mowed the lawn again and we even made an effort with one of the tennis courts many years later we put in a swimming pool because father liked to swim and it made me nervous to watch him in the ocean i was always afraid hed make a wrong turn and head out to sea and the buildings that had been dormitories for the staffwhere mother and father and freud had once resided we simply removed them we had the wreckers come and drag them away we had the ground leveled and we paved it we told father it was a parking lot although we never had very many cars around we put our hearts into the main building we put a bar where the reception desk had been we turned that lobby into a huge game room we were thinking of the dart board and the billiard tables in the kaffee mowatt so i suppose its accurate to sayas franny saysthat we converted the lobby to a viennese coffeehouse it led into what had been the hotel restaurant and the kitchen we just knocked down some walls and made the whole thing into what the architect called a kind of country kitchen a huge kind lilly said a weird kind said frank it was franks idea to restore the ballroom in case we have a big party he argued though we would never have a party so large that the socalled country kitchen couldnt handle it even with eliminating many of the bathrooms even with turning the top floor into storage space and the second floor into a library we could sleep thirtyodd peoplein complete privacyif wed ever gone through with it and bought enough beds at first father seemed puzzled by how quiet it was where are the guests hed ask especially in summer with the windows open when you would expect to hear the childrentheir high light voices swept up from the beach and mingled with the cries of gulls and terns i explained to father that we did well enough in the summers to not even need to bother to stay open for business in the winter but some summers he would question me about the surrounding silence orchestrated by the steady percussion of the sea by my count i cant imagine theres more than two or three guests around here father would say unless im going deaf too he would add but wed all explain to him how we were such a firstclass resort hotel that we didnt really need to fill the place we were getting such a stiff price for a room we didnt need to fill every room to be making a bundle isnt that fantastic hed say its what i knew this place could be hed remind us it needed only that proper combination of class and democracy i always knew it could be special well my family was a model of democracy of course first lilly made the money then frank went to work with the money and so the third hotel new hampshire had lots of un paying guests we wanted as many people around as possible because the presence of people both their merry and quarrelsome sounds helped further my fathers illusions that we were at last a joint of distinction operating wholly in the black lilly came and stayed as long as she could stand it she never liked working in the library although we offered hervirtuallythe entire second floor too many books in the library she said she felt when she was writing that the presence of other books dwarfed her little efforts lilly even tried writing in the ballroom oncethat vast space awaiting music and graceful feet lilly would write and write in there but her tiny pecks upon her typewriter would never fill the empty dance floorthough she tried how lilly tried and franny would come and stay out of the publics scrutiny franny would use our third hotel new hampshire to collect herself franny would be famousmore famous than lilly too im afraid in the movie version of trying to grow franny got the part of playing herself after all she is the hero of the first hotel new hampshire in the movie version of course shes the only one of us who seems authentic they made frank into your stereotypical homosexual cymbalist and taxidermist they made lilly cute but lillys smallness was never cute to us her size im afraid always seemed like a failed effortno cuteness involved in the struggle or in the result and they overplayed egg egg the heartbreakeregg really was cute they found some veteran western actor to play iowa bob frank and franny and i all remembered seeing this old duffer shot off a horse a million times he had a way of lifting weights as if he were wolfing down a plate of flapjackshe was completely unconvincing and of course they cut out all the swearing some producer actually told franny that profanity revealed a poor vocabulary and a lack of imagination and frank and lilly and father and i all loved to shout at franny then and ask her what she had said to that what an anal crock of shit you dumb asshole shed told the producer up yoursand in your ear too but even with the limitation imposed upon her language franny came across in trying to grow even though they cast junior jones in such a way that he came on like some selfconscious buffoon auditioning for a jazz band even though the people playing mother and father were insipid and vague and the one who was supposed to be mewell jesus god even with these handicaps franny shone through she was in her twenties when they shot the movie but she was so pretty that she played sixteen just fine i think the oaf they got to play you franny told me was supposed to exude an absolutely lifeless combination of sweetness and stupidity well i dont know thats what you do exude every now and then frank would tease me like a kind of weightlifting maiden aunt lilly said to me thats how they cast you but in my first few years of looking after father at the third hotel new hampshire that is rather what i felt like much of the time a kind of weightlifting maiden aunt with a degree in american literature from vienna i could do worse than become the caretaker of my fathers illusions you need a nice woman franny said to me long distancefrom new york from la from the viewpoint of her rising stardom frank would argue with her that perhaps what i needed was a nice man but i was wary i was happy setting up my fathers fantasy in the tradition established by the doomed fehlgeburt i would especially enjoy reading to father in the evenings reading aloud to someone is one of this worlds pleasures i would even succeed in interesting father in lifting weights you dont have to see to do it and in the mornings now father and i have a wonderful time in the old ballroom weve got mats spread out everywhere and a proper bench for the bench presses weve got barbells and dumbbells for every occasionand we have the ballrooms splendid view of the atlantic ocean if father hasnt the means to see the view he is content to feel the sea breeze wash over him as he lies lifting ever since squeezing arbeiter as ive said i dont put quite as much into the weights and father has become sophisticated enough as a weight lifter to realize this he chides me a little bit about it but i enjoy just taking a light workout with him i leave him to do the heavy lifting now oh i know youre still in shape he teases me but youre no match for what you were in the summer of sixtyfour you cant be twentytwo all your life i remind him and we lift and lift for a while on those mornings with the maine mist not yet burned off and the sea damp settled upon us i can imagine that im just starting the voyage all over againi can believe im lying on the rug old sorrow liked to lie on and its iowa bob beside me instructing me instead of me instructing my father i would be sneaking up on forty before i would try living with a woman for my thirtieth birthday lilly sent me a donald justice poem she liked the ending and thought it applied to me i was feeling cross at the time and fired back a note to lilly saying who is this donald justice and how come everything he says applies to us but its a nice ending to any poem and i did feel just like this at thirty thirty today i saw the trees flare briefly like the candles upon a cake as the sun went down the sky a momentary flash yet there was time to wish before the light could die if i had known what to wish as once i must have known bending above the clean candlelit tablecloth to blow them out with a breath and when frank was forty i would send him a birthday greeting with donald justices men at forty poem enclosed men at forty learn to close softly the doors to rooms they will not be coming back to frank fired me back a note saying he stopped reading the damn poem right there close your own doors frank snapped youll be forty soon enough as for me i bang the damn doors and come back to them all the fucking time bravo frank i thought he has always kept passing the open windows without the slightest trace of fear its what all the great agents do they make the most incredible and illogical advice sound reasonable they make you go ahead without fear and that way you get it you get more or less what you want or you get something anyway at least you dont end up with nothing when you go ahead without fear when you lunge into the darkness as if you were operating on the soundest advice in the world who would have thought frank would have ended up so lovable he was such a rotten kid and i do not blame frank for pushing lilly too hard it was lilly franny always said who pushed lilly too hard when the damn reviewers liked her trying to growwhen they condescended to her with their superior forms of praise saying how in spite of who she was the lilly berry of that famous operasaving family she was really not a bad writer she was really very promisingwhen they prattled on and on about the freshness of her voice all it meant to lilly was that now she had to get going now she had to get serious but our little lilly wrote her first book almost by accident that book was only a euphemism for trying to grow yet it insisted to her that she was a writer when perhaps she was only a sensitive and loving reader a lover of literature who thought she wanted to write i think it was the writing that killed lilly because writing can do that it just burned her up she wasnt big enough to take the selfabuse of it to take the constant chipping awayof herself after the movie version of trying to grow made franny famous and after the tv series of the first hotel new hampshire made lilly berry a household word i suppose that lilly wanted to just write as one is always hearing writers say i suppose she just wanted to be free to write her book now the problem was it wasnt a very good bookthe second one it was called the evening of the mind from a line she stole from her guru donald justice now comes the evening of the mind here are the fireflies twitching in the blood and so on she might have been wiser to take her title and make her book from another donald justice line time a bow bent with his certain failure she might have called her book certain failure because it was just that it was more than she could handle it was over her head it was about the death of dreams it was about how hard the dreams die it was a brave book in that it departed from anything directly relatable to lillys little autobiography but it departed to a country too foreign for her to grasp she wrote a vague book that reflected how foreign the language she was only visiting was to her when you write vaguely you are always vulnerable she was easily wounded when the criticswhen the damn reviewers with their dull plodding cunningjumped on her according to frank who was usually right about lilly she suffered the further embarrassment of writing a bad book that was adopted as heroic by a rather influential group of bad readers a certain illiterate kind of college student was attracted to the vagueness of the evening of the mind this kind of college student was relieved to discover that absolute obscurity was not only publishable but seemingly identified with seriousness what some of the students liked best in her book frank pointed out was what lilly hated most about itits selfexaminations that led nowhere its plotlessness its people fading in and out of character its absence of story somehow among a certain university population the obvious failure to be clear confirms that what any fool knows is a vice can be rearranged by art to resemble a virtue where in hell do these college kids get such an idea franny would complain not all of them have this idea frank would point out they think whats forced and strained and difficult with a fucking capital d is better than whats straightforward fluent and comprehensible franny shouted what the fucks wrong with these people only some of them are like that franny frank would say just the ones whove made a cult out of lillys failure franny asked just the ones who listen to their teachers frank said smuglyhappily at home in one of his antieverything moods i mean where do you think the college students learn to think that way franny frank asked her from their teachers jesus god franny would say she would not ask for a part in the evening of the mind there was no way to make that book into a movie anyway franny became a star with so much more ease than lilly became a writer being a star is easier franny would say you dont have to do anything but be relaxed about who you are and trust that people will like you you just trust that theyll get the you in you franny said you just be relaxed and hope that the you in you comes across for a writer i guess the you in you needs more nourishment to emerge i always wanted to write donald justice a letter about that but i think that seeing himonly once and from a distanceshould suffice if whats best and clearest in him isnt in his poems he wouldnt be a very good writer and since something good and strong in him emerges in his poems it would probably be disappointing to meet him oh i dont mean that hed be a bum hes probably a wonderful man but he couldnt be as precise as his poems his poems are so stately hed have to be a letdown in lillys case of course her work was a letdownand she knew it she knew her work wasnt as lovable as she was and lilly would have preferred it the other way around what saved franny was not just that being a star is easier than being a writer what saved franny too was that she didnt have to be a star alone what donald justice knows is that you have to be a writer all alone whether you live alone or not you would not recognize me mine is the face which blooms in the dank mirrors of washrooms as you grope for the light switch my eyes have the expression of the cold eyes of statues watching their pigeons return from the feed you have scattered jesus god as franny has said whod want to meet him but lilly was lovely to knowexcept perhaps to herself lilly wanted her words to be lovely but her words let her down its remarkable how franny and i once thought of frank as the king of mice we had frank figured all wrong we underestimated frank from the beginning he was a hero but he needed to get to that point in time when he would be signing all our checks and telling us how much we could spend on this or that in order for us to recognize the hero that frank had always been no lilly was our king of mice we should have known franny would wail and wail she was just too small and so lilly is lost to us now she was the sorrow we never quite understood we never saw through her disguises perhaps lilly never grew quite large enough for us to see she authored one masterpiece which she never gave herself enough credit for she wrote the screenplay for the movie starring chipper dove she was the writer and director of that opera in the grand tradition of schlagobers and blood she knew just how far to go with that story it was the evening of the mind that didnt live up to her own expectations and the difficulty she had trying to begin againtrying to write the book that would have been called ambitiously everything after childhood that isnt even a donald justice line that was lillys own idea but she couldnt live up to it either when franny drinks too much she gets pissed off at the power donald justice had over lilly franny sometimes gets drunk enough to blame poor donald justice for what happened to lilly but frank and i are always the first to assure franny that it was quality that killed lilly it was the end of the great gatsby which was not her ending which was not an ending within her grasp and once lilly said damn that donald justice anyway hes written all the good lines he may have written the last line my sister lilly read frank found lillys copy of donald justices night light opened to page the page dogeared many times and the one line at the top of the page was circled and circledin lipstick once and in several different tones of ink from several different ballpoint pens even in lowly pencil i do not think the ending can be right that might have been the line that drove lilly to it it was a february night franny was out on the west coast franny couldnt have saved her father and i were in maine lilly knew we went to bed early father was on his third seeing eye dog at the time sacher was gone a victim of overeating the little blond dog with the perky yapping bark the one that was hit by a carits vice was chasing cars fortunately not when father was attachedthat one was gone too father called her schlagobers because she had a disposition like whipped cream the third one was a farter but only in this way did he bear an unpleasant resemblance to sorrow it was another german shepherd but a male this time and father insisted that his name be fred that was also the name of the handyman at the third hotel new hampshirea deaf retired lobsterman named fred whenever father called any dogwhen he called sacher when he called schlagobersfred the handyman would cry what from whatever part of the hotel he was working in the whole thing irritated father so much and so much unspokenly reminded us both of egg that father always threatened to name the next dog fred since that old fool fred will answer whenever i call the dog anyway no matter what name im calling father shouted jesus god if hes going to be calling out what all the time we might as well get the name right so seeing eye dog number three was fred his only bad habit was that he tried to hump the cleaning womans daughter whenever the little girl strayed from her mothers side fred would goofily pin the little girl to the ground and start humping her and the little girl would scream no fred and the cleaning woman would holler cut it out fred and whack fred with a mop or a broom or with whatever was handy and father would hear the fracas and know what was going on and hed yell goddamn it fred you horny bastard get your ass over here fred and the deaf handyman the retired lobsterman our other fred would cry out what what and id have to go find him because father refused and tell him not you fred nothing fred oh hed say going back to work thought somebody called so it would have been hopeless for lilly to call us in maine we wouldnt have been able to do much more for her than yell fred a few times what lilly tried to do was call frank frank wasnt that far from her he might have helped we tell him now that he might have helped her that time but in the long run we know doom floats lilly got franks answering service anyway frank had replaced his live answering service with one of those mechanical services with one of those infuriating recordings of himself hi frank herebut actually im not here ha ha actually im out want to leave a message wait for the little signal and talk your heart out franny left many messages that made frank cross go fuck a doughnut frank franny would scream into the infuriating machine it costs me money every time that fucking device answers meim in fucking los angeles frank you moron you dipshit you turd in a birdbath and then shed make all sorts of farting sounds and very liquid kisses and frank would call me disgusted as usual honestly hed say i dont understand franny at all she just left the most disgusting message on my tape recorder i mean i know she thinks shes being funny but doesnt she know that weve all heard quite enough of her vulgarity at her age it hardly becomes her any longerif it ever did youve cleaned up your language i wish youd make an effort to clean up hers and on and on lillys message must have scared frank and he probably didnt come in from his evening date very long after she had called he put the machine on and listened to his messages as he was brushing his teeth getting ready to go to bed they were mostly business things the tennis player he represents had gotten in some difficulty over a deodorant commercial a screenwriter called to say that a director was manipulating him and frank made a fast mental noteto the effect that this writer needed lots of manipulation a famous choreographer had bogged down in her autobiography she was blocked in her childhood she confided to frank who just kept brushing his teeth he rinsed his mouth turned off the bathroom light and then heard lilly hi its me she said apologeticallyto the machine lilly was always apologizing frank smiled and untucked his bedcovers he always put his dressmakers dummy in bed before he crawled in there was a long pause on the machine and frank thought the thing was broken it often was but then lilly added its just me something about the tiredness in her voice made frank check the time of night and made him listen with some anxiety in the pause that followed frank remembers whispering her name go on lilly he whispered and lilly sang her little song just a little snatch of a song it was one of the heurigen songsa silly sad song a king of mice song frank knew the song by heart of course yerkaufts mei gwand i fahr in himmel sell my old clothes im off to heaven holy cow lilly frank whispered to the recorder he started getting dressed fast auf wiedersehen frank lilly said when her little song was over frank didnt answer her he ran down to columbus circle and caught an uptown cab and even though frank was no runner im sure he made good time i couldnt have done any better even if hed been home when lilly called i always told him that it would take anyone longer to cover twenty blocks and a zoo than it takes to fall fourteen storiesthe distance from the window of the corner suite on the stanhopes fourteenth floor to the pavement at eightyfirst and fifth avenue lilly had a shorter trip to take than franks and she would have beaten him to her destinationregardless there was nothing he could have done even so frank said he didnt say or even think to himself auf wiedersehen lilly until after theyd shown him her little body she left a better note than fehlgeburt had left lilly was not crazy she left a serious suicide note sorry said the note just not big enough i best remember her little hands how they leaped about in her lap whenever she said anything thoughtfuland lilly was always thoughtful not enough laughter in her man as junior jones would say lillys hands could not contain themselves they danced to whatever she thought she heardmaybe it was the same music freud tapped his baseball bat to the same song father is hearing now the bat stirring gracefully at his tired feet my father the blind walker he walks everywhere he covers the grounds of the hotel new hampshire for hours every day summer and winter first sacher led him then schlagobers then fred when fred developed his habit of killing skunks we had to get rid of him i like fred father said but between the farting and the skunks hell drive the guests away well the guests arent complaining i told father well theyre just being polite father said theyre showing their class but its loathsome its truly an imposition and if fred ever attacks a skunk when im with him well for christs sake ill kill him its the baseball bat for him then so we found a nice family who wanted a watchdog they werent blind but they didnt care if fred farted and smelled like a skunk and now father walks with seeing eye dog number four we got tired of naming them and when lilly died father lost a little more of his playfulness i just am not up to naming another dog he said want to do this one but i wasnt up to a dognaming either franny was shooting a film in france and frankwho was the hardest hit by lillys leaving uswas irritated at the whole idea of dogs frank had too much sorrow on his mind he wasnt in a mood for naming dogs at all jesus god frank said call it number four my father shrugged and settled for just plain old four so that now in the twilight when father is searching for his walking companion i hear him screaming the number four four he bellows goddamn it four and old fred the handyman still cries out what and father goes on with his four four four like someone remembering a childhood game that one where you throw up the ball and yell someones number and the one called has to try to catch the ball before the ball hits the ground four i hear father calling and i imagine some child running arms held out for the ball sometimes the child is lilly sometimes its egg and when father has finally found four i watch out the window as four leads my father carefully down to the docks in the failing light its possible to mistake my father and his seeing eye dog for a much younger man on the dockwith a bear perhaps possibly theyre fishing for pollack its no fun fishing when you cant see the fish come out of the water father has told me and so with four father just sits on the dock welcoming the evening until the fierce maine mosquitoes drive him back to the hotel new hampshire there is even a sign hotel new hampshire father insisted on it and although he cant see itand wouldnt miss it if i only pretended there was a signit is a concession i gladly make for him although it is a nuisance at times occasionally tourists get lost and find us they see the sign and think we are a hotel i have explained to father a very complicated system that our success in this hotel business has afforded us when the lost tourists find us and ask for rooms we ask them if they have reservations they say no of course but invariablylooking around themselves at the silence at the abandoned quality of peace we have achieved at the third hotel new hampshirethey ask but surely you have vacancies no vacancies we always say no reservations no vacancies sometimes father argues with me about this but surely we have room for them he hisses they seem very nice theres a child or two i can hear them quarreling and the mother sounds tiredtheyve probably been doing too much driving standards are standards pop i say really what would our other guests think if we got too loose about this its just so elitist he whispers wonderingly i mean i always knew this was a special place but somehow i never dreamed it would actually and he usually breaks off his sentence right there smiling and then he adds well wouldnt your mother have loved all this the baseball bat waves showing it all to mother and i say without the slightest tone of qualification in my voice she sure would have pop if not every minute my father adds thoughtfully at least this part at least the end lillys end considering her cult following was as quiet as we could have it i wish id had the courage to ask donald justice for an elegy but it wasas much as possiblea family funeral junior jones was there he sat with franny and i couldnt help but notice how perfectly they held each others hands it often takes a funeral to make you realize who has grown older i noticed junior had added a few gentle lines around his eyes he was a very hardworking lawyer nowwed hardly heard from him when he was in law school he disappeared almost as completely into law school as he had once disappeared into the bottom of a pile of cleveland browns i guess law school and football are similarly myopic experiences playing in the line junior always said had prepared him for law school hard work but boring boring boring now junior ran the black arm of the law and i knew that when franny was in new york she stayed with him they were both stars and maybe they were finally at ease with each other i thought but at lillys funeral all i could think was how lilly would have loved seeing them together father next to susie the bear kept the heavy end of his baseball bat on the floor between his kneesjust swaying slightly and when he walkedon susies arm on the arm of freuds former seeing eye bearhe carried the louisville slugger with great dignity as if it were simply a stout sort of cane susie was a wreck but she held herself together at the funeralfor fathers sake i think she had worshiped my father ever since his miracle swing of the batthe fabulous instinctual swing that had batted ernst the pornographer away by the time of lillys suicide susie the bear had been around shed left the east coast for the west and then had come back east again she ran a commune in vermont for a while i ran that fucker right into the ground she would tell us laughing she started a family counseling service in boston which blossomed into a day care center because there was a greater need for one of those which blossomed into a rape crisis center as soon as day care centers were everywhere the rape crisis center was not welcome in boston and susie admits that not all the hostility was external there were rape lovers and women haters everywhere of course and a variety of stupid people who were willing to assume that women who worked in a rape crisis center had to be what susie called hardcore dykes and feminist troublemakers the bostonians gave susie and her first rape crisis center a rather hard time apparently as a way of making their point they even raped one of the rape crisis center employees but even susie admits some of the rape crisis women in those early days were hardcore dykes and feminist troublemakers they really were just man haters and so some of the trouble at the rape crisis center was internal some of those women were simply antisystem philosophers without franks sense of humor and if the lawenforcement personnel were antagonistic to women wanting to see a little rape justicefor a changeso were the women antagonistic to the law in general and nobody really did the victim much good susies rape crisis center in boston was broken up when some of the man haters castrated an alleged rapist in a parking lot in back bay susie had come back to new yorkshe had gone back to family counseling she specialized in child beatingsdealing with as she would say both the children and the beatersbut she was sick of new york city she said it was no fun to live in greenwich village if you werent a bear and she was convinced that she had a future in rape crisis having witnessed her performance at the stanhope in i had to agree franny always said it was a better performance than any performance franny would ever give and franny is very good the way franny held herself together for her oneline part in dealing with chipper dove must have given her the necessary confidence in fact in all her later films franny would make that old line live again well look whos here she always finds a way to slip in that lovely line she does not use her own name of course movie stars almost never do and franny berry isnt exactly the sort of name that people notice frannys hollywood name her acting name is one you know this is our familys story and its inappropriate for me to use frannys stage namebut i know that you know her franny is the one you always desire she is the best one even when shes the villain shes always the real hero even when she dies even when she dies for loveor worse for war shes the most beautiful the most unapproachable but the most vulnerable too somehowand the toughest shes why you go to the movie or why you stay others dream of her nownow that she has freed me from dreaming about her in quite such a devastating way now i can live with what i dream about franny but there must be members of her audience who dont live so well with what they dream about her she made the adjustment to her fame very easily it was an adjustment lilly could never have made but franny made it easilybecause she was always our familys star she was used to being the main attraction the center of everyones attentionthe one we waited for the one we listened to she was born to the leading role and i was born to be a miserable fucking agent frank said gloomily after lillys funeral i have agented even this he said meaning lillys death she wasnt big enough for all the shit i gave her to do he said morosely then he began to cry we tried to cheer him up but frank said im always the fucking agent damn it i bring it all aboutthats me look at sorrow he howled who stuffed him who started the whole story frank cried crying and crying im just the asshole agent he blubbered but father reached out to frank the baseball bat as his antenna and he said frank frank my boy youre not the agent of lillys trouble frank father said who is the family dreamer frank father asked and we all looked at him well its meim the dreamer frank father said and lilly just dreamed more than she could do frank she inherited the damn dreams father said from me but i was her agent frank said stupidly yes but that doesnt matter frank franny said i mean it matters that youre my agent franki really need you franny told him but nobody could be lillys agent frank it wouldnt have mattered frank i told himbecause he was always saying this to me it wouldnt have mattered who her agent was frank but it was me he saidhe was so infuriatingly stubborn christ frank franny said its easier to talk to your answering service that finally brought him around for a while we would have to endure the wall of worshipful wailers lillys suicide cultthey were her fans who thought that lillys suicide was her ultimate statement was the proof of her seriousness this was ironic in lillys case because frank and franny and i knew that lillys suicidefrom lillys point of view was the ultimate admission that she was not serious enough but these people insisted on loving her for what she least loved in herself a group of lillys suicide fans even wrote to franny requesting that franny travel to the nations college campuses giving readings from lillys workas lilly it was franny the actress they were appealing to they wanted franny to play lilly and we remembered lillys only writerinresidence role and her account of the only english department meeting she ever attended in the meeting the lecture committee revealed that there was only enough money remaining for two more visits by moderately wellknown poets or one more visit by a wellknown writer or a poet or they could contribute all the remaining money toward the considerable expenses asked by a woman who was traveling the nations campuses doing virginia woolf although lilly was the only person in the english department who actually taught any of virginia woolfs books in her courses she found that she was alone in resisting the departments wishes to invite the virginia woolf impersonator i think virginia woolf would have wanted the money to go to a living writer lilly said to a real writer she added but the department insisted that they wanted all the money to go to the woman who did virginia woolf okay lilly finally said ill agree but only if the woman does it all only if she goes all the way there was a silence in the english department meeting and someone asked lilly if she was really seriousif she could possibly be in such bad taste as to suggest that the woman come to the campus to commit suicide and my sister lilly said it is what my brother frank would call disgusting that youas teachers of literaturewould actually spend money on an actress imitating a dead writer whose work you do not teach rather than spend it on a living writer whose work you probably havent read especially said lilly when you consider that the woman whose work is not being taught and whose person is being imitated was virtually obsessed with the difference between greatness and posing and you want to pay someone to pose as her you should be ashamed lilly told them go ahead and bring the woman here lilly added ill give her the rocks to put in her pockets ill lead her to the river and that is what franny told the group who wanted her to pose as lilly and do the nations campuses you should be ashamed franny said besides she added i am much too tall to play lilly my sister was really short this by the suicide fans was construed as frannys insensitivityand by association in various aspects of the news our family was characterized as being indifferent to lillys death for our unwillingness to take part in these lilly poses in frustration frank volunteered to do lilly at a public reading from the works of suicidal poets and writers naturally none of the writers or poets were reading from their own work various hired readers sympathetic to the work of the deceasedor worse sympathetic to their lifestyle which nearly always meant their deathstylewould read the work of the suicides as if they were the dead authors come back to life franny wanted no part of this either but frank volunteered he was rejected on the grounds of insincerity he said they surmised i was insincere fucking right i was he shouted they could all stand a fucking overdose of insincerity he added and junior jones would marry frannyfinally this is a fairy tale franny told me long distance but junior and i have decided that if we save it any longer we wont have anything worth saving franny was sneaking up on forty at the time the black arm of the law and hollywood had at least schlagobers and blood in common i suppose that franny and junior jones would strike peoplein their new york and their los angeles lifeas glamorous but i often think that socalled glamorous people are just very busy people junior and franny were consumed by their work and they succumbed to the comfort of having each others arms to fall exhausted into i was truly happy for them and only sorry that they both announced that they would have no time for kids i dont want children if i cant take care of them franny said ditto man said junior jones and one night susie the bear told me that she didnt want children either because the children she gave birth to would be ugly and she wouldnt bring an ugly child into the worldnot for anything she said it was simply the cruelest life one could expose a child to the discrimination suffered by people who arent goodlooking but youre not ugly susie i told her you just take a little getting used to i told her i think youre really attractive if you want to know and i did think so i thought susie the bear was a hero youre sick then susie said i got a face like a hatchet like a chisel with a bad complexion and i got a body like a paper bag she said like a paper bag of cold oatmeal susie said i think youre very nice i told her and i did franny had shown me how lovable susie the bear was and i had heard the song susie the bear taught franny to sing id had some interesting dreams concerning susies teaching me a song like that so i repeated to her i think youre very nice then youve got a brain like a paper bag of cold oatmeal susie told me if you think im very nice youre a real sick boy and one night when there were no guests in the hotel new hampshire i heard a peculiar creeping sound father was as likely to walk around at night as he was likely to walk around in the daylightbecause of course it was always nighttime for him but wherever father went the louisville slugger trailed after him or searched ahead of him and as he grew older his gait more and more resembled the gait of freud as if father had psychologically developed a limpas a form of kinship to the old interpreter of dreams also wherever father went seeing eye dog number four went with him we were negligent about keeping fours toenails clipped so that father accompanied by four made quite a clatter old fred the handyman had a room on the third floor and slept like a stone at the bottom of the sea he slept as soundly as the abandoned weirs ruined by seals and now sunk in the mud flats now rinsed by the tide old fred was a sundown and sunup sort of sleeper because he was deaf he said he didnt like to be up at night especially in summer the maine nights are vibrant with noiseat least when you compare the nights to the maine days the opposite of new york frank liked to say the only time its quiet on central park south is about three in the morning but in maine frank liked to say about three in the morning is about the only time anythings going on fucking nature comes to life it was about three in the morning i noteda summer night with the insect world teeming the seabirds sounded fairly restful but the sea was no less determined and i heard this peculiar creeping sound it was at first hard to tell if it was outside my window which was openthough there was a screenor if the sound was outside my door in the hall my door was open too and the outside doors to the hotel new hampshire were never lockedthere were too many of them a raccoon i thought but then something much heavier than any raccoon shuffled across the bare floor at the landing to the stairs and softly padded down the carpeted hall toward my door i could feel the weight of whatever it wasit was making the floorboards sigh even the sea seemed to quiet itself even the sea seemed to listen to whatever it wasit was the kind of sound you hear in the night that makes the tide pause that makes the birds who never fly at night float up to the sky and hang suspended as if they were painted there four i whispered thinking that the dog might be on the prowl but whatever was in the hall was too tentative to be seeing eye dog number four four had been in the hall before old four wouldnt be pausing at every door i wished i had fathers baseball bat but when the bear lurched into my doorway i realized there was no weapon in the hotel new hampshire powerful enough to protect me from this intruder i lay very still pretending to be sound asleepwith my eyes wide open in the flat blurred flannelsoft light of the predawn the bear seemed huge it stared into my room at my motionless bed like an old nurse taking a bed check in a hospital i tried not to breathe but the bear knew i was there it sniffed deeply and very gracefully on all fours it came into my room well why not i was thinking a bear began my lifes fairy tale it is fitting that a bear should end it the bear shoved its warm face near mine and breathed in everything about me with one purposeful sniff it seemed to review my lifes storyand in a gesture resembling commiseration it placed its heavy paw on my hip it was quite a warm summer nightfor maineand i was naked covered by just a sheet the bears breath was hot and a little fruityperhaps it had just been feeding in the wild blueberriesbut it was surprisingly pleasant breath if not exactly fresh when the bear drew back the sheet and looked me over i felt just the tip of the iceberg of fear that chipper dove must have felt when he truly believed that a bear in heat wanted him but this bear rather disrespectfully snorted at what it saw earl said the bear and rather roughly shoved me it made room beside me for itself and crawled into my bed with me it was only when it embraced me and i identified the most distinctive component of its strange and powerful scent that i suspected this was no ordinary bear mixed with the pleasure of its fruited breath and the mustardgreen sharpness of its summer sweat i detected the obvious odor of mothballs susie i said thought youd never guess she said susie i cried and turned to her returning her embrace i had never been so happy to see her keep it down susie ordered me dont wake up your father ive been crawling all over this fucking hotel trying to find you i found your father first and someone who says what in his sleep and i met an absolute moron of a dog who didnt even know i was a bearthe fucker wagged his tail and went right back to sleep what a watchdog and fucking frank gave me the directionsi dont think frank should be trusted to give the directions to maine much less to this queer little part of the wretched state holy cow said susie i just wanted to see you before it got light i wanted to get to you while it was still dark for christs sake and i must have left new york about noon yesterday and now its almost fucking dawn she said and im exhausted she added she started to cry im sweating like a pig in this dumb fucking suit but i smell so bad and look so awful i dont dare take it off take it off i told her you smell very nice oh sure she said still crying but i coaxed her out of the bear head she smudged her tears with her paws but i held her paws and kissed her on the mouth for a while i think i was right about the blueberries thats what susie tastes like to me wild blueberries you taste very nice i told her oh sure she mumbled but she let me help her out of the rest of the bear suit it was like a sauna inside there i realized that susie was built like a bear and she was as slick with sweat as a bear fresh out of a lake i realized how i admired herfor her bearishness for her complicated courage im very fond of you susie i said closing my door and getting back into bed with her hurry up it will be light soon she said and then youll see how ugly i am i can see you now i said and i think youre lovely youre going to have to work hard to convince me said susie the bear for some years now i have been convincing susie the bear that she is lovely i think so of course and in a few more years i think susie will finally agree bears are stubborn but they are sane creatures once you gain their trust they will not shy away from you at first susie was so obsessed with her ugliness that she took every conceivable precaution against a possible pregnancy believing that the worst thing on earth for her to do would be to bring a poor child into this cruel world and allow him or her to suffer the treatment that is usually bestowed upon the ugly when i first started sleeping with susie the bear she was taking the pill and she also wore a diaphragm she put so much spermicidal jelly on the diaphragm that i had to suppress the feeling that we were engaging in an act of overkillto sperm to ease me over this peculiar anxiety susie insisted that i wear a prophylactic too thats the trouble with men she used to say you got to arm yourself so heavily before you dare do it with them that you sometimes lose sight of the purpose but susie has calmed down recently she seems to feel that one method of birth control is adequate and if the accident happens i cant help but hope that she will accept it bravely of course i wouldnt push her to have a baby if she didnt want to those people who want to make people have babies they dont want to have are ogres but even if i werent too ugly susie protests im too old i mean after forty you can have all sorts of complications i might not just have an ugly baby i might not even have a babyi might give birth to a kind of banana after forty its pretty risky nonsense susie i tell her well just get you in shapea little light work with the weights a little running youre young at heart susie i tell her the bear in you susie is still a cub convince me she tells me and i know what that means thats our euphemism for itwhenever we want each other she will just say out of the blue to me i need to be convinced or i will say to her susie you look in need of a little convincing or else susie will just say earl to me and ill know exactly what she means when we got married thats what she said when she came to her moment to say i do susie said earl what the minister said earl susie said nodding she does i told the minister that means she does i suppose that neither susie nor i will ever quite get over franny but we have our love for franny in common and thats more to have in common than whatever thing it is thats held in common by most couples and if susie was once freuds eyes i now see for my father so that susie and i have the vision of freud in common too you got a marriage made in heaven man junior jones has told me that morning after id first made love to susie the bear i was a little late meeting father in the ballroom for our weightlifting session he was already lifting hard when i staggered in four hundred and sixtyfour i said to him because this was our traditional greeting recalling that old rogue schnitzler father and i thought it was a very funny way for two men living without women to greet each other four hundred and sixtyfour my eye father grunted four hundred and sixtyfourlike hell i had to listen to you half the night jesus god i may be blind but i can hear by my count youre down to about four hundred and fiftyeight you havent got four hundred and sixtyfour left in younot anymore who the hell is she ive never imagined such an animal but when i told him id been with susie the bear and that i very much hoped she would stay and live with us father was delighted thats what weve been missing he cried thats really perfect i mean you couldnt ask for a better hotel i think youve handled the hotel business brilliantly but we need a bear everybody does and now that youve got the bear youre home free john now youve finally written the happy ending not quite i thought but all things consideredgiven sorrow given doom given lovei knew things could be much worse so what is missing just a child i think a child is missing i wanted a child and i still want one given egg and given lilly children are all i am missing now i still might convince susie the bear of course but franny and junior jones will provide me with my first child even susie is unafraid for that child that child is going to be a beauty susie says with franny and junior making it how can it miss but how could we miss i ask her as soon as you have it believe me it will be beautiful but just think of the color susie says i mean with junior and franny making it wont it be an absolutely gorgeous fucking color but i know as junior jones has told me that franny and juniors baby might be any colorill give it a range between coffee and milk junior likes to say any color baby is going to be a gorgeouscolored baby susie i tell her you know that but susie just needs more convincing i think that when susie sees junior and frannys baby it will make her want one too thats what i hope anywaybecause i am almost forty and susie has already crossed that bridge and if were going to have a baby we shouldnt wait much longer i think that frannys baby will do the trick even father agreeseven frank and isnt it just like franny to be so generous as to offer to have a baby for me i mean from that day in vienna when she promised us all that she was going to take care of us that she was going to be our mother from that day forth franny has stuck to her guns franny has come throughthe hero in her has kept pumping the hero in franny could lift a ballroom full of barbells it was just last winter after the big snow when franny called me to say that she was going to have a babyjust for me franny was forty at the time she said that having a baby was closing the door to a room she wouldnt be coming back to it was so early in the morning when the phone rang that both susie and i thought it was the rape crisis center hotline phone and susie jumped out of bed thinking she had another rape crisis on her hands but it was just the regular telephone that was ringing and it was frannyall the way out on the west coast she and junior were staying up late and having a party of two together they hadnt gone to bed yet they saidthey pointed out that it was still night in california they sounded a little drunk and silly and susie was cross with them she told them that no one but a rape victim ever called us that early in the morning and then she handed the phone to me i had to give franny the usual report on how the rape crisis center was doing franny has donated quite a bit of money to the center and junior has helped us get good legal advice in our maine area just last year susies rape crisis center gave medical psychological and legal counsel to ninetyone victims of rapeor of raperelated abuse not bad for maine as franny says in new york and la man says junior jones theres about ninetyone thousand victims a year of everything he adds it wasnt hard to convince susie that all those rooms in the hotel new hampshire could be used for something were a more than adequate facility for a rape crisis center and susie has trained several of the women from the college in brunswick so we always have a woman here to answer the hotline phone susie has instructed me never to answer the hotline phone the last thing a rape victim wants to hear when she calls for help susie has told me is a fucking mans voice of course its been a little complicated with father who cant see which phone is ringing so father when hes caught off guard by a ringing phone has developed this habit of yelling telephone even if hes standing right next to it surprisingly although father still thinks that the hotel new hampshire is a hotel he is not bad at rape counseling i mean he knows that rape crisis is susies businesshe just doesnt know that its our only business and sometimes he starts a conversation with a rape victim whos recovering herself with us at the hotel new hampshire for a few days and father gets her confused with what he thinks is one of the guests he might happen upon the victim just composing herself down on one of the docks and my father will taptaptap his louisville slugger out onto the dock and four will wag his tail to let my father know that someone is there and father will start chatting hello whos here hell ask and maybe the rape victim will say its just me sylvia oh yes sylvia father will say as if hes known her all his life well how do you like the hotel sylvia and poor sylvia will think that this is my fathers very polite and indirect way of referring to the rape crisis centerthe hoteland shell just go along with it oh its meant a lot to me shell say i mean i really needed to talk but i didnt want to feel i had to talk about anything until i was ready and whats nice here is that nobody pressures you nobody tells you what you ought to feel or ought to do but they help you get to those feelings more easily than you might get to them all by yourself if you know what i mean sylvia will say and father will say of course i know what you mean dear weve been in the business for years and thats just what a good hotel does it simply provides you with the space and with the atmosphere for what it is you need a good hotel turns space and atmosphere into something generous into something sympathetica good hotel makes those gestures that are like touching you or saying a kind word to you just when and only when you need it a good hotel is always there my father will say the baseball bat conducting both his lyrics and his song but it doesnt ever give you the feeling that its breathing down your neck yeah thats it i guess sylvia will say or betsy or patricia columbine sally alice constance or hope will say it gets it all out of me somehow but not by force theyll say no never by force my dear father will agree a good hotel forces nothing i like to call it just a sympathy space father will say never acknowledging his debt to schraubenschlüssel and his sympathy bomb and sylvia will say everyones nice here yes thats what i like about a good hotel father will say excitedly everyone is nice in a great hotel hell tell sylvia or anybody wholl listen to him you have a right to expect that niceness you come to us my dearand please forgive me for saying solike someone whos been maimed and were your doctors and your nurses yes thats right sylvia will say if you come to a great hotel in parts in broken pieces my father will go on and on when you leave the great hotel youll leave it whole again we simply put you back together again but this is almost mystically accomplishedhis is the sympathy space im talking aboutbecause you cant force anyone back together again they have to grow their own way we provide space father will say the baseball bat blessing the rape victim like a magic wand the space and the light my father will say as if he were a holy man blessing some other holy person and thats how you should treat a rape victim susie says they are holy and you treat them as a great hotel treats every guest every guest at a great hotel is an honored guest and every rape victim at the hotel new hampshire is an honored guestand holy its actually a good name for a rape crisis center susie agrees the hotel new hampshirethats got a little class to it and with the support of the county authorities and a wonderful organization of women doctors called the kennebec womens medical associates we run a real rape crisis center in our unreal hotel susie sometimes tells me that father is the best counselor shes got when someones really fucked up susie confides to me i send them down to the docks to see the blind man and seeing eye dog number four whatever he tells them must be working susie concludes at least so far nobodys jumped off keep passing the open windows my dear my father will tell just about anyone thats the important thing dear he adds no doubt it is lilly who lends such authority to my fathers advice he was always good at advising us childreneven when he knew absolutely nothing about what was wrong maybe especially when he knows absolutely nothing frank says i mean he still doesnt know im queer and he gives me good advice all the time what a knack okay okay franny said to me on the phone just last winter just after the big snow i didnt call you to hear the ins and outs of every rape in mainenot this time kid franny told me do you still want a baby of course i do i told her im trying to convince susie of it every day well franny said howd you like a baby of mine but you dont want a baby franny i reminded her what do you mean i mean junior and i got a little sloppy franny said and rather than do the modern thing we thought we knew the perfect mother and father for a baby especially these days man junior said on his end of the phone i mean maine may be the last hideout every kid should grow up in a weird hotel dont you agree franny asked what i thought man said junior jones was that every kid should have at least one parent who does nothing i dont mean to insult you man junior said to me but youre just a perfect sort of caretaker you know what i mean he means you look after everybody franny said sweetly he means its kind of like your role youre a perfect father or a mother man junior added and when susies got a baby around perhaps shell see the light franny said maybe shell get brave enough to give it a shot man said junior jones so to speak he added and franny howled on her end of the phone theyd obviously been cooking this phone call up together for quite some time hey franny said on the phone cat got your tongue are you there hello hello hey man said junior jones you passed out or something has a bear got your balls franny asked me im asking you do you want my baby thats not a frivolous question man said junior jones yes or no kid franny said i love you you know she added i wouldnt have a baby for just anybody you know kid but i couldnt speak i was so happy im offering you nine fucking months of my life im offering you nine months of my beautiful body kid franny teased me take it or leave it man cried junior jones your sister whose body is desired by millions is offering to change her shape for you shes willing to look like a fucking coke bottle just to give you a baby man i dont know exactly how im going to put up with it he added but we both love you you know what do you say take it or leave it i love you franny added to me fiercely im trying to give you what you need john she told me but susie the bear took the phone from me for christs sake she said to franny and junior you wake us up with what im sure is another fucking rape and now youve got him all red in the face and unable to speak what the fuck is going on this morning anyway if junior and i have a baby franny asked susie will you and john take care of it you bet your sweet ass honey said my good susie the bear and so the matter was decided were still waiting leave it to franny to take longer than anybody else leave it to me man says junior jones this babys going to be so big it needs a little more time in the cooker than most he must be right because frannys been carrying my baby for almost ten months now shes big enough to play for the browns junior jones complains i call him every night for a progress report jesus god franny says to me i just lie in bed all day waiting to explode im so bored the things i suffer for you my love she tells meand we share a private laugh over that susie goes around singing any day now and father is lifting more and more weight father is weight lifting with a frenzy these days he is convinced the baby will be born a weight lifter and father says hes got to get in shape to handle it and all the rape crisis women are being very patient with meabout the way i lunge for the phone when it rings toward either phone its just the hot line they tell me relax its probably just another rape honey susie reassures me its not your baby calm down its not at all that im anxious to discover if it will be a boy or a girl for once i agree with frank it doesnt matter nowadays of course with the precautionary tests they takeespecially with a woman frannys agethey already know the sex of the child or someone knows not frannyshe didnt want to know who wants to know such things in advance who doesnt know that half of pleasure lies in the wonder of anticipation whatever it is its going to be bored frank says bored frank franny howls how dare you say my baby will be bored but frank is just expressing a typical new york city opinion of growing up in maine if the baby grows up in maine frank insists it will have to be bored but i point out to frank that life is never boring in the hotel new hampshire not in the lighthearted first hotel new hampshire not in the darkness of the dream that was the second hotel new hampshire and not in our third hotel new hampshire eithernot in the great hotel we have at last become no one is bored and frank finally agrees he is a frequent and everwelcome guest here after all he takes over the library on the second floor the way junior jones dominates the barbells in the ballroom when he is visiting the way frannys beauty graces every room when she is herethe good maine air and the cold maine sea franny graces it all i fully expect that frannys child will have a similar good influence to comfort her i tried to read franny a donald justice poem over the phone the one called to a tenmonths child late arrival no one would think of blaming you for hesitating so who setting his hand to knock at a door so strange as this one might not draw back hold it right there franny interrupted me no more fucking donald justice please ive heard enough donald justice poems to get pregnant from them or at least sick to my stomach but donald justice is right as usual who wouldnt hesitate to come into this world who wouldnt put off this fairy tale as long as possible already you see frannys child is indicating a remarkable insight a rare sensitivity and yesterday it snowed in maine we learn to take weather personally susie was investigating the alleged rape of a waitress in bath and i was worried about her driving back in the storm but susie was safely home before dark and we both said how this storm reminded us of the big snow of last winter of the day franny called to tell us about her coming gift father plays like a child in the snow snow is quite a wonder to the blind he said just yesterday coming into the kitchen all covered with it hed been out in the drifts literally rolling around with seeing eye dog number fourthey were both covered with it it was a wild storm by threethirty in the afternoon we had to turn all the lights on i stoked up the fires in two of the woodstoves a bird blinded by the snow had flown through a windowpane in the ballroom and broken its neck four found it lying by the barbells and carried it all around the hotel before susie could get it away from the dog the snow melted off fathers boots and made the kitchen slippery father slipped in a puddle and whacked me in the ribs with the louisville sluggerwhich he always waves wildly whenever he is thrown off balance we had a little argument about that just like a child he wont knock the snow off his boots before he comes inside i cant see the snow he complains childishly how the fuck do i knock it off if i cant see it shut up both of you susie the bear told us when theres a child in the house youll both have to stop yelling i made some fresh pasta with a neat machine frank brought from new york it flattens the dough in sheets and cuts the pasta into any shape you want its important to have toys like that if you live in maine susie made a mussel sauce for the pasta father chopped up the onion for her an onion never seems to bother fathers eyes when we heard four bark we thought hed found another poor bird we saw a volkswagen bus trying to make its way up our driveway in the storm the bus was slithering and sliding whoever was driving the bus was either excited another fucking rape said susie instinctively or else it was someone from out of state no maine driver would have so much trouble driving in the snow i thought but it was hardly the tourist time of year at the hotel new hampshire the bus couldnt make it all the way to the parking lot but it got close enough for me to see the arizona license plate no wonder they cant drive i saidwhich is a typical maine point of view toward outofstaters yeah well susie said youd probably look like an idiot in an arizona desert whats a desert father asked and susie laughed the driver of the arizona bus was walking through the snow toward us he didnt even know how to walk in the snowhe kept falling down theyve had a rape all the way out in arizona susie i told her and youre so famous theyll only talk to you dont they know were a resort hotel father asked peevishly ill tell whoever it is that were closed for the season the man from arizona was sorry to hear that he explained that he thought he was headed for the mountains for some skiingwhich he and his family had never tried beforebut that hed been given some bad directions or he got lost in the storm and here he was at the ocean instead wrong season for the ocean father pointed out the man could see that he looked nice but awfully tired we do have enough room susie whispered to me i didnt want to start taking in guests in fact what i loved best about this hotel new hampshire was that the only guests were in fathers mind but when i saw all the little kids pile out of the volkswagen bus and start playing in the snow i had a change of heart the mother looked awfully tired toonice but tired whats that one of the kids was screaming its an ocean i think the mother said an ocean the children shouted is there a beach too one of the kids cried under all that snow i guess the mother told them so we invited the man and his wife and his four little children to be our guests in the hotel new hampshire even though we were closed for the season its easy to make more pasta its easy to stretch a mussel sauce father got a little confused showing our guests to their rooms it was the first time hed had to show a guest to a room in this hotel new hampshire and it occurred to him as he was hunting for linen in the library that he didnt know where anything was i had to help him naturally and i did a fair job of pretending that i showed guests to their rooms all the time youll have to forgive us if we seem a little unprofessional i told the father of the nice young family when were closed for the season we get a little out of practice its sweet of you to take us in the nice young mother said the kids were disappointed not to see the skiing but theyve never seen an ocean either so its a treat for them and they can get to the skiing tomorrow she added she sounded like a good mother to me im expecting a child myself i told her any day now and only later did susie point out to me that my remark must have seemed odd since even susie was clearly not pregnant what the hell must they have thought you meant you moron susie said but everything was fine the kids had wonderful appetites and after dinner i showed them how to make an apple pie and while the pie was baking i took them for a scary wintry walk down to the snowblown beach and the driftedover docks i showed them the violent waves bashing through the laces of ice that fringed the shore i showed them that the sea in a storm is a great gray swell of water rolling forever rolling my father of course told the young husband and wife from arizona all about the fabulous space for sympathy that a truly great hotel provides he described our hotel to the nice people from arizona susie told me as if he were describing the sacher but its as if we are the sacher to him my warm bear said in my arms that night while the storm howled and the snow fell yes my love i told her it was wonderful to lie in bed in the morning and hear the voices of the children they had discovered the barbells in the ballroom and father was giving them pointers iowa bob would have loved this hotel new hampshire i thought that was when i woke up susie and asked her to get into the bear suit earl she complained im too old to be a bear anymore she is a bit of a bear in the early morningmy dear susie come on susie i said do it for the kids think of what it will mean to them what susie said you want me to scare children no no susie i said not scare them all i wanted her to do was dress up in the bear suit and walk outside in the snow around the hotel and i would suddenly call out look bear tracks in the snow and theyre fresh and the people big and small from arizona would all come out and wonder over the wilderness they had stumbled upon as if in a dream and then i would cry look theres the bear going around the woodpile and susie would pause thereperhaps i could persuade her to give us a good earl or twoand she would disappear behind the woodpile in her bearlike fashion and slip in one of the back doors and slip out of her disguise and come into the kitchen saying whats all this about a bear you rarely see a bear around here anymore you want me to go outside in the fucking snow susie asked for the kids susie i said what a treat it would be for them first they see the ocean and then they see a bear everyone should see a bear susie i said of course she agreed she was grouchy about it but that made her performance all the better susie was always superb as a bear and now she is getting convinced that shes a lovely human being too and so we gave the strangers from arizona a vision of a bear to take away with them father waved goodbye to them from the ballroom after which he said to me a bear huh susie will catch her death or at least pneumonia and no one should be sickno one should even have a coldwhen the baby comes i know more about babies than you do you know a bear he repeated shaking his head but i knew that the people from arizona had been convinced susie the bear is a masterpiece of conviction the bear that paused by the woodpile its breath a fog upon the bright cold morning its paws softly denting the fresh untouched snowas if it were the first bear on earth and this the planets first snowall of it had been convincing as lilly knew everything is a fairy tale so we dream on thus we invent our lives we give ourselves a sainted mother we make our father a hero and someones older brother and someones older sisterthey become our heroes too we invent what we love and what we fear there is always a brave lost brotherand a little lost sister too we dream on and on the best hotel the perfect family the resort life and our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them in the hotel new hampshire were screwed down for lifebut whats a little air in the pipes or even a lot of shit in the hair if you have good memories i hope this is a proper ending for you motherand for you egg it is an ending conscious of the manner of your favorite ending lillythe one you never grew big enough to write there may not be enough barbells in this ending to satisfy iowa bob and not enough fatalism for frank there may not be enough of the nature of dreams in this ending for either father or freud and not enough resilience for franny and i suppose its not ugly enough for susie the bear its probably not big enough for junior jones and i know its not nearly violent enough to please some of the friends and foes from our past it might not merit so much as a moan from screaming anniewherever she lies screaming now but this is what we do we dream on and our dreams escape us almost as vividly as we can imagine them thats what happens like it or not and because thats what happens this is what we need we need a good smart bear some peoples minds are good enough so that they can live all by themselvestheir minds can be their good smart bears thats the case with frank i think frank has a good smart bear for a mind he is not the king of mice i fast mistook him for and franny has a good smart bear named junior jones franny is also skilled at keeping sorrow at bay and my father has his illusions they are powerful enough my fathers illusions are his good smart bearat last and that leaves me of course with susie the bearwith her rape crisis center and my fairytale hotelso im all right too you have to be all right if youre expecting a baby coach bob knew it all along youve got to get obsessed and stay obsessed you have to keep passing the open windows the end
