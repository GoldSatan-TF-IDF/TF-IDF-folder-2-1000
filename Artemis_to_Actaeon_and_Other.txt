to actaeon thou couldst not look on me and live so runs the mortal legend thou that couldst not live nor look on me so the divine decree that sawst me in the cloud the wave the bough the clod commoved with april and the shapes lurking twixt lid and eyeball in the dark mocked i thee not in every guise of life hid in girls eyes a naiad in her well wooed through their laughter and like echo fled luring thee down the primal silences where the heart hushes and the flesh is dumb nay was not i the tide that drew thee out relentlessly from the detaining shore forth from the homelights and the hailing voices forth from the last faint headlands failing line till i enveloped thee from verge to verge and hid thee in the hollow of my being and still because between us hung the veil the myriadtinted veil of sense thy feet refused their rest thy hands the gifts of life thy heart its losses lest some lesser face should blur mine image in thine upturned soul ere death had stamped it there this was thy thought and mine the gods they say have all not so this have they flocks on every hill the blue spirals of incense and the amber drip of lucid honeycomb on sylvan shrines firstchosen weanlings doves immaculate twincooing in the osierplaited cage and ivygarlands glaucous with the dew mans wealth mans servitude but not himself and so they pale for lack of warmth they wane freeze to the marble of their images and pinnacled on mans subserviency through the thick sacrificial haze discern unheeding lives and loves as some cold peak through icy mists may enviously descry warm vales unzoned to the allfruitful sun so they along an immortality of endlessenvistaed homage strain their gaze if haply some rash votary emptyurned but light of foot with alladventuring hand break rank fling past the people and the priest up the last step on to the inmost shrine and there the sacred curtain in his clutch drop dead of seeing while the others prayed yes this we wait for this renews us this incarnates us pale people of your dreams who are but what you make us wood or stone or cold chryselephantine hung with gems or else the beating purpose of your life your sword your clay the note your pipe pursues the face that haunts your pillow or the light scarce visible over leagues of labouring sea o thus through use to reign again to drink the cup of peradventure to the lees for one dear instant disimmortalised in giving immortality so dream the gods upon their listless thrones yet sometimes when the votary appears with deathaffronting forehead and glad eyes too young they rather muse too frail thou art and shall we rob some girl of saffron veil and nuptial garland for so slight a thing and so to their incurious loves return not so with thee for some indeed there are who would behold the truth and then return to pine among the semblances but i divined in thee the questing foot that never revisits the cold hearth of yesterday or calls achievement home i from afar beheld thee fashioned for one hours high use nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop long long hadst thou inhabited my dreams surprising me as harts surprise a pool stealing to drink at midnight i divined thee rash to reach the heart of life and lie bosom to bosom in occasions arms and said because i love thee thou shalt die for immortality is not to range unlimited through vast olympian days or sit in dull dominion over time but this to drink fates utmost at a draught nor feel the wine grow stale upon the lip to scale the summit of some soaring moment nor know the dulness of the long descent to snatch the crown of life and seal it up secure forever in the vaults of death and this was thine to lose thyself in me relive in my renewal and become the light of other lives a quenchless torch passed on from hand to hand till men are dust and the last garland withers from my shrine life nay lift me to thy lips life and once more pour the wild music through me i quivered in the reedbed with my kind rooted in lethebank when at the dawn there came a groping shape of mystery moving among us that with random stroke severed and rapt me from my silent tribe pierced fashioned lipped me sounding for a voice laughing on lethebank and in my throat i felt the wingbeat of the fledgeling notes the bubble of godlike laughter in my throat such little songs she sang pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe they trickled from me like a slender spring that strings frail woodgrowths on its crystal thread nor dreams of glassing cities bearing ships she sang and bore me through the april world matching the birds doubling the insecthum in the meadows under the lowmoving airs and breathings of the scarcearticulate air when it makes mouths of grasses but when the sky burst into storm and took great trees for pipes she thrust me in her breast and warm beneath her cloudy vesture on her terrible heart i shook and heard the battle but more oft those early days we moved in charmed woods where once at dusk she piped against a faun and one warm dawn a tree became a nymph listening and trembled and life laughed and passed and once we came to a great stream that bore the stars upon its bosom like a sea and ships like stars so to the sea we came and there she raised me to her lips and sent one swift pang through me then refrained her hand and whispered hear and into my frail flanks into my bursting veins the whole sea poured its spaces and its thunder and i feared we came to cities and life piped on me low calls to dreaming girls in countinghouse windows through the chink of gold flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth and made the heavy merchant at his desk curse us for a cracked hurdygurdy life mimicked the hurdygurdy and we passed we climbed the slopes of solitude and there life met a god who challenged her and said thy pipe against my lyre but wait she laughed and in my live flank dug a fingerhole and wrung new music from it ah the pain we climbed and climbed and left the god behind we saw the earth spread vaster than the sea with infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow and a silence that was louder than the deep but on the utmost pinnacle life again hid me and i heard the terror in her hair safe in new vales i ached for the old pang and clamoured play me against a god again poor marsyasmortal he shall bleed thee yet she breathed and kissed me stilling the dim need but evermore it woke and stabbed my flank with yearnings for new music and new pain another note against another god i clamoured and she answered bide my time of every heartwound i will make a stop and drink thy life in music pang by pang but first thou must yield the notes i stored in thee at dawn beside the river take my lips she kissed me like a lover but i wept remembering that high song against the god and the old songs slept in me and i was dumb we came to cavernous foul places blind with harpywings and sulphurous with the glare of sinful furnaces where hunger toiled and pleasure gathered in a starveling prey and death fed delicately on young bones now sing cried life and set her lips to me here are gods also wilt thou pipe for dis my cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar choked by the sulphurfumes and beastlipped gods laughed down on me and mouthed the flutes of hell now sing said life reissuing to the stars and wrung a new note from my wounded side so came we to clear spaces and the sea and now i felt its volume in my heart and my heart waxed with it and life played on me the song of the infinite now the stars she said then from the utmost pinnacle again she poured me on the wild sidereal stream and i grew with her great breathings till we swept the interstellar spaces like new worlds loosed from the fiery ruin of a star cold cold we rested on black peaks again under black skies under a groping wind and life grown old hugged me to a numb breast pressing numb lips against me suddenly a blade of silver severed the black peaks from the black sky and earth was born again breathing and various under a gods feet a god a god i felt the heart of life leap under me and my cold flanks shook again he bore no lyre he rang no challenge out but life warmed to him warming me with her and as he neared i felt beneath her hands the stab of a new wound that sucked my soul forth in a new song from my throbbing throat his name his name i whispered but she shed the music faster and i grew with it became a part of it while life and i clung lip to lip and i from her wrung song as she from me one song one ecstasy in indistinguishable union blent till she became the flute and i the player and lo the song i played on her was more than any she had drawn from me it held the stars the peaks the cities and the sea the fauns catch the nymphs tremor and the heart of dreaming girls of toilers at the desk apollos challenge on the sunrise slope and the hiss of the nightgods mouthing flutes of hell all to the dawnwinds whisper in the reeds when life first came a shape of mystery moving among us and with random stroke severed and rapt me from my silent tribe all this i wrung from her in that deep hour while love stood murmuring play the god poor grass now by that hour i am a mate to thee forever life however spent and clogged and tossed back useless to my native mud yea groping for new reeds to fashion thee new instruments of anguish and delight thy hand shall leap to me thy broken reed thine ear remember me thy bosom thrill with the old subjection then when love and i held thee and fashioned thee and made thee dance like a slavegirl to her pipers yea thou yet shalt hear my call and dropping all thy toys thoult lift me to thy lips life and once more pour the wild music through me vesalius in zante see note at end set wide the window let me drink the day i loved light ever light in eye and brain no tapers mirrored in long palace floors nor dedicated depths of silent aisles but just the common dusty windblown day that roofs earths millions o too long i walked in that thricesifted air that princes breathe nor felt the heavenwide jostling of the winds and all the ancient outlawry of earth now let me breathe and see this pilgrimage they call a penance let them call it that i set my face to the east to shrive my soul of mortal sin so be it if my blade once questioned living flesh if once i tore the pages of the book in opening it see what the torn page yielded ere the light had paled its buried characters and judge the girl they brought me pinioned hand and foot in catalepsy say i should have known that trance had not yet darkened into death and held my scalpel well suppose i knew sum up the facts her life against her death her life the scum upon the pools of pleasure breeds such by thousands and her death perchance the obolus to appease the ferrying shade and waft her into immortality think what she purchased with that one heartflutter that whispered its deep secret to my blade for just because her bosom fluttered still it told me more than many rifled graves because i spoke too soon she answered me her vain life ripened to this bud of death as the whole plant is forced into one flower all her blank past a scroll on which god wrote his word of healing so that the poor flesh which spread death living died to purchase life ah no the sin i sinned was mine not theirs not that they sent me forth to wash away none of their tariffed frailties but a deed so far beyond their grasp of good or ill that set to weigh it in the churchs balance scarce would they know which scale to cast it in but i i know i sinned against my will myself my soul the god within the breast can any penance wash such sacrilege when i was young in venice years ago i walked the hospice with a spanish monk a solitary cloistered in high thoughts the great loyola whom i reckoned then a mere refurbisher of faded creeds expert to edge anew the arms of faith as who should say a galenist resolved to hold the walls of dogma against fact experience insight his own self if need be ah how i pitied him mine own eyes set straight in the level beams of truth who groped in errors old deserted catacombs and lit his tapers upon empty graves ay but he held his own the monk more man than any laurelled cripple of the wars charless spent shafts for what he willed he willed as those do that forerun the wheels of fate not take their dust that force the virgin hours hew life into the likeness of themselves and wrest the stars from their concurrences so firm his mould but mine the ductile soul that wears the livery of circumstance and hangs obsequious on its suzerains eye for who rules now the twilightflitting monk or i that took the morning like an alp he held his own i let mine slip from me the birthright that no sovereign can restore and so ironic time beholds us now master and slave he lord of half the earth i ousted from my narrow heritage for theres the sting my kingdom knows me not reach me that folio my usurpers title fallopius reigning vice nay not so successor not usurper i am dead my throne stood empty he was heir to it ay but who hewed his kingdom from the waste cleared inch by inch the acres for his sowing won back for man that ancient fief o the church his body who flung galen from his seat and founded the great dynasty of truth in errors central kingdom ask men that and see their answer just a wondering stare to learn things were not always as they are the very fight forgotten with the fighter already grows the moss upon my grave ay and so meet hold fast to that vesalius they only who reconquer day by day the inch of ground they camped on overnight have right of foothold on this crowded earth i left mine own he seized it with it went my name my fame my very self it seems till i am but the symbol of a man the signboard creaking oer an empty inn he names me true oh give the door its due i entered by only i pray you note had door been none a shoulderthrust of mine had breached the crazy wall he seems to say so meet and yet a word of thanks of praise of recognition that the clue was found seized followed clung to by some hand now dust had this obscured his quartering of my shield how the one weakness stirs again i thought i had done with that old thirst for gratitude that lured me to the desert years ago i did my work and was not that enough no but because the idlers sneered and shrugged the envious whispered the traducers lied and friendship doubted where it should have cheered i flung aside the unfinished task sought praise outside my souls esteem and learned too late that victory like gods kingdom is within nay let the folio rest upon my knee i do not feel its weight ingratitude the hurrying traveller does not ask the name of him who points him on his way and this fallopius sits in the midheart of me because he keeps his eye upon the goal cuts a straight furrow to the end in view cares not who oped the fountain by the way but drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey that was the lesson that ignatius taught the one i might have learned from him but would not that we are but stray atoms on the wind a dancing transiency of summer eves till we become one with our purpose merged in that vast effort of the race which makes mortality immortal he that loseth his life shall find it so the scripture runs but i so hugged the fleeting self in me so loved the lovely perishable hours so kissed myself to death upon their lips that on one pyre we perished in the end a grimmer bonfire than the church eer lit yet all was well or seemed so till i heard that younger voice an echo of my own and like a wanderer turning to his home who finds another on the hearth and learns halfdazed that other is his actual self in name and claim as the whole parish swears so strangely suddenly stood dispossessed of that same self i had sold all to keep a baffled ghost that none would see or hear vesalius whos vesalius this fallopius it is who dragged the galenidol down who rent the veil of flesh and forced a way into the secret fortalice of life yet it was i that bore the brunt of it well better so better awake and live my last brief moment as the man i was than lapse from lifes long lethargy to death without one conscious interval at least i repossess my past am once again no courtier medcining the whims of kings in muffled palacechambers but the free friendless vesalius with his back to the wall and all the world against him o for that best gift of all fallopius take my thanks that and much more at first when padua wrote master fallopius dead resume again the chair even he could not completely fill and see what usury age shall take of youth in honours forfeited why just at first i was quite simply credulously glad to think the old life stood ajar for me like a fond womans unforgetting heart but now that death waylays me now i know this isle is the circumference of my days and i shall die here in a little while so also best fallopius for i see the gods may give anew but not restore and though i think that in my chair again i might have argued my supplanters wrong in this or that this cesalpinus say with all his hotfoot blundering in the dark fabricius with his overcautious clutch on galen systole and diastole of truths mysterious heart yet other ways it may be that this dying serves the cause for truth stays not to build her monument for this or that cooperating hand but props it with her servants failures nay cements its courses with their blood and brains a living substance that shall clinch her walls against the assaults of time already see her scaffold rises on my hidden toil i but the accepted premiss whence must spring the airy structure of her argument nor could the bricks it rests on serve to build the crowning finials i abide her law a different substance for a different end content to know i hold the building up though men agape at dome and pinnacles guess not the whole must crumble like a dream but for that buried labour underneath yet padua i had still my word to say let others say it ah but will they guess just the one word nay truth is manytongued what one man failed to speak another finds another word for may not all converge in some vast utterance of which you and i fallopius were but halting syllables so knowledge come no matter how it comes no matter whence the light falls so it fall truths way not mine that i whose service failed in action yet may make amends in praise fabricius cesalpinus say your word not yours or mine but truths as you receive it you miss a point i saw see others then misread my meaning yet expound your own obscure one space i cleared the sky is wide and you may yet uncover other stars for thus i read the meaning of this end there are two ways of spreading light to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it i let my wick burn out there yet remains to spread an answering surface to the flame that others kindle turn me in my bed the window darkens as the hours swing round but yonder look the other casement glows let me face westward as my sun goes down margaret of cortona fra paolo since they say the end is near and you of all men have the gentlest eyes most like our father francis since you know how i have toiled and prayed and scourged and striven mothered the orphan waked beside the sick gone empty that mine enemy might eat given bread for stones in famine years and channelled with vigilant knees the pavement of this cell till i constrained the christ upon the wall to bend his thorncrowned head in mute forgiveness three times he bowed it but the whole stands writ sealed with the bishops signet as you know once for each person of the blessed three a miracle that the whole town attests the very babes thrust forward for my blessing and either parish plotting for my bones since this you know sit near and bear with me i have lain here these many empty days i thought to pack with credos and hail marys so close that not a fear should force the door but still between the blessed syllables that taper up like blazing angel heads praise over praise to the unutterable strange questions clutch me thrusting fiery arms as though athwart the closemeshed litanies my dead should pluck at me from hell with eyes alive in their obliterated faces i have tried the saints names and our blessed mothers fra paolo i have tried them oer and oer and like a blade bent backward at first thrust they yield and fail me and the questions stay and so i thought into some human heart pure and yet footworn with the tread of sin if only i might creep for sanctuary it might be that those eyes would let me rest fra paolo listen how should i forget the day i saw him first you know the one i had been laughing in the marketplace with others like me i the youngest there jostling about a pack of mountebanks like flies on carrion i the youngest there till darkness fell and while the other girls turned this way that way as perdition beckoned i wondering what the night would bring half hoping if not this once a childs sleep in my garret at least enough to buy that twopronged coral the others covet gainst the evil eye since after all one sees that im the youngest so muttering my litany to hell the only prayer i knew that was not latin felt on my arm a touch as kind as yours and heard a voice as kind as yours say come i turned and went and from that day i never looked on the face of any other man so much is known so much effaced the sin cast like a plaguestruck body to the sea deep deep into the unfathomable pardon the head bowed thrice as the whole town attests what more then to what purpose bear with me it seems that he a stranger in the place first noted me that afternoon and wondered how grew so white a bud in such black slime and why not mine the hand to pluck it out why so christ deals with souls you cry what then not so not so when christ the heavenly gardener plucks flowers for paradise do i not know he snaps the stem above the root and presses the ransomed soul between two convent walls a lifeless blossom in the book of life but when my lover gathered me he lifted stem root and all ay and the clinging mud and set me on his sill to spread and bloom after the common way take sun and rain and make a patch of brightness for the street though raised above rough fingers so you make a weed a flower and others passing think next ditch i cross ill lift a root from it and dress my window and the blessing spreads well so i grew with every root and tendril grappling the secret anchorage of his love and so we loved each other till he died ah that black night he left me that dead dawn i found him lying in the woods alive to gasp my name out and his lifeblood with it as though the murderers knife had probed for me in his hacked breast and found me in each wound well it was there christ came to me you know and led me home just as that other led me just as that other father bear with me my lovers death they tell me saved my soul and i have lived to be a light to men and gather sinners to the knees of grace all this you say the bishops signet covers but stay suppose my lover had not died at last my question father help me face it i say suppose my lover had not died think you i ever would have left him living even to be christs blessed margaret we lived in sin why to the sin i died to that other was as paradise when god walks there at eventide the air pure gold and angels treading all the grass to flowers he was my christ he led me out of hell he died to save me so your casuists say could christ do more your christ outpity mine why yours but let the sinner bathe his feet mine raised her to the level of his heart and then christs way is saving as mans way is squandering and the devil take the shards but this man kept for sacramental use the cup that once had slaked a passing thirst this man declared the same clay serves to model a devil or a saint the scribe may stain the same fair parchment with obscenities or gild with benedictions nay he cried because a satyr feasted in this wood and fouled the grasses with carousing foot shall not a hermit build his chapel here and cleanse the echoes with his litanies the sodden grasses spring again why not the trampled soul is man less merciful than nature good more fugitive than grass and so if after all he had not died and suddenly that door should know his hand and with that voice as kind as yours he said come margaret forth into the sun again back to the life we fashioned with our hands out of old sins and follies fragments scorned of more ambitious builders yet by love the patient architect so shaped and fitted that not a crevice let the winter in think you my bones would not arise and walk this bruised body as once the bruised soul turn from the wonders of the seventh heaven as from the antics of the marketplace if this could be as i so oft have dreamed i who have known both loves divine and human think you i would not leave this christ for that i rave you say you start from me fra paolo go then your going leaves me not alone i marvel rather that i feared the question since now i name it it draws near to me with such dear reassurance in its eyes and takes your place beside me nay i tell you fra paolo i have cried on all the saints if this be devils prompting let them drown it in alleluias yet not one replies and for the christ there is he silent too your christ poor father you that have but one and that one silent how i pity you he will not answer will not help you cast the devil out but hangs there on the wall blind wood and bone how if i call on him i whom he talks with as the town attests if ever prayer hath ravished me so high that its wings failed and dropped me in thy breast christ i adjure thee by that naked hour of innermost commixture when my soul contained thee as the paten holds the host judge thou alone between this priest and me nay rather lord between my past and present thy margaret and that others whose she is by right of salvage and whose call should follow thine silent still or his who stooped to her and drew her to thee by the bands of love not thine then his ah christ the thorncrowned head bends bends again down on your knees fra paolo if his then thine kneel priest for this is heaven a torchbearer great cities rise and have their fall the brass that held their glories moulders in its turn hard granite rots like an uprooted weed and ever on the palimpsest of earth impatient time rubs out the word he writ but one thing makes the years its pedestal springs from the ashes of its pyre and claps a skyward wing above its epitaph the will of man willing immortal things the ages are but baubles hung upon the thread of some strong lives and one slight wrist may lift a century above the dust for time the sisyphean load of little lives becomes the globe and sceptre of the great but who are these that linking hand in hand transmit across the twilight waste of years the flying brightness of a kindled hour not always nor alone the lives that search how they may snatch a glory out of heaven or add a height to babel oftener they that in the still fulfilment of each days pacific order hold great deeds in leash that in the sober sheath of tranquil tasks hide the attempered blade of high emprise and leap like lightning to the clap of fate so greatly gave he nurturing gainst the call of one rare moment all the daily store of joy distilled from the acquitted task and that deliberate rashness which bespeaks the pondered action passed into the blood so swift to harden purpose into deed that with the wind of ruin in his hair soul sprang fullstatured from the broken flesh and at one stroke he lived the whole of life poured all in one libation to the truth a brimming flood whose drops shall overflow on deserts of the soul long beaten down by the brute hoof of habit till they spring in manifold upheaval to the sun call here no high artificer to raise his wordy monument such lives as these make death a dull misnomer and its pomp an empty vesture let resounding lives reecho splendidly through highpiled vaults and make the grave their spokesman such as he are as the hidden streams that underground sweeten the pastures for the grazing kine or as spring airs that bring through prison bars the scent of freedom or a light that burns immutably across the shaken seas forevermore by nameless hands renewed where else were darkness and a glutted shore ii the mortal lease i because the currents of our love are poured through the slow welter of the primal flood from some blind source of monsterhaunted mud and flung together by random forces stored ere the vast void with rushing worlds was scored because we know ourselves but the dim scud tossed from their heedless keels the seablown bud that wastes and scatters ere the wave has roared because we have this knowledge in our veins shall we deny the journeys gathered lore the great refusals and the long disdains the stubborn questing for a phantom shore the sleepless hopes and memorable pains and all mortalitys immortal gains ii because our kiss is as the moon to draw the mounting waters of that redlit sea that circles brain with sense and bids us be the playthings of an elemental law shall we forego the deeper touch of awe on loves extremest pinnacle where we winging the vistas of infinity gigantic on the mist our shadows saw shall kinship with the dim firstmoving clod not draw the folded pinion from the soul and shall we not by spirals visiontrod reach upward to some stillretreating goal as earth escaping from the nights control drinks at the founts of morning like a god iii all all is sweet in that commingled draught mysterious that life pours for lovers thirst and i would meet your passion as the first wild woodland woman met her captors craft or as the greek whose fearless beauty laughed and doffed her raiment by the attic flood but in the streams of my belated blood flow all the warring potions love has quaffed how can i be to you the nymph who danced smooth by ilissus as the planetrees bole or how the nereid whose drenched lashes glanced like seaflowers through the summer seas long roll i that have also been the nun entranced who nightlong held her bridegroom in her soul iv sad immortality is dead you say and all her grey brood banished from the soul life like the earth is now a rounded whole the orb of mans dominion live today and every sense in me leapt to obey seeing the routed phantoms backward roll but from their waning throng a whisper stole and touched the morning splendour with decay sad immortality is dead and we the funeral train that bear her to her grave yet hath she left a twofaced progeny in hearts of men and some will always see the skull beneath the wreath yet always crave in every kiss the folded kiss to be v yet for one rounded moment i will be no more to you than what my lips may give and in the circle of your kisses live as in some island of a stormblown sea where the cold surges of infinity upon the outward reefs unheeded grieve and the loud murmur of our blood shall weave primeval silences round you and me if in that moment we are all we are we live enough let this for all requite do i not know some winged things from far are borne along illimitable night to dance their lives out in a single flight between the moonrise and the setting star vi the moment came with sacramental cup lifted and all the vault of life grew bright with tides of incommensurable light but tremblingly i turned and covered up my face before the wonder down the slope i heard her feet in irretrievable flight and when i looked again my stricken sight saw night and rain in a dead world agrope now walks her ghost beside me whispering with lips derisive thou that wouldst forego what god assured thee that the cup i bring globes not in every drop the cosmic show all that the insatiate heart of man can wring from lifes long vintage now thou shalt not know vii shall i not know i that could always catch the sunrise in one beam along the wall the nests of june in aprils mating call and ruinous autumn in the winds first snatch at summers green impenetrable thatch that always knew far off the secret fall of a gods feet across the citys brawl the touch of silent fingers on my latch not thou vain moment something more than thou shall write the score of what mine eyes have wept the touch of kisses that have missed my brow the murmur of wings that brushed me while i slept and some mute angel in the breast even now measures my loss by all that i have kept viii strive we no more some hearts are like the bright treechequered spaces flecked with sun and shade where gathered in old days the youth and maid to woo and weave their dances with the night they cease their flutings and the next days light finds the smooth green unconscious of their tread and ready its velvet pliancies to spread under fresh feet till these in turn take flight but other hearts a long long road doth span from some far region of old works and wars and the weary armies of the thoughts of man have trampled it and furrowed it with scars and sometimes husht a sacred caravan moves over it alone beneath the stars experience i like crusoe with the bootless gold we stand upon the desert verge of death and say what shall avail the woes of yesterday to buy tomorrows wisdom in the land whose currency is strange unto our hand in lifes small market they had served to pay some latefound rapture could we but delay till time hath matched our means to our demand but otherwise fate wills it for behold our gathered strength of individual pain when times long alchemy hath made it gold dies with us hoarded all these years in vain since those that might be heir to it the mould renew and coin themselves new griefs again ii o death we come fullhanded to thy gate rich with strange burden of the mingled years gains and renunciations mirth and tears and loves oblivion and remembering hate nor know we what compulsion laid such freight upon our souls and shall our hopes and fears buy nothing of thee death behold our wares and sell us the one joy for which we wait had we lived longer life had such for sale with the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap but now we stand before thy shadowy pale and all our longings lie within thy keep death can it be the years shall naught avail not so death answered they shall purchase sleep grief i on immemorial altitudes august grief holds her high dominion bold the feet that climb unblenching to that stern retreat whence looking down man knows himself but dust there lie the mightiest passions earthward thrust beneath her regnant footstool and there meet pale ghosts of buried longings that were sweet with many an abdicated shall and must for there she rules omnipotent whose will compels a mute acceptance of her chart who holds the world and lo it cannot fill her mighty hand who will be served apart with uncommunicable rites and still surrender of the undivided heart ii she holds the world within her mighty hand and lo it is a toy for babes to toss and all its shining imagery but dross to those that in her awful presence stand as sunconfronting eagles oer the land that lies below they send their gaze across the common intervals of gain and loss and hopes infinitude without a strand but he who on that lonely eminence watches too long the whirling of the spheres through dim eternities descending thence the voices of his kind no longer hears and blinded by the spectacle immense journeys alone through all the after years chartres i immense august like some titanic bloom the mighty choir unfolds its lithic core petalled with panes of azure gules and or splendidly lambent in the gothic gloom and stamened with keen flamelets that illume the pale highaltar on the prayerworn floor by worshippers innumerous thronged of yore a few brown crones familiars of the tomb the stranded driftwood of faiths ebbing sea for these alone the finials fret the skies the topmost bosses shake their blossoms free while from the triple portals with grave eyes tranquil and fixed upon eternity the cloud of witnesses still testifies ii the crimson panes like blooddrops stigmatise the western floor the aisles are mute and cold a rigid fetich in her robe of gold the virgin of the pillar with blank eyes enthroned beneath her votive canopies gathers a meagre remnant to her fold the rest is solitude the church grown old stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies wellnigh again its mighty framework grows to be a part of natures self withdrawn from hot humanitys impatient woes the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn and in the east one giant window shows the roseate coldness of an alp at dawn two backgrounds i la vierge au donateur here by the ample rivers argent sweep bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls a towercrowned cybele in armoured sleep the city lies fat plenty in her halls with calm parochial spires that hold in fee the friendly gables clustered at their base and equipoised oer tower and marketplace the gothic ministers winged immensity and in that narrow burgh with equal mood two placid hearts to all lifes good resigned might from the altar to the lychgate find long years of peace and dreamless plenitude ii mona lisa yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep no mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed dreams and illusions beacon from its keep but at the gate an angel bares his blade and tales are told of those who thought to gain at dawn its ramparts but when evening fell far off they saw each fading pinnacle lit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain yet there two souls whom lifes perversities had mocked with want in plenty tears in mirth might meet in dreams ungarmented of earth and drain joys awful chalice to the lees the tomb of ilaria giunigi ilaria thou that wert so fair and dear that death would fain disown thee grief made wise with prophecy thy husbands widowed eyes and bade him call the masters art to rear thy perfect image on the sculptured bier with dreaming lids hands laid in peaceful guise beneath the breast that seems to fall and rise and lips that at loves call should answer here firstborn of the renascence when thy soul cast the sweet robing of the flesh aside into these lovelier marble limbs it stole regenerate in arts sunrise clear and wide as saints who having kept faiths raiment whole change it above for garments glorified the one grief one grief there is the helpmeet of my heart that shall not from me till my days be sped that walks beside me in sunshine and in shade and hath in all my fortunes equal part at first i feared it and would often start aghast to find it bending oer my bed till usage slowly dulled the edge of dread and one cold night i cried how warm thou art since then we two have travelled hand in hand and lo my grief has been interpreter for me in many a fierce and alien land whose speech young joy had failed to understand plucking me tribute of red gold and myrrh from desolate whirlings of the desert sand the eumenides think you we slept within the delphic bower what time our victim sought apollos grace nay drawn into ourselves in that deep place where good and evil meet we bode our hour for not inexorable is our power and we are hunted of the prey we chase soonest gain ground on them that flee apace and draw temerity from hearts that cower shuddering we gather in the house of ruth and on the fearful turn a face of fear but they to whom the ways of doom are clear not vainly named us the eumenides our feet are faithful in the paths of truth and in the constant heart we house at peace iii orpheus love will make men dare to die for their beloved of this alcestis is a monument for she was willing to lay down her life for her husband and so noble did this appear to the gods that they granted her the privilege of returning to earth but orpheus the son of oeagrus they sent empty away plato the symposium orpheus the harper coming to the gate where the implacable dim warder sate besought for parley with a shade within dearer to him than life itself had been sweeter than sunlight on illyrian sea or bloom of myrtle or murmur of laden bee whom lately from his unconsenting breast the fates at some capricious blind behest intolerably had reft eurydice dear to the sunlight as illyrian sea sweet as the murmur of bees or myrtle bloom and uncompanioned led her to the tomb there solitary by the stygian tide strayed her dear feet the shadow of his own since mid the desolate millions who have died each phantom walks its crowded path alone and there her head that slept upon his breast no more had such sweet harbour for its rest nor her swift ear from those disvoiced throats could catch one echo of his living notes and dreaming nightly of her pallid doom no solace had he of his own young bloom but yearned to pour his blood into her veins and buy her back with unimagined pains to whom the shepherd of the shadows said yea many thus would bargain for their dead but when they hear my fatal gateway clang life quivers in them with a last sweet pang they see the smoke of home above the trees the cordage whistles on the harbour breeze the beaten path that wanders to the shore grows dear because they shall not tread it more the dog that drowsing on their threshold lies looks at them with their childhood in his eyes and in the sunsets melancholy fall they read a sunrise that shall give them all not thus am i the harper smiled his scorn i see no path but those her feet have worn my rooftree is the shadow of her hair and the light breaking through her long despair the only sunrise that mine eyelids crave for doubly dead without me in the grave is she who if my feet had gone before had found life dark as deaths abhorred shore the gate clanged on him and he went his way amid the alien millions mute and grey swept like a cold mist down an unlit strand where nameless wreckage gluts the stealthy sand drift of the cockleshells of hope and faith wherein they foundered on the rock of death so came he to the image that he sought less living than her semblance in his thought who at the summons of his thrilling notes drew back to life as a drowned creature floats back to the surface yet no less is dead and cold fear smote him till she spoke and said art thou then come to lay thy lips on mine and pour thy lifes libation out like wine shall i through thee revisit earth again traverse the shining sea the fruitful plain behold the house we dwelt in lay my head upon the happy pillows of our bed and feel in dreams the pressure of thine arms kindle these pulses that no memory warms nay give me for a space upon thy breast deaths shadowy substitute for rapture rest then join again the joyous living throng and give me life but give it in thy song for only they that die themselves may give life to the dead and i would have thee live fear seized him closer than her arms but he answered not so for thou shalt come with me i sought thee not that we should part again but that fresh joy should bud from the old pain and the gods if grudgingly their gifts they make yield all to them that without asking take the gods she said so runs lifes ancient lore yield all man takes but always claim their score the iron wings of the eumenides when heard far off seem but a summer breeze but me thoult have alive on earth again only by paying here my meed of pain then lay on my cold lips the tender ghost of the dear kiss that used to warm them most take from my frozen hands thy hands of fire and of my heartstrings make thee a new lyre that in thy music men may find my voice and something of me still on earth rejoice shuddering he heard her but with closeflung arm swept her resisting through the ghostly swarm swift hide thee neath my cloak that we may glide past the dim warder as the gate swings wide he whirled her with him lighter than a leaf unwittingly whirled onward by a brief autumnal eddy but when the fatal door suddenly yielded him to life once more and issuing to the allconsoling skies he turned to seek the sunlight in her eyes he clutched at emptiness she was not there and the dim warder answered to his prayer only once have i seen the wonder wrought but when alcestis thus her master sought living she sought him not nor dreamed that fate for any subterfuge would swing my gate loving she gave herself to livid death joyous she bought his respite with her breath came not embodied but a tenuous shade in whom her rapture a great radiance made for never saw i ghost upon this shore shine with such living ecstasy before nor heard an exile from the light above hail me with smiles thou art not death but love but when the gods frustrated this beheld how living still among the dead she dwelled because she lived in him whose life she won and her blood beat in his beneath the sun they reasoned when the bitter stygian wave the sweetness of loves kisses cannot lave when the pale flood of lethe washes not from mortal mind one high immortal thought akin to us the earthly creature grows since nature suffers only what it knows if she whom we to this grey desert banned still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land that for his sake she left without a tear set wide the gates her being is not here so ruled the gods but thou that soughtst to give thy life for love yet for thyself wouldst live they know not for their kin but back to earth give pitying one that is of mortal birth humbled the harper heard and turned away mounting alone to the empoverished day yet as he left the stygian shades behind he heard the cordage on the harbour wind saw the blue smoke above the homestead trees and in his hidden heart was glad of these an autumn sunset i leaguered in fire the wild black promontories of the coast extend their savage silhouettes the sun in universal carnage sets and halting higher the motionless stormclouds mass their sullen threats like an advancing mob in swordpoints penned that balked yet stands at bay midzenith hangs the fascinated day in windlustrated hollows crystalline a wan valkyrie whose wide pinions shine across the ensanguined ruins of the fray and in her hand swings high oerhead above the waste of war the silver torchlight of the evening star wherewith to search the faces of the dead ii lagooned in gold seem not those jetty promontories rather the outposts of some ancient land forlorn uncomforted of morn where old oblivions gather the melancholy unconsoling fold of all things that go utterly to death and mix no more no more with lifes perpetually awakening breath shall time not ferry me to such a shore over such sailless seas to walk with hopes slain importunities in miserable marriage nay shall not all things be there forgot save the seas golden barrier and the black closecrouching promontories dead to all shames forgotten of all glories shall i not wander there a shadows shade a spectre selfdestroyed so purged of all remembrance and sucked back into the primal void that should we on that shore phantasmal meet i should not know the coming of your feet moonrise over tyringham now the high holocaust of hours is done and all the west empurpled with their death how swift oblivion drinks the fallen sun how little while the dusk remembereth though some there were proud hours that marched in mail and took the morning on auspicious crest crying to fortune back for i prevail yet now they lie disfeatured with the rest and some that stole so soft on destiny methought they had surprised her to a smile but these fled frozen when she turned to see and moaned and muttered through my heart awhile but now the day is emptied of them all and night absorbs their lifeblood at a draught and so my life lies as the gods let fall an empty cup from which their lips have quaffed yet see night is not by translucent ways up the grey void of autumn afternoon steals a mild crescent charioted in haze and all the air is merciful as june the lake is a forgotten streak of day that trembles through the hemlocks darkling bars and still my heart still some divine delay upon the threshold holds the earliest stars o pale equivocal hour whose suppliant feet haunt the mute reaches of the sleeping wind art thou a watcher stealing to entreat prayer and sepulture for thy fallen kind poor plaintive waif of a predestined race their ruin gapes for thee why linger here go hence in silence veil thine orphaned face lest i should look on it and call it dear for if i love thee thou wilt sooner die some sudden ruin will plunge upon thy head midnight will fall from the revengeful sky and hurl thee down among thy shuddering dead avert thine eyes lapse softly from my sight call not my name nor heed if thine i crave so shalt thou sink through mitigated night and bathe thee in the alleffacing wave but upward still thy perilous footsteps fare along a highhung heaven drenched in light dilating on a tide of crystal air that floods the dark hills to their utmost height strange hour is this thy waning face that leans out of midheaven and makes my soul its glass what victory is imaged there what means thy tarrying smile oh veil thy lips and pass nay pause and let me name thee for i see o with what flooding ecstasy of light strange hour that wilt not loose thy hold on me thourt not days latest but the first of night and after thee the goldfoot stars come thick from hand to hand they toss the flying fire till all the zenith with their dance is quick about the wheeling music of the lyre dread hour that leadst the immemorial round with lifted torch revealing one by one the thronging splendours that the day held bound and how each blue abyss enshrines its sun be thou the image of a thought that fares forth from itself and flings its ray ahead leaping the barriers of ephemeral cares to where our lives are but the ages tread and let this year be not the last of youth but first like thee of some new train of hours if more remote from hope yet nearer truth and kin to the unpetitionable powers all souls i a thin moon faints in the sky oerhead and dumb in the churchyard lie the dead walk we not sweet by garden ways where the late rose hangs and the phlox delays but forth of the gate and down the road past the church and the yews to their dim abode for its turn of the year and all souls night when the dead can hear and the dead have sight ii fear not that sound like wind in the trees it is only their call that comes on the breeze fear not the shudder that seems to pass it is only the tread of their feet on the grass fear not the drip of the bough as you stoop it is only the touch of their hands that grope for the years on the turn and its all souls night when the dead can yearn and the dead can smite iii and where should a man bring his sweet to woo but here where such hundreds were lovers too where lie the dead lips that thirst to kiss the empty hands that their fellows miss where the maid and her lover from sere to green sleep bed by bed with the worm between for its turn of the year and all souls night when the dead can hear and the dead have sight iv and now they rise and walk in the cold let us warm their blood and give youth to the old let them see us and hear us and say ah thus in the prime of the year it went with us till their lips drawn close and so long unkist forget they are mist that mingles with mist for the years on the turn and its all souls night when the dead can burn and the dead can smite v till they say as they hear us poor dead poor dead just an hour of this and our agelong bed just a thrill of the old remembered pains to kindle a flame in our frozen veins a touch and a sight and a floating apart as the chill of dawn strikes each phantom heart for its turn of the year and all souls night when the dead can hear and the dead have sight vi and where should the living feel alive but here in this wan white humming hive as the moon wastes down and the dawn turns cold and one by one they creep back to the fold and where should a man hold his mate and say one more one more ere we go their way for the years on the turn and its all souls night when the living can learn by the churchyard light vii and how should we break faith who have seen those dead lips plight with the mist between and how forget who have seen how soon they lie thus chambered and cold to the moon how scorn how hate how strive wee too who must do so soon as those others do for its all souls night and break of the day and behold with the light the dead are away all saints all so grave and shining see they come from the blissful ranks of the forgiven though so distant wheels the nearest crystal dome and the spheres are seven are you in such haste to come to earth shining ones the wonder on your brow to the low poor places of your birth and the day that must be darkness now does the heart still crave the spot it yearned on in the grey and mortal years the pure flame the smoky hearth it burned on the clear eye its tears was there in the narrow range of living after all the wider scope in the old old rapture of forgiving in the long long flight of hope come you from free sweep across the spaces to the irksome bounds of mortal law from the allembracing vision to some faces look that never saw never we imprisoned here had sought you lured you with the ancient bait of pain down the silver current of the lightyears brought you to the beaten round again is it you perchance who ache to strain us dumbly to the dim transfigured breast or with tragic gesture would detain us from the agelong search for rest is the labour then more glorious than the laurel the learning than the conquered thought is the meed of men the righteous quarrel not the justice wrought long ago we guessed it faithful ghosts proudly chose the present for our scene and sent out indomitable hosts day by day to widen our demesne sit you by our hearthstone lone immortals share again the bitter wine of life well we know beyond the peaceful portals there is nothing better than our strife nought more thrilling than the cry that calls us spent and stumbling to the conflict vain after each disaster that befalls us nerves us for a sterner strain and when flood or foeman shakes the sleeper in his moments lapse from pain bids us fold our tents and flee our kin and deeper drive into the wilderness again the old pole star before the clepsydra had bound the days man tethered change to his fixed star and said the elder races that long since are dead marched by that light it swerves not from its base though all the worlds about it wax and fade when egypt saw it fast in reeling spheres her pyramids shaftcentred on its ray she reared and said long as this star holds sway in uninvaded ether shall the years revere my monuments and went her way the pyramids abide but through the shaft that held the polar pivot eye to eye look now blank nothingness as though change laughed at mans presumption and his puny craft the star has slipped its leash and roams the sky yet could the immemorial piles be swung a skyey hairsbreadth from their rooted base back to the central anchorage of space ah then again as when the race was young should they behold the beacon of the race of old men said the truth is there we rear our faith fullcentred on it it was known thus of the elders who foreran us here mapped out its circuit in the shifting sphere and found it mid mutation fixed alone change laughs again again the sky is cold and down that fissure now no starbeam glides yet they whose sweep of vision grows not old still at the central point of space behold another polestar for the truth abides a grave though life should come with all its marshalled honours trump and drum to proffer you the captaincy of some resounding exploit that shall fill mans pulses with commemorative thrill and be a banner to far battle days for truths unrisen upon untrod ways what would your answer be o heart once brave seek otherwhere for me i watch beside a grave though to some shining festival of thought the sages call you from steep citadel of bastioned argument whose rampart gained yields the pure vision passionately sought in dreams known well but never yet in wakefulness attained how should you answer to their summons save i watch beside a grave though beauty from her fane within the soul of firetongued seers descending or from the dreamlit temples of the past with feet immortal wending illuminate griefs antre swart and vast with halfveiled face that promises the whole to him who holds her fast what answer could you give sight of one face i crave one only while i live woo elsewhere for i watch beside a grave though love of the one heart that loves you best a stormtossed messenger should beat its wings for shelter in your breast where clung its last years nest the nest you built together and made fast lest envious winds should stir and winged each delicate thought to minister with sweetness faramassed to the young dreams within what answer could it win the nest was whelmed in sorrows rising wave nor could i reach one drowning dream to save i watch beside a grave non dolet age after age the fruit of knowledge falls to ashes on mens lips love fails faith sickens like a dying tree life sheds its dreams that no new spring recalls the longedfor ships come empty home or founder on the deep and eyes first lose their tears and then their sleep so weary a world it lies forlorn of day and yet not wholly dark since evermore some soul that missed the mark calls back to those agrope in the mad maze of hope courage my brothers i have found the way the day is lost what then what though the straggling rearguard of the fight be whelmed in fear and night and the flying scouts proclaim that death has gripped the van ever the heart of man cheers on the hearts of men it hurts not dying cried the roman wife and one by one the leaders in the strife fall on the blade of failure and exclaim the day is won a huntingsong hunters where does hope nest not in the halfoped breast nor the young rose nor april sunrise those with a quick wing she brushes the wide world through greets with the throat of thrushes fades from as fast as dew but would you spy her sleeping cradled warm look in the breast of weeping the tree stript by storm but would you bind her fast yours at last bedmate and lover gain the last headland bare that the cold tides cover there may you capture her there where the sea gives to the ground only the drift of the drowned yet if she slips you once found push to her uttermost lair in the low house of despair there will she watch by your head sing to you till you be dead then with your child in her breast in another heart build a new nest survival when you and i like all things kind or cruel the garnered days and light evasive hours are gone again to be a part of flowers and tears and tides in lifes divine renewal if some grey eve to certain eyes should wear a deeper radiance than mere light can give some silent page abruptly flush and live may it not be that you and i are there uses ah from the niggard tree of time how quickly fall the hours it needs no touch of wind or rime to loose such facile flowers drift of the dead years harvesting they clog tomorrows way yet serve to shelter growths of spring beneath their warm decay or blent by pious hands with rare sweet savours of content surprise the souls december air with junes forgotten scent a meeting on a sheer peak of joy we meet below us hums the abyss death either way allures our feet if we take one step amiss one moment let us drink the blue transcendent air together then down where the same old works to do in the same dull daily weather we may not wait yet look below how part on this keen ridge but one may pass they call you go my life shall be your bridge note vesalius the great anatomist studied at louvain and paris and was called by venice to the chair of surgery in the university of padua he was one of the first physiologists to dissect the human body and his great work the structure of the human body was an open attack on the physiology of galen the book excited such violent opposition not only in the church but in the university that in a fit of discouragement he burned his remaining manuscripts and accepted the post of physician at the court of charles v and afterward of his son philip ii of spain this closed his life of free enquiry for the inquisition forbade all scientific research and the dissection of corpses was prohibited in spain vesalius led for many years the life of the rich and successful court physician but regrets for his past were never wholly extinguished and in they were roused afresh by the reading of an anatomical treatise by gabriel fallopius his successor in the chair at padua from that moment life in spain became intolerable to vesalius and in he set out for the east tradition reports that this journey was a penance to which the church condemned him for having opened the body of a woman before she was actually dead but more probably vesalius sick of his long servitude made the pilgrimage a pretext to escape from spain fallopius had meanwhile died and the venetian senate is said to have offered vesalius his old chair but on the way home from jerusalem he was seized with illness and died at zante in
