the fabric of sin the ninth book in the merrily watkins series a novel by phil rickman shapen of clay and kneaded with water a bedrock of shame and a source of pollution a cauldron of iniquity and a fabric of sin what can i say that hath not been foreknown or what disclose that hath not been foretold the essenes poems of initiation part one do i believe in ghosts i answer that i am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me m r james introduction to his complete ghost stories third hill although the countryside around the barn was open and level three landmark hills were laid out along the horizon like ancient and venerated body parts merrily thought the bones of the border holy relics on display in the sunset glow standing at the barn window with adam eastgate she tracked them right to left from the southern end of the black mountains the volcaniclooking sugar loaf and the ruined profile of the skirrid which legend said had cracked open when jesus christ died on the cross still somehow sacred these hills no towns crowded them nobody messed with them at least not the way someone had with the third and lowest hill the only one this side of the welsh border but still maybe a dozen miles away the third hill had been stabbed under its summit some kind of radio mast sticking out like a spear from the spine of a fallen warrior a torn and bloody pennant of cloud flurrying horizontally from its shaft oh merrily said realizing right they say its like another country up there garway the light through the window was this deep fruity pink the sun dying somewhere behind the hill with its radio mast its famously enigmatic church and a farmhouse called the master house that they were saying was haunted adam eastgate had been aiming a forefinger like he wanted to stab the hill himself again and again sighing he let his hand fall we dont often make mistakes merrily shed never actually been to garway hill nor before today to this place either a tidy cluster of converted farm buildings off a deadend country lane maybe three miles outside the city pieces of herefordshire adding up to more than twelve thousand acres were administered from here on behalf of perhaps the most prestigious landlord in the country and she hadnt even heard of it all the stuff you ought to know about and didnt sometimes this county could be just a little too discreet all a bit awkward merrily turned away from the window and the hills jane and i my daughter we keep planning to go over to garway check out the knights templar church somehow never seem to find the time aye we saw it with the man when he came to inspect the farm likes a quiet stroll when he can and of course its always so quiet there nobody noticed us even when adam eastgate slipping her a cautious glance why are you smiling you might not have seen a soul but itd be all over the hill before he was back in his land rover merrily looked down at the outline plans on the conference table they were blurred she rubbed her eyes he inspects every property you take on personally aw hey hes not just a figurehead the brackeny accent digging in northumbria in his dry soldierly way adam eastgate was affronted very protective of the man the people working here does he know about this particular problem then eastgate didnt reply which could have meant yes or no or not something youre supposed to ask ok then merrily sat down in one of the highbacked chairs red brocade what specifically are we looking at oh hell i cant tell you perhaps i wasnt listening hard enough yknow or you find it embarrassing not a question of embarrassment merrily im just not the man it happened to if anything did always the getout clause how would you like me to play it then how would you normally play it well dear god how long was this going to take to begin with we usually try to find out if theres a backstory talk to local people village historian theres always a village historian or maybe she clocked his wince that would be the wrong approach would it depends if you want it on american tv before the weeks out seriously merrily tight smile im the landsteward deal with builders architects and tenants right most of whom good as gold but we know if were forced to evict somebody who hasnt parted with the rent for two years next days tabloids were halfexpecting prince puts family on the street oh you see where were going haunted prince calls in exorcist eastgate shuddered nice chap adam the bishop had said knows what he wants and how to get it done but raising this had taken the best part of half an hour and three false starts this had been two nights ago one of those receptions where the duchy was explaining its ambitious conservation plans to the great and the good of hereford the bishop and the archdeacon and their wives were having a drink afterwards with adam eastgate when the garway investment had come up and its complications you could imagine the bishop nodding helpfully we do have a person you know looks after this kind of thing i mean youllve read the stuff same as i have eastgate said he only has to venture an offthecuff opinion on whatever it is architecture alternative medicine gm foods the benefits of talking to plants see there you go thats exactly it how many years ago was that but do they ever forget well no this was the nations last bit of official glitter a face from commemorative investiture plaques royal wedding mugs on your grans dresser merrily feeling slightly ashamed that although shed known it was most unlikely that the man would be here today she was wearing her best coat her mother would have agonized changing tops changing shoes inspecting her hair many times in the car mirror just in case who is it safe to talk to then whos actually living in the house well nobody im trying to explain this came from the builder canny fella normally or so i thought till hes ringing us up adam man i think youre going to have to find somebody else for this one im going what eastgate walked to the darkening window glanced out briefly unseeing turned and came back were good employers merrily in some ways the best never short of tenders and once theyre allocated we dont get jobs chucked back at us doesnt happen merrily nodding theyd be a fairly significant name on a builders cv but it worked both ways eastgate said this builder had a rare feel for an old property and the master house itself see normally were not interested in anything less than about two hundred acres and this is what ninetyfive but its a forgotten bit of old england right down there on the very edge of wales not much you find these days completely unrestored hardly touched in over a century we get to tease out the past plus im thinking craft workshops in the barns the stables the granary a little working community new economic life and green very green woodburners rainwater tanks sheepswool insulation oh he loves all that doesnt he the man its his number one and it influences us all naturally eastgate shook his head im going come on felix what is this really about you sick domestic problems adam he says to us maybe this is an old place that doesnt want to be restored his words hostile that was another one of his team had a powerful feeling they were not wanted he pulled out of the whole project because one person thought he its a she merrily oh the sun had gone leaving a raspberry hue on the room but you could still make out the shapes of the fields and the fuzz of hedgerows on the side of garway hill im going to leave it in your hands all right eastgate gathered up the plans into a black cardboard folder you take these theyre only copies see what hes putting in jeopardy the bottom line being youd like him back on the job asap only if hes normal look if you want to ask a few questions locally go ahead weve nothing to hide bought in good faith and what we have in mind is going to be good for the community id just say exercise a bit more discretion than usual merrily nodded my watchword adam she had a headache they walked into the forecourt deeply shadowed now not quite six and everyone seemed to have gone home maybe adam eastgate had timed their meeting for the tailend of the working day so he wouldnt have to explain any of this to the staff all the leaves were still on the trees and it was still warm too warm a long flooded summer and the planet in the condemned cell at least the nights were drawing in now the tindery musk of autumn on the air as eastgate walked with merrily to the old volvo it had been nicked last summer in the dark obviously and then swiftly abandoned presumably after theyd heard the engine so just to get this right what exactly will you do at the house merrily to ah depends what it is you work on your own i like to think not she smiled wearily he didnt get it ok there are a few advisers i can call on if necessary usually when there are people involved who might have particular problems psychological psychiatric when youre looking at an empty that is a house not lived in as such oh the way you shaped and trimmed your glossary of terms when addressing ingrained scepticism adam eastgate cleared his throat only i didnt think youd be so small female i was going to say matteroffact about it meaning like its real i dont do it all the time theres also a parish weddings funerals rows with the churchwardens i suppose medieval was the word i was groping for im medieval she looked up at him through the fastthickening air youre working for an institution dating back if ive got this right to thirteen thirtyseven duchy was created by edward iii to provide an income for his son the prince of wales the kings father having been the first to hold the title well the first englishman and by that you mean what exactly merrily well they flinching at the sharpness of eastgates glance they had their own didnt they the welsh for a long time and even after the princes of wales had become english there was owain glyndwr in the fifteenth century still trying to get it back but maybe mentioning this would not be very tactful not my subject welsh history thank god eastgate straightened up anyway youll keep us up to speed i hope obviously tell you what i can without you know breaking any confidences that might arise not that this was likely it didnt seem to be any more than what huw owen would call a volatile or a delinquent the wonky fuse box the dripping tap deliverancelite merrily unlocked the car its an empty house if anythings happening nobody has to live with it daytoday so were looking at probably prayers a roombyroom blessing or if a particular and persistent personality is identified maybe a requiem eucharist involving the people most closely involved present and where possible past nine times out of ten this is enough to restore a kind of calm adam whys it called the master house if anybody was able to explain that eastgate said they didnt want to maybe the main house when there were subsidiary farms or the local schoolmaster used to live there mmm she had a last look at the hill where isolated white lights had appeared its big sisters the skirrid and the sugarloaf fading uninhabited into the driedblood sky adam eastgate said ever get scared yourself merrily me merrily laughed an unconvincing hollow sound in the stillness an early owl picked it up or seemed to and flew with it as she got into the car lament then he was back on the phone merrily told lol in the pub soon as i got in barely had time to put the kettle on the duchy guy no the bishop mustve rung several times already i dont think ive ever known him this jumpy i just i dont get it she took a drink serious decadence a housewhite spritzer in the black swan oak beams low lights with ones paramour how long had it been before shed felt able to do this comfortably six months a year seemed stupid now nobody glanced at them twice although this was probably because almost nobody knew them thursday night and most of the drinkers in the lounge bar were from outside the village having drifted in for dinner some probably responding to the dispiriting daily telegraph travel feature identifying ledwardine as the blackandwhite timberribbed heart of the new cotswolds like when did that happen couple of years ago the village was still on the rim of the wilderness now there was talk of the black swan chasing a michelin star the cotswolds are coming merrily listened to the brittle laughter at the bar ominous like a melting ice cap rural warming feels suddenly claustrophobic or is that just me final confirmation of the countys new economic status the major investment in herefordshire by the old cotswolds most distinguished resident charles windsor highgrove does he know about this lol said well thats what i asked didnt get an answer hed probably be fascinated has his otherworldly side only he keeps quieter about it these days merrily looked around making sure nobody could overhear them in their corner well back from the bar since the tabloids labelled him as a loony who talks to plants maybe theyve been advised not to tell him just get it quietly disposed of as for the bishop you can see his problem this is the guy next in line for head of the church of england that didnt escape me i suppose its as good a reason as any to play it by the book no reason however for the bishop to go adding extra entirely gratuitous chapters full attention i think merrily well need to get you a locum for at least a week move you over there and shed gone what like what sounding like jane probably lol i dont want to go and stay in garway for a week i just i dont see the point in which case orange sparks from the electric candles on the walls were agitating in lols glasses why not just tell the bishop to you know piss off because hes a friend because i owe him because merrily shook her head helpless lol leaned back he was looking good actually old denim jacket over a bakers lament tshirt which he wore like a medal but always keeping the motif at least partly covered up as if he could still only halfbelieve what was finally happening to him he put down his lager thoughtful suppose i come with you youre touring its only three gigs next week just the one night away i could reschedule or cancel that is not a word we use lol you give anybody the slightest reason to think youre slipping back a year ago the thought of three gigs three solo gigs would have given him palpitations night sweats lol looked into his glass obviously knowing she was right and merrily watched him across the oak table through this haze of love and pride blurred by fatigue very happy for him if concerned that he might just be feeling he didnt deserve it ominously when shed gone over to the cottage to drag him out to the pub shed heard the voice of his longdead muse nick drake from the stereo worst of all it was blackeyed dog nicks voice pitched high in bleak and terminal despair lol had turned it off before he opened the door merrily staring at him in alarm but finding no despair in his eyes just this sense of puzzlement besides she said im supposed to be staying with the local priest they havent got a vicar in the garway cluster at present so a retired guys taking services meanwhile he and his wife do b b i turn up there with a boyfriend hows that going to look what about jane jane stays here cant miss any school at this stage woman curate called ruth wisdoms lined up to mind the parish work experience shes ok and janes less likely to drive her to selfmutilation than at one time and she merrily looked up a woman was standing behind lols chair excuse me you just have to be lol robinson she was tall and very slender shed been with a group of women in their twenties with fancy cocktails their backs to the bar all of them now looking at lol hands over smiles nobody has to be anybody lol said mr enigmatic the woman was leaning over him now her glossy black dress like oil on a dipstick one small breast almost touching his cheek lol i just wanted to say we all went to see the bakers lament at the flicks in the sticks special preview and it was absolutely enchanting especially the music obviously but listen when i went to buy the cd in hereford they hadnt even got it nobody had well it it all takes time lol said and im like for christs sake this guys local and the manager guy he eventually admitted theyd had about fifteen orders just that day fifteen orders in one morning this tells me you need to get a better recording company mr robinson i couldnt even find a download well its kind of caught them on the hop lol said all of us really we didnt actually well i have to say i just totally love it hope you dont mind me coming over er no lol said no not at all thank you the young woman straightened up as did her conspicuous nipples she looked across at merrily and smiled at her merrily felt small and dowdy and old hes lovely isnt he the woman said walking back across the village square lol avoided the creamy light of the fake gaslamps merrily was a pace behind him fifteen orders in one morning she was probably exaggerating why would she merrily pulled on her woollen beret zipped up her fraying fleece she doesnt know you although shell probably be telling people she does now one small song in one small film not so small now and you know what people will remember the song when theyve halfforgotten the film because its somehow caught the mood the zeitgeist whatever you have become a cool person laurence its not real lol was shaking his head as if to clear it after his two halves of lager its a freak accident sometimes you wanted to encircle his neck with your hands and over a year now since this young guy liam brown not long out of film school had written to lol telling him about his selffinanced rural love story how badly after hearing it on lols album alien he wanted the bakers lament on the soundtrack only wasnt sure he could afford it just take it lol had told him the way lol would sending him three versions of the song including an unreleased instrumental track and forgetting all about it not even mentioning it to merrily until the middle of july when the first dvd arrived the bakers lament there on the label with a bread knife stuck into a country cob the guy had named the movie after the song shooting the picture with unknown actors whod formed some kind of workers cooperative lol and merrily had watched it together at the vicarage the tragicomic story of a young couple setting up a village bakery on the welsh border in the s when the supermarkets were starting to starve small shopkeepers out of business following through to the new millennium when the couple were played and not badly either by the actors own parents and the village had turned into something like contemporary ledwardine the bakery now a twee delicatessen the movie was simple and charming and unpretentious a rural elegy with lols music seeping through it like a bloodstream carrying the sense of change and loss and a kind of resilience liam brown was even worse than lol at selfpromotion and they hadnt known it had been released in a limited way on the arthouse circuit until it was in the papers that an obscure british independent film had picked up some debutdirector award at cannes then the who is this guy calls had started coming in to lols producer prof levin change was coming new costwolds new lol they stopped on the edge of the cobbles where theyd go their separate ways merrily to the vicarage lol to his terraced cottage in church street when he took her hand his felt cold apparently the next question they ask is is he still alive thinking maybe its a forgotten recording from the sixties by some contemporary of nick drake it should be him merrily not me lol hes dead he died in after a mere five six years of not being successful you get to double that and some she pulled him under the oakpillared village hall and bugger it if there were people watching let them watch clasped her hands in his hair and found his lips with her mouth and then unzipped her fleece and tucked one of his cold hands inside all this she said aware of the ambivalence is something overdue remember that trying to banish the image of the girl in the pub showing him her implants out of a dress that must have cost something close to two weeks stipend jane said youre a soft touch mum always were a doormat thanks it was getting late but it was friday night and merrily had lit a small log fire in the vicarage sitting room the whole place was colder since theyd said goodbye to the oilgobbling aga which while it had to be done meant she wasnt looking forward to winter and i dont mean one of those rough spiky doormats jane said youll like ruth she rides a motorbike jeez if theres anything worse than a trendy lesbian cleric in leathers with a vintage harley between her legs like maybe i could arrange to stay at eirions janes voice dried up and her face went blank eirion was away at university now and she still hadnt got used to that ok it was only cardiff and he came home to abergavenny at weekends but things inevitably had changed ruths not a lesbian jane not a problem anyway jane on her knees on the hearthrug stared into the desultory yellow flames i was thinking of giving girls a try for a while actually shock tactic cry for help merrily pulled up an armchair he didnt phone then erm no how long ten days no problem i dont think he was even able to get home last weekend didnt i mention that no but i kind of assumed that was why you suddenly had to work on your project all thats gone quiet too they may not even start the dig until the spring oh pity about that jane had been hyper for a while after her campaign to stall council plans for executive homes in colemans meadow convinced that the field had once been crossed by an ancient trackway and amazingly shed been right theyd found prehistoric stones there long buried by some superstitious farmer sensational archaeology for a place like ledwardine hell call merrily said hes eirion i dont care if he calls or not yes you do like its very demanding university life jane didnt look at her lots of guys youre obliged to get smashed with lots of girls to assist with their essays and stuff eirion was never like that he was never at university before university further education this could be the time to talk about it again just over six months from her a levels jane needed to start applying to universities like now but jane wasnt interested because that was what everybody did she kept saying she could feel the system trying to stereotype her and look at the cost tuition fees could they afford it was it really worth it especially as she hadnt yet decided on a career like you didnt just do further education for the sake of having done it you went to uni jane said looking down at the rug and got pregnant before you were into your second year we were naïve in those days well comparatively immature although i suppose every generation gets to say that in which case i must be jane turned to her moisteyed or was it the light i must be very seriously immature then pushing eighteen and only the one real boyfriend thats not normal mum that wasnt even normal in your day thats like almost perverted well actually flower i think its really quite the phone rang then offering her a timely getout which she felt compelled to ignore ill let the machine no you get it go on youll only sit there worrying until you find an excuse to sneak off and play the message merrily nodded got up its a doormat thing jane said sweetly to her back thanks she took the call in the scullery office padding over the flags in the cold kitchen where no stove rumbled scooping up the phone with one hand switching on the desk lamp with the other ledwardine vic mrs watkins is it yes it is adam eastgate likely mentioned me oh right mr barlow lowlevel local accent felix right i was going to call you tomorrow actually see if we could arrange to meet tomorrow would be all right for us yes at the house owls whooping it up in the orchard silence in the old black bakelite phone the kind of phone that could really carry a silence the house at garway merrily said no mr barlow said i dont think so any particular reason well see person you need to talk to more than me is my plasterer its my plasterer had the experience your plasterer i call her that were converting this barn at monkland see were in a caravan on the site thats not far for me its just i thought you might find it easier to explain the problem in situ merrily said no he said no i dont think so you couldnt spare the time another silence no owls even she waited i think youre gonner have to come here he said we dont plan to go back see to the master house this was what he was ringing to tell her that they werent on any account going back to the house thats correct he said she had the feeling that he was working to a script and whoever had written it was standing at his shoulder she felt another question coming and hung on for it i was told you you were the hereford exorcist more or less and youll have the um full regalia is it regalia wed like it if you came with all the regalia felix barlow said the full bell book and candle kind of thing oh if thats all right with you barlow said fuchsia she was beautiful and shimmery in the mist like one of those exotic birds that werent supposed to migrate here greens and blues in her dark tangly hair skin like milky coffee she stood by the long green caravan in her pinksplashed overalls and her turquoise wellingtons calling out when merrily was close enough for the dog collar to show will you bless me im sorry in the oldfashioned way please she said that is with all due ceremony from the field gate through the lingering mist a keen hint of first frost shed looked as young as jane close up you guessed she was nearly thirty still not merrilys idea of a plasterer im serious i can tell merrily looked into eyes which were startlingly big and round like an owls and widely separated it strengthens the aura the woman said isnt that right im sure it must be merrily parted her woollen cloak to expose the cassock hemmed with mud now the full regalia could be a pain but would it be all right if we talked first i just wanted to ask you while felix wasnt here hes not religious the woman turned away and moved back to the caravan fuchsia she said over her shoulder fuchsia mary linden which meant that her parents had been either gardeners or big fans of the gormenghast trilogy following her into the caravan merrilys money was on gormenghast she felt tired again had a lingering headache shed awoken a good hour before dawn her body all curled up tense with resentment never her favourite negative emotion resentment most times it came hissing like poison gas out of inflated selfesteem they cant treat me like this seldom objective never exactly christian and hardly thank you jane the way of the doormat at six am shed been hugging a pot of tea ethel the black cat on her knees in the frigid kitchen watery sunlight eventually seeping into the windows before the mist had blotted it up the more shed thought about the duchy job the more senseless it had seemed she was expected to desert the parish and jane and lol for up to a week to address some embarrassment in an empty house an empty house that was the other point no family life disrupted there nobodys sanity at risk was there in fact anything more on the line than the reputation of the bishop of hereford as a faithful servant of the monarchy and the professional judgement of the duke of cornwalls landsteward merrily had put on her pectoral cross and knelt in her bathrobe on the cold stone flags and prayed and listened the result had been inconclusive it was a substantial professional caravan with a living room and a goodsized kitchen area copper pans on hooks conveying weight and a sense of permanence twin doors at the bottom of the living area suggesting a separate bedroom and bathroom the walls of the living room were lined with oriental rugs and there was a woodburning stove lit the sweet scent of apple logs mingling with the sweeter fumes of cannabis fuchsia kicked off her wellies picked up a rubberized walkietalkie ill call felix hes over at the barn have a seat please merrily shrugging off the black woollen cloak merrily made a space for herself between tumbled books on one of the fitted sofas she could see the barn its bay agape through the window opposite and the goldenbrown mist the window behind her framed the church tower across the rutted field and the lane where shed left her car monkland was a mainroad village on the way to leominster this was the first time shed penetrated its hinterland so the barns going to be our home its supposed to be finished by now fuchsia prodded at the walkietalkie but thats what its like with builders merrily they fit in their own projects between jobs if a builders home looks like some wretched hovel that means hes doing very well the ephemeral beauty didnt include her voice which was quite slow and loud in an uncontrolled way like a childs merrily folded the cloak over her knees less puzzled now about why it or the cassock had been necessary why felix barlow though not religious himself had thought traditional priestly attire would be appropriate the walkietalkie cackled and fuchsia said shes here babes and clicked it off hell come now merrily he was getting a bit frazzled and he needed to work with his hands to calm himself down felix has problems talking about the nonphysical which is very odd because hes really perceptive and buildings speak to him how do they do that they send him information communicating what they were and what they can be again its like dowsing he feels it in his muscles the needs of the stone and the oak well in some buildings anyway what about the farmhouse at garway the master house had been left to rot fuchsia was wrapping her thin arms around herself as if to crush a shudder and it wasnt complaining houses know when theyve gone bad and this is what it said to felix this one didnt speak to felix merrily fuchsia said it spoke to me i see and now my auras permeated with darkness fuchsia opened her arms can you see im afraid not some priests can not the man at garway he was no help at all but there was a very good guy in the place i grew up hed packed it in but it never goes away its a calling like they say i believe that merrily if you answer the call you may receive gifts its as well to be careful about gifts merrily said you can never be too sure who theyre from fuchsia crouched in front of the stove and opened up its vents pale flames spurting in the glass square on a shelf to the left of the stainless steel flue merrily read titles from a stack of paperbacks the gap in the curtain the secrets of dr taverner the flint knife ghost stories of an antiquary where did you grow up fuchsia west wales cardiganshire fuchsia watched the flames i was born there no welsh accent though through the caravan window merrily saw a man in a hat coming out of the mist felix was there too fuchsia said in cardiganshire in the place where i was born he was there when i entered the world fuchsia smiled her face reflected stretched and warped in the shiny flue felix cut my cord merrily merrily blinked which makes for a lifelong connection fuchsia said something you learned as a deliverance minister whatever ghosts were there were people who saw them and people who wanted to see them and they were seldom the same people put it this way if whatever had happened at garway had happened to felix merrily would have been more inclined to believe it he was a big untamedlooking man in a leather waistcoat long redgrey hair in a rubberbanded ponytail a wide smile through a stubble like sharp sand hed left his wellies at the bottom of the caravan steps and she saw that his woollen socks had been darned how often nowadays did socks get darned didnt really want this mrs watkins he lowered himself with a sigh into the sofa opposite her he had to be a good twenty years older than fuchsia i just wanted off the job and that would be an end to it but adam hes like a terrier is adam he likes you trusts you to get it right he should know better felix pulled out a dented cigarette tin and rizlas all right if i please do in fact merrily reached gratefully down to her bag bringing out the silk cut and the zippo and he doesnt want to see you lose the contract if something can be cleared up i never asked for this i want you to know that i said to adam leave it its just one of those things but then he told me fuchsia said and i realized you must be meant merrily meant merrily said its a matter of metaphysics merrily looked at felix who said nothing and back at fuchsia whose wideeyed gaze met hers fullon that house is diseased you see we need spiritual antibiotics you know a bit about these things then i know that this is about good and evil merrily fuchsia said and ive experienced the evil ok merrily lit a cigarette do you want to tell me nearest the scissors dust sheets mostly heavyduty plastic felix explained theyd laid them on the floor where the damp and sunken stone flags had been taken up this was after the roof had been made safe first things first theyd spread the dust sheets on the floor so they could make a start on the walls limeplaster fuchsia said i love it you should see her felix said she moves like a dragonfly not that day fuchsia moved closer to the wood stove there was no air that day it was close and heavy outside but still damp inside the house my wings she giggled bleakly a sound like pills rattling in a jar my wings were drooping it was the first time shed been there see felix said i have three blokes in the regular team theyd made a start on the roof fuchsia watched the flames i was looking forward to it it seemed a lovely area it has two personalities merrily long light views on the english side and then deep green and full of drama as it swoops down to the monnow valley and wales she gripped her knees all spoiled now felix looked at her worried then he turned to merrily so ledwardine eh you know gomer parry oh yes she smiled very well danny thomas not quite as well i didnt meet him until he became gomers partner in the planthire i was in dannys band in the seventies felix said bass fingers always too messed up for anything more delicate than a bass guitar and a bit clumsy at that i think we did one gig and i wouldnt say folks was actually walking out the door it was full of death fuchsia said the cold white waxy stillness of death merrily saw felix grit his teeth turning away from fuchsia whose elongated reflection in the stainlesssteel flue was starting to look like munchs scream i didnt know whether it wanted me out or it wanted me dead merrily stop it girl felixs fingers gripping his knees merrily knelt down next to fuchsia on the rug what made you think that something wanted you dead fuchsia shrugged i tried to work i went out i came back i went out again and then i went back i am a professional she stared defiantly at merrily felix went back on his own the next day and when he came home it was like it was all over him i made him shower and then i burned all the clothes hed been wearing just out there merrily i poured petrol on them merrily nodded very early in her deliverance career shed been advised to do something similar to draw a line under a particular situation some things it was easier not to question you said you went back it was under the dust sheets what was i tried to ignore it but all the time i could hear the dust sheets behind me wriggling and rippling and whispering the air was really thick and heavy and i wouldnt let myself turn round felix wasnt there i was checking out the granary felix said working out how many steps could be repaired heard her screaming started running fuchsia was staring down at her hands mumbling something merrily bent to her im sorry a face of crumpled linen felix said shes said that a few times thats what you saw fuchsia nodded her head violently and bent forward as if she had awful stomachache and felix looked depairingly at merrily and then fuchsia said can we do it in the church the blessing dont see why not but id need to clear it with the vicar no theres no need merrily well its what we usually do but at least she was on fairly good terms with the minister at monkland she could get away with it if youd rather not make a thing out of it not this church fuchsia said shed insisted on changing first into something white the oldfashioned way all due ceremony merrily went back across the field through the clearing mist to the car and brought the blue case out of the boot inside it were the holy water and oil for anointing borrowed from roman catholicism but it was sometimes helpful partly theatre she waited in the field with felix those books on the shelf near the stove are they yours or fuchsias i dont read much nowadays half a page and i fall asleep if they ent technical books they ent mine i meant the ghost stories oh aye she likes the old ghost stories sometime shell read one aloud and it scares the pants off me but she just giggles finds them comforting mabbe the old houses the formality the stiff way people talk stilted sometimes she says she was born out of time wrong place wrong time where was she born she didnt tell you she said cardiganshire well that felix half smiled thats more or less right you heard of tepee city blimey is it still there i reckon likely the longestsurviving alternative community in britain by now i was there about a year as a young feller gap year as you might say nice folks in the main had to pull your weight mind or you wouldnt be welcome for too long so you were a tepee dweller bender in my case you know the ole bentover sapling kind of thing vaguely only there a year like i say but i never regretted it when you eventually graduate to building and rebuilding proper houses if the first ones you ever put together was benders youve probably got your priorities right make it warm watertight and use natural insulation fuchsia said you erm cut her cord aye she likes to tell people that is it true it is actually felix squeezed his prickly jaw childbirth in the valley it could be like a communal event i just happened to be nearest the scissors afterwards mary asked me to be her godfather kind of thing though we never went to church just down the wood where we lit a fire asked the gods to bless the child bit pagan sorry about that but they did kind of you know they included jesus merrily smiled faintly then we played some music smoked some weed and i held the child for a bit and made some vows in the smoke so you and fuchsias mother im sorry for asking personal questions but it helps to know a few basics no felix said me and mary that never really happened i wanted it to at the time i ent denying that she was beautiful thin fragile didnt have much to say needed looking after when she turned up at tepee city she was already pregnant said the fatherd buggered off to america to go on the road in a pickup truck i suppose i got closer to her than anybody but not as close as idve liked you know she stayed a few months and then she she just left with the baby no she left the baby in the valley with another family just like that more or less rachel the woman who took fuchsia she was this earthmother type done it before i mean it was that kind of place fuchsia was a child of the tribe kind of thing we thought mary was gonner come back she said shed been offered a job good money and shed be back for the kid the social services tried to find her got nowhere so it ended up with rachel adopting fuchsia or fostering her whatever and i kept in touch kind of thing helped out sent money you left when it was clear that fuchsias mother wasnt going to come back no no what happened my ole feller died suddenly i had to sort things out he had a builders yard my dad i sold it after a bit went to work for a firm of conservation builders learning the trade kind of thing then went on my own built up a business got married got divorced then fuchsia showed up what just appeared wed put her through art college see you had had the money by then mrs watkins why not i mean i never meant for this for us to be like you know how its turned out she just arrived one day and she was interested in what i was doing the conservation work and she hadnt got a job she went to work for you before there was any relationship that was how it started aye felix wiped his mouth with the back of a hand i call her my plasterer what she does really is mouldings recreates original colours experiments with limewashes she just loves the feel of plaster i see look mrs watkins im under no illusions about how long its gonner last but were rebuilding that felix nodded towards the barn it was a ruin and im determined to make it into a proper home for her like an ancestral home kind of thing for the ancestry shell never have she reads all these stories about folks living in country houses and if i can give her that things might be good for a while you never heard from her mother again not a word youd never tried to find her didnt know where to start no idea where she was from she had a bit of a brummie accent i remember and she was mixed race one of them mustve been black fuchsia reckons shes dead why does she think that just a feeling theres this kind of tribal mysticism in tepee city and she had a period of building fires in a clearing in the wood and looking for mary in the smoke now she just mopes around ole churches and reads ghost stories i was hoping when the barn was finished itd be some kind of stability merrily looked at him saying nothing there was a sadness here a longing but also a realistic suspicion that it wasnt going to work out if you can take away the fear felix said if you could just do that you know you think its more than just this place the master house look i dont know i believe something happened to her in that place i just dont know if its in her mind i dont know mrs watkins i accept that these things go on what i mean is you have a feeling for houses but nothing seems to have i mean for you it didnt have anything to say to me good or bad what i usually do if a place is blocking me is ill spend a night inside in a sleeping bag you wake up in a house you can somehow get a proper feel of it i mightve got round to that but she didnt want me to look i know what youre thinking but its just a job just money right erm whys it called the master house do you know not really bloke i spoke to said it goes back to the templars who built garway church they had masters and grand masters apparently it could be old enough i found fourteenthcentury bits maybe older did you ask anybody if it was supposed to be haunted anybody locally a woman we talked to said it wouldnt be a surprise said it hadnt been a happy house who was that has a smallholding edge of the hamlet sells freerange eggs and honey and herbs mrs mornington morningside something like that and the reason you wont go back now is purely see it from my position if you can felix said fuchsia came down the caravan steps then wearing what looked like a bridesmaid dress with a bodice of white lace the colours in her hair were like streaks of oil rainbowed in dark water merrily felt a flicker of unease and glanced at felix but he was gazing across at monkland church with its halo of gilded mist pity this wasnt the church they were using she had no history here felix turned and saw fuchsia and swallowed looks so much like her now it scares me a bit her mother aye who is this the last time merrily had been inside the church of st cosmas and st damien somebody had sacrificed a crow on one of the altars these things happened just occasionally after a church had been decommissioned by the c of e left to fade into filmset gothic lifting cloak and cassock to climb into felixs silver truck outside the caravan she was remembering the crows entrails arranged like intricate jewellery on the righthand altar it was a church with two of everything twin chancels twin naves with a pulpit in the middle they might see this as representing a dualism huw owen her spiritual director had said at the time left and right darkness and light this was in the very early days in deliverance and shed blown it been unable to handle the necessary cleansing of the church emotionally exposed at the time her senses still snagged on memories of a fairly sickening job in the old general hospital feeling clammy palms itching and then the explosion of coughing and huw supervising ordering her out this was when shed been advised to burn the vestments shed been wearing and shed done that in an incinerator behind the vicarage burned everything except for oh god this cloak the same heavy woollen cowled cape that shed worn here on the night of her humiliation because it hadnt been at the general hospital it had seemed ok not to burn it after all they werent cheap these cloaks the female clergy still a minority market but never dismiss coincidence it was better not to take it in she began to unlace the cloak as the truck bounced down an eroded lane where torn shards of tarmac were crumbling like piecrust into the verges and fuchsias voice came cawing from the back seat are you high church then merrily anglocatholic oh well ive never been one for labels fuchsia you adapt compromise where you can mixnmatch pick your own anything works now in the new flexible c of e do you have a statue of our lady in your church merrily no but ive thought about it we have two in the caravan now felix said bitterly ones above the bed makes you feel a bit queasy when you look up and the moonlights full on it i also like to go to the cathedral in hereford fuchsia said when its fairly quiet merrily turned to look at fuchsia rocking in the narrow rear seat her hair centreparted one hand holding a cream woollen shawl together at her neck the other steadying the canvas zipbag on her knees the deliverance bag shed asked if she could carry it when its quiet merrily when theres nobody to say i dont belong why would you think you dont belong merrily said nobody has to sign anything im neither one place nor the other thats how i feel i see everything had turned around this was no longer just about an empty house with a presence now there was a human dimension complicating matters in a way the duchy of cornwall wouldnt have anticipated there are a few advisers i can call on if necessary but thats usually when there are people involved who might have problems psychological psychiatric like an apparently intelligent woman with the manner of a small child repeatedly clutching your name like a mothers hand in a bewildering department store ive thought of joining the catholic church merrily but they havent got the old churches any more and i like the old churches especially st cosmas and st damien its open all the time i can go in at night at dawn whenever and what do you do there just sit there its a place of healing how long have you felt you needed healing oh its not for me its for my mother you wont remember your mother oh yes but you were only a baby when she im sure i do remember her part of hers in me isnt it have you ever tried to find her maybe the internet i did once there was another mary linden it just got confusing would you like me to include your mother in the prayers its too late merrily what makes you think that i just want you to make my aura strong please fuchsia said the mist was low and white among the pines around the little sandstone church there might have been a proper village here once but it barely qualified as a hamlet now a couple of dwellings sat fairly close one of them a farm the church of st cosmas and st damien had a squat body and a timbered belltower and its churchyard was raised like a cake stand supported by the churches restoration trust it apparently held just one service a year felix left the truck at the side of the track and locked it with the sun muffled like a coin in a handkerchief merrily uncloaked and chilly opened the gate into the churchyard perhaps we should tell someone were here nobody ever disturbs me fuchsia handed her the bag they probably take one look at me and think im a mad person shouldering the bag strap merrily saw felix wince look he said quickly ill stay outside yeah explain to anybody who shows up you sure his look confirmed it merrily nodded and fuchsia drifted ahead of her like a ghost in the mist around the church to the arcaded wooden porch is this safe after several recent cases of exorcism turning up the jets under something combustible you were forced to ask but this wasnt an exorcism fuchsia knew enough not to be asking for it shed wanted a blessing which was exactly what merrily under the circumstances would have been offering so no problem really no fuchsia before we go in fuchsia stopped just inside the porch the mist hanging in shining strings from the gothic points of its deep and glassless windows merrily caught her up i want to get this right is it your feeling you might have brought something with you out of the house at garway fuchsia stood for a while moistening her lips with her tongue something found me something which knew you already do you think fuchsia said nothing her eyes gave nothing away merrily said when you talked about evil and also a feeling of death the owl eyes didnt blink or flicker the skin around them softly lucent and about something moving under the dustsheets you mean was i talking about something subliminal fuchsia said something under the surface of my own mind are you asking if im mentally ill merrily merrily found a smile from somewhere no she said im not asking that lets go in she remembered its intimacy emphasised by the central pulpit the two chancels like cattle pens she remembered the harmonium and the discreet domestic medieval tomb of john and agnes de la bere praying effigies modestly separated by johns shield found herself picturing stone images of herself and lol with his boswell guitar between them candles fuchsia held up a brown paper bag shed found inside the pulpit theyre still here yours three left and a stub sometimes i light them on one of the altars you have a preference the lefthand one because its furthest from the door all right shall we make it just the one candle oh i havent brought matches ive got a lighter they didnt use the candlesticks provided instead placing the candle stub in a tin tray and merrily lit it praying within herself for assistance they sat side by side facing the altar from benches just inside the rood screen fuchsia in white merrily blackcassocked it was less cold than shed expected you ok fuchsia yeah you know what im asking theres nothing here now there never is in here its a holy site a healing place merrily nodded stood up shall i kneel down merrily before the altar ok it didnt take long handson very gentle father i ask you now to cleanse and make new all things within the heart and soul of fuchsia to restore her to new life and a new relationship with you to make her welcome the lids were down over the owleyes wings of white light opening up in the window over the altar there was a small rustling from behind them in the lefthand nave churches were full of small sounds merrily didnt look towards it but was suddenly thinking of dust sheets wriggling and rippling like something malevolent under the skin and it it needed more something a vibration in the solarplexus telling her that she left fuchsia kneeling there the white dress tucked under her knees the shawl hanging loose over her shoulders keeping her in view as she moved quickly back to the bench and her bag feeling for the smoothness of glass and bringing out the most roman catholic item in there the oil olive oil extravirgin blessed by the bishop in a brown screwtop vial fuchsias forehead shone merrily bent and with a forefinger inscribed on it a cross in oil and if you could open your hands on the left palm another cross oil of wholeness and healing and then the right fuchsia drawing a slow breath eyelids fluttering watch over her in the name of all the angels and saints in heaven keep guard over her soul day and night all very solemn and slightly surreal merrily shivering slightly as fuchsias eyes opened and she was looking back through the chancel screen towards the harmonium and the doorway who is this fuchsia whispered who is this whos coming and laughed as lightly as her harsh childs voice could manage stonewall the look on sophies face was beyond outrage bordering on disbelief down in broad street air brakes gasped bishops came and bishops went hereford cathedral remained and sophie she sank down at her desk almost fading into it like a ghost merrily shut the window of the gatehouse office usually a refuge under the cathedrals calming façade where the bishops lay secretary applied cold cream for the soul today the air up here was tainted with dismay sophies snowy hair disarranged merrily had phoned her before leaving for monkland outlining the brief and this was when sophie had gone over to the bishops palace to elicit some hard facts from bernie dunmore and been unaccountably shockingly stonewalled merrily sat down opposite her with her back to the window that doesnt happen sophie it certainly never has before i actually thought at one stage that he wasnt going to tell me about any of it all the time merrily had been telling her about fuchsia and felix sophie had been rearranging the correspondence on her desk lifting up the pile and stacking it like a pack of cards that she was about to shuffle finding things to do with her hands as if she was trying to stop them shaking autumn at last twinset time but no real need for that extra scarf the idea of sophie feeling the cold was disturbing to merrily she stood up again as the kettle came to the boil ill make it i should perhaps take one sugar sophie said calmly jesus merrily pulled down the teapot and mugs so all in all theres probably more to this than either of us knows you know rather more than i do until last night i didnt even know how heavily the duchy was into the county ive made a point of finding out sophie put on her chained glasses to consult a computer printout the serious involvement with herefordshire happened fairly rapidly according to the duchy of cornwalls website major investment here began with scattered segments of the oncevast estate around hereford and ross owned in the seventeenth century by thomas guy of guys hospital fame i should know about this shouldnt i held more recently of course by the footwear magnate sir charlie clore and then after his death by prudential assurance who sold it to the duchy in i think this probably means theres now more duchy investment in this county than anywhere outside of cornwall itself royal herefordshire the showpiece being the very impressive harewood park which of course one cant miss because its right next to the a why here i mean why herefordshire beautiful unspoiled perhaps the prince wants to help keep it that way hes famously keen on green issues seems likely to ensure that the land will be treated sympathetically with an eye to heritage conservation and organic farming hmm nothing overtly sinister merrily nothing for say jane to rail against which is why i cant understand sophie cathedral person confirmed royalist closed her lips and turned her head ostensibly fixing a clip in her hair nothing about garway on the duchy website nothing do you know garway sophie havent been over there for many years not since our hiking days hiking days merrily blinked bobcap knapsack flask of soup you im not in the mood merrily merrily sighed maybe you could tell me what you remember i remember the church small and rather strange built by the mysterious knights templar in fact one of the bestpreserved examples of templar architecture in the country especially since the london church was badly damaged in the blitz and theres a medieval columbarium nearby said to be absolutely the finest of its kind anywhere columb dovecote the templars kept doves and pigeons as a food supply the whole area had i suppose a sense of isolation selfisolation in a way that i wouldnt imagine has gone away not an area i should have thought that anyone visits without a particular reason i printed out some general background material for you merrily after the bishop dropped what crumbs of information he deemed it necessary for me to have ok time to deal with this sophie hadnt seemed so screwedup since siân callaghanclarkes attempt to turn deliverance into a branch of social services merrily dumped two tea bags into the pot and brought the kettle back to the boil what exactly did he say when you first mentioned it its not so much a question of what he did or didnt say said as of what he did next which was to telephone canterbury sophie scowled on his private line how do you know he did that about twenty minutes later someone returned his call on this line who suffice to say the voice was instantly recognizable not aaah pouring boiling water into the pot merrily had scorched the back of a hand in the steam shit sorry what was the matter with her some issue of church politics here sophie said obviously it isnt obvious to me merrily held her reddening hand under the coldwater tap all i can see is a conflict of loyalty over a woman who could well be emotionally disturbed you think the girls delusional dont know enough to say one way or the other she has a complicated history seems to be looking for a kind of stability shes never had likes old churches and ceremony you mightve seen her in the cathedral big eyes doesnt smile and what were you able to do to help her protective blessing in church with oil which seemed appropriate you dont look entirely convinced who is this whos coming outside she hadnt even remembered saying it merrily dried her hand on the towel ill keep an eye on her meanwhile check out the house at garway actually ive got some stuff here she came back to the desk and brought out the folder that adam eastgate had given her with the plans and a photo of what looked like a traditional welsh longhouse stonebuilt one end extending into the barn or cowshed we havent had any reports about this house before have we sophie nothing on the database even peripheral nothing i checked the files and correspondence going back to canon dobbss time and earlier you havent been there yet merrily shook her head shed driven directly over to hereford after picking up the volvo in monkland sophie brought out more printout i looked up the master house on the listed buildings database its given as fourteenth century but they usually play safe so it could be earlier if it dates back to the templar occupancy of garway which is what felix barlow reckons that would be thirteenth century maybe very early fourteenth i think the order was scrapped around then wasnt it the order was officially and rather brutally dissolved in in france anyway this was less than two centuries after it was formed the templars would have survived a little longer in britain but not in any organized way and would they have been connected in any way with the master house given that head templars were called masters possibly in peacetime they seem to have behaved like any other monastic community farming the land employing local people as the house is still part of a farm i phoned an acquaintance in the local nfu office it seems to have belonged for quite some time many generations to the gwilym family whose land straddles the welsh border not heard of them should i have very longestablished and rather affluent now with business interests here in the city they seem to have had financial difficulties in the early s and had to sell the master house with a large package of land to a family called newton who settled there for about fifty years finally moving out of the house itself in we think the late s why did they move out nothing of interest to you upkeep heating costs they had no historical attachment to the master house bought another farm nearby with a more modern house the master house was later rented out to various people at various times a riding stables a commune of selfsufficiency fanatics in the s and its these newtons who sold it to the duchy the grays now an eldest daughter married into a family called gray they seem to have sold it to the duchy with about ninety acres feeling the pinch i gather had a very bad time during the foot and mouth in rather losing heart when are you going not decided yet possibly tomorrow id hoped to persuade felix and fuchsia to come with me doesnt make a lot of sense going alone i can do a houseblessing and prayers but whos going to say if its achieved anything with nobody living or working there to report back so youre going tomorrow to stay for a few days im going for half a day have a look around talk to a few people locally and then come back to think about it the bishop was insistent sophie said that you should have as much time as it takes to get to the bottom of this i was asked to ring the reverend murray in garway and reserve you a room at the guest house his wife runs and no i dont understand it either cant you stall him frankly merrily poured tea its hard to imagine bernie dunmore being so far excuse me up the duchys bum maybe i should talk to him hes in london im afraid until tuesday house of lords would be wouldnt he still gives us three days if you can copy some of this stuff well present him with a full and careful report which he can safely dangle in front of the duchy the prince of wales the archbishop of are you sure he was talking to canterbury about this im his confidential secretary merrily supposed to be so what are your personal feelings sophie was looking down at her desk sophie hill who worked for the cathedral there was a pause in the traffic on broad street mmm merrily nodded youre probably right the church has always relied on the silence of its employees no disruptive questions asked knowing your place as you say sophie looked up letting her chained glasses fall to her chest merrily avoided her gaze i think sophie said very quietly that a lot would depend on whether the prince of wales knows about this oh he has after all been known to express an interest in such matters such matters you know well hes talked publicly about spiritual healing organic farming relationships with the land and plants if thats what you mean i think youll find that it goes deeper sophie said merrily stood up walked across to the door opened it and looked down the stone steps i dont think theyve got around to bugging us yet sophie were quite alone she closed the door came back and sat down what the naked cross the steeples of the two citycentre churches st peters and all saints were far more visible in hereford than the tower of the cathedral which was in a corner backed up against the river not central it didnt hide exactly it just didnt show off it didnt have secrets as such just didnt go out of its way like sophie this relates to your late predecessor sophie said dobbs you could see him standing silently in the corner face like an eroded cliff face the man who had refused to be called a deliverance minister who until his last collapse in the cathedral itself had been the hereford diocesan exorcist canon thomas dobbs who wouldnt even open his front door to merrily but had left a message for her in its letter box succinctly conveying his thoughts on being replaced by a woman the first exorcist was jesus christ interesting how rapidly the situation had changed since then first merrily then siân callaghanclarke canon of this cathedral getting herself appointed deliverance coordinator with plans to subtly secularise the service hadnt worked and now siâns ambitions were allegedly focused on the impending vacancy for archdeacon sorting through canon dobbss files after his death sophie said i came across a box file of press cuttings i didnt bother you with any of this at the time it seemed hardly relevant and you had enough problems but hed accumulated a substantial collection of newspaper and magazine articles about the prince of wales dobbs merrily rocked back in her chair dobbs collected stories about prince charles i dont mean photo spreads from hello these all have specific references to the princes spiritual life for some reason i filed them away in a storeroom in the cloisters why would dobbs be especially interested in charles i mean this was presumably before the duchy got into herefordshire certainly before they bought the guys estate from the prudential is there any possibility that dobbs knew him personally i dont know i have no reason to think he did i mean he may have i really dont know merrily it just brought it back to me with all this could i have a look at the cuttings ive brought them up you can take them with you when you leave that night merrily called huw owen who took it all unexpectedly seriously listen he said you must never trust the buggers never any of them not at this level covering the phone merrily reached out a foot and prodded the scullery door shut jane in a black mood had joanna newsom on the stereo in the sitting room california gothic cracked and witchy merrily lowered her voice who are we talking about the duchy of cornwall or the royals generally its not so much the royals lass as the c of e the church and the monarchy have been an item for nearly half a millennium but change comes fast these days some of our masters as you know have become a bit wary about a certain individual lets not walk all round this charles most of it dating back to his famous remark about the monarchy when he takes over becoming defender of the faiths plural muslims hindus catholics my god is this a safe pair of hands for the sacred chalice its backs to the cathedral walls lass knives unsheathed in the deepest cloisters ive always liked the way you underplay a drama huw trying to psych out if there was even a hint of a smile on his cratered face as he sat by the racing flames in the inglenook of his eyrie in the brecon beacons smuggled out of his native wales by his mother as a small child and brought up in yorkshire huw was back in the land of his unknown father supervising deliverance courses for c of e clergy in a former nonconformist chapel burned out by decades of hellfire preaching the place where it had begun for merrily this weird ministry not quite as long ago as it sometimes seemed all right maybe im exaggerating huw said im just warning you to watch your back where the royals are concerned the royals and canterbury the smallest rumour can cause a seismic shift and little folks like you can get dropped down the nearest crevice thanks huw ill sleep so much easier tonight im just telling you so merrily shifted the heavy bakelite phone from one ear to the other having established that nobody in ermine or a dog collar is to be trusted whats your considered opinion of why canterbury would need to be kept informed about a house owned by the duchy of cornwall thats alleged to be haunted well they wouldnt would they would they tell the prince or would they try to keep it from him in case he became too curious i think if he is curious hes probably experienced enough now to keep it to himself happen whats more important like your feller at the duchy said is that the press dont get wind of it theyd hound the builder and then theyd hound you mmm you ask me this is just bernie dunmore covering his own back thinking how it might rebound on the diocese if it all went pearshaped and it did go pearshaped sometimes no denying that an inexact science deliverance well not a science at all obviously everybody lives in fear nowadays huw said way things are going deliverance itself could be c of e history in a year or two and what would you do huw if we all got the elbow id retire lass take the pension rent a little shack at the rough end of sennybridge with a back yard and a bog and carry on with the job no bureaucracy no politics no farcical pc synods just me and the naked cross talking of which canon dobbs old buggers dead sophies given me a collection of news cuttings he kept about the prince of wales and the church and other connections why would dobbs keep a royal scrapbook traditionalist of the first order dobbs happen hed started to notice the lad spreading his favours i wouldnt worry about it concentrate on covering your own arse and your specific advice as my spiritual director would be keep all your cards on the table face up merrily shook out a silk cut explain stage one find the former owners of this hovel and see what kind of recent history its got forget the white lady and the phantom stagecoach the home movies you can do without home movies huws latest euphemism for placememories and trapped events that repeated themselves and then if its just what the girl claims she saw and theres nowt blindingly obvious from the last few years stage two would be to set up a lowkey houseblessing for a specific date being careful mind to invite the local incumbent there isnt one a retired guys holding the fort hell do also you want at least one member of the family the folks who flogged the place off to the duchy plus if possible someone from the family as owned it before for many generations you said so im told that would help then and finally this is important you must formally request the presence of an official of the duchy of cornwall the higher up the better wow merrily sat back lit her cigarette smart that way youve acquitted yourself in full view and theyre all involved all implicated flawless it wouldnt be of course it was never that easy and what do you do after that huw said i dont know what do i do after that boss you bugger off out of it just as fast as your cute little legs will carry you what about the woman fuchsia aftercare oh aye there was a lengthy meditative silence she imagined him staring down at his peeling slippers their rubber soles smoking on the edge of the hearth you do need to separate it he said eventually if theres nowt particularly to support it at the house you most likely are looking at a different problem you said she was orphaned abandoned shes certainly had personal problems maybe the house brought something to a head possible how was the blessing curious there wasnt the normal sense of relief afterwards in fact she looked up as if something might have followed us into the church said something like is something coming something like that and laughed i mean its always a problem isnt it you can never be quite sure when somebodys winding you up happen include her in your prayers when you do the cleansing something moving around under the carpet was that what you said dust sheets i suppose a shrink would be talking about demons in her past that shes covered up perhaps she just has a gothic imagination the wriggling under the sheets the face of crumpled linen shes also obviously read a fair amount about healing and deliverance because she knew exactly what she hang on gimme that again lass what crumpled linen a face of crumpled linen thats the image fuchsia claims she saw when she turned around from the wall she was plastering poetic in its macabre way although this wouldve been crumpled plastic aye very literary huw said but then not surprising really its a quote what m r james author of classic ghost stories in the s yeah i know who m r james is i can even tell you which story it comes from whistle what are you oh whistle and ill come to you my lad is the one about the university professor haunted by a malevolent entity which id get hold of a copy if i were you without too much delay youre saying thered been a book of jamess stories amongst fuchsias collection in the caravan orangecoloured spine on the shelf by the wood stove ghost stories of an antiquary all right lass let me get this totally right youre telling me its an actual phrase taken from one of m r jamess ghost stories merrily dropped her cigarette in the ashtray and flopped forward both hands around the old black phone oh bugger bit of a coincidence eh if you have any problems finding the story give us a call and ill scan a few pages and email them across yes thank you huw shit merrily tipped the phone very gently into its rest gazing at her reflection in the dark mirror of the scullery window and into a toofamiliar void heresy this job people learned what you did and envisaged desecrated graves chalices of blood nightlong spiritual struggles with an indelibly black metaphysical evil his satanic majesty the beast their disappointment almost invariably was palpable so youve never really had to rescue anyone from actual demonic possession to which youd shrug and smile awkwardly and admit that rather than the coils of the old serpent it mostly came down to the spirals of the subconscious mind this was the void the thought that there might in the end be nothing there that psychology would not be equipped to explain that people like siân callaghanclarke might just be right about the relevance of what you were doing the dark night of nosoul what in the end you feared most and a dampener on the spirit as merrily drove down into the unknown border using a route shed never travelled before sunken lanes below the bare abraded hillsides windwhipped twisted trees still england it had to be there below the road was the river monnow which was the border failing to be crossed by a smashed and collapsing footbridge fenced off with a sign that said danger but if this wasnt wales neither was it truly herefordshire not with names like bagwllydiart on the signposts rural wales almost all of it now was designated tourist country while herefordshires own tourist country was ledwardine and its neighbouring black and white villages in the north of the county and the lushness of the wye valley in the south the unknown border was only about an hour from ledwardine and sooner or later it would be joining the new cotswolds not for a while though and it certainly had never been nor ever would be east anglia jane had them all natch the penguin complete ghost stories of m r james sitting up in bed last night under the blackened oak beams with her dressing gown around her shoulders and the tawny owls fluting in the churchyard merrily had read oh whistle and ill come to you my lad first published in she couldnt possibly have read it before or even seen it on tv because it really wasnt something that would ever allow itself to be forgotten this story of parkins an academic on a golfing holiday on the suffolk coast and what he discovers there and what discovers him oh parkins says a colleague before he leaves if you are going to burnstow i wish you would look at the site of the templars preceptory and let me know if you think it would be any good to have a dig there in the summer templar preceptory the only immediate connection with the village of garway preceptory the templars term for one of their communities a description apparently unique to this curious order of medieval warrior monks but burnstow according to the authors own foreword was based on a seaside town the whole width of england away merrily had followed parkins into the globe inn where the only room available had two beds sure to be significant as for the templars preceptory all parkins had found there was a series of unpromising humps and mounds oh and in a cavity near the possible site of an altar an old whistle on one side of the whistle it said quis est iste quivenit who is this who is coming if you werent aware of garway hill it meant that you were either on or immediately below it she couldnt see a radio mast only a row of houses like battered ornaments on a shelf overlooking a couple of fields away on the right the church of st michael welcome to garway please drive carefully like you had a choice in lanes like these sanded by the low october sun the church was aloof in its own shallow valley saturday afternoon nobody about the folder containing the directions and the key of the master house lay on the old volvos passenger seat the house was supposed to be within sight of the church tower but only just you should look for two white gateposts one broken in half later maybe if at all thanks to huw owen and m r james the case was as good as closed fuchsia was making it up delusion was another possibility but probably less likely now a right turning brought merrily to the entrance of the churchyard no concessions here to the advent of the motor vehicle parking tight into the hedge she climbed out through the passenger door walking up in jeans and a gomer parry plant hire sweatshirt into a curving and shaded path leading to a mellow enclosure a haze of greens and ambers an awning of birdsong if you wanted to know about a place always check out the church first feel its disposition benevolence or disapproval or more often nowadays a mildewed resignation this one she thought was aware of her she walked up into the bumpy churchyard under the tower plain stone simple pyramidal hat and yet its origins are almost certainly celtic the earliest record of a monastery on the site is in the seventh century sophies notes from the internet but it is not until the arrival of the knights templar in that the history of garway church opens out and at the same time closes in you could apparently still see the foundations of the original circular nave which the templars had created in imitation of the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem the extent of merrilys knowledge of templar architecture she took a step back looking up the tower was square and unadorned stonework like oatmeal biscuit the lower half darker as if it had been dunked in tea two vertical slits near the top on each of the four sides were disconcertingly like allround eyes watchful and mildly amused i suppose seen from above it does look rather as though its neck has been broken like a chickens merrily halfturned he was standing alongside her in walking boots and fishing hat a twotone nylon hiking jacket over his faded blue shirt and clerical collar you see the tower originally was entirely separate from the body of the church which is why its set at such an angle the gap was bridged at a later date as you can see the arrangement would have looked less odd one imagines in the days when the nave was circular im so sorry he bowed his head didnt mean to sneak up it is mrs merrily watkins i hope walking home from the pub when i saw the car and you did look rather purposeful behind the wheel mr murray teddy he bent down to her putting out a hand so glad i realize this must be a terrible bind for you but heavens the gossip this sort of thing engenders usually among people who enter a church no more than twice in their lifetimes carried in and out both times not really what one looks for in retirement no i suppose not actually the reverend murray didnt look old enough or unfit enough to be retired handshake firm eyes vividly blue and skin tanned to the colour of garways lower tower around the stiff white beard and the high bland dome of his forehead never been a particularly pastoral sort of chap merrily when the girl turned up here asking for protection sanctuary i confess i was completely thrown you mean fuchsia fuchsia indeed yes she came here to the church to ask for sanctuary merrily remembered now the bloke at garway he was no help at all sanctuary is perhaps too emotive a word the builder chap was waiting in the entrance in his truck the girl was rather vague disoriented i thought she was anyway i brought her in and said a short prayer you know the routine what did you think she was beg pardon you said when you first saw her you thought she was ah murray straightened up hands behind his back looking up at the tower i thought im afraid that she was probably on drugs a small percentage of the visitors here do tend to be what we used to call potheads found a chap the other week completely out of it lying with his head under the holy spring harmless enough i suppose but not what one expects to see in a country churchyard wheres the holy spring my we are getting down to business arent we ill show you if you like i can show you everything teddy murray extended an arm to steer merrily towards the church entrance it appears to be my principal role in this community guide and interpreter much more my sort of thing i have to say with no little shame than dispensing spiritual succour historian by inclination im afraid and the walks the walks for the guests my wifes guest house tends to cater for people who like to tramp the hills in all weathers i compile the handy routemaps and im available to go along and point things out when required this the rev murray turned and flung out an arm towards the guardian hills is gods own weekend retreat i always say that in fact its in beverleys brochure gods own weekend retreat very erm presumptuous i suppose but there had to be some reason for the templars to favour it remote spot like this was it divine guidance sorry he put up his hands one gets carried away do you want to know all this i only ask because as someones bound to tell you the master house does seem to be contemporaneous with the templars occupation of garway although despite the title it does not appear to have been the home of the preceptor or master so you didnt go back to the master house with fuchsia well no murray looked bewildered she didnt ask me to hardly my property to intrude upon anyway my impression was that you couldnt have dragged her back and in the absence of a fulltime minister here i wasnt sure who it would be best to inform and then events overtook me and so paul how are you a man in jeans and a heavy workshirt had come out of the church leaning on a stick there was a motorized wheelchair on the path outside he stood looking at it with no great love teddy murray took a step forward and the man raised his stick bugger off eh teddy sorry not ready for him yet boy gonner have another bit of a walk round come back for the thing teddy nodded they watched the man making his way up the path he couldnt be more than midthirties thick brown hair ms teddy murmured what kind of luck is that for a farmer he opened the church door stood aside for merrily you been in here before never no sooner were they inside than hed closed the door blew out a breath didnt want to introduce you merrily difficult thats paul gray he and his wife teddy lowered his voice sold the master house to the duchy oh long story bad feeling not for me to still a bit of a newcomer as of course is paul which is one of the problems he laughed you can be here for three generations and theyll still call you a newcomer couple of families go back to the norman conquest so extending an arm what do you think its unusual more than you know merrily nodded taking it in it was quite small but lofty and airy and filled with rosy light the chancel was framed by a classic zigzagged and serrated norman arch wide and theatrical red velvet curtains were drawn across it as if what lay beyond them was not for the unprepared something rare and sacred graillike or perhaps a body in a coffin merrily shook herself too much m r james teddy murray nodded towards a banner with a crusader kind of cross red and gold on white hanging from the pulpit still a major presence then merrily said the templars yes i suppose they are do you know much about them merrily erm she looked up at the dark brown wooden ceiling curved like the bottom of a boat and decorated with a small and regular galaxy of white stars in a pocket of her jeans the mobile phone began to vibrate against her left thigh maybe not as much as i ought to merrily placed a hand over the phone and teddy murray leaned back against a pew end looking down at her with what you could only describe as a beneficent smile evidently all too ready to do what he was better at than dispensing spiritual succour its sometimes difficult to separate the truth from the lurid speculation she told him never a problem for my daughter i suppose he said that few of us like to countenance the idea that the templars guarded the secret of the bloodline of christ through his supposed marriage to mary magdalene oh shes happy enough with that idea i suppose what bothers me most is the idea of the templars or someone guarding the secret resting place of his bones lets not talk of heresy lets not none of it however makes the knights templar less interesting teddy murray said follow me mrs watkins funnies when merrily climbed back into the car the weather had changed the sky had the deep grey lustre of tinfoil and a single slow raindrop rolled down the windscreen like a cartoon tear and she just wanted to be home and lighting a fire she pulled out her phone lol would be on the way to his gig in newtown powys so it was more likely to be jane it was neither just a short text call me mob please fb a text from frannie bliss if it was him this was a first mobile would mean he didnt want to take the call in the cid room she found his number in the index but the signal was on the blink so she reversed out of the church entrance and drove away from the village uphill pulling into a passing place winding up the window against a rising wind nicely timed reverend bliss said youve caught up with me in the gents i totally refuse to picture the scene not good enough anyway too much of an echo ill call you back just give me a couple of minutes to finish up in here echo merrily sat watching the sloping landscape losing its colours in the gathering rain compiling a mental inventory of all the curios that teddy murray had revealed in garway church beginning with the green man the familiar stone face with entwined foliage inexplicably found in churches this one was in the chancel arch and with those stubby horns he wasnt typical there was also a cord or vine with tassels resembling fingers so it looked like he was making a funny face at you waggling his fingers at either side of his head what the green man had to do with the templars teddy couldnt explain but this was a templar church so it must have had some significance everything in a templar church was significant theyd moved on to the matching long stones set into the chancel steps the altar steps and one window ledge these identified by teddy as the lids of templar stone coffins now part of the fabric of the church teddy laughing in his element now the historian the tour guide someone said you can throw the templars out of the building but youll never get the building back from the templars giving her the primaryschool version for which shed been quite grateful the order of the poor knights of christ and the temple of solomon founded in the early twelfth century the time of the crusades ostensibly to protect pilgrims to jerusalem the king of jerusalem baldwin ii had allowed them to establish their headquarters at the alaqsa mosque believed to be the site of the original temple theyd begun it was said with only nine members led by one hugh de payens monastic soldiers red crosses on their surcoats growing over the next century into something internationally powerful influential and very wealthy too wealthy and too powerful by the thirteenth century for the king of france philip iv and the pet pope hed acquired clement v accommodated at the time in avignon the french templars had all been arrested in a series of simultaneous dawn raids on friday october accused of a black catalogue of heresies hang on it hadnt taken much calculation doesnt that mean its exactly im afraid it does seven hundred years ago next saturday i was hoping wed have a permanent minister in place by then but it was not to be it therefore falls to me to conduct some sort of memorial service for the poor chaps you dont sound totally enthused it is so obvious and the problem is what fanatics merrily the known facts about the templars are relatively few the amount of wild speculation has been quite monumental in recent years the da vinci code and its source the holy blood and the holy grail all the preposterous theories undermining the central tenets of christianity as we know it mmm everybody knew about it now the alleged bloodline of jesus from his alleged marriage to mary magdalene the female disciple whose crucial role was supposedly written out of the scriptures by the roman catholic church jane had been quite taken with the idea that the real reason for the suppression of the knights templar had been their guardianship of this secret knowledge and the whereabouts of the tomb of christ unrisen whether or not you accepted this teddy murray had said the charges against the templars were surely made up like many of those levelled at various abbots by henry viiis people during the reformation what kings tended to covet most in religious organizations was their money the last grand master of the order jacques de molay had been burned alive in paris but the persecution had been less extreme in britain where most templars had been allowed to join other monastic orders except apparently the order of hospitallers of st john to which the properties of garway had been transferred de molay was now seen as a martyr and friday the thirteenth because of this thats the reason for the whole superstition and a bunch of slightly distasteful movies such is the received wisdom merrily what rather bothers me is that the church promises to be packed ive had letters from all kinds of organizations wanting to be represented from templar reenactment groups to more shall we say more sinistersounding societies like what teddy had said there seemed to be a number of occultsounding groups whose rituals were supposed to be based on templar practices he said he didnt know much about them merrily knew a little more from huw owens reading list supposedly ancient formulae handed down through renaissance magical orders and then developed by the fashionable fraternities of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries mainly bollocks lucky the anniversary is going to be a saturday then merrily said you think that will change anything i dont its their first opportunity in a century to commemorate the suppression and a century ago few if any of these theories were in the public domain why here there must lots of templar churches all over the country in fact actually no teddy said nothing so perfectly preserved the london temple for instance was wrecked in the blitz theres nowhere more authentic or more isolated and yet getatable hed unlocked the tower dark and starkly atmospheric with its funeral bier and a magnificent medieval oak chest hewn from a massive log whose idea was it to have a memorial service so many people wrote in we couldnt get out of it merrily so im quite anxious that this business with the master house should be dealt with before then do you think that will be possible before next weekend bad enough when the girl arrived wish i hadnt been here merrily had been forced to say that shed do her best to get it wrapped and if huw was right that might be on the cards shed asked teddy where the master house came into the picture one of the templar farms hed said that was all they farmed sheep as did the hospitallers after them as did the locals today not much had really changed in garway merrily was thinking as the mobile chimed to indicate that di bliss had left the building raining hard in the police car park is it frannie its not raining at all and im not in the police carpark im off the premises entirely and if it was known i was calling you id probably have a tail sorry merrily was still thinking about the garway green man who having small stubby horns might be expected also to have a tail all right listen bliss said i may be touching upon something you already know about but why would the gentlefolk that humble coppers like myself used to call the funnies suddenly have become interested in you the funnies im thinking specifically of a feller in an unmarked room at headquarters who very occasionally creeps around this division when its felt that national security might be at stake merrily rubbed vainly at the condensation on the windscreen without the engine running it kept reforming under her palm youre talking about the special branch i hope youre on your own using language like that frannie are you actually saying the special branch are making inquiries about me im saying nothing merrily she scrubbed furiously at the windscreen starting to put it together and it was it was beyond ridiculous what are you doing exactly bliss said trying to see out of the bloody she sank back in her seat im looking into something connected with the duchy of cornwalls investments in herefordshire would that explain anything a short silence except for a car engine somewhere and a clanging that became duller what sounded like bliss moving away from something to a place of greater safety that would possibly explain it yes he said its nothing particularly contentious with respect merrily how would you know bliss paused you want to explain being as were old mates and those smartarsed cloakanddagger twats get right up my nasal passages well she thought about it could see no harm all right the duchy of cornwall have paid good money out of the princes piggy bank for an old farmhouse which their favourite conservation builder is refusing to work on because his girlfriend says its haunted thats it sorry to disappoint obviously id like to be able to tell you that the vengeful spirit of princess dianas been seen around highgrove in a yeah yeah but thats it frannie thats the lot as far as i know i see you dont though do you wheres the threat to national security in that maybe theres more to it than you know ive already been thinking along those very lines these inquiries about me is that still going on i dont know merrily ive been off for a couple of days i got this from karen dowell now promoted to ds by the way they wanted your background potted biog any political connections and oh yeh they wanted to know about little jane and her widely reported altercation with the herefordshire council over the proposed development of colemans meadow wha it was like yobs had strolled up and starting rocking the car calm down merrily its not so unusual and it wouldve been pointed out by somebody fairly quickly that the kids a force of nature as distinct from a rural terrorist it doesnt matter its just merrily sat up dipping into her bag for the silk cut packet the bastards i mean you know what else theyve done dont you someones leaned on the bishop so that hes actually freed me up to to devote all my attention to a minor issue which the way its shaping up may not even be deliverance business the bishops told you this himself bishop dunmore is conveniently away in london until tuesday she lit a cigarette opened the window to let out the smoke which blew back in a blast of wind from garway hill wherever that was from here sod this im going home youre on this now mmm where garway hill be a spectral sheepshagger then would it merrily all right just remember we havent spoken and you know nothing of this if you need to speak to me call the mobile using your mobile as distinct from the vicarage landline you actually think im just being careful bloody hell frannie stay cool merrily switching off the phone she felt hunted exposed focusedon and just tired braindead sod it she took two angry drags on the cigarette and then put it out pulled her waterproof jacket from the back seat and walked out into the rain a lumpy grey mattress of cloud meant that she couldnt see the village or the church tower or anything much apart from the windcombed coarse grass on the other side of a barbedwire fence supposed to be going back to check out the master house but what was the point as merrily was leaving the church teddy murray had said we ah we have a room for you merrily im not sure what you i dont know to be honest teddy i dont live that far away and i cant really understand why the bishop feels the need to inflict me on you oh i think we both know what thats about they want you to put the lid on something firmly as regards my interpretive role i suspect mervyn neale might have had a hand in it the archdeacon been with the bishop when the issue was raised by adam eastgate mervyn and i have known one another for some time he refers people to us people looking for an openair holiday not on a percentage basis i have to add well shed said finally i have a few things to sort out at home so maybe i could ring you tomorrow pleasant enough guy but merrily had been glad to get away his interpretive role suggested hed been appointed by the archdeacon as her native guide useful in some ways but there was a sense of remote control that she didnt like the rain gusted into her face and drummed on the side of her hood she let it come shivering thinking of the wind that had suddenly arisen when parkins the academic in the m r james story had blown experimentally on the old whistle hed found in the remains of the templar preceptory who is this who is coming a figure like windblown rags pursuing parkins along the deserted beach making its final most memorable appearance at night in his room at the globe inn arising under the sheets of the second bed and standing in front of the bedroom door with its arms outstretched and its intensely horrible face of crumpled linen although the dust sheets were plastic you got the idea merrily turned back towards the old volvo with the wind behind her signposts using the mobile from the scullery this was insane she called sophie at home sophies husband andrew answered humphed a bit andrew the architect and cathedral widower they even lived in one of the cloisterish streets behind the close merrily sophie had picked up an extension andrew humphing again and hanging up i was halfexpecting you to call this afternoon the bishop having suggested in an email from the palace this morning that a preliminary written report might be quite useful and you thought odd hes never previously particularly requested a report of any kind on anything relating to deliverance correct it was almost dark the greybrown sky melding with the churchyard wall outside the scullery window still no rain here maybe garway hill had its own climate well sophie it might all be academic now anyway merrily put on the desk lamp and explained in some detail about huw owens m r james revelation never any discretion problems here next to sophie the grave was broadcasting house so the woman made it up ice particles in sophies voice the whole thing either that or her perceptions have been conditioned by her reading habits which seems unlikely why ive no idea presumably youll go back and ask her oh yes that should be revelatory im almost looking forward to it in a rather unchristian way ill try and get over to monkland tomorrow after the morning worship with or without a special branch tail im sorry merrily i may have misheard you didnt merrily looked at the cigarettes on the desk decided against sources close to gaol street intimate ive been checked out by the security services jane too the heritage terrorist this is purely because of your unsolicited proximity to the business interests of the heir to the throne i dont know sophie but youre a minister in the church of england that makes me harmless think about it the amount of surveillance in this country is becoming quite terrifying a pause incidentally have you had a chance to read canon dobbss file on the prince of wales not really its on the desk here ill try and have a look later well sophie said i realize we live in troubled times but i think this has gone far enough leave it with me what are you going to do i think im going to call the bishop in london sophie was probably the only person outside his immediate family with the bishops mobile number im not sure that would really will you be in tonight merrily yeah but i dont want to ruin your night or andrews merrily sophie said with some severity this is what i do merrily sighed pulled over the old black box file and opened it up unwrapped a wodge of a copier paper held together by two rubber bands the top page splashing two headlines charles in health storm top docs slam prince over support for quacks both dated back to the early s when the prince of wales newly married to diana spencer had been appointed president of the british medical association the conservative and seriously cautious organization representing doctors in the uk the bma was not into alternative therapy in fact the hatred of the association for practitioners who had not been through the system knew few bounds you would have thought these guys might have known better than to appoint as their figurehead a man whose famously healthy family had a long history of consulting osteopaths homeopaths and various spiritual healers the first warning came at a dinner for the new president in his speech the prince said how touched hed been that the bma should have even considered electing him adding you may for all i know wish to get rid of me after six months the laughter merrily thought must have been hollow shed thought she remembered the row but was now realizing that she couldnt have fully absorbed it nor been knowledgeable enough at the time to recognize its significance one of the cuttings had an edited transcript of charless speech to the bma it was dynamite basically one of the least attractive traits of various professional bodies is the deeply ingrained suspicion and downright hostility which can exist towards anything unorthodox i suppose it is inevitable that something which is different should arouse strong feelings on the part of the majority whose conventional wisdom is being challenged i suppose too that human nature is such that we are frequently prevented from seeing that what is taken for todays unorthodoxy is probably going to be tomorrows convention perhaps we just have to accept it is gods will that the unorthodox individual is doomed to years of frustration ridicule and failure in order to act out his role in the scheme of things until his day arrives and mankind is ready to receive his message a message which he probably finds hard to explain himself but which he knows comes from a far deeper source than conscious thought merrily lit a cigarette amazing to think hed actually said that to a bunch of doctors it got better or worse depending on your angle of approach through the centuries healing has been practised by folk healers who are guided by traditional wisdom that sees illness as a disorder of the whole person involving not only the patients body but his mind his selfimage his dependence on the physical and social environment as well as his relation to bloody hell the cosmos i would suggest that the whole impossible edifice of modern medicine for all its breathtaking successes is like the tower of pisa slightly offbalance you could imagine some of britains leading physicians having to leave at this point to check their own blood pressure especially if they looked closely at the princes sources merrily found an interview with charles which dobbs or someone had marked down the side in what looked like felt pen it seemed that charles how had she avoided knowing about all this had become interested apparently via the writings of carl jung in the power of dreams coincidence and what he called signposts in other words the idea that individuals were open to guidance from elsewhere the collective unconscious the cosmos that they should be alert for psychic pointers one of which had apparently manifested while charles was in his study attempting to draft his speech to the bma he was quoted as saying it was the most extraordinary thing i was sitting at my desk at the time and i happened to look at my bookshelf and my eyes suddenly settled on a book about paracelsus so i took the book down and read it and as a result i tried to make a speech around paracelsus and perhaps a relook at what he was saying and the ideas he propounded wasnt it time to think again about the relationship between mind and body or body and spirit paracelsus rennaissance physician and herbalist also an occultist of the renaissance period a magician deep waters because it was raining as above jane did the arm movements so below at least she seemed happier the sullen face replaced by the concentration face it always paid to consult jane theyd built a log fire in the parlour and eaten from trays and jane had produced one of her paperbacks with planets and pentagrams on the front paracelsus was just the name he adopted ok his real name was this is interesting theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim from which the word bombast is derived because thats the kind of guy he was always throwing his weight about and losing his cool got up peoples noses can we get back to as above so below paracelsus said the human body was like a microcosm of nature or the universe whatever its the basis of astrology he had this theory that your main internal organs corresponded to individual planets it made serious sense in the renaissance still does in a way he was an occultist though ah see thats a typical church attitude terribly sorry he didnt think of himself as an occultist like nobody did it was science science and philosophy it was like high learning cutting edge like is stephen hawking an occultist i can see where chazza was coming from on this homeopathy operates on this microcosm basis doesnt it i believe it does so you could consider paracelsus as the father of alternative medicine except it wasnt alternative then it was cutting edge state of the art exactly so does this mean the duchy of cornwalls going to be setting up a centre for alternative healing at garway no it theres probably no connection at all im just interested in why the late canon dobbs was interested in the spiritual development of prince charles be a good place for it though mum garway with the knights templar a lot of this started with them and their excavations of the temple of solomon most ritual magic raising of spirits all this goes back to solomon and maybe the whole microcosmmacrocosm thing sometimes i wish you didnt know all this merrily said and jane smiled happy ish down on the rug arms around her knees watching baby flames scurrying from log to log shed be happier still if she knew shed been checked out by the special branch but perhaps this wasnt the time to enlighten her i was over in colemans meadow this afternoon jane said i thought it was all fenced off it is but coops has a key to the temporary gate coops jane turned from the fire picked up merrilys look neil cooper the guy from the county archaeologists department oh actually hes pretty pissed off been trying to leave for a while too young obviously to be tied to local government hed like to be a field archaeologist but hes afraid of what will happen at colemans meadow if he quits now in what way it had gone suspiciously quiet since the initial excitement over the discovery of the three longburied megaliths in colemans meadow jane had been euphoric about the stones because the field was bisected by what she and the great visionary alfred watkins before her had considered to be a seminal ley line linking ledwardine church with the iron age earthworks on the summit of cole hill the villages holy hill hills again always hills ok jane said you know about rescue archaeology right this is where archaeologists are given a specific period of time to excavate an area scheduled for development its what most archaeology is these days thanks to the rampant overpopulation thats suffocating britain jane scowled time we scrapped all family allowance if youve got more than two kids so its like three kids no more benefits four kids compulsory sterilization thats your personal concept is it janes politics could veer from extreme left to extreme right and back again within seconds extreme being the only constant i dont know weve got to do something havent we like i dont care what colour people are or what they worship as long as there are less of them fewer merrily said you clergy are just so pedantic but to return to colemans meadow yeah well obviously its our beloved councillor lyndon pierce gomer shouldve buried that bastard with the jcb while he had a chance gomer almost wound up in court as it is he wanted to go to court he told me he wanted his day in court so he could stand up and publicly accuse pierce of corruption and get it into the papers if you say something in court youre like immune from getting sued for slander mmm it was interesting the way pierce had declined to give evidence and the police inquiry had been dropped however ok jane plopping down next to merrily on the sofa the situation is that pierce and some of his fascist friends in the councils socalled cabinet want it confined to rescue archaeology which means coops is allowed to get the site excavated and learn what he can from it and then they have to give it back like take the stones away or something and then give back the meadow so all thats left is like maps and stuff in a report and the housing estate goes ahead which would be crass soulless and a total crime as well as obviously destroying the ley im with you there what can we do to stop it ok well theres a small lobby inside the council supported by the heritage guys and the tourist guys suggesting that if the stones were reerected theyd be the best prehistoric remains in the county and a major tourist attraction so potentially better for the local economy than an estate of fourbedroomed houses with double garages means we get coachloads of tourists but still the lesser of two evils so what are you proposing to do nothing janes face had gone blank coops says its best if i do nothing at present dont give pierce any ammunition and you youre going along with that coops is a very persuasive guy in his quiet way merrily watched jane selecting a new dry log for the fire considering the options in the basket the ash or the oak fast burnslow burn dont suppose eirion called wouldnt know jane said insouciant havent had the mobile switched on all day the call came just after ten jane was watching law and order the one about sex crimes merrilys eyes closing when the mobile chimed on the arm of the sofa sophie rang me the bishop said doleful two seconds bernie merrily took the mobile into the kitchen where the cold air was like a razor the aga had swallowed two gallons of oil a day but it had had its compensations i suppose a grovelling apologys due the bishop said all i can say is that i kept nothing from you not intentionally thats reassuring kind of and im still no wiser merrily although yes i am now inclined to believe that the initial information i was given by adam eastgate is probably incomplete incomplete thats a very elastic word bernie whether any concealment of information is down to the duchy i would personally doubt i dont think adams the sort of man to play a double game however i ah sophie did say shed felt obliged to tell you that wed also had a call from ah a private number in canterbury yes well whoever it was from i was advised that the best way of dealing with this might be simply to allow my deliverance consultant to devote herself to uncovering what there is be uncovered without the usual constraints on her time it was canterbury who wanted the investigation so lets just clarify this bernie there is more to it than a decidedly iffy haunting im assuming there is i honestly do not know but someone in canterbury does im not sure bernie were not somehow indirectly working for the security services are we good god merrily all right suppose i was to conclude that the ghost story was a fabrication you can do that its a possibility then please do it the bishop said soonest afterwards she felt exhausted but couldnt settle with the halfeight eucharist tomorrow she ought to be in bed but she made two mugs of hot chocolate took one to jane in the parlour then came back sat down in the scullery and reopened the phone rang felix barlow and asked if it would be ok to come and speak to fuchsia tomorrow i know its late felix but i need to fit it into my fairly rigid sunday schedule im sorry hang on would you felix didnt sound happy merrily heard him moving back into his tin home and thought there were raised voices she drank some chocolate lit a cigarette still unsure of what to make of this it wasnt unprecedented but if you excluded council tenants desperate to be rehoused it was rare for anyone to invent a ghost story rarer still for anyone to transpose a relatively well known fictional story into a real situation after just over a minute felix returned and told merrily that fuchsia didnt want to talk to her no offence to you mrs watkins she gets like this maybe leave it a few days a few days well get back to you all right no im afraid its not all right im under a certain pressure to get this sorted one way or youre under pressure she heard the clangs of him hurriedly clambering down the caravan steps into the night then his voice upclose and frayed tell the duchy we wont be touching that job now under any circumstances all right but that yeah i know this is me burning my boats with them for ever and thats some kind of madness and im going to regret it for a long time but thats the size of it he was panting has something happened felix weve told you everything we can why do you need us any more because merrily really didnt want to say any of this to him she needed to put it directly to fuchsia but it was late and she was overtired and because im not sure you have told me everything i have to go now where is she in the bathroom doing her hair she got soaked tell me one thing has anyone else been to talk to her about that house or to you why would they i dont know you think fuchsias holding something back is it mrs watkins or do you think shes lying i think we need to discuss it again thats all you think shes lying mrs watkins oh god why had she made this call why hadnt she thought about it first or maybe prayed for advice sat in silence and listened to the voice inside hows she been felix since the blessing through the scullerys open doorway the kitchen clock ticked off the seconds of silence in the phone i think shes been back felix said back to garway to the master house i had to go and collect some timber for the barn and when i got home she wasnt here gone off in the van when she got back it was dark she said shed been shopping in hereford which is something she never does on a saturday hates crowds how do you know she went back to the house because we still got a key to the place when i said id take it back to the duchy adam said no hurry likely still thinking we might go back to the job one day and the key was missing its back now and no she wont talk about it all right merrily said how about i come over now no i think it might help it might help you it wouldnt help me if she wont let me go back to the bloody place because its so evil why did she go there again you explain that i cant i wish id known i was in garway this afternoon too at the house no i was at the church i didnt go to the house why not good question because id decided i was being misused underinformed shortchanged because i was pissed off because it was raining if id known she was there i would have obviously christ what a mess felix can you ask her to ring me can you tell her its very important all right he said ill try and get her to call you any time doesnt matter how late yes on which basis merrily took the mobile to bed and kept waking up in the night thinking she was hearing its electronic chimes although she never did ghosts and scholars usually after a eucharist you were aware of subtle ambient changes a charge of energy a sharpening a recolouring on a fine day shards of sunlight spilling between the apples in the rood screen raising shivers of gold dust in the air this was not a fine day when merrily unlocked the church under a sky like a gravestone the interior had been unresponsive sixteen people had since taken holy communion afterwards nothing much seemed to have altered or so she felt blaming herself and her headache im so sorry shirley west said in the vestry cradling the empty chalice like a sick baby im so terribly clumsy i just get nervous im afraid merrily but you didnt knock it over i very nearly did shirley i nearly do most weeks ive stopped worrying about it you were often told that a mass was supposed to be like perfect theatre conducted with precision and grace shirley said i have no grace shirley merrily shook her head thats not true which was a lie but what could you say shirley had come to live in ledwardine a few months ago and had shown up in the church before the removal van had left she was in her early forties overweight divorced a bank manager in leominster she had family here shed come to virtually every service moving up rapidly to giving out hymn books arranging flowers and assisting eventually with the eucharist altar girl someone said in the shop shirley said that theres been talk of those old stones they found in the ground being put back up mmm its a possibility merrily looked up from the chalice into deepset brown eyes full of worried fervour shouldnt we be doing something to try to stop it stop it the raising of heathen stones opposite our church erm well you wont see them from the church will you shirley youve got the market square in between and the market hall besides i suppose they were here first and duly toppled over and buried there was a christian purpose to that surely i think it was probably more to do with three big stones getting in the way of ploughing and haymaking evidently nobody had told shirley about janes pivotal role in the discovery of the colemans meadow stone row parish life complications everywhere the thing is shirley quite a lot of medieval churches were actually built on the sites of prehistoric stone circles and burial chambers exactly burying the evil under the house of god surely im not sure if prechristian necessarily means evil our lord was born into a world full of darkness he was the light of the world and in fact looking at it in a practical way most archaeologists seem to think the early christians put the new churches in the places where local people were used to worshipping ive never heard that shirley looked at her eyes narrowed merrily sighed nothings ever quite as it seems huw owen said on the answering machine give me a call would you priests rarely phoned one another on sundays merrily had twenty minutes before having to go back for the morning service shed only slipped home in the hope of finding a message from fuchsia or at least felix shed been worrying about it on and off since waking into the grey light suppose felix had gone back into the caravan and told fuchsia that she was being accused of lying before calling huw back she tried ringing felix phone switched off for possibly the first time ever she took the mobile back to the church with her calling huw from a damp bench in the graveyard catching him in his land rover between parishes the signal wasnt brilliant might be pu oincidences huw on the handsfree breaking up you should know james collection foreword mentions based ordshire call you back mobile huw on the mobile getting interested glances now from fragments of congregation filtering through the lychgate in most parishes the morning service was as good as it got congregationwise evensong having been dumped through low attendance here mornings had actually been overtaken by the sundayevening meditation even though the rumours of healing had long since died down it was satisfying a good reason to be able to be here tonight rather than at mrs murrays guest house in garway merrily waved to james bulldavies a fairly impoverished remnant of the ledwardine squirearchy and his partner alison kinnersley who when she and jane had first come to ledwardine had been living with lol always faintly troubled alison would return tonight for the meditation alone james wasnt into silence a nervous sun tested the clouds and the phone chimed the stalls of barchester huw said sorry m r james mentions in his foreword to the collected edition that his barchester cathedral was partly based on hereford cathedral id forgotten that herefordshire was also the imagined setting for one of the later stories a view from a hill i thought they were always set in east anglia sorry to complicate matters lass no engine rattle now hed parked up somewhere but it seems that james monty as he was known came to relate to rural herefordshire extremely well you could even say it became a refuge for him you didnt know this before of course i didnt else idve mentioned it how come you know it now how does any bugger know owt these days i googled montague rhodes james and found an unusually erudite website called ghosts and scholars devoted entirely to the man how much do you know about him hardly anything he was an academic wasnt he divided his career between eton his old school and kings college cambridge son of a clergyman brought up in the parish of livermere in suffolk moody sort of place apparently very inspirational in later years he reckoned there was only one area to match it let me guess aye specifically the countryside around kilpeck and much dewchurch four miles from garway five thereabouts the trail however does lead to garway itself merrily pulled her cloak over her knees wanting a cigarette watching an unexpected sunbeam stroking a mossy headstone where was this going monty never married huw said but he did have a close though presumed platonic female friend called gwendolen mcbryde widow of his good mate james mcbryde a talented artist illustrated some of the early stories gwen was pregnant when he died very young and gave birth to a daughter mother and daughter moved to herefordshire as youngish widows with daughters sometimes do oh sod it she pulled her bag onto the bench found the cigarettes seems monty would visit gwen on quite a regular basis huw said finding the countryside much to his taste like i said monty was very fond of old churches and extremely knowledgeable about them no big surprise that hed visit garway if you say so this is the point after montys death gwen published a collection of his letters letters from a friend in one of them james recalls a particular visit to garway in i think actually there are two mentions of garway but one just in passing the one you need to know about well ive already emailed it to you best if you read it when you get back home huw for heavens sake the woman who edits the website rosemary pardoe says monty appears to have had quote a peculiar experience at garway the nature of which is quote tantalizingly unclear but which he writes about with typical spooky jamesian humour saying read it when you get back i dont want you thinking im embroidering it winding you up some places just attract this kind of thing huw have to be off anyroad ive work to do and so have you and then he wasnt there the bastard but if hed thought it was so important surely hed have told her couldnt make it up after the service when everybody else even shirley west had gone merrily had a furtive cigarette with gomer parry behind the tower asking him what the feeling was in the village about the resurrection of the old stones in colemans meadow maybe most people would actually prefer a new estate of executive homes ent so much that vicar gomer said few more fancy houses ent the argument tip o the muckheap its whos in bed with lyndon pierce who wants to see the village turned into a town supermarkets and posh restaurants and whos on young janeys side and yours gomer lets not forget that ar ill be doin my bit sure to to see pierce gets his arse kicked vicar the light was back big time in gomers wirerimmed glasses his white hair topping his weathered brown face like the froth on beer councillor pierce had said gomer parry was halfway senile an old joke who ought to be in a home gomer would need to be a long way into senility to forget that harchaeologists needs a jcb and a driver he said wont be no charge from me thats very generous of you gomer im sure janell see it gets back to the right people erm you know felix barlow barlow gomer adjusted his cap screwed up his eyes builder from monkland knows danny ar met the feller a few times over the years he dont build no mocktudor rainbowstone crap dont build nothin new at all fars i can see good bloke oh straight i reckon liked a drink at one time so i yeard thatd be when he was married when was that eight years nine i lose track but i remember his wife oh hell aye i remember her all right it started to rain merrily leaned into the base of the tower you know lizzie nugent gomer said widow up by bearswood dont think so husband left her with two kids and a twentyacre smallholdin i was over attendin to some ditchin one day early march itd be when the gales blows the roof off lizzies cowshed smashed to bits so i calls a few people see if we could get some galvanized cheapish and somebody puts me on to felix barlow he comes round in his truck that same day with these sheets off a shed hes took down and we fixed the ole roof between us took us n moren a few hours and when he found out lizzie ent got no insurance he was very reasonable about it was felix no question bout that gomer ignited his rollup hands cupped around it were havin a cuppa with lizzie afterwards when up comes this bloody great white bmw woman inside leanin on the horn till felix goes out givin him hell we could all of us year it folks in the next villaged likely year it all this what you doin yere when you oughter be up at lady soandsos what you think you are bloody registered charity this is mrs barlow goodlookin woman mind but it ent everythin is it erm no i suppose not barlow goes around helpin too many poor widows wheres the next bmw comin from you met the woman hes with now the hippie never met her no vicar gomer waved his ciggy fellers a bit alternative hisself mind builder as ent into cheating his clients thats alternative for a start ennit merrily laughed knows the job too could be in an office collar and tie directin operations but he knows that money ent everythin no moren a goodlookin woman is she is a goodlooking woman as it happens the hippie and not much more than half his age oh well gomer shrugged teeth crushing the ciggy just cause a feller spends all his time shorin up ole buildings dont mean all his tools is obsolete merrily blinked merrily didnt know what m r james had looked like the only face she could see in her mind was huws framed by hair like driedout straw mounted on an agedulled dogcollar and settling into a complacent conjurors smile we must have offended somebody or something at garway i think i wondered why you were so anxious jane said to borrow the m r james always a danger with emails shed been on the computer in the scullery researching some aspect of stone rows when huws mail had come through shed read it looked up the references been into the ghosts and scholars website you couldnt make it up jane said still sitting at the desk impressed excited merrily walked to the window oh hell mr james could make it up though couldnt he i mean that was what he did oh mum it was a letter to his friend someone who obviously knew exactly what he was on about he doesnt spell it out does he he knows she understands his point of reference mmm possibly merrily read the rest of it probably we took it too much for granted in speaking of it that we should be able to do exactly as we pleased next time we shall know better there is no doubt it is a very rum place and needs careful handling no the kid was right you couldnt make it up she could see why huw had insisted on emailing the whole page from the ghosts and scholars website something had happened to m r james at garway either something faintly curious which jamess serpentine imagination had inflated into something disturbing or something seriously disturbing which james in this otherwise routine letter to a female friend was deliberately making light of the editor of the website had made a kind of pilgrimage to the area to track down the settings for the main herefordshire story a view from a hill although the story seemed to be set in the general area of garway the village itself didnt appear to feature even under a different name i love this guy jane was glowing greatest ghoststory writer ever because he just well basically he just he didnt do ghosts what did he do then entities he did entities creeping things indefinable things exuding malevolence in traditional settings like old churches and deserted shores and places with burial mounds according to the website he once said there was no point at all in writing about the supernatural if it wasnt evil doesnt that kind of invalidate the bible he meant fiction mum wow merrily said theres a step forward for you i mean complete fiction anyway he wasnt exactly antireligious his old man was a vicar in suffolk he was brought up in the church he might even have gone that way himself if he hadnt got into academic research and teaching and stuff and did you know he came to this area well no i just didnt its incredible but youve read all the stories erm jane fiddled with the mouse not all of them to be completely honest you totally love him but you havent read all his stories ok mainly ive just seen the tv versions i dont remember us watching them remembered them being on usually around christmas and mostly before jane had been born erm i didnt mean us janes face had clouded i saw them at irene eirions his dad had a complete set of the videos and we watched most of them one night one after the other it was it was pretty good we were on our own and we scared ourselves silly that mustve been a long night watching them all not that long jane looked away they only lasted half an hour each or a bit longer oh jane jane merrily guessing theyd watched them tucked up together in eirions bed when his parents were out anyway jane said the tv versions were obviously set in east anglia or somewhere to be honest i bought the book but i only got round to reading a couple and i didnt read the foreword otherwise idve known about him coming here obviously im now going to read everything im going to find a biography its amazing mmm it was certainly a complication did fuchsia know m r james had been to garway it was not unlikely so jane sat back hands behind her head whats your angle on this mum oh it its just somebody else who scared themselves silly in a house belonging to prince charles did i tell you that not directly but i just happened to click on history and found the duchy of cornwall website merrily nodded resigned right didnt mean to snoop but this one was interesting and you know it never goes any further with me not any more idve told you all about it if youd asked i know but anyway sorry so like the house is at garway then with the knights templar church how did you get on to m r james because theres a mention of a templar preceptory in one of his stories oh whistle and ill come to you my lad that one is really scary in the tv version this professor hes not what youd call sociable and he just goes around kind of mumbling to himself on this grey beach and then he do you know of any more any more stories mentioning the knights templar no but i could email this website and ask this rosemary pardoe who obviously knows like everything about m r ok merrily said why not whatever had happened to m r james at garway he didnt appear to have used it in a story but perhaps he had in some less obvious way if hed been at garway in it would have to be one of the later ones and fuchsia whatever fuchsia had seen or imagined or invented at garway shed linked it to a story set in east anglia albeit with a templar connection james had talked of next time next time we shall know better you sensed a residual fascination holy shit jane look at this jane had read further down to where rosemary pardoe was passing on her own observations about garway church and its environs merrily leaned across the dovecote mum did you know about this sophie mentioned it its apparently the finest of its period in the country oh yeah that too now read the rest go on it was built by the knights templar probably and then rebuilt by the hospitallers who took over at garway go on read it jane stood up merrily sat down as well as the ancient garway church itself with its semi detached thirteenthcentury tower there is a huge dovecote on private property on the adjoining farm its doveholes number a worrying oh when are you going back jane said and can i come when she went upstairs to change into jeans and sweatshirt merrily took the mobile with her and called felix again from the bedroom unsure now of how best to approach this it was all subtly turning around m r james himself becoming a player seventy or so years after his death as for the dovecote if it had been there for the best part of eight centuries it was a bit late now to start worrying about the implications of dovechambers the person you are calling is not available if you would like to leave a message felix its merrily could you or fuchsia please call me i need to talk about the she hesitated the face of crumpled linen crumpling her cassock for the wash basket she put on jeans and the gomer parry sweatshirt the alarm clock said oneforty meditation was seventhirty she swallowed two paracetamol in the bathroom came back downstairs to find jane still hanging around in their chilly kitchen not got a meeting with erm coops today jane shook her head she looked less happy her face a little flushed there were crossroads in her life do you want to drive then merrily said part two this is wild frontier country with an aura of barbarians roaming over the adjacent border simon jenkins on garway englands thousand best churches as above what jane knew about the templars came of course out of paganism those difficult months when shed been a teenage goddessworshipper slipping out into the vicarage garden at night to make her devotions to the lady moon partly a rebellion thing ok understandable in an intelligent imaginative kid whod been dragged away to the unknown village where her mother had become a lowpaid lowlevel employee of the boring setinitsways maledominated hierarchical church of england janes paganism partly about giving christianity a good kicking merrily watched her driving back straight hands textbook on the wheel eyes unblinking remembering the alltimelow a couple of years ago with the heat of the old aga at her back a whitefaced jane rigid in the kitchen doorway and their relationship trampled into the flagstones nobody gives a shit for your church your congregations are like laughable in twenty years youll be preaching to each other you dont matter any more you havent mattered for years im embarrassed to tell anybody what you do the rage had evaporated tensions long since eased but janes pagan instincts remained tamer now certainly but still feeding something inside her that was hungry for experience up in her attic apartment she was still reading books about old gods like for centuries its been accepted that the templars were the guardians of arcane secrets including the holy grail i mean who better they were spiritual warriors they put their lives on the line to protect sacred truths they were like the sas with soul who says the sas have no soul unlike the templars however theyre not known for their monastic celibacy jane said theyd driven in from the east less of a back door to garway and better roads for jane who was hoping to take her driving test before christmas the sun was low and intense a searchlight spraying the yellowing leaves on the turning trees when you werent driving you got a more spectacular overview or underview maybe all you could see of garway hill itself was the top of the radio mast on its summit changing down for a sudden incline jane let the clutch slip sorry its ok take your time jane redfaced pulled the car out of its shudder the volvo wheezing and protesting like an old dog being dragged out for a walk by a child who didnt understand so if the holy blood and the holy grail concept is that the grail is actually the suppressed feminine principle as like enshrined by mary magdalene who was jesus christs other half and dont look at me like that mum you dont know how im looking at you your eyes are firmly on the road i can feel the selfrighteous hostility its not selfrighteous and its not hostility its just that all thats been discredited even the authors are now saying they were just testing a theory it doesnt change the fact that mary magdalene whether or not she was mrs christ represents the goddess figure which maledominated christianity suppressed janes debating skills had become formidable but how many times had they been here look i accept that there may be a hidden feminine principle what i dont accept is jesus and mary magdalene being an item starting a bloodline for which when you look into it theres no real evidence at all aw mum why do you have to deny the poor guy a sex life there you go the guy if he was just a guy just another prophet who didnt rise again didnt ascend into heaven if you want to deny his divinity i dont want to deny anybodys divinity im into divinity big time but i dont see why women shouldnt have a share of it whether its mary magdalene or the virgin mary we wont argue now merrily said take this bit slowly maybe she ought to be driving instead the lanes were proving unpredictable and there were more of them than shed figured more to garway too than you imagined flushed by the low sun it seemed like a remote and separate realm like cornwall was to england maybe the duchy had recognized that aspect jane glanced at a signpost which seemed to have been twisted round so that garway was pointing into a field so garway and garway hill are like separated right looks like it i thought the church and a few cottages nearby were the centre of the community but apparently not you get these separate clusters kind of disorienting after half a mile or so the landscape broadened out and they were into a random scatter of modern housing and an open stretch of common with a childrens play area across the lane from the common was a pub of whitewashed stone with a swinging sign a full moon in a deepening twilight sky the garway moon cool sign jane said artistic kind of pagan why does the moon always have to be pagan you tell me does the bible have much to say about it jane relaxed into the drivers seat this is very much my kind of place mum its like frontier country on the edge it is frontier country those hills are wales i actually meant frontier in the deeper sense the knights templar move in monks with horses and swords and they stamp their presence on the whole area infuse it with mystery i mean like why out here unless maybe it was considered a really good obscure place to conceal secrets practise arcane practices or they were just given the land maybe no better reason than that theres always a better reason jane said for you flower there always has to be dont call me flower and dont tell me youre not curious too i can be curious without having to subscribe to the whole fashionable gnosticism thing jane slowed as the road sloped past a modernish primary school on one side and a rundown village hall on the other i dont see whats so wrong with gnosticism its just saying that faith is not enough the gnostics wanted to know they wanted direct experience of the reality of something out there god whatever i dont see why you have a problem with that anyway not now huh too weighty idve thought youd lived in the sticks long enough to know its absolutely the worst place to keep a secret yeah now but in medieval times when almost nobody could read including the templars most of the knights templar seem to have been illiterate mum they were international bankers people could stash money at one preceptory and withdraw from another since when did banking demand literacy ok then maybe this was just where they came to carry on their own form of gnostic worship which the straight church would see as heresy jane pulled the volvo over to the grass verge to let a tractor get past was that all right except you shouldve signalled first to let him know what you were doing and why are we going up here inexplicably jane had taken an uphill right sorry i thought i think the church was straight on down the hill never mind carry on it didnt matter merrily suddenly wanted to hug jane if the worst you had to deal with was theological debate you ok mum mmm she felt the pressure of tears deciding that when jane wasnt around she was going to ring eirion on the quiet find out what had gone wrong between them just wanting the kid to be happy this sort of location is actually more suited to the cistercians jane said they liked to be way out on their own but see that fits too because the knights templar were connected with the cistercians through bernard of clairvaux the top cistercian fixer smartest operator in the medieval catholic church i know who you mean im just impressed at the extent of your knowledge its in the medieval history syllabus just our history guy robbie williams its his period so what happened bernard cleared up the problem the templars had about being devout christians and also having to kill people on a regular basis simple solution he ruled that it was ok to kill nonchristians especially muslims merrily said a medieval interpretation which now seems to operate in reverse whats your point comes back to paganism again of all the medieval monastic orders the cistercians were the ones who most reflected prechristian religion the old ways some sources might say that but come on natural successors to the druids sheep farmers who liked relative isolation and were into ancient sites and earthforces and sacred springs natural running water was very much prized in the days before taps merrily said and sure maybe they dowsed for it that doesnt mean garway church has a holy spring doesnt it it does and if you can find somewhere to turn this car around well go back and check it out no not there jane keep your eyes on the did you see that sign janes head swivelling on the house mmm im afraid i did theyd passed a grey stone corner house which might once have been a pub and still had a big yellow sign on the side the sun a mystical golden sun with a smuglooking curledlipped face and waving tendrils of radiance below it were sunflowers and a naked figure on a horse merrily also noticed that the farmhouse almost opposite had a name plate the rising sun its just an old pub sign jane thats all mum it was like a giant tarot card the sun and the moon this place had two pubs called the sun and the moon that says nothing to you im reserving my opinion i think i was probably guided to turn up this road you dont say as above so below jane said the holy well was at the bottom of the churchyard like most holy wells it was disappointing a trickle under the wall ribbons on a nearby bush which could be down to either visiting pagans or local kids jane crouched down unzipping her white hoodie holding cupped hands underneath the water merrily was reminded uncomfortably of the author winnie sparke who had hung around the wells in malvern and what had happened to her jane you know how much i really hate doing the motherhen bit but that water jane looked into her cupped hands but didnt drink the water she smiled and dabbed some on her cheeks beyond the body of the church the verticallysliteyed tower gazed down with what merrily took to be a kind of benign cynicism if we go back to the church we can see the outline of the original circular nave templar trade mark designed in honour of the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem on the other hand jane stood up and walked off to the edge of the churchyard if we go along here we should be able to see the dovecote designed to commemorate the beast its on private land wed need to ask for permission not just to see it jane why else was she here was already walking across a marshylooking field towards the fringe of a farm with barns storage tanks a galvanized shed and some kind of stone silo merrily wrong shoes as usual bugger stepping uncertainly across a boggy bit following a shallow stream while slowly realizing that the stone silo on the edge of the farmyard clutter was probably what they were looking for she stopped and confronted it a squat round tower like a sawnoff roofless hopkiln the fading sun balanced on its rim jane shading her eyes doesnt look very evil from here merrily said why should it be evil jane turning in annoyance thats just christian propaganda anyway recent translations of the book of rev from the ancient greek suggest it might actually be six one six not being much of a greek scholar i may have to continue to be wary of whatever jane said it does suggest a kind of partly submerged mystical awareness doesnt it it does sacred architecture its a dovecote everything is significant another pointer to this whole hill being a store of arcane knowledge i cant believe coops and his guys havent checked this place out i need to ask him jane i think merrily shut up some mothers with daughters it was pregnancy abortion drugs if the worst you had to worry about was your kid creating a fantasy landscape and coops of course maybe she ought to find out more about coops fantastic energy here mum jane began whirling around with her arms spread wide eight years old again cant you feel it not to speak of no the sun had tucked itself under the rim of the tubular dovecote the ground dropping into shadow and merrily was aware of a damp pattering as jane said you just dont want to admit and then was staggering back something long and grey and damp surging between them god merrily lurching towards jane through the wet grass a womans voice crying out behind her roscoe when jane sat down in the grass it was on top of her pinning her down all over her face tail waving thank god a woman with shoulderlength whiteblonde hair threw down a short leather doglead you bastard roscoe the dog shifted from jane looked back at the woman seeming bemused obviously thought she was offering to play with him the woman said is it racist nowadays to say the irish wolfhounds the stupidest bloody creature on four legs you all right darling i sure jane had struggled upright holding roscoes hairy head against a hip to prove that she wasnt afraid of him if there hadnt been energy in the air before there was now teach you to stand there in a place like this the woman said calling out the number of the bloody beast fearsome tradition the woman picked up the doglead she wore an ancient barbour flayed almost white in places full of holes and flakily at odds with her rosepink silk scarf her face was long and thinlipped and older than the barbour but by how much was anybodys guess if were on your land merrily said i apologize frowning at jane who was brushing herself down smudged brown paw marks down the front of the white hoodie it isnt my land dont worry the woman patted her knee and roscoe ambled over and she attached his lead as a mobile phone beeped inside the barbour not that ownership of most of the land around here isnt open to some kind of dispute excuse me a moment reining in the wolfhound she dug out the mobile pushed back her straight white hair and held the phone to an ear without turning or moving away mr hinton good afternoon no not yet im afraid as you may not have noticed its sunday yes indeed im expecting the delivery in the next week and as soon as it gets here i shall bring it round yes i guarantee youll love it guarantee it money back yes absolutely well talk again mr hinton the woman clicked off the phone dropped it into a coat pocket farmers they think everybody works on sundays the columbarium yes why does it have chambers not often spoken of locally as you see by its situation we tend not to advertise our antiquities why not jane asked its supposed to be unique no idea the woman smiled exposing a dark and raunchy slit between upper front teeth setting light to deepset but vivid bluegreen eyes but then i was merely born here we tend nowadays to rely on outsiders usually americans to explain all our mysteries whereve you come from merrily told her ledwardine in the north of the county aware of time moving on the need to take a brief look at the master house before they left youre no use at all then the woman patted her pockets havent got a fag on you by any chance slim chance nowadays i know actually i have merrily reached down to her shoulder bag only silk cut im afraid that would be perfect m dear left my buggers on the mantelpiece and im absolutely gasping thank you she mouthed a cigarette and merrily lit it for her and she swallowed a lungful of smoke head tilted back to exhale it into the sky in the direction of the devils dovecote lit up in the pub the other night in joyful contravention of the law chap looking at me as if id pissed on his shoes bloody government how dare they merrily looked at jane jane was wideeyed and trying not to laugh ledwardine eh the woman lowering her eyes to merrilys gomer parry plant hire sweatshirt and you evidently know the little digger chap with specs that you or i might use to track the canals on mars i didnt realize gomer worked so far out needed new field drains in a hurry ditches overflowing quagmire my regular chap had packed it in but absolutely refused to recommend anyone local hed worked for the grays you see and oh my god you cant work for the grays and the gwilyms you were here yesterday with murray werent you so fascinated that i came back thought so squinting at merrily through the smoke and a frond of hair nicotineblonded fallen forward a worn elegance about her bad penny said merrily oh i dont think so mrs watkins and you thought the intelligence services in ledwardine were fast merrily took a step back the woman held up her cigarette not habitually nosy but living here one learns there are things its as well to know about as not so yes i do know who you are she snatched another puff blowing the smoke out sideways and what you do not exactly a chance encounter then merrily said no sorry the woman switched the cigarette to her left hand putting out the right morningwood mrs freerange eggs and honey and herbs the woman whod told felix the master house was unhappy they shook hands this is jane my daughter of course girl involved in a fracas with the wretched council i applaud you m dear would have been there mself with a placard but always too busy merrily sighed mrs morningwood this is all very impressive darling its not impressive at all truth of it is roscoe and i happened to be padding quietly through the church precincts yesterday afternoon when murray was kind enough to identify you by name you mustve been behind the church tower no wish to intrude merrily imagined mrs morningwood flattened against the stonework with a hand around the wolfhounds muzzle not that this would have been necessary you couldnt help noticing how docile and obedient roscoe had become since being set on jane and the rest was down to google directing me immediately to your diocesan website deliverance thats really what theyre calling it nowadays mixed blessing google brass tacks mrs watkins if you like all right mrs morningwood flicked away an inch of ash save some time i ask you why youre here you say whats it to you you prying cow i then try to convince you that i might be able to assist in some way being the nearest neighbour of whoevers attempting to live in that benighted hovel at any particular time the master house socalled and now interestingly or mystifyingly perhaps in the ownership of the heir to the throne should we feel honoured do you suppose merrily said attempting to live there if you were able to point to anyone whod succeeded youd have a sight longer memory than me m dear am i to understand youve been invited to subject the place to some form of exorcism thats probably overstating it we havent even found it yet want to find it now that was the original plan but now we dont have much time not much time is probably an advantage an excuse to get out of there mrs morningwood patted her thigh and the dog crept close follow me the sun had been reduced to a reddening corona on the rim of the dovecote they followed her back to where the volvo was parked up against the hedge on the edge of the churchyard then along the lane and into a layby concealing the entrance to a mud track all too easy to miss cigarette poking from her lips mrs morningwood began pulling nettles away from the bars of a galvanized gate with her bare hands a rural skill that merrily had never mastered impressive entrance seems to seal itself up in a matter of days even at this time of year make of that what you will not you jane merrily said and jane smiled and moved alongside mrs morningwood at the jammed gate mrs morningwood can i ask you something before i forget why were there two pubs around here called the sun and the moon before my time child i was thinking that the knights templar were well into astrology jane said were they you dont know much about the templars problem at garway mrs morningwood freed the gate with a ferrous clatter prising it from the post is separating fact from legend you probably know the saying about the garway witches no therell be nine witches from the bottom of orcop to the end of garway hill as long as water runs and are there to my knowledge only me mrs morningwood let loose a short throaty laugh herbs darling i grow various medicinal herbs make potions and flog them at the farmers markets two fingers up to the diabolical ec regulations have you lived here all your life except for the twenty years or so when i tried to separate myself before the damn place reached out its suckers mrs morningwood pinched out the remains of her cigarette mother passed along leaving me the cottage which tied in roughly with the divorce came back to recover that was thirteen no fourteen years ago god almighty shouldntve reverted to the maiden name that was the mistake slotted myself back into a fearsome tradition jane looked at her waiting for it always be a morningwood on garway hill as long as badgers shit on the white rocks mrs morningwood exploded into catarrhal laughter and flung open the metal gate in you go watch night a square ridged field given up to docks and thistles new thorn trees sprouting around the greying bones of the old woodland enclosing it on three sides hid many of the hills and the only sighting point was the conical cap of the church tower so many folds and hollows merrily said hard to be sure exactly where you are you know kentchurch court mrs morningwoods arm another of merrilys cigarettes at the end of it was signposting a heavy canopy of oak woodland down behind there home of the scudamores normans who followed the conqueror over here in the eleventh century one of the sons married owain glyndwrs daughter and theyre supposed to have sheltered him when his rebellion went down and the master house is where close over the ridge mrs morningwood pushed the gate shut and plucked a twig from one of the holes in her barbour turning to jane suppose i might as well tell you those pubs sun and moon uhhuh jane stood on the mud track a hand on roscoes grizzled head getting better at containing her curiosity thats only half the story mrs morningwood said used to be a third inn called as it happens the stars wow jane blinked really and if you continue past the sun youll come to a white house which also used to be a pub with the i suppose equally celestial name of the globe holy sh jane lost it youre kidding go and look on your way home theres a small sign on the wall the globe four astronomical pubs in one small area this is amazing mrs morningwood yes it is interesting i would agree when youve grown up with it you dont think part of the fabric im sorry merrily kept on looking at the point of the church tower and the autumnal woodland glowing dully like dying embers under clouds the colour of old brick but did you say the globe at the first oblique sight of it you thought of a fox dozing in the undergrowth except they didnt did they not out in the open by day foxes didnt sleep like that theyd walked uphill for about fifty paces cresting a rise with two oak trees on top boughs locked like antlers and then the house was in a hollow below them sprawling sideon lowslung and sagging in a frame of bleached oak built of rubblestone the muddy colours of garway church a tinroofed leanto had collapsed at one end exposing arms of oak raised in a ragged v to the rafters there were the usual twentiethcentury additions to the house itself notably the dormers jutting from the old stone tiles but you could see that they were already rotting slates slipping guttering hanging off while the original oak endured sort of welsh longhouse in one of its incarnations mrs morningwood said barn or cattle shed attached are you all right mrs watkins im fine if disoriented like shed passed into a dream and then from one dream into another that was darker the globe where did fiction begin and why had mrs morningwood suddenly decided to pass on information that would make the place for jane even sexier nice job on the roof actually mrs watkins timbers patched rather than replaced and he had the foresight to use secondhand stone tiles new ones mightve been disastrous the chap was good pity he couldnt stay whatve you heard mrs morningwood his girl was frightened he told you that yes he did you told him it was an unhappy house merrily said would it be possible to explain further moving beyond the second oak tree she saw a granary with stone steps and a barn with a badly holed roof mrs morningwood zipped up her cracked and fissured barbour over the pink scarf last time i was in there was nearly fifty years ago i was nine years old you lived next door and you havent been in for fifty years next doors a relative term darling my cottage is six fields away including one we let go to conifers for purposes of concealment so you wouldnt see this house word is the duchy of cornwall wants to turn it into craft workshops employing green energy good luck to them ive nothing against charles been times ive even applauded the chap especially when he supports alternative remedies against the weasels of the medical profession taking their grimy little backhanders from the drug companies to cure us of nonexistent ills cholesterol who the hell invented cholesterol mrs morningwood had sunk her fists so deeply into the pockets of the worn barbour that you could see her knuckles through the holes do you know what a watch night is mrs watkins or was erm maybe most places it had faded out by the end of the nineteenth century garways said to be the last part of herefordshire to carry it on even so it had almost vanished even here when it was reinstated by the newtons this was the family whod bought the place from the gwilyms and how much do you know about that not much thats why im here learning history fychan gwilym mrs morningwood said sorry a name inevitably and deliberately mispronounced this side of the border it all begins with fychan the gwilyms while not exactly marcher lords being of course mainly welsh nonetheless had a substantial domain and fychan was their patriarch around the turn of last century notorious drunk gambler fornicator wifebeater and worst of all a very bad farmer weekends hed take himself off to the fleshpots of hereford and monmouth weekdays hed be out hunting and gradually running the farm into the ground to pay off his debts when was that early s fortunately one morning they found the bastard dead on the road to bagwyllydiart the eldest son far too young to take over and the widow much relieved one imagines rejected the local vultures moved to a cottage on the edge of the village and shocked everyone by flogging the farm to the newtons from off mrs watkins how far off over towards ross i believe wellheeled farming family the newtons looking for a living for a second son gwilyms incandescent with rage hordes of them wriggling out of their holes imagine a raiding party of rednecked bastards spitting and cursing well i exaggerate obviously but such were the recriminations that the widow gwilym found it expedient to leave the area altogether within the year this house was so important to the family or was it the land oh the house principally ancestral family home you see attempts to stop the sale but it was legal and once the newtons were in they started buying more land couple of fields here bit of woodland there gradually assembling a lucrative holding aware all the time of course of the gwilym family closing in like birnam wood from the welsh side for many years in the ample shape of one owain gwilym who had a farm near skenfrith ground extending almost to the border dedicated to getting the newtons out and the master house back not an ideal neighbour sounds like the seedbed of a classic border feud inevitably two farming dynasties headtohead harassment destruction of fences smashing of gates rustling of stock mrs morningwood sniffed in contempt farmers can be like children petty bullying and breaking one anothers toys split the community down the middle you were either for the gwilyms or the newtons and the newtons during this period had considerably more money and were generous to their local employees always helps and they were clever always thinking of ways to weave themselves into the very fabric of the area learning its psychology absorbing its traditions and using them which brings us back to the watch night you remembered yet i think merrily flicked a wary glance at jane that it was about keeping company with the dead mrs morningwood folded her arms and hunched her shoulders leaning her head back as if to allow the memories to come sliding down like grain specifically felicity newton only ever remember her as an old woman mustve been close to a hundred when she died in the s and not many people made the century in those days her son ralph head of the family decided to make an event of it in theory to allow everyone to pay their respects one can see now that it was designed to work as a kind of ritual homage binding the village and the neighbouring farms to the newtons all i know is it haunted my dreams for years you all had to see the body darling if only it had stopped there mrs morningwood pointed down to the master house where the skeleton of a porch had been half pulled away from the gothicshaped front door of whitening oak she described a square hall just inside which had also served as the living room with a large inglenook in front of which the remains of felicity newton had been displayed it must have been about eleven pm on a winters night i was quite excited id been allowed to stay up we walked across the fields my mother and i just across here people going in before us all dressed in black leaving their hurricane lamps outside people who all knew one another but no one spoke i remember there was a fire in the room kept very low the only source of light apart from the one candle like a grotto a shrine we were allowed to enter in ones and twos and each time the door closed behind us so that we were shut in with the corpse merrily saw jane discreetly rolling her eyes first time id seen a dead un mrs morningwood said the candle was in a saucer sitting in a mound of salt on a saucer placed on the chest of the corpse which lay in its coffin on trestles in the centre of the room the candle casting a quite ghastly light on the face i remember one of those frozen moments that resurface for years in nightmares taking one look and being gripped by a horror that was physical like a cramp in my stomach tried to run out but then from the shadows by the inglenook a bigger shadow arose tessie worthy the newtons housekeeper a large and formidable woman i remember as clearly as if it was yesterday tessie worthy in her big white starched apron rising up and intoning in this low rumble of a voice everybody is to touch her gross jane said hugging the wolfhound i remember my mother lifting me up and placing my hand on the withered cheek i remember turning my head away when the smell wafted up at me im sure if i went in there now id smell it again putrid the faint but piercing stench of decay mixed with the sickly smell of molten wax i closed my eyes tightly the face felt like the skin on a cold eggcustard this is an old celtic thing jane said unfazed like corpse candles about keeping away evil spirits m dear a light must remain burning in the room where the corpse lies up until burial until the funeral merrily said the spirit was supposed to be hanging around the house and shouldnt be left alone that was the belief i think she looked down at the house some of its windows leaded and framed with rusted metal others just holes like the sockets of eyes which had been put out however i do believe the newtons used it as a kind of controlling device mrs morningwood said each hand on the dead cheek an unspoken gesture of allegiance and of course almost everyone came except obviously anyone called gwilym how often did that happen merrily asked these communal visits to the newton dead twice three times i dont truly know i left home in my twenties couldnt wait to get out to the big exciting nonsuperstitious city by the time i returned theyd moved out left the house built a new house originally for a tenant then improved and extended it and then it became the family home more convenient easier to heat or that was their story the master house was rented out first to some people who tried to run a riding stables and failed and then to one of those s goodlife communes posh kids with ideals but no morals theyd gone too time i returned and word was the gwilyms were trying to buy it back gruffydd gwilym not a bad chap actually but the newtons turned him away rather see the house rot away than returned to the gwilyms and now of course theres gruffydds son suckarse merrily blinked patting roscoe the wolfhound whod come to sit between her and jane sycharth actually mrs morningwood spelled it out some of us do know our welsh pronunciations but cant resist taking the piss sycharth inherited earlier than expected gruffydd having been killed in one of those ubiquitous tractor accidents that occur on hill farms wouldnt happen to sycharth mans never even been on a bloody tractor big businessman now in hereford property restaurants latest is some abomination called the centurion i know it flash eatery on roman road he owns that a reversal of fortunes for both families the gwilyms back in the money hard times for the newtons suffered terribly during the foot and mouth of which of course the despicable government allowed to spread to shaft the farmers the way thatcher shafted the miners merrily nodded you heard this all the time a conspiracy theory that would last for at least a generation all governments are the same underneath final straw though for the newtons farm was like a concentration camp after the war smoke and death and the newtons hardly the powerful family i remembered and it didnt get any easier the boys wanted out and that mightve been the end of it had the eldest girl roxanne not married paul gray young farmer with ambition and enough family funds to buy in actually started to turn it around before he was diagnosed with ms ah i saw him briefly trying to avoid his wheelchair hes fighting cursed though farm was cursed people still talk like that as im sure you know and the feud never went away like a live electric wire under the ground and periodically someone would strike it with a spade sycharth pretends its all history when the word leaked out about pauls illness he immediately offered to help by buying back the master house and surrounding land which mightve been tempting if he hadnt been a gwilym didnt want to know but i think it did make them realize that this might be a good time to sell to the right buyer ah merrily nodded perhaps a respectable outside buyer with plenty of money and no possible link to the gwilyms i dont know the details mrs morningwood said but it was clearly the grays who made the approach to the duchy of cornwall mmm knowing how keen the duchy were on herefordshire at the time having recently bought harewood park not a dozen miles away clever oh theyve always been clever grays and newtons both if rather unlucky and how do the gwilyms feel about the duchy one can only imagine all right then darling mrs morningwood squeezed out her cigarette tidily pocketing the stub if you want to go into the house i wont detain you any longer but at least you know some of the background yes thank you mrs morningwood you have a key a very big key merrily could feel its outline bulging her bag only problem now is ive a church service to take at seventhirty back in ledwardine time for a peek surely im sure your god will protect you come along roscoe youre not coming hens to get in before nightfall besides i think i told you i never go there because you actually believe its haunted or for some other reason that you maybe dont feel able to share for just a moment mrs morningwood looked almost thrown then she smiled i trust the dog mrs watkins once got carried away in pursuit of a bunny found himself within yards of the ruins he froze for a moment absolutely froze then made the most extraordinary noise and came running back to me like the wind tail well down walked pitifully to heel all the way home she attached the leather lead to roscoes collar and then held out the looped end first to merrily then to jane go on try him see what happens jane looked at merrily wouldnt be fair merrily said the inglenook a year or so before moving to ledwardine merrily had helped take the funeral of a youngish woman with psychiatric problems wife of a local head teacher probably suicide but passed off by a kindly coroner as accidental death up in liverpool this had been when shed been a curate and thered been an open coffin in the american tradition and that had bothered her and the fact that it bothered her was also worrying was she squeamish immature surely it was good to be as open as possible about death took away the fear touch a corpse youll never be afraid again theyve made her look so composed the husband had said after all her suffering and her confusion i want everyone to see how together she looks together yes like an expensive doll in a white padded giftbox a classy ad for the embalmers art but you couldnt believe it had ever enclosed an animating spark this was the problem the underlining of the finality of death the erasure of the spirit a lasting image of the recently departed in eternal rigid repose where was the promise of freedom the energy of release standing in the ruins of the master house porch gripping the big rustbrown key merrily was still unsure how she felt about public displays of mortality but one thing was certain a single eerie experience as a child would hardly be enough to keep someone as worldhardened as mrs morningwood at bay for a half a century weird about the dog jane said maybe you think she was winding you up you couldve just taken her up on the offer walked him down here yourself wouldnt have proved anything most dogs dont like being suddenly taken away from their owners on the end of a lead perhaps she knew how hed react honestly jane scowled youre always so suspicious of people is that really good for a vicar i mean i liked her i liked her but im not sure how far id trust her everybody has an agenda and shed targeted us there were things she wanted me to know thats suspicious and you a christian yes its very sad down in the hollow the air was already purpling with dusk the birdsong withdrawing into the trees two sparrows flew out of the eaves merrily looked at the oak front door makes you wonder why these gwilyms wanted it back jane said its going to cost a fortune even to patch it up i can understand that if its the family home since way way back and if this guy sycharth owns the centurion hes certainly got the money the house looked heavier closeup less vulnerable some of its lower stones like boulders jane picked up a stone tile fallen from the porch and propped it against the wall so these gwilyms are obviously going to be seriously pissed off about the newtons or the grays or whoever cut this deal with charless guys behind their backs having to sit there on the other side of the river and watch the old homestead getting immaculately renovated turned into somebody elses business would there be any chance of them ever buying it back cant be ruled out flower the duchys a business buying and selling property if they cant make it work they might sell it on and the project certainly hasnt got off to the best of starts merrily was watching the top unrolling from a new can of worms how influential was sycharth gwilym in hereford property circles had felix barlow ever worked for the gwilyms had felix somehow been got at ok that seemed unlikely but god who could you totally trust who could you ever trust so jane said we going in she was standing brown paw marks down her front under the grey metal skull of a lamp over the front door fragments of glass embedded in its rim like splintered teeth merrily frowned perhaps not cant just look around and leave first rule of deliverance never walk away from an alleged disturbance without leaving gods card in case of what jane said a ghostly coffin in the hall and the body suddenly sits up with the pennies dropping from its dead eyes wasnt quite how i was thinking you know what i think i think you just dont want to go into a possibly haunted house with someone you think might still be halfpagan things have changed these days i tend to credit the boss with being more broadminded so go on then unlock it janes eyes were dancing erratically it could be that she didnt actually want to go in but she was jane watkins yeah all right merrily put the key into a hole enlarged probably by generations of gwilyns coming home from the pub in the dark the key rattling around in there failing to locate the tumblers it took both hands and a lot of jiggling before the lock turned over and the door sprang loose and hung there sullenly still needing a shoulder to shudder it open house that doesnt want to be restored merrily said what nothing she stepped inside ahead of jane inhaling damp and plaster dust disturbed by the vibration two grimy leaded windows were set into a sloping wall and the restricted light brown and flecked like the sediment at the bottom of an old medicine bottle was barely reaching the shadows that crowded the corners of what seemed quite a big room smelling wet earth merrily counted one two three four five doors and the wall opposite jaggedly agape a vast inglenook the oak beam across it as rough and massive as the capstone of a cromlech primeval like the tree itself had fallen onto some waiting stones been sawn off and the entire house built around it so this jane peering over merrilys shoulder this is where they laid the old girl out not here now though jane sorry to disappoint the only furniture was in the hearth a rusted iron firebasket the size of a small sheeppen in search of better light merrily walked across what seemed like worn linoleum ground into the earth to a narrow door next to the inglenook when she unlatched it greyness slithered down a stone staircase halfspiralling behind the fireplace she didnt go up she was cold rubbing her arms through the toothin sweatshirt looking over her shoulder into an empty jane down here couple of steps going down into looks like the kitchen big hooks in the beams kind of a fatty smell just tell me when youre going somewhere ok in case of what jane came back up pulling a door shut behind her whats upstairs i dont know id feel better with a torch if it was dangerous theyd have warned you wouldnt they i suppose the only warnings had come in that faintly teasing way from mrs morningwood merrily scenting a setup go on then mum jane was behind her on the steps the wooden handrail was hanging loose from the wall merrily didnt touch it upstairs they found a landing with no windows the only light fanning from one door left narrowly ajar merrily put out an arm to hold jane back could be floorboards missing before stepping tentatively into a long and dismal bedroom smelling of dead things in decay bluish light from a single dormer halfboarded wooden skeletons of two beds at either end of the room like in the story jane whispered what oh whistle and ill come to you in parkinss room at the whatever the pub was called the globe inn jane turned sharply bloody hell thats why you its just a bit coincidental in the circumstances mum id say its seriously coincidental its noteworthy there was a paper sack up against one wall fuchsias limeplaster was this the room where shed claimed to have seen something wriggling under the the floor was bare boards felix had evidently taken his dust sheets away mum why didnt you ask mrs morningwood about m r james because theres a couple of other people i need to discuss it with first and if you were to email the ghosts and scholars website we might learn a bit more from the experts ill do that tonight but if like if m r james admits something strange happened to him in garway maybe he actually stayed in the globe inn that would surely he always stayed with some people not too far away lets not speculate huh whatever jane looked around are you going to leave the calling card or what cant decide what to do its just an empty house in my limited experience they need people they dont ask me what they are however i think huw owen thinks we might need to ask a few people round interested parties although getting a gwilym and a gray into the same room might be problematical why would you need to that seem a bit like meddling to you feuds were a pastoral issue and she wasnt the parish priest maybe she needed to talk to teddy murray again even though he was only a standin they checked out three other bedrooms of varying sizes unfurnished a bathroom with a cracked discoloured bath and no water from the taps a separate toilet that stank everywhere tainted by dereliction in dire need of felix barlow but fuchsia if felix was right something had brought fuchsia back here yesterday fuchsia who wanted to be blessed in the oldfashioned way watch over her in the name of all the angels and saints in heaven keep guard over her soul day and night fuchsia newly blessed had returned to a place shed judged to be full of death nothing here was suggesting why jane headed for the top of the halfspiral stairs and merrily followed her down unsatisfied mildly annoyed the stone steps were worn smooth at the edges slippery some shored up underneath with bricks pointless doing a roomtoroom prayer cycle she didnt know enough of the history to have any kind of focus and all she could feel in the air was the crisscrossing of private agendas it was an unwelcoming old house soured by neglect and that was probably the extent of it back in the big room the light seemed stronger but that would be just her eyes adjusting she looked around walked around the ingrained lino and then stepped inside the inglenook ducking although there was no need to under the vast beam the inglenook was almost a small chamber in itself a separate place in the sooty dimness she found the remains of what must have been a bread oven empty and a matted tangle of grey bones all that was left of a bird behind the firebasket she looked up the chimney glimmerings of light but something blocking it nests maybe nothing much here jane sorry mum janes voice coming from the other side of the room im sorry merrily said i thought you the sentence guillotined by the thought that if it hadnt been jane who was with her in the inglenook sort of passage leading to a back door jane called out kind of a washroom standing very still and fully upright her back flat to the rear wall merrily let in a long thin river of breath an old sink janes voice further away cupboards jane get merrilys throat spasmblocked her headache back like spikes like a crown of thorns twisting in the iron firebasket gaped up at her like an open gintrap while she scrabbled in the pockets of her mind for prayer christ be be for gods sake calm pushing back a sudden amazing panic vile as a migraine she closed her eyes but it was like when you made yourself dizzy as child and she felt sick feeling the crumbling house turning slowly around her grinding on the axis of its origins christ be wi with only halfhearing the words st patricks breastplate the old armour but her lips were cold and flaccid and wouldnt shape them there was a solid substantial resistance a flat hardedged no and a rubbery numbness in her hands when she tried to clasp them together and although the prayer was sounding in her head it was distant someone elses whispers and she tried to turn up the volume envisioning bright brass bells clanging in a high tower but the sound was harsh and industrial christ behind me christ before me a muted crackling down there bird bones crunching under her shoes when she opened her eyes in revulsion there was a face in the high corner of the inglenook and it had stubby horns and a worm squirming from its blackened mouth and merrily recoiled mum janes footsteps sounded on the ingrained lino but she mustnt mum look i dont want to worry you or anything but its getting dark and youve got your meditation in just over an hour and i think weve both had enough of this place merrily wouldnt move or try to speak because if jane knew where she was jane would join her listen what lol liked best about the gigging was the coming home home to the mosaic of colouredlit windows in the black and white houses the fake gas lamps ambering the cobbles sometimes the scent of applewood smoke he parked the animal under the lamp on the edge of the square well back from the cars and suvs of the sundayevening diners in the black swan the truck had been gomers idea watching lol loading two guitars and an amp awkwardly into the astra together with all the onemanband gadgets which contrived the drumming and the toots and whirrs and storm noises that audiences loved for the apparent chaos of it all gomer had remembered that his sidekick danny thomas knew a reliable bloke who was selling his mitsubishi l animal it said on the side gomer seemed to find this funny he and danny had converted the truck building a watertight compartment into the box to accommodate the gear fitting a metal rolltop cover you could lock and gomer had taken lols old astra to recondition for himself waste not want not lol boy lol climbed down walked round the animal in the late twilight and pushed back the rolltop under the lights uncovering the case of the lovely boswell guitar handmade by al boswell the romani in the frome valley two harmonicas shining like ingots in a black velvet tray and the plastic thing that could make your voice sound like an oboe audiences everywhere hello hartlepool good evening godalming seemed to warm to the homespun the cobbledtogether they actually wanted to like you taken him a long time to realize that nick drake never had nick who for gods sake was so much better all hed felt was a paralysing isolation which had sometimes left him playing with his back halfturned away from the crowd lol opened the case that held the boswell paranoia he knew but he was always worried that the vibration of the truck might have damaged it many different kinds of wood had gone into its mandolin soundbox it wasnt the kind of guitar you took out on the road but he felt it was his talisman receiving it from al boswell when his life was turning round the songs coming through and merrily miraculously warm in his bed the guitar seemed fine but across the street over the corner of the square the vicarage had no lights not how it should be before merrily left the house to do the evening meditation shed always put on the globular lamp over the door always symbolic place of sanctuary for lol more than anybody he pulled back the rolltop locked it quickly ran across the square to the vicarage gate no visible lights in the house no volvo in the drive garage doors shut and bolted lol felt the inner freeze of dislocation she wasnt there and she hadnt told him he felt for cold moments like a stranger here again without merrily he would be a stranger snatching moments of warmth only from his hardearned applause a furnace door opening and closing stupid not as if they were married maybe shed left him a message on the answering machine he ran back across the square to the terraced cottage in church street unlocked his front door a haze of street light on the desk under the front window silence no bleeps lol looked out into the street up and down at the windows of ledwardine the mosaic of coloured squares now as unwelcoming as the ash in the hearth there would be a simple explanation he was becoming neurotic overpossessive not as if they were married yet so often with the nature of what she did when hed felt a wrongness there had been something wrong he went back out to the square to where he could see the body of the church through the lychgate the bunched shadows of people drifting through to an evening service with no hymns psalms lessons or sermon a vaporous glow from the churchdoor lantern about to walk down glancing back at the vicarage he saw a blur of white someone emerging from the gate crossing the cobbles towards church street lol made tea and jane seized her mug with both hands carrying it through to the parlour with the burntorange ceiling where lol switched on the parchmentshaded desk lamp leaving the curtains open his initial relief burning away you mean shes ill i dont know janes eyes glassy and anxious maybe jane we were in a hurry lol we got back late i said id get on the computer try and get some background on what she is in the church yeah she dashed straight across left me to put the car away and feed ethel and stuff so whats wrong with her lol i just i dont know all right maybe its been coming on for a while ok its been a heavy year all the death all the things she couldnt prevent all the stuff that came to nothing i dont know ok lol sat down in the chair facing jane on the sofa a chill on the room tell me in sequence and she tried to but most of it he couldnt really take in the number of the beast and the pubs with the cosmic names the spooky woman with the dog and the farmhouse when we came out honest to god lol she was white as as a surplice like trying to be normal kind of lets not worry jane which only made it worse because it was so obvious like im going to be worried me the pagan worried about what and then we go into this field and i get the full blessing bit the spiritual bodyarmour at sundown on the edge of a field like huh she ever done that before no but then i dont usually go with her on these jobs do i she said it was routine quite normal yeah right and shes gone ahead with the meditation mmm jane nodded i mean maybe thatll help lol got her to tell him again about the pubs and the dovecote and m r james after you came out of the house what exactly did she say she looked at her watch and shes like oh my god were not going to make it back in time but you could tell that wasnt what was really bothering her and if we were late why was she wasting time with all this blessing crap like im an idiot and all the way back she was like talking about other things trivial things in this brisk practical way like she was trying to screen something out like shed seen something in there or realized something she didnt want to face up to and when you got back was she still upset yeah that was obvious jane drank some tea she looked totally out of it like someone whod been in a car crash but when we were actually looking around the place she was fairly dismissive a bit annoyed like shed been set up she hates that people treating her like shes some dim vicar jane finished her tea still looking starved and unhappy and maybe even resentful that some dim vicar might have picked up on an aspect of otherness that shed missed out on lol catching him looking at her i think ive changed quite a bit the past year id like to think i could help her but shes still wary you know ill talk to her lol said lol padded past the font unseen not difficult at the sundayevening meditation when the front pews were arranged in a circle and the only light was candlelight vast shadows ghosting the sandstone walls about two dozen people had come about normal when the rumours of healing had been circulating there would have been as many as a hundred but it had calmed down now idea that prayers as much about listening means we have to think about what we mean by listening no priestly trappings no ceremonial no smoke no mirrors no applause no stamping for encores merrilys gig she was sitting on the edge of the circle in her black jeans and sweatshirt hair tied back never a pulpit person because when you think about it we hardly ever really do it lol sank down a couple of rows back in deep shadow his eyes closing momentarily in relief feeling her voice low soft conversational unassuming intimate halfguiltily fancying the hell out of her if were holding a conversation with somebody even if we think were taking in what theyre saying to us what were actually doing is filtering it putting it through this sieve of our own needs desires fears thinking of what we want them to be saying and also of what were afraid they might really be saying were processing the words analysing alert for any subtext our minds are taking an active role in other words were not listening does that make sense murmured assent the people who came here on a sunday evening were by and large not the ones who came to the family service in the morning this was postwatershed ok then merrily said do you think we should try listening tonight without filtering without questioning or intellectualising without any attempts at interpretation someone said yeah they should go for it and merrily moved her wooden chair a little forward into the candlelight first we need to go into the contemplative state opening ourselves up so laying her hands palms down on her knees if we start with the relaxation exercise beginning at the feet becoming aware of our feet curling our toes the scraping of a pew merrily i want to ask merrily looked up shirley is this in the bible im sorry does the bible tell us we should be opening ourselves up to messages well i think youll find its all over the bible in one way or another but when you say messages im not sure were talking about the same messages from beyond is that in the bible i could find you some examples shirley but this wasnt really intended to be a biblestudy session as much as only its what the spiritualists do isnt it go into a trance and wait for something to come through dont get me wrong i appreciate youre trying to do something different here merrily to bring some of these people into the fold but im an oldfashioned christian and i keep asking myself is the church the right place for it merrily sighed her breath fluttering a candle flame shirley i take your point but theres a subtle difference between spirituality and spiritualism spiritism what im no actually the difference is not that subtle at all its something entirely how do we know that whats coming through is from god that its not a dead person merrilys face was tilted into the candlelight and now lol saw the furrows and the strain or something evil this shirley said restive murmurs from around the circle a groan lol just sighed a fundamentalist all she needed because when we approach it like this merrily said in this context its coming out of prayer and its an act of faith shirley if you could bear with me its just that in the dark with a ring of candles it doesnt feel right to me i dont like opening myself up how do we know there isnt somebody here whos brought something evil in with them this time when merrily looked up lol was shocked at the pallor of her face sound like jane when it was over merrily held the snuffer over the last candle and then guided lol through the darkness towards the south door didnt handle that too well did i moving them both swiftly down the nave she could find her way blindfold around this sandstone cavern had even actually done that once when she was new here it had seemed necessary having an intimate tactile knowledge of the body of the church her own sacred space to which it had seemed desperately important tonight to get back bad mistake she felt sick better she hadnt made it in time than have to watch the socalled groundbreaking meditation service crumbling away into a pointless debate about the validity of replacing the traditional evensong hymns and all with quiet and contemplation more like a bloody parish meeting i wouldnt care shirley doesnt normally come on a sunday night i mean if she prefers the formality of a structured service well fine who is she shirley i think i mentioned her currently my most enthusiastic parishioner oh yes you did lol bumped into the prayerbook rack there was the slap of a book landing on flags leave it ill find it in the morning why are we talking in the dark how did the gig go oh hell im so sorry ive forgotten where newtown theatr hafren it was good almost full the local record shop was selling albums in the foyer they sold out thats fantastic come back to the vic have some supper with us lol didnt move she could see his outline head bowed he said when she said that about someone bringing evil into the church lol god what was she supposed to say look this is uncharitable but i sometimes think shirley actually comes to too many services you thought she meant you didnt you merrilys fingers found the stone bowl of the font pressing into its whorls and furrows youve been talking to jane right well she came over just now a bit worried told me about m r james and the woman who was saying shed seen one of his ghosts and the dovecote and this mrs mornington wood merrily straightened up morningwood and how you came out of the house whitefaced and wouldnt talk about it lol was standing next to her now pretty much the way youre not talking about it now merrily leaned against the firmness of the font she looked back along the nave vaguely moonlit now like a straight path through woodland but there was no green man at ledwardine all right i may have i saw something that wasnt supposed to be there inside the house the duchy of cornwall house it just looked ordinary it felt ordinary until i decided for some reason to have a look inside the inglenook its quite a high inglenook someone like me can stand upright in it and quite a lot of space all round like a small black room her mind was already tightening shed hoped it might melt away in the meditation but the meditation had never happened and maybe that was just as well maybe she had brought something back and if theyd gone into the meditation it wouldve been contaminated maybe shirley oh for gods sake go on merrily felt lols hand on her arm the small black room behind the inglenook there was a feeling of not being alone im not talking about god or anything youre saying you actually felt something was with you inside this inglenook something watching me its all a bit subjective a feeling id been getting at garway generally it has a very peculiar atmosphere i cant explain it even the church seems to have eyes ancient landmark sentient landscape oh god listen to me im starting to sound like jane lol was silent there were cooling clangs from the heating which had switched itself off you know the green man merrily said like you get in country churches stone face looking through foliage mouthful of leaves and stuff maybe an ancient fertility symbol several in herefordshire the one in garway church is moulded into the chancel arch and theres also this one inside the oak lintel over the fireplace in the master house almost identical id guess but id need to check i just looked up there it was thats what you thought was watching you at the back so only visible from inside the inglenook you dont see him unless you enter his a secret green man and not in a church i dont know of any ancient ones that arent in churches though maybe there are and hidden away why this green man is what scared you why youd turned white i havent been feeling too great lately she pulled away from the font couldnt deal with this now lets go outside a wind had arisen chattering amongst dead chrysanths in a gravepot merrily pulled the church keys from her shoulder bag the master house key poked out and she thrust it back lol said you now think something actually happened to this fuchsia at the house id convinced myself she was pulling some kind of scam the face of crushed linen all that i was coming round to thinking there was some entirely prosaic reason for felix changing his mind wanting out of the job i was ready to confront her about it so what are you going to do now confront her but maybe with a bit more sensitivity that is i still think theres a lot she hasnt told me but im no longer ruling out the possibility of something else what are you going to tell jane i dont know you sure youve told me everything lol im going to ring them now ok fumbling out the phone and putting the number in the frame they stood under the lychgate opposite the square orange and green lights making lanterns of the leaded windows of the black swan lol said why dont you call them in the morning they might leave early the ringing stopped hold on hes the voice in the phone said hello felix merrily said ive been trying to get you all day listen i really need to talk to you both of you tomorrow morning if possible even tonight if youre up for that take me about twenty minutes to get there there was no reply something quizzical about the silence sorry she said its merrily watkins yeh i thought it was oh shit frannie im sorry i mustve put the wrong number in more haste less who did you think you were calling merrily just just a guy ive been trying to felix you said bliss said that would be felix barlow how did you something jerked inside her chest frannie twenty minutes then bliss said ill be waiting supposed to be sheep there was the usual small sordid fairground under a frantic night sky fallen leaves panicdancing in the intersecting headlight beams from three cars and a dark blue van all pointing at the caravan engines growling flapping and crackling from the plastic screen theyd erected inside the tapes to keep out the rising wind a rich smell of churned mud the west mercia police travelling show fuchsia merrily felt insubstantial blown around like the leaves where is she please can someone nearly a dozen men and women cops and crimescene technos like worker ants in the grass none of them answering her all of them hyper never let anybody tell you these guys didnt get a wild buzz from violent death this is the feller bliss was in a white coverall what he liked to call a durex suit flicking occasional questions at her like pellets youre sure about that all the motion only emphasizing the stillness of the big man in a heap dumped like manure below the caravans open door oh god oh god oh god yes was she sure under the hardened mud and the congealed fluids his head was a different shape mouth halfopen dried blood caked around his nose both eyes sootblack merrily forcing herself to keep looking at him aware of bliss watching her closely this is the builder you were telling me about right doing up the farmhouse for charlies outfit yes one of felixs feet was twisted into the gap between two of the metal steps a hand clawed the mud poor guy trying to seize the earth one last time a decent man frannie kind trying to do the best thing really bliss said do you know where fuchsia is bliss said tell me again why were you ringing him tonight merrily i was trying to arrange a meeting sounded like an emergency to me bliss said sunday night very heavy day for the clergy and there you were prepared to drop everything and come rushing out here in the dark yes what conclusions am i to draw from this i was merrily sighed how long have you got till billy grace gets here the pathologist which i hope is gonna be before flamin daylight two crimescene women were moving around felixs body with evidence bags emotions uncoupled not seeing a person not looking for history much beyond the final act who found him frannie dogwalker where would the police be without dogwalkers eh what do you think happened thats for billy grace to find out well he didnt merrily spun at him furious just fall off the sodding step did he segments of smoky cloud on fastforward across the threequarter moon blisss eyebrows going up my we are fractious tonight merrily yes its interesting that youre so emotionally involved interesting significant even bliss had his head on one side red hair shaved close to the skull these days to disguise erosion merrily looked away over towards the edge of the field where lol was parked forbidden by some jobsworth copper even to get out of the truck you need steadying her voice to find fuchsia the house i told you about how trivial and foolish this was going to sound it was fuchsia who had the problem this is fuchsia mary linden the assistant and girlfriend i keep asking if anyones looking for her and nobody at first i thought she was being you know disingenuous im now more inclined to believe theres something to what shes saying and i wanted to tell them that talk it all over again bliss scratched his nose obscuring a reluctant halfsmile im loath as ever to go into the details of your frankly unenviable job merrily but youre saying you were feeling a bit guilty i yeah when did you last talk to mr barlow last night on the phone and the girl not since last week when i met them here whats she like shes unusual unusual yeh that explains everything ill be sure to put that in my report whimsical imaginative in a childlike way and beautiful of course and about twenty years younger than felix that what you were looking for this word whimsical bliss said would that translate for the rest of us as three sheets to the wind what are you asking bliss didnt reply you have got people out looking for her weve gorra couple of people out there yeh youre sure shes not somewhere close an image of fuchsia crouching big eyed between treeroots in the woods sure as we can be bliss said you actually think she did this dont you cant deny that the domestic solution would save us a lorra graft what was he hit with could be one of his own tools im never one to preempt the slab merrily but when the heads swollen up like that battered out of shape youre looking at multiple skull fractures and no you wouldnt generally get that falling off the steps into a field the killer mustve been very very angry a fourth vehicle had appeared next to the dark blue van a cop shouted across to bliss dr grace boss must be a bad telly night bliss turned to merrily you ever think on these occasions that our fates might be entwined reverend every time theres one of those occasions frannie i just look when you find fuchsia will you let me know if i can bliss said and well probably need to talk about this at length maybe tomorrow thanks for dropping by merrily yeah walking back across the field hands jammed into the pockets of her fleece merrily looked behind her once and saw on the very edge of the headlights the gaping maw of the bay in the barn that felix had been renovating for fuchsia to bring her stability shit she wanted to scream it into the wind shit shit shit janes mobile played the riff from lols sunny days and she tightened her lips and ignored it wouldnt be mum shed call the landline ethel the black cat prowled the scullery desk the mobile stopped jane clicked on the email address from the ghosts and scholars website put in the message shed drafted read it through one last time dear ms pardoe sorry to bother you but i wonder if you might be able to help me after reading on your website about m r jamess unexplained strange experience at garway church on the welsh border i wondered if you could throw any more light on it i live in herefordshire and went with my mother to garway today and to me the mystical influence of the knights templar could still be felt very strongly there after all these centuries m r jamess story oh whistle and ill come to you my lad has a templar preceptory in it and we were wondering if the story could have come out of whatever m r james experienced at garway like me you were also intrigued by the medieval dovecote with dove holes do have any ideas why this might have been anything you can tell me would be very gratefully received perhaps we might be able to help with your own researches too one day yours sincerely jane watkins seemed ok didnt give too much away jane sent it feeling a lot less excited than she had when shed composed it since then mum had been back with lol mum looking totally like death this time and then theyd both gone out to this place at monkland mum apologetic as usual could jane get herself something to eat jesus what about her like when was she going to eat mum was clearly losing weight she looked like a small bird after a long winter jane picked up ghost stories of an antiquary one of two books shed brought down from her apartment she put it down again oh whistle was actually quite a bleak story full of solitude the guy didnt die or anything but the effects of what hed seen would be hanging over him for the rest of his life she saw the image still as vivid in her head as if it had been on the computer screen mum walking out of that derelict farmhouse into the early dusk walking with her shoulders stiffened and her spine kind of pulled in like she knew there was something very close behind her her face like yellowing paper never seen her quite like that before never and it was unnerving because in one way she needed mum to be basically sceptical as resistant to the paranormal despite her job as jane was to the strictures of the church mum as a buffer against her wildest ideas giving jane the freedom to explore because there was always that framework of stability maybe she was really afraid of growing up into a world where a mature and intelligent woman was visibly and seismically shaken by the irrational trying to conceal her fear from a kid who was no longer a kid jane turned with a reluctance she recognised as unusual to the second book on the desk ella leathers the folklore of herefordshire in the index under garway shed found the line about nine witches and also a page reference for the watch after death on page mrs leather listed the places where it was customary until a few years ago for the household to sit up all night when a death had occurred they did not sit in the same room as the corpse but elsewhere the idea being that the spirit of the dead person was still in and about the house and the people said it was for the last time it was the last night so no one went to bed but at orcop and garway the watch is still kept so martha s who lived on garway hill assured me only if it was somebody you cared about she added not for strangers so as for bringing comparative strangers into the same room as the body the newtons had obviously bent the rules in their own best interests picking up on what came next maybe theyd even read this very account published for the first time in usually among the country folk a light is kept burning in the room where a corpse lies every night until burial a pewter plate of salt is placed on the body according to martha s the candle should be stuck in the middle of the salt heaped up in the centre of the plate seriously creepy jane shut the book it was too quiet in here picking up the mobile she got up and walked to the scullery window looking out at darkness and a wall pressing one on the keypad you have three new messages to listen to your messages she hesitated staring into the little square of light before pressing one again first new message received at thirteen fortythree today jane its oh shit you know who it is for gods sake ive left about seventeen messages five actually i know theres nothing wrong with the phone which means something wrong with you i even tried ringing the landline thinking id ask your mum yeah yeah i know how much youd hate that but im a bit beyond caring only its always the bloody answering machine i mean have i done something have i done something i didnt know about has somebody told you ive done something just you dont even have to ring me back just leave a message ill close down the phone for the rest of the night so you dont risk speaking to me just leave a message jane i mean christ weve been like together for two years thats longer than a lot of marr oh fuck it jane stared into the phone for a long time before switching it off the builder was dead his girlfriend missing most of this lol had already put together out of fragments of chat heard from the open window of the truck watching the shadowy scurryings around the screenedoff caravan guessing what was coming when merrily returned just not sure as a failed psychotherapist and a derivative songwriter finding a little success a little too late how best to handle it maybe you need a good manager she was rubbing her eyes wearily a tourorganizer whatever the word is i really dont think so or just a roadie to carry the spare guitar youre tired lol started the engine flicked on the headlamps you havent eaten since lunch or as its sunday knowing you maybe even breakfast its still sunday as they bumped into the lane merrily loosened her seat belt as if there was pressure in her chest she hadnt yet reached for a cigarette couple of weeks ago i lay awake counting up all the people whove suffered in some unnecessary way or died unnaturally in spite of all my prayers and entreaties and its supposed to be sheep merrily lol said gently i suppose counting corpses will eventually get you to sleep but the dreams are going to be altogether less pastoral she had the blessing lol the full bit holy water oil we could drive into hereford now and you could go round administering blessings at random to people in the street but some of them would still get into a street fight cause a road accident or something so whats the point whats the point of any of it lol was silent pulling on to the main road speeding up as merrily stared out of the side window on the way here shed told him about the ritual in the little disused church the girl suggesting something was coming merrilys discussions with huw owen leading to her discovery of the fictional origins of that line this constant tension between her faith and an equallynecessary scepticism must drive her halfcrazy at times like now her face was still turned away from him watching the night you keep thinking what if the church is actually reaching the end of its useful life and every day it gets harder to answer that persistent nagging question if there is a god why does he allow so much suffering well my children the truth the bottomline heartfelt truth is im buggered if i know youre thinking lol braked hard for a badger ambling across the road youre thinking of that guy michael taylor that his name the yorkshireman who back in the s told his local priest he was possessed by evil spirits and then having been subjected to a nightlong exorcism went home and murdered his wife in the most horrific way possible with bare hands merrily shook her head probably meaning she hadnt been thinking about the guy for a whole halfminute it was a blessing not an exorcism lol said there was no question of possession was there i did at least two things wrong one i didnt involve felix in the blessing would he have even wanted to be involved two i had a chance to go to the house yesterday and i didnt i decided it was probably bullshit but you had every reason to think that you talked to huw owen and he i was careless cynical traffic was sparse this area still managing to stay a decade or so behind the rest of the country high in the cab lol saw in a dip on the left the lights of the perfectlyformedaroundthegreen black and white village of dilwyn he tried again even if youd gone to the house yesterday theres no certainty youd have felt any reaction that isnt how it works is it i dont know how it works nobody knows how it works maybe the woman didnt kill him lol said they dont know it was her do they they know something im fairly sure theres something bliss wasnt revealing its how they operate never tell anybody anything unless it serves a purpose when they find her you need to talk to her bliss would arrange that wouldnt he she didnt want to talk last night and why did she go back to garway why did she go back after the blessing evidently he didnt want to tell me that merrily shouldve thought please lol said just he slowed for the sign that said ledwardine trying to shut out the whingey voice of the fundamentalist woman shirley west how do we know there isnt somebody here whos brought something evil in with them the road curved towards the village the hump of cole hill forming under the halfclouded moon and the steeple rising out of nowhere like an ancient rocket petrified on its pad crises of faith merrily would say when she wasnt in the middle of one were part of the deal they could only strengthen your faith in the end until lol thought you had one too many he parked easily on the square the diners had left and the lights of the black swan had dimmed there was nobody about he turned to merrily not touching her you um want me to come in with you lesser creatures and birds in the early light merrily let lol out by the vicarage back door so that he could use the garden gate to slip unseen into the churchyard creeping between shadowed headstones and out the other side into the old orchard which had once enclosed the village like a nest around eggs the secret ways of ledwardine merrily in her bathrobe watching from the landing window as lol emerged from the alley by the new bistro onto the square vanishing into jim prossers shop called eight till late but usually open by seven and coming out with a morning paper there was no real need for this game any more everybody must know by now yet she had the feeling that it was expected a matter of decorum a village thing no sex anyway just needed warmth whatever gets you through the night and the recurrent images of wideeyed bigeyed fuchsia will you bless me you look like the lady of shallot or something jane said appearing at the top of the stairs already dressed for school face shining hair brushed wasnt she last heard of lying in a barge or something merrily said kind of dead before that she was a seriously messedup person messedup right erm jane had waited up last night knew the worst she was leaning against the stairrail with her blazer over an arm ive just been listening to the news on hereford and worcester they said a mans body had been found near his caravan at monkland and the cops were treating it as suspicious it is they didnt mention a woman good mum jane came down to the landing look im not stupid i can put the pieces together if not always in the right holes are you ok im serious ive been thinking maybe i should take a hairdressing course open a little salon in lols front room mum do something useful you need a holiday mmm ive been thinking about garway hill nice views so do it jane said i mean it if you want to go over there and deal with whatever needs dealing with ill stay here with whichever loopy militantlesbian cleric they want to dump on the parish jane i was just and ill help however i can checking stuff on the net ringing people whatever you need i well i just wanted to say that any religious differences dont come into it i want to help no ulterior motive i swear it i never thought there was flower but i looked up some stuff in mrs leather last night left the page refs on your desk thank you maybe ill get a chance to read them when youve gone to school merrily set off downstairs jane right behind i bet you didnt sleep much last night did you and not because lol was here yeah well thanks for your concern however for christs sake mum your guys had his head smashed in that must be something i wish i hadnt had to see yes and like not the only thing i saw your face when you came out of that house this wasnt going to go away was it look ive told you id seen something that was in the wrong place the green man we dont know what it means but its an odd symbolic medieval thing and it isnt usually if ever found in houses so it was unexpected just a bit of a shock bit more than that if you ask me the jury merrily stopped on the stairs is still out all right there are some things you just dont want to face up to youre a priest but youre afraid to confront the reality of like metaphysical evil even when its possibly caused violent death im just putting two and two together and making thirteen violent death in my limited experience is caused by people sure but what causes the people to cause the violence lets just get some breakfast or youll be late merrily carried on to the bottom on the stairs listening out for the bleep of the answering machine but all she could hear was ethel crunching dried food rocking the bowl on the stone flag oh the other thing jane said i emailed the m r james site last night while you were out about the dovecote and the templars so like if something comes in for me dont feel you have to wait till i get home just open it thank you jane looked at her that look got shrewder every year all you could do was stare back and hope you came through breakfast merrily said ill make it jane said and ill make yours too and im not going to school until ive watched you eat it no overnight messages on the machine and no early calls local people had come to accept that monday was a vicars day off usually the only one by the time merrily had read mrs leathers account of the watch after death the computers inbox was showing what looked like an actual email amongst the spam dear jane thanks for your mail garway is certainly the most mysterious and intriguing place ive ever visited in my quest for mrj im afraid i cant throw any particular light on the dovecote mystery apart from pointing out as you probably already know that before the suppression of the order the knights templar were accused of denying christ rejecting the mass and the sacrament and spitting on the cross these charges may have been fabricated but the possibility of the order becoming corrupt in later years cannot be ruled out the dovecote as it stands today seems to have been largely rebuilt by the knights hospitaller who succeeded the templars at garway but i dont know of any satanic scandal attaching to them re your question about whistle im afraid i have to disappoint you whatever happened to mrj at garway seems to have occurred in a good thirteen years after the publication of the story it was probably written in he may have visited garway before ghost stories of an antiquary came out in but there is no record of it that i know of he doesnt seem to have found any reason to come to herefordshire until the widow of his friend james mcbryde moved there with her young daughter in so that was that merrily sat back unsure if she was disappointed or relieved that despite the templar connection and the globe inn coincidence oh whistle and ill come to you my lad could hardly have been inspired by whatever happened to m r james at garway church nearly fourteen years later remiss of her not to have checked those dates herself and fuchsia the face of crumpled linen it had all turned around again more evidence that whatever had happened to fuchsia had happened inside fuchsias head whether creatively or otherwise it was not unlikely that fuchsia had even made those same connections with whistle time to talk to huw owen again as she glanced at the big black phone it rang you in merrily bliss said whats it sound like youre not still ratty make that confused and upset will you still be in in half an hour or so have you found her ill have another bloke with me bliss said background buzz suggesting the cid room rather than the car park his tone and the fact that he was ringing on the landline suggesting she might need to exercise caution who youll like him bliss said hell make you laugh you still havent told me whether the line went dead merrily sat holding the empty phone staring blankly at the rest of the message on the screen incidentally if you didnt know this gwendolen mcbrydes daughter was also called jane and mrj was very fond of her this may well have been because jane something of an artist like both her parents was fascinated by the supernatural and creepy things generally so when mrj says we caused offence at garway he may well be referring to the by then teenage jane and possibly her mother as well as himself it occurs to me that you might like to read michael coxs biography of mrj relevant pages of which ive attached good luck with your investigations do let me know how you get on rosemary pardoe merrily sat up clicked on the attachment bringing up two scanned pages from m r james an informal portrait the first began by examining the possibility that the lively and affectionate young widow gwendolen mcbryde had been rather attracted to her late husbands best friend a man who had helped her through difficult times and been conscientious about his role as janes guardian monty had been entirely relaxed at the house woodlands in south herefordshire treated with affectionate and admiring indulgence by his host gwendolen had recalled him doing impersonations putting on funny accents and once reading aloud from a midsummer nights dream to a background of nightjars hed also once read the lessons at nearby abbeydore according to gwendolen he had a beautiful voice which when he read aloud lent you his understanding at abbeydore it gave me an unreal feeling as if some saint held forth to lesser creatures and birds as for gwens daughter well it seemed she was very much montys kind of kid producing lots of delightful drawings of unspeakable entities emerging from gaping tombs so rosemary pardoes suggestion that it was the daughter whod been with monty james in garway seemed to be on the money oh god when in herefordshire m r james had stayed with a widowed single mother with a teenage daughter who was into creepy things and was called jane into the bleak morning after the night of cruel tragedy came the brittle sound of cosmic laughter she thought of bliss hell make you laugh and what hed said on the phone when she was in the car on garway hill what they used to call the funnies oh hell this is jonathan long bliss hooked out a chair at the refectory table one of my colleagues all the time she was making them coffee merrily kept glancing at bliss but there was no eye response he didnt look happy she felt the tension rolling in her stomach hard as a golf ball jonathan long rank unspecified looked several years younger than bliss perhaps very early thirties he didnt look like a cop maybe a young academic a lecturer in something dry and exact like law or economics his body was thickening and he wore a dark grey threespiece suit a cop with a waistcoat was rare these days a young cop with a waistcoat entirely outside merrilys experience i gather youve known francis for some time long said way back since he had a full head of hair tension throwing out flippancy like feeble sparks long didnt smile neither did bliss long had spiky black hair and a light tan bliss needed to avoid the sun in case his freckles turned malignant we were hoping mrs watkins that you might share some of your impressions longs accent was educated and still fairly refined seemed unlikely that hed spent much of his career confiscating crack pipes and bundling binge drinkers into blue vans it also seemed unlikely that he was going to identify himself as special branch about what mr long she sat down opposite them theology contemporary music specifically fuchsia mary linden long examined his coffee do you have cream by any chance erm no sorry all right playtime over youve found her right yeh bliss said weve found her we think weve found her his usually foxy eyes were dull as pennies sudden sunlight dropped from the highest kitchen window like a splash of cold milk were still waiting for the dental report jonathan long said but its unlikely to be anyone else collecting beads had she on some level expected it had she looked down on felixs body last night dumped like a heap of building rubble on his own doorstep and somehow known she was seeing only half a tragedy i didnt know whether it wanted me out or it wanted me dead merrily a train in the distance rattling through the night the coffee going cold in front of her while the horror came out in short sick spurts on the southern line the london train via newport jonathan longs voice light and casual as if he was reading from a passenger timetable just under half a kilometre from what i understand is known as the tram inn level crossing past the big feed place with the silos bliss said the full significance of it crashed in on merrily like a rock through a windscreen she pushed her chair back a raking screech on the stone flags she laid her head on the line bliss said i dont know how people can do that meself they just think of the train roaring unstoppably out of the night never a thought for the poor bastard driving it watch over her in the name of all the angels and saints in heaven keep guard over her soul day and night you knew last night didnt you merrily stared at him you knew when we were at the caravan this word whimsical would that translate for the rest of us as three sheets to the wind dont look at me like that merrily we knew a woman had been hit by a train that was all what do you know about her not much but then in some ways there isnt much that anyone knows we have names of adoptive parents but we havent spoken to them yet you even found them im we have someone working on it merrily told them about fuchsias mother tepee city how did you get an id frannie car keys in her pocket a van parked near the tram inn registered to felix barlow tepee city long said thats well into wales isnt it mrs watkins a welshspeaking area yes why a significant amount of oldfashioned welsh nationalism in that area i think not much in tepee city itself idve thought alternative communities are usually immigrants whats your point like he was going to tell her this smooth git with his secret agenda merrily just wanted to throw him out throw both of them out and take herself down to the church to scream abuse at god this house long said the master house fuchsia was instrumental in getting felix barlow to pull out of the contract she was the reason he pulled out because she thought it was haunted because she said shed sensed a an evil there merrily said reluctantly long smiled the kind of smile where you couldnt have slid a butter knife between his lips from your conversations with her can you think of any other reason why she or anyone else for that matter might not have wanted that house redeveloped you mean a sane reason no i cant wasnt gods fault merrily gripped her knees under the table she was incompetent smug selfsatisfied lazy shed spotted the unconvincing elements the lines from m r james and missed all the danger signs when he came home it was like it was all over him i made him shower and then i burned all the clothes hed been wearing just out there merrily i poured petrol on them so what did you long was steepling his fingers francis has tried to explain your role in the ah diocese but what precisely did you do with this woman are you actually leading the inquiry mr long mr bliss is leading the murder inquiry im dealing with a side issue which may or may not be connected do you want to explain that jonathan long said nothing merrily played with a teaspoon let the silence drift for a few seconds looked at him so would that would that be one of those we ask the questions kind of silences i did try to tell you on the way here mate bliss said this is a woman who isnt invariably attracted to the enigmatic type longs gaze settled for a moment on bliss and then he turned back to merrily you performed an exorcism or whatever you prefer to call it oh for heavens sake merrily dropped the teaspoon into her mug we have an escalating series of responses and exorcism is so far up the ladder we usually get vertigo before we she had a blessing in a church thats it and it shouldnt have been there shouldve been followup aftercare what was your opinion of her mrs watkins what give me a picture she was intelligent in her way intense seemed certain about what shed experienced but i was keeping an open mind you thought she might be delusional or making it up some people do but you went ahead all the same at the blessing stage we can afford to be a bit uncertain for the heavier stuff you need permission from the bishop its also likely to involve a psychiatric assessment and do you think psychiatry might have been appropriate in the case of fuchsia mary linden i dont know any suggestion of previous violence on either side her and felix no i mean are you sure she did this merrily bliss said as im apparently leading the inquiry ill make an executive decision to spell it out for you were waiting for forensic even the dental stuff isnt straightforward when a trains im sorry when a trains run over someones head its like collecting beads from a broken necklace no we dont know she killed him and theres a possibility we never will for sure we havent found a weapon but its one of those situations where the press statement is likely to say that were not looking for anybody else that any clearer thanks no i cant see any reason shed want to kill felix my impression was that she very much needed him in her life her rock if you like an old family friend a link going way back shed gone in search of him she seems to have wanted security a proper home didnt want to mention either umbilical cords or paying for art college might tell bliss later but not in front of jonathan long not for her to pass on mrs morningwoods stories either not to this guy long nodded right then he stood up thats probably all for the present unless he glanced at bliss who came more slowly to his feet if you think of anything else that might be relevant merrily you know where i am bliss smiled jonathan well nobody really knows where jonathan is when theyd gone merrily poured longs coffee untouched down the sink and rang huw owen in the brecon beacons no answer she called sophie at the gatehouse engaged she wasnt ready to go to the church she ought to sit down and think about it sensibly she didnt feel sensible there was a possibility no getting round it that she could in some way have prevented this all of it if she hadnt been so blasé so easily deflected she fumbled a cigarette out of the packet started to light it and couldnt get a proper grip on the zippo no use saying it had all been out of her hands shed let it slip through them fall to the flags smash the phone was ringing in the scullery merrily dropped the lighter went to the sink and splashed water on her face towelled it roughly and went through to the phone ledwardine vicarage adam eastgate merrily at the duchy listen have you heard the radio news this morning kind of ive been trying to get some sense out of the police erm i was over there last night not long after they found him im so sorry adam the big black phone was full of a chargedup silence the policeve just been here merrily said im afraid jesus merrily i could never in a million years have imagined no me neither im not sure if you know this but felixs girlfriend fuchsia is also dead found on on the railway not yet officially identified but i dont think theres any doubt christ almighty so how how did felix die he had head injuries adam im sorry i didnt see any of this coming either and i ought to have come on thats easily said merrily we could all say that hell i knew him better than any builder we ever used he was a canny fella i liked him a lot but jesus this is not real this is complete madness yes in her head merrily was in the car again on garway hill on the phone to bliss irritably deciding not to check out the master house sod this going home ill have to get word to the man adam eastgate said he always admired felixs work she heard him breathing steadily pictured him standing by the window in the duchys barn looking out towards the welsh border hills and garway and wondering how this might rebound heard him clearing his throat merrily ive got to ask does this connect in your your view of things to the master house be stupid of me to say it doesnt but not id guess in any way that would interest the police so it wont come out at the inquest or anything about inquests tend to stick to the cold facts right eastgate paused well i dont know what to say have to get another builder yes i dont know how to react to this was she crazy i mean thats the issue isnt it i dont know at first i thought it was something like that but now ive been to the house and i dont know theres a lot of history what do you suggest me the bishop referred it to you merrily yes remembering how shed reacted telling lol i

the back door it had turned into the kind of october day that made global warming seem like a scarestory cold air seizing her arms through the thin sweatshirt she didnt care she walked through into the churchyard the way lol had left at dawn the sun now pulsing feebly in a loaded sky selfdisgust oozing rancid fluid into her gut we have to think about what we mean by listening because when you

muriel and this is official is it i mean does she do this kind of thing as you know some kind of agricultural consultant gomer laughed started coughing and fitted a ciggy in his mouth still laughing still coughing i see merrily said go and get warm vicar thats the best thing robbie was complaining that his coffee would be ready couldnt this wait but jane persisted these guys were sometimes inclined to forget they were getting paid fairly decent money to feed young minds i suppose youve been reading some trashy novel he said no mr williams jane said ive been to garway church robbie sat down again behind the history room desk have you now seriously interesting place yes it is robbie said spent many a day there fully absorbed morrell the head had introduced this system where sixthformers got to call teachers by their first names like they were your mates it just led to awkwardness in janes view and this was a view clearly shared by the head of history who refused even to reveal his first name it had always been r williams so obviously right jane pulled up a chair so if anybody could answer my questions about garway and the templars for you mr williams the midmorning break is over damn and blast robbie said mildly dropped myself in it there didnt i he had to be coming up to retirement sparse white hair tweed jacket comfortably overweight and unlike most of his smoothie colleagues so determinedly uncool that he almost was cool you see its not exactly very big that church jane said but so full of mysteries she wasnt going to tell him she hadnt been into the actual church yet due to them running into mrs morningwood and everything anyway no problem shed been on the commonroom computer and there were two or three websites with stacks of pictures of the churchs unique features the templar coffin lids in the floor the enigmatic carvings the remains of the circular nave robbie took off his brownframed glasses looked at the ceiling thing is jane theres an awful lot of twaddle talked about the knights templar always has been supposed to be magicians and guardians of famous secrets but in reality they were uneducated and illiterate most of them werent even monks in the true sense simply a religious brotherhood who observed various disciplines and went out into the world to fight people but they obviously knew about magic and astrological configurations and things not obviously at all girl magic in medieval times was a high science chronicled in latin and greek hardly for the illiterate yeah maybe one kind of magic but like what about all the hedge witches and the local conjurers youre saying they were intellectuals i mean there was always like an instinctive element surely like something that was passed down an oral tradition perhaps im merely saying that the ornate web of mythology woven around the templars was precisely that but you dont know that you dont know that they hadnt theyve became a very convenient repository for ludicrous conspiracy theories and you need to remember that i but you dont know that they didnt develop some instinctive spiritual feel for teach history jane not newage theology ok history jane focused the templars were linked to the cistercians right thats one theory and the cistercians were known for being close to the earth in like a pagan way always settled in remote places where they could be selfsufficient and they studied the stars and they were well into landscape patterns and stuff to an extent and that wouldntve been written down in latin would it and ok if the templars werent into magic what about all the charges that were proved against them secret rituals at night the charges were not proved jane the pope clement v actually declared that they were un proven but decided to dissolve the templar order anyway because these accusations had brought it very much into disrepute but if you ah jane robbie williams sat back arms folded smiling almost fondly and shaking his head you really are a most unusual girl hard to think of anyone else in your year who displays the smallest curiosity about anything not actually involved with achieving the necessary qualifications and im not being very helpful am i why dont you tell me where youre going with this or hoping to go for the first time jane felt her engine stall couldnt tell him that stick to questions teachers always liked questions theres only one pub left in garway right the moon robbie patted his comfortable stomach i do know my hostelries did you know there used to be another three called the sun the stars and the globe i didnt know that how interesting do you know how far those names go back well i havent had a chance to check it all out yet but it does suggest theres some astrological tradition in the area doesnt it astronomical anyway then again it may be simply that some chap opened a pub called the moon and another chap set up in opposition and called his the sun and so on yeah i suppose sorry jane what else have you found the dovecote with compartments your guess is as good as mine on that one could be a coincidence could be someones idea of a joke or it could be rather sinister who knows how about the green man ah robbie said a bell at the end of the passage signalled the end of breaktime the stone face carved into the chancel arch jane said quickly and nobody knows what it really means even though theyre fairly common in churches yes is the green man of celtic origin or early medieval and does this one even qualify for the title how do you mean a green man is by definition a foliate face leaves and vines coming out of his mouth and his nose and whatnot yes jane had a picture of it in her head from one of the websites the blank eyes the stubby horns but whats interesting robbie said is that the specimen inside the chancel arch at garway appears to have no foliate embellishments whatsoever no representation of greenery emerging from its mouth instead what on closer scrutiny is quite obviously a thick studded cord with tassels at either end i admit thats puzzled me too what could it mean well now robbie leaned forward in his chair he smelled quite strongly of mints if we return to the list of charges against the templars they were if you recall accused of worshipping an idol in the form of a bearded male head yeah of course it was supposed to have powers it was also said to have a cord wound around it robbie said holy sh jane slid to the edge of her chair so that face could be baphomet robbie raised both arms and joined his hands behind his head it came to be known as baphomet a name for which there seem to be several explanations the most common of which is that its a corruption of muhammad and the templars during the crusades would obviously have been much exposed to islam the templars couldve been secret muslims this could be a kind of islamic idol the muslims dont have idols jane and if we pursue that theory we also tend to stumble over the word worship while the muslims afford their prophet the very greatest respect they only worship allah maybe the pope or somebody put a spin on that because like messing with muhammad that would be serious heresy right obviously it would however since those days in the west anyway baphomet seems to have acquired a rather darker image satanic even demonic anyway which is where it rather departs from the medieval historians sphere of expertise so youd need to research that at the library but like the fact that the heads set into the chancel arch the entrance to the holiest part of the church if that is baphomet robbie put on a slightly twisted conspiratorial smile is he guarding the altar or is he drawing attention away from it think for instance which side its on well erm obviously she hadnt seen the actual thing only the picture which was closeup i suppose that would depend which side youre approaching it from its only visible from one side jane the side facing you as you walk in putting it very firmly on the left oh sinistral as it were the lefthand path hah now im getting carried away and my coffee will be completely cold robbie rose from his chair i do so hate cold coffee im sorry mr williams but youve been really helpful i suppose i really ought to have asked you why youre so interested in all this maybe ill tell you sometime might on the other hand be better if i never knew jane she watched him plodding across to the door his battered briefcase under an arm and couldnt believe how after rubbishing all her other ideas and dismissing the templars as some kind of thick thugs hed suddenly come out with something as weird and disturbing as this she came to her feet oh robbie stopped neck hunched into his shoulders as if shed thrown something at him just one more thing mr williams have you ever heard of a green man or a bearded head or whatever that wasnt in a church say in a public building or a house cant say i have and unless it was in a chapel that would strike me as unlikely he turned and looked at her his eyes narrowing why have you seen one somewhere else no no jane slid her chair back under one of the desks i just wondered thats all this time the phone was picked up at once gatehouse sophie its me look im sorry about this but i know its been on the radio no more brutal form of suicide in my opinion than to lay ones head in the path of a train the engine driver is usually traumatized i did try to ring you i dont think the bishop knows yet it brings up the question of going back to garway oh sophie said i doubt hed want that now i think i want it merrily some people appear to be locked into a tragic cycle and whatever we a cycle i just might have broken if id known more yes you would think that i need to understand as far as i can what happened thats surely for the police to establish or the coroner superficially and you think this would need a full week i dont know ive had another message i cant really ignore ill explain when i know a bit more you want me to tell the bishop please ill see if ruth wisdoms still available merrily mmm i think you need to be very careful sophie said this may go deeper than either of us had imagined merrily made some tea and took it into the scullery lit a cigarette and stared unhappily at the answering machine for a minute or so before rewinding the last message the one waiting for her when shed come in from the churchyard mrs watkins morningwood come and see me will you darling a pause then someone didnt do a terribly good job did they was it you or was it me or is something dreadfully amiss invaded space back off merrily huw said youre not thinking youre reacting she said nothing over by the door to the hall stood two overnight bags packed she didnt have a respectable suitcase let it lie lass attend to your parish go into the church morning and evening for three days contemplate let things settle and then look at it again ive just been to the church it wasnt a great success i was probably too emotional my point exactly anyway merrily said it was already too late she was on the mobile in the kitchen using the mobile too much thanks to bliss and his paranoia so you think you had a bit of a psychic experience do you thats what this is all about no what its about is that two people are dead for reasons it seems unlikely anybody will ever be able to explain except possibly me after a fashion and too late because i was putting my home life and my parish and my personal comforts before the job i agreed to take on because i was being lax and lazy wrong attitude lass mopping up huw its just mopping up and a miserable attempt at penance i wont exactly enjoy it but i dont think i really deserve to mopping up huws voice rose uncharacteristically its digging up its disturbing the ground its exposing live wires a little woman with a bucket and spade spade wires mrs morningwood talking about the sometimesdormant feud between the gwilyms and the newtonsgrays like a live electric wire under the ground and periodically someone would strike it with a spade ive told you what to do huw said talk to the vicar of monkland or whoevers attending to the funerals and the bloke standing in at garway you then have a requiem at garway church followed by a blessing or something a bit heavier but dont overdo it at the house two priests plus interested parties bang bang out and if it goes on what deaths i dont know they bring in another builder who happens to have a heart attack whatever i need to find out whats there merrily theres masses there its always going to be there garways layered with it that whole area tantalizing little mysteries codes nobodys going to crack and symbols and forgotten secrets and occasionally summat flares so you tamp it down and you walk away and with any luck it wont flare again in your lifetime youre saying its too big to deal with too big too deep its knights bloody templar folksve been obsessing over the buggers for centuries you dont need it one week merrily looked across at the overnight bag im giving it one week max shed phoned teddy murray oh dear hed said all vagueness the kind of minister who held garden fêtes and came to tea i was told it was all off never mind im sure we can organize a room do everything we can to ensure your stay is as painless as possible think of it as an autumn break in gods weekend retreat he clearly hadnt known about felix and fuchsia all right huw did one of his slow meditative sighs she thought of him pushing weary fingers through hair like waste silage tell me again tell me what happened to you im not going into it again because it sounds stupid and if anyone told it to me id react the way youre reacting oh for listen dont get me wrong merrily i accept that summat happened youve been doing this long enough to know the difference and itd be patronizing of me to suggest otherwise give me the physical symptoms i dont you bloody do all right couldnt breathe heart going like an old washing machine and and the feeling of being i was transfixed it was like id invaded his space and had to take the consequences it felt evil it was without heart i thought it had some kind of worm coming out of its mouth but it was rope or something fibrous there was a sense of naked contempt and a sense that it was alive i was trying to pray as you do the breastplate second nature and i couldnt get the words out couldnt you know form the words jane was calling to me from across the room and she might as wellve been miles away there was just me and him id invaded his space he invaded mine howd he do that it was just an instant a microsecond of insidious cold a a penetrating cold sexual jesus huw was it the socalled green man merrily stifled the shudder leaning back hard carries a lot of associations some of them fertilityoriented therefore therefore its all subjective jesus wept you go in with that kind of nambypamby academic attitude youre stuffed before you start youre a priest you either treat it as a level of reality or you back off which is what as your spiritual director im formally suggesting that you do youre spending too much time in your hellfire chapel huw she listened to him breathing shut her eyes bit her lip im sorry lets lay it out huw said a woman kills her lover and then tops herself and youre worried its because of something she picked up at this house that correct i think that its a question that needs an answer and a question that neither the police nor the coroner are ever likely to ask even though the only experience in that farmhouse she told you about was a noteventhinlydisguised scene from a famous ghost story by monty james i cant explain that doesnt help either that the story predates jamess visit to garway by about fifteen years and bears no relation to your own perceived experience no frannie blisss face had appeared at the kitchen window peering in hands binoculared against the glass merrily pointed in the direction of the door making turning motions to indicate that it was open ever think summats playing with you huw said the way a cat plays with a bird you trying to scare me or something shed noticed hed said bird unlike mice sometimes she thought birds dont escape bliss said im not here all right youre asking me to lie for you again merrily filled the kettle bliss sat down and stretched out his legs under the table hands behind his head he really bothers me that bastard they all do jonathan if thats his name i thought you knew him merrily sat down i thought he worked out of a little office at headquarters no merrily thats bill boyd weve learned to put up with bill jonathan came up from the capital last week apparently to look into a certain issue one of the lesspublicized aspects of nineeleven and sevenseven and the rest is that we get to see a lot more of his sort lofty superior gits in expensive suits what issue youre not the first to ask youre expected to work with him and you dont know what hes investigating bliss glanced at merrily an eyebrow raised i didnt like to ask him directly frannie if he was special branch in case he realized wed been discussing it im grateful merrily so she halfextracted a cigarette and then pushed it back hes not investigating a haunting is he i think its reasonable to assume bliss said that hes looking into a perceived threat against the heir to the throne i dont think i understand applying my renowned deductive skills im working on the assumption that they the duchy of cornwall have received certain communications could be anonymous letters untraceable emails text messages lot of options in the technological age locally or at their head office wherever that is but relating to here thats clear enough posing a direct threat to the man maybe suggesting if im reading between the right lines that the duchy is acquiring too much property in this part of the world but who would that be likely to bother and what can they do about it anyway its probably just a crank merrily alqaeda might just be five towelheads in a cave with a computer a video camera and a mobile phone its crazy its the world were trying to go on living in all right merrily let her chin sink into her cupped hands long did ask a particularly odd question didnt he when we were talking about fuchsia and tepee city he said isnt that a welshspeaking area full of welsh nationalists oldfashioned welsh nationalists was the term he actually used why would he think welsh nationalists are concerned about the prince of wales buying property in herefordshire england doesnt make a lot of sense does it merrily and anyway the days of welsh nationalist terrorism such as it was are long over if he really thought there was anything in it he certainly wouldntve mentioned it in front of you oh merrily bliss bounced his heels alternately off the stone flags like a kid you dont know how much it pisses me off when theres something highlevel going down in my manor that i dont know about you think i can help or youre just here for sympathy bliss smiled merrily leaned back folding her arms thinking it out ok if someone is suggesting that the master house for reasons we cant fathom is one acquisition too many was this before or after felix barlow told adam eastgate that this was a house that didnt want to be restored after would be my guess bliss nodded at the overnight bag in the corner whats with the luggage going to garway why need to merrily pulled over the padded folder containing adam eastgates plans for the master house when she upended it a plastic bag fell out resealed like a police evidence bag she pulled it open and shook out the key onto the table you dont find too many like this nowadays do you outside of churches and prisons bliss said youre not staying there are you too scary and the central heatings not working come on merrily the truth why im going back apart from every time i close my eyes seeing fuchsia mary linden swimming towards me asking to be blessed in the oldfashioned way thats it and all the things we might have found out if i hadnt been so smug and sceptical things that would never come out at an inquest im assuming an inquest is going to be where this ends the media have indeed been told were not looking for a third party bliss said and frankly if it was so much as suggested that the third party might turn out to be the kind of third party i suspect youre looking at then i think weve made a sound decision assuming the forensics support the obvious conclusion that fuchsia killed felix and then herself how important is it to you to find a motive its obviously tidier for us merrily if we can find evidence of domestic strife andor mental imbalance you tried to find the mother by any chance mary linden weve got the birth certificate and the name tallies as does tepee valley but the mothers name is less poetic than linden mary roberts what about the adoptive parents moved on some years ago were trying to pin them down but bloody hippies they could be anywhere were continuing inquiries but we dont have the manpower to make too much of it if you get anywhere would there be stuff youre able to share sometimes its easier for the police to get information than somebody like me with no obvious reason to inquire equally bliss said there are situations where its easier for a harmless cleric to learn things than a copper does that mean were looking at an arrangement you tell me what youve learned from relatives or anyone else i tell you what i can what you can look at it this way frannie most of the stuff i wouldnt feel right divulging is going to be stuff that would embarrass you anyway and the coroner youre so cute merrily bliss said im a professional its odd how people seem to forget that bliss smiled shaking his head particularly me merrily said after a lunch of soup and a cheese sandwich she rang uncle ted the senior churchwarden to explain that she might be away for a few days he was out so she laid it gratefully on his machine uncle ted was still resentful of deliverance although he must know that without it shed probably wind up with another four parishes and ledwardine would see even less of her she rang lol but he must have already left for tonights gig somewhere in south wales shed try his mobile later she ought to go and lie on the bed try and recharge but there was too much to do in a very short time looking up morningwood in the phone book she found just one entry and called it on the mobile poor girl mrs morningwood said nothing about felix just poor girl im coming over either tonight or early tomorrow will you be around mrs morningwood in and out darling never far away always there around nightfall to shut the chicks away and youre where coming in from the hereford side past the turning know where that is no ask three hundred yards sign on the right ty gwyn short track ok if youre not in ill keep trying there was an uncertain pause mrs morningwood cleared her throat reason i called earlier spoke about you with a friend sally in the frome valley a momentary fog you ran into too many people in this job you met it seems under difficult circumstances relating to gypsies mrs morningwood said oh sally boswell at the hop museum her husband al had made lols most precious guitar mandolin soundbox and about a dozen different types of wood lol revered al al revered sally known her for quite some years darling she confirmed what id sensed when we met that you are rescourceful and trustworthy that was very kind of her mrs morningwood can i no come and see me im wary of phones and shed gone suddenly nobody was trusting phones it was getting like the old soviet union merrily dropped the mobile in the intray picked up dobbss charles file and read an unidentified cutting looked from the typeface and the length of the paragraphs like one of the quality broadsheets about the princes diet how aged around thirty after seeing how some pigs were treated hed vowed to become vegetarian dropped red meat taken up raw vegetables lost weight and developed a rather ascetic appearance hed still gone shooting though some family traditions mustve been hard to shed especially with a father like his but the interest in organic farming had grown out of it with impressive results how relevant was any of this stuff if thered been anything immediately pertinent in the dobbs file sophie would have spotted it merrily slid the papers back into the file as the phone quivered before it rang sophie herself you have a locum her voice was not so much dry as arid that was quick merrily im afraid that it isnt going to be ruth wisdom oh ruth has unexpected domestic ties sophie said consequently i had to put out a roundrobin email which im afraid was answered within a very short time i did point out didnt i that jane will still be here i mean shes got her own apartment in the attic but its not a bloke is it im very sorry merrily sophie said you really wont like this but it was out of my hands monster when jane got off the school bus there was a silvergrey car she didnt recognize outside the vicarage she walked over it looked like one of those hybrid jobs that ran partly on urine or something cost an arm and a leg but the driver was guaranteed a martyrs welcome in ecoparadise very tidy inside a pair of womens leather gloves on the dash jane went back to the market square wishing whoever it was would just sod off needing some time undisturbed with mum because what she had in her airline bag was likely to be of serious and sobering significance normally if you had a free period in the afternoon you spent it wiping out any outstanding homework essays jane had had two free periods and had spent them both plus most of the lunch hour on one of the commonroom computers feeling she had something to prove to mum and maybe to coops who she hadnt seen for a few days but she intended to soon she looked around the square for lols cool truck not there he mustve left for his gig jane felt a kind of dismay while it was good that lol had gigs better still that hed found the balls to do gigs inevitably it was pulling him and mum in different directions and although they did their best neither of them in all honesty was what you could call a strong and decisive person outside the eight till late a news bill for the only evening paper that reached ledwardine the star read double death riddle of builder and girlfriend the girlfriend too jane froze literally froze hard against one of the fat blackened oak pillars holding up the market hall she could remember quite clearly a time when shocking death had given her not a shiver but a frisson subtly different fizzing with a forbidden excitement back then death had not essentially been about loss even god forbid the death of her own dad because it had happened when jane was quite young in a highspeed car crash with a woman next to him who had not been mum then theyd moved to the country and death in ledwardine had resonated it was so much closer as close as the churchyard just over the garden wall where funerals were conducted by her own mother before burial in a grave dug by gomer parry whose wife minnie had gone in the hospital in hereford his nephew nev in a fire and there was colette the friend jane had first got drunk with on cider both of them paralytic under the tree in powells orchard where old edgar powell had blown his brains out at the wassailing and worst of all miss lucy devenish janes friend and mentor and inspiration but not for very long before her moped had been on its side in the main road under cole hill the fragility of life random cosmic pruning one snip of the big secateurs and then what sometimes she wished she had mums faith always assuming it really was faith she pictured mum standing at the landing window in her frayed robe staring bleakly out into the drab grey morning this guy the builder obviously jane hadnt known him or his girlfriend but out here he was much more than a cheap cliché on a billboard death riddle tapped onto a screen by some cynical hack in a town where the air was always singing with sirens out here where it was quiet and death resonated hed been part of the fabric working the sandstone and the timber and the welsh slate and the girlfriend mum was not going to be easy to live with tonight now the stuff in the airline bag the printouts from admittedly some fairly lurid websites felt like some kind of porn not the kind that could get you banned from using the computer for the rest of term more insidious than that unnerved by the billboard switching the bag from her left shoulder to her right jane crossed to the vicarage shed seen the woman somewhere before she was fairly sure of that fiftyish and elegant heavy hair with a dull sheen like pewter serious grey eyes dark grey suit dog collar mum said jane this is siân mum was looking to be honest frazzled her skin close to grey standing at a corner of the refectory table like the kitchen wasnt her own which of course it wasnt the church owned it the church owned everything owned mum there was a case in the hall a real leather travellers case with stickers next to mums old overnight bags siân jane stared at the woman the woman smiled in this bland way perfect teeth holy shit it had to be siân callaghanclarke siâns going to be looking after things here for a few days mum said as you erm suspected this morning i need to go over to garway sort some things out this was the woman who only a few months ago had nearly destroyed mum after getting herself made diocesan deliverance coordinator callaghanclarkes view of deliverance seemed to be that it was totally about helping deluded people to seek treatment bringing in this smooth shrink as part of the deliverance module at least hed gone and the last time mum had mentioned callaghanclarke it was to say that shed been keeping a low profile lately not interfering never going into the office but mum was inclined to take her eye off the ball jane is fairly selfsufficient siân she has her own apartm a big room on the second floor and a lot of studying to do so with all the parish business you probably wont get to meet a lot anyway mum smiling inanely here she is jane just stood there like struck dumb ethel doing a figure of eight around her ankles hello jane callaghanclarke said ive heard such a lot about you black farce mum had collapsed into the old captains chair in the scullery the door was shut jane with her back to it have you gone insane callaghanclarke was upstairs in the guest room unpacking her fancy case of italian leather covered with stickers from international church synods and it was a big house where voices didnt travel so like why in gods name were they whispering nothing i could do mum said fait accompli ruth wisdom couldnt make it sophie asked around by email siân offered sophie accepted that if shed said no how suspicious would that have looked siâns highly placed in the diocese i wouldnt want sophie to get on the wrong side of her over something like this i have to stay here with this monster shes not a monster jane shes just an ambitious very smart exbarrister with some kind of calling mum started to laugh one of those laughs where things really cant get any worse your builder guy jane said theres a news bill outside prossers it says the girlfriends yes it was worse than jane had expected immediately she was imagining doing it one ear squashed into the cold steel track the other exposed to the enormous sawbench scream of the oncoming train did she lie facing it watching the lights or was she turned away feeling the vibration inside her brain her whole body hunched and tensed foetal what could make a fairly young and apparently beautiful woman batter to death somebody shed loved and then have herself demolished her face ground into fragments of bone shreds of tissue jane pulled the plug on it she dragged over the other chair and sat down why does callaghanclarke want to come here like whats the ulterior motive jane there im not a kid any more mum i can keep my mouth shut and ive been around this situation long enough to get a feel for seedy c of e politics why ok mum said to look at it charitably oh yeah sure lets all be terribly christian about it to look at it charitably first maybe she just wanted to help out knowing this was a job that the bishops keen we deal with efficiently and it would need to be a woman she wants to be the first woman bishop right archdeacon apparently in the short term what the present archdeacons coming up to retirement possibly next year becoming archdeacon would be a good stepping stone to a bishops palace when that becomes a possibility for a woman jane thought about this as she understood it the archdeacon was like the bishops chief of staff the head of human resources in the diocese he or she organized priests the archdeacons in charge of like not replacing vicars who retire or burn out so the rest of you can all have seventeen parishes each the bishops axeman or woman something like that mum wasnt laughing now the word is according to sophie that siâns shadowing archdeacon neale for a month using the time to put together a new game plan for rationalizing the diocese ive known for a while that i could be affected but you can say no to more parishes cant you i can but im on a fiveyear contract which may not be renewed if i dont agree with whatever they propose no getting round the fact that im one of the very few to have only one church because ive also got deliverance she wants to figure out how to turn you into the vicar of north herefordshire with south shropshire and no time for deliverance who knows you sound like you dont care what can i do anyway siâns view has always been that deliverance should be spread out over quite an extensive team so you have a larger number of clergy with rudimentary training in aspects of healing and deliverance like the way stupid analogy but its all i can think of a percentage of police are firearmstrained many more now than there used to be and youd jane was dismayed youd actually go along with that i think too many armed cops can be dangerous better to have a handful who know when not to shoot but i didnt get ordained to become deliverance consultant youre good at it i dont care what you say anyway it might all be academic she may not become archdeacon and theres nothing she can do in a few days you reckon just stay cool disappear into your apartment feed the cat and dont get into arguments me arguments please ill try not to antagonize her but i will be keeping an eye on her just dont make it too obvious discretion is my middle name mum smiled this weak kind of if only smile her face looked drawnin blotchy you know what jane said you shouldnt be going to garway you should be going to the docs theres nothing wrong with me have you looked at yourself just need a good nights sleep no you just dont want to give kent asprey the satisfaction of having you at his mercy im all right probably one of those twentyfourhour bugs be fine tomorrow why are you hugging that case you werent fine yesterday jane took her airline bag over to the desk and unzipped it look im sorry but im afraid this isnt going to help you sleep mum stiffened whatve you done no its not i was talking to robbie williams the head of history i know hes a medieval historian and he knows a lot about the crusades and the knights templar jane you didnt i didnt say a word about you i just said id been across to garway and got interested bottom line is i asked him about the green man and he said he thought the one at garway church was a representation of something else jane pulled out her plastic document case and opened it out all the stuff shed printed out from the net for some reason sods law it opened to the crude engraving of the dark and devilish bearded figure with a goats head and cloven hooves wings and a womans breasts and a candle burning on its head between the horns mum went oh for gods sake scarecrow for the vulgar an image oozing calculated perversity paint it in blood on the wall in the soiled sanctity of some abandoned crypt the devil the antichrist the beast the oldest enemy introduced into the vicarage inevitably by little jane merrilys first instinct was to cover it up with the mouse mat take it away but that would be playing into its hooves dont let siân see it siân whose upper lip would pucker in distaste not revulsion no nervous fingering of the pectoral cross here merely distaste at the medievalism of it only it wasnt medieval nineteenth century probably merrily propped up the plastic folder against the computer and gazed into the smudgy smirk of the goatmanwomandemon the face of bored decadence the face of lookatmeimsotwistedandsatanicanddontyoujustloveit the red and black ink had blurred making it look even more perverse hints of blood and lipstick its an old printer and i probably whipped the paper out too fast jane said youve got to be a bit careful about what you download morrell has occasional dawn swoops anyway this is the work of eliphas levi you have heard of him heard of him merrily turned wearily to jane flower ive worn his jeans jane scowled merrily smiled fractionally sorry yeah i have heard of him french occultist late nineteenth century or thereabouts who under his real name was an ordained priest although he and the catholic church became increasingly estranged didnt help when he ran off with a sixteenyearold girl like aleister crowley who claimed to be his reincarnation he really wanted to be a rock star but unfortunately for both of them rock music wouldnt be invented for another century i hate it when youre flip jane said although i realize its essentially a defensive thing merrily felt the thickness of the file must have taken jane quite a long time to collect all this sorry youve gone to a lot of trouble yeah i suppose you could be pointing me in a direction i hadnt thought of both levi and crowley as i recall were at some stage in their murky careers into what they saw as the tradition of the knights templar if you already know it all ive been wasting my time jane snatched down the copy of the engraving looking quite hurt merrily sighed ive probably forgotten most of it remind me that woman will be down soon no she wont shell see the value of giving us some time to talk before i leave it was like this in with no crusades on the agenda the poor knights of christ and the temple of solomon were no longer even pretending to be poor they were multinational bankers a wealthy powerful secretive and formidable presence the guardians of too many arcane secrets that was janes view of it but to orthodox historians they were simply a threat to the french monarchy and the pope this pope anyway clement v based at avignon and therefore under the protection of the french king philip iv a puppet pope jane talked and it all came back how the list of charges against the templars was drawn up or dreamed up nobody could quite say but it was impressively damning they denied christ they didnt believe in the mass they practised sodomy and exchanged obscene kisses on being received into the order they were taught that the masters of the order none of them ordained priests could absolve them from sin and they worshipped this bearded head which came to be known as baphomet mr williams had told jane that the name was seen by some sources as a corruption of muhammad but merrily vaguely remembered other interpretations it was quite clever jane said if you look closely at the charges you can definitely see where some of them are coming from yeah i know the denial of christ could mean that they were simply denying the divinity of christ because they were supposed to have known the socalled truth that hed died leaving behind his girlfriend mary magdalene and their family on the same basis you have the rejection of the mass because allegedly they knew there could be no transubstantiation right and then we come to the head ok tell me about the head probably goes back to the celtic cult of the head jane said i hadnt heard of that connection the celts saw the head as the receptacle of the spirit right mr williams thinks the templars actually did worship the head or maybe just recognized it as symbolic of something consider the fact that the templars were linked to the cistercians and gnostic sects here we go and other guys who werent stupid enough to reject centuries of prechristian knowledge of nature and harmony with the land and and a lot of other practical stuff that you cant get in any way from the bible yeah yeah im sure it mustve been symbolic of something however if the bearded head represents that revolting joke merrily jerked a thumb at the engraving of the horned beast with the candle on its head then it really doesnt say a lot to me about mankinds links with the earth especially as it also features in black masses and is often found above the altars of satanic temples you havent actually read levi have you somehow that thing with the teenage girl kind of said it all for me but go on what it basically comes down to jane shuffled papers is whole centuries of superstition smears and misrepresentation its a hieroglyphic representing male and female and illumination the candle its also pan the goatfoot god the spirit of nature ok listen to this the symbolic head of the goat of mendes is occasionally given to this figure and it is then the baphomet of the templars and the word of the gnostics bizarre images which became scarecrows for the vulgar so only thick people think there could be anything evil here and the church of course jane shrugged well thank you flower youve converted me ill pack in all this christian crap put up a goat of mendes poster in the hall only ten dollars from the church of satan and all fallen angels sacramento and once ive popped into the church and spat on the altar all right you can mock jane stood up im just trying to show you what youre dealing with thats all there are two sides to everything so the garway green man is actually baphomet mr williams thinks that he knows garway church and he thinks it makes sense and if what you found inside the inglenook at the master house was a replica of the baphomet in the church you didnt tell robbie williams about that no i just asked about it in a general kind of way only i would hate any of this to get back to your beloved head teacher because if morrell thought i was involving you a minor in what he regards as my unscientific primitive and superstitious occupation its ok i dont think robbie williams likes morrell either and in case janes gaze softened in case you were fearing the worst even i would be a bit wary of bending a knee to baphomet or the goat of mendes she came over and merrily halfrose and then they were spontaneously hugging ridiculous embracing your heathen daughter because shed granted you the concession of drawing the line at actual devil worship more probably merrily guessed it was the formal sealing of a pact against what was upstairs jane look im sorry it was a bad night and its not been a great day i dont really know what im supposed to be doing going over to garway it could be a wasted exercise even huw owens telling me to back off because whatever happened there concerns ancient secrets that arent going to get cracked definitely not by someone like me he actually said that i dont think he meant it in any mystical sense i think he was saying id just tie myself up in knots getting nowhere and when you come home and hang all this on me with the saintly siân upstairs merrily was feeling almost painfully tired tired and inept huw was probably right tamp it down walk away and with any luck it wont flare again in your lifetime listen theres one final thing mum jacques de molay the last grand master of the templars i think theres an engraving of him here ive got it there he looks a bit like baphomet himself doesnt he merrily looked at the drawing of the figure with the cross on his surcoat dignified but defiant che guevara or maybe just the quiet one from some electricfolk band in the s he was burned at the stake jane nodded after refusing to confess to sodomy sacrilege and the rest of it most of the others who were arrested did confess after being threatened and tortured but de molay insisted to the end that he was a good christian he said he wanted to die facing the church of our lady but get this before the flames took him he said that god would avenge him he said the pope and the king of france could expect to see him again before too long i know de molays dying curse wheres this going jane neither the king nor the pope lasted a year and jacques de molay became this kind of cult figure still is apparently yes there was some guy in the french revolution jane said and when they guillotined louis xvi he was like this is for jacques de molay merrily thought she could hear footsteps on the stairs and stood up felt for a moment slightly dizzy suppose id better show siân around hang on jane said i havent told you yet sorry only and this isnt like supposition or legend or anything this is official history i think it was all right merrily paused holding the door handle aching for a cigarette what happened in that was the year jacques de molay came to garway jane said bev and rev setting out a place by the window in the whitewashed dairy now the guests dining room beverley murray glanced at teddy across the table and you could almost see it happening this smouldering issue reigniting in the air between them then beverley went back to the cutlery tray and teddy said if handled discreetly i think it would be sensible discretion being the operative word when was there beverley letting the cutlery clink more than was necessary when was there ever discretion in a place like this sometimes i think that damned radio mast picks up everything we say and broadcasts it into everybodys living room in which case merrily needs to get it all done and dusted before too many people find out by too many people teddy presumably meant some of the cranks likely to descend on garway next weekend for the templar memorial service quick as i possibly can merrily was not feeling up to an argument as soon as i can establish what were looking at meaning help me here teddy prised out a reluctant chuckle merrily has a most unenviable job bumps in the night being an area most of us tend to steer clear of too many pitfalls if theres a crisis in the parish teddy tends to take himself for a walk beverley said she was maybe ten years younger than teddy one of those brisk practical shorthaired blondes whod become a familiar breed in these parts like the golden retriever their farmhouse was eighteenthcentury a block of sunburnedlooking stone wedged into the hillside half a mile beyond the church ruinous outbuildings scattered below it like scree the ridge dinner b b walkers welcome two public footpaths intersected below a terrace with tables and green and yellow umbrellas balm for the soul this landscape teddy was in thick socks still carrying his walking boots by their laces youll start to feel it soon merrily take away that anxious frown teddy well its true bevvie he turned to merrily sorry if im being tactless but i have to say i dont think ive seen anyone alter as dramatically as you have in just a few days well yes sudden death inevitably a shock to the system but its not your fault my dear not your fault yes well merrily said maybe a good nights sleep or as i say a good walk oh i know bevvie thinks im an avoider but the countryside calms and strengthens one of the functions of a parish priest is to remain centred and essentially placid he means passive beverley said in other words uninvolved male priests think theres some sort of dignity to being remote one of the benefits of having girls in the clergy is that at least they arent afraid of getting their feet wet women get involved men go for a walk he does yoga too im afraid basic stuff but it keeps one in trim teddy dumped his boots by the door like to enjoy this place for a couple more decades that so wrong i mean obviously were delighted to have you here merrily beverley said if only the circumstances were different yes thanks if only merrily was the sole guest although a party from germany was expected at the end of the week there were nosmoking signs in the dining room the lounge her bedroom and the ensuite bathroom at the end of the day im afraid i really dont see beverley said why this community has to be dragged into something which might be terribly sad but is also sordid sordid sordid bad enough that teddys forced to conduct a service next saturday for a bunch of anoraks i suppose but nothing to do with the knights templar is terribly healthy it seems to me the activities they were accused of well no smoke without fire thats my view outside the window rolling shadows chased the last of the sunlight out of a patch of woodland i can understand how you feel merrily said carefully when shed rung from the vicarage thinking shed go to garway in the morning teddy murray had invited merrily over for supper jane listening to her vacillating had held up both palms pushing go and it was the only way she realized that now timeconsuming but if you went in cold you learned no more than the police would or the media interviews statements on the record therefore restricted really it was about listening as shed said at the sunday meditation not quite getting through to shirley west merrily shivered not the first time beverley noticing at once cold merrily oh no not at all goose walked over my after a light supper vegetarian not a problem grow our own the three of them were sitting around a glassfronted wood stove in the lounge which had rough panelling and a small cocktail bar like a pulpit in one corner more coffee i think beverley said reaching for the pot and teddy having collected more of bevs sidelong glances discreet as neatly folded notes made another approach how much of a public affair does this have to be merrily well i wont be selling tickets no ha i think what im asking eight people max thats what i was thinking you me a representative of the duchy a couple of friends or relatives of felix and fuchsia and tell me if you think this is going to be a problem members of the two families whove owned the place the grays and the gwilyms oh lord teddys whitebearded chin sank into his chest and merrily pined for a liedown and a cigarette she sat up a bit ambitious do you think they dont speak to one another you know i did hear that family feuds in this part of the world can be very bitter indeed and go on literally for centuries its not a joke beverley was filling cups personally i think it might cause more trouble than any of this is worth theres still a lot of superstition in this area and this is almost encouraging it i mean how can a house it seems more than a little absurd yes merrily nodded i suppose it does later when teddy had gone for his evening stroll she joined beverley in the kitchen stainless steel halogen lights ultrafunctional no dust no stains no dark corners beverley wiped down a worktop with a damp cloth i didnt want to be offensive merrily and im still a churchgoer of sorts but do you really think the atmosphere of a place can affect the way someone behaves make them do something horrible i suppose i have to say yes sometimes in a way but and that you can do something about it how were you supposed to answer that tell her about the times you awoke in the night and wondered if you werent just patching up the fabric of a great big ancient but flimsy construction that was in fact completely hollow merrily closed her eyes momentarily finally admitting to herself that she wasnt very well couldnt be prementrual she wasnt due for another ten days you ok merrily im fine the thing is i thought at first it was going to be nothing i thought the bishop was going over the top in asking for a full inquiry then two people die yes beverley threw the cloth into one of three sinks something you said earlier worried me a little mmm when you said there should be no more than eight people at this ceremony and that one of them should be teddy how necessary is that i suppose what im saying and please dont tell him weve had this conversation hed be angry with me is that id really rather you did it without him i see no you dont what you see is a fit healthy athletic man who walks at least five miles every morning before breakfast you dont see what i saw when he was the rector of our village near cheltenham how long ago was this six years thats how long weve been married anyway i was recently divorced at the time when i first met teddy and my son was abroad gap year before uni beverley said shed had room to breathe for the first time in years shed been awarded the house in the divorce settlement and there was a recent bequest from an uncle but shed only been forty and on the lookout for a meaningful job i was thinking of going back to nursing but thats a thankless task nowadays nhs hospitals are like meatprocessing plants beverley switched on the dishwasher and then mercifully dimmed the lights she stood looking out of a small square window towards the glowing of distant farms telling merrily how shed started going to church helping out spending time with the rector much as merrily had when her own marriage had been coming unstitched the difference being that it had led merrily into a personal calling and bev into a project called teddy his workload was becoming ridiculous poor man four large parishes in gloucestershire and the phone never seemed to stop ringing and then the main church was broken into five times in two years you get that too i imagine not so far then youve been very lucky the final straw was a wave of absolutely awful vandalism well not just vandalism desecration gravestones pushed over defaced strange symbols chiselled into them and one night someone broke in and actually defecated in the church which was horrible horrible horrible and a police matter surely youd think so wouldnt you its only when it actually happens that you find out that unless the damage is very serious or someones been hurt the police really arent interested in the slightest they might show up and take a statement looking rather bored but you never hear from them again how long did this go on couple of months intermittently there was supposed to be a neighbourhood watch in the village but they were only interested in protecting their own homes teddy would be out patrolling the churchyard himself at all hours of the night one night he almost caught someone and was knocked to the ground what is happening in our society sometimes theyre killed priests killed outside their own churches weve been lucky in this part of the world so far i suppose thats one advantage of a place where everyone knows everyone else but to cut a long story short he more or less had a breakdown constantly tired youd see his hands trembling dropping the prayer book at service when the graves were desecrated some people in the parish were talking about well it was inevitable i suppose what satanism that sort of thing whatever it was it wasnt pleasant it left a nasty taste teddy seemed to age about ten years i found myself looking after him its what im good at i suppose he erm he wasnt married then his wife had died some years before car accident the church was his life if you could call it a life and in the parish the nerve of people the way some of them reacted when they found out i was divorced i mean it was hardly a major scandal one night i said for gods sake why dont you pack in this stupid stupid job and lets move to somewhere they dont know us and start a guest house i did know what i was doing by the way my parents were hoteliers he got early retirement after i threatened to go to the press overworked overpressured underpaid and under threats of violence literally there were threatening phone calls didnt i say untraceable these days people make them from cheap mobiles but he got early retirement and we wound up here not quite my idea of an idyll but the people are ok they dont judge bev and rev thats what they call us in the pub we thought of having it on the sign outside but that would be a little too cosy he seems ok now i tease him about his walks but its really done him the world of good the four years weve been at garway learned all the history guides people around leads expeditions and able to keep his hand in with the church just our bloody luck that the vicar would have to leave and thered be an unexpected hiatus before the next one takes over and teddy would feel obliged to stand in fulltime and that it should coincide god help us with this madness it wasnt clear whether she meant the master house problem or the templar service maybe both what sort of service is he going to give them we still havent given up hope that someone else might take it on beverley looked at merrily eyes steady i dont suppose beverley most of what i know about the knights templar i got from teddy the other day all he needs is an ordinary service with a couple of customized prayers a sermon about the need for religious tolerance and i dunno onward christian soldiers beverley would it be ok if i your exorcism service someone prone to stressrelated problems that could be damaging couldnt it well it its been known but in the vast majority of cases it so if you do need an extra minister at your whatever you call it deliverance perhaps you could call in another exorcist or something merrily nodded wearily sure shed end up doing it on her own in the dim mouldsmelling room the atmosphere swollen with historic hostility the baphomet grinning in the inglenook is that all right beverley said of course would it be ok if went to bed im feeling a bit oh im so sorry you must be absolutely exhausted its obviously been a difficult couple of days just a bit tiring merrily said as always when you were feverish there wasnt much sleep that night strange bed a hard fitnessfreak mattress getting up around two am feeling hot and leaning out of the firstfloor window cold air on bare arms murky night obscuring distance so that the end of the cigarette feebly glittering against the moonless sky was like the tail light of a passing plane before bed merrily had called jane on the mobile jane said siân callaghanclarke had been very friendly not at all what shed imagined theyd actually talked for a couple of hours about siâns time as a barrister and janes problems finding the right career plan erm great merrily said hey mum its not my fault she wasnt being a bitch i never said a word that meaningful pause said it all you remembered to feed ethel like ethel would let me forget mum dont small hiss of exasperation hows it going there how was it going merrily peered down the valley into vague dustings of light there was a prickling of fine drizzle now on her arms she pulled them in stubbing out the cigarette on the stone wall under the windowsill feeling cold now and hollow and disoriented no sense of where she was in relation to the top of the hill with its radio mast or the hidden valley of the church the rum place where m r james believed hed caused some offence this was not an easy place jacques de molay had located it though in the last grand master of the order of the poor knights of christ and the temple of solomon had sailed from france then ridden across southern england to visit the remote preceptory at garway according to janes internet research nobody appeared to know why hed come or what hed done here and if there were no crazy theories on the net last refuge of the extreme she shut the window groped her shivery way back to bed please god not some bloody bug woke again from a darkly vivid dream in which the tower of garway church was with her in the room the tower was standing in the far corner beyond the window its vertical sliteyes solemnly considering her guarding its secrets knowing hers she sat up violently in bed the duvet gathered around her the moon had come out sprinkling talcumpowdery light on the wardrobe the wardrobe no more than half a century old was roughly the same shape as the church tower and had twin vertical ventilation slits high up in each door black now you could go crazy merrily lay down again rolling herself in the duvet turning her back on the wardrobe stupidly grateful that the ridge was not the globe and the room had only one bed when she walked on to the square in ledwardine a crowd was gathering but nobody was looking directly at her although she was collecting meaningful sidelong glances from people like the prossers james bulldavies alison kinnersley and shirley west it was a deep pink dusk and the lights were coming on lol wouldnt be at home of course he was off on a gig somewhere so why was there a filtered light in his cottage in church street she walked across the square getting out the key hed given her but she didnt need it the door was slightly ajar she went in there was a dim light in the hallway and low music coming from somewhere the song cure of souls from lols album the one hed written about her before they were together did you suffocate your feelings as you redefined your goals and vowed to undertake the cure of souls over the music came the throaty notes of slippery female laughter dripping down the stairs like a pouring of oil was a shiny black discarded dress merrily heartbroken ran out back onto the square where they were burning jacques de molay his cold eyes fixed on hers through the darkening smoke as his white smock shrivelled up turning brown she awoke sweating and shivering no light in the sky part three mystery is a way of saying that we do not fully understand what it is that we are experiencing or talking about but nonetheless we know it to be real and not false it is not about trying to evade important questions as to how or why or what kenneth stevenson do this the shape style and meaning of the eucharist suicide note kind of mrs morningwood having beckoned her into the window now appeared to see something worrying in merrilys eyes youre not at all well are you im fine shoes off mrs morningwood said look i lie down on the chaise longue put that pillow behind your head the other one under your back where the springs have gone in the middle mrs morningwood wore jeans and a military sort of jumper ribbed and a pale lemon silk scarf her hair was down and looked freshly washed merrily tried to focus saw the blur of a timelessly handsome woman no longer overfussed about what she looked like a clock was ticking somewhere the room had cream walls a bentwood rocking chair an ebony desk and a black castiron range with a fresh log on a glowing bed roscoe the wolfhound lying full length below it longer and hairier than the rug he was on im sorry merrily looked around for the clock confused what time is it now i should think coming up to midday clocks in the kitchen we dont allow time in here midday oh my god shed had breakfast at nine most of a boiled egg one slice of dry toast watching teddy murray cheerily loading his knapsack off to plan out a circular tenmile walk for the german party next weekend bev inspecting merrily practical blonde head on one side are you sure youre all right merrily shed gone back to her room lay down for a moment on the bed woke up over an hour later in a panic rushing into the bathroom washing again brushing her hair and stumbling down the stairs nobody about a radio somewhere playing classic fm but it still brought back celloed strands of the cure of souls that reproachful song shed ring lol just as soon as she got back wasnt his fault her dream her paranoia slipping quietly out of the front door which had steps down to the lane forgetting for the moment where shed left the volvo only remembering where she had to go in it past the turning three hundred yards sign on the right ty gwyn short track an end of a terrace two tiny whiterendered cottages at one end knocked together set well back from the road overlooking fields and woodland under a pocked and mottled cheesy sky didnt really remember getting here mrs morningwood had pulled up a piano stool with a black velvet seat to the foot of the chaise longue arranging a blue woollen travelling rug over merrilys legs bending over her feet now reading glasses on her nose separating the toes and then running a thumbnail along one sole it felt like a stanley knife blanking out the pain merrily scrabbled for a question unrelated to her state of health why did jacques de molay come to garway who templar boss havent got a heart condition have you not that im aware of shouldve asked before i started remiss of me jacques de molay i suppose its more or less established that he did come here about twelve years before his unfortunate death i believe where would he have oh my your stomach darling tight as a drum intestines wound up like a watch spring and then something implodes i think youre rather close to an ulcer whatve you been doing mrs morningwood stood back deep lines in her long face all her features hardfocused in the sunless light you really werent aware of this at all no i god itll get less painful after a while at first you know i was thinking premature menopause what no stigma sometimes happens to girls in their twenties probably isnt probably plain stress never had reflexology before well rolling her head in the pillow not quite like this not the seriously painful kind some socalled practitioners are merely playing at it feelgood massageparlour stuff buggerall use to anybody sorry darling what was your question de molay i was trying to ask you where he might have stayed when he was here you really need to rest a holiday when did you last have a holiday four years five i dont know we werent living here then another lifetime i can feel other peoples problems curled up tightly inside you stored away in little sacks the stanley knife again biting into the side of a big toe sacks that swell mrs morningwood said merrily shut her eyes this was not going the way it was supposed to the plan had been to walk in eyes wide open go for some straight answers mrs morningwood you didnt just accidentally bump into jane and me the other day you had an agenda and presumably still have why did you court jane with your revelations about the four pubs and the heavenly bodies why were you so keen that we should check out the master house while you buggered off the pain faded she let her head sink into the pillow with her usual uncompromising dynamism shed staggered up the path under a wooden pergola still lush with vines still trying to find a doorbell or a knocker when the door had opened and shed virtually fallen over the threshold i suppose youre thinking of the master house mrs morningwood said it would make sense of the name certainly doubtless the sort of grand celebrity occasion theyd have wanted to commemorate nobody know for sure so little from that period was written down mrs watkins not exactly known for their illuminated script the templars didnt keep diaries or ledgers far as i know being illiterate couldnt have helped no wordofmouth old wives tales about why de molay came he was presumably inspecting the preceptory why does it interest you trying to get a handle on the place thats all to what extent its connected to the templars a log collapsed in the range gases spurting merrily starting to sweat good mrs morningwood didnt look up working on a toe with both hands like peeling a plum youre probably full of toxins id hate to even inquire about your diet mostly vegetarian bit of fish bit of this bit of that i know a vegetarian diet needs to be carefully organized or therell be deficiencies looks of you i bet you dont even bother to eat at all half the time you find life isnt something that happens between meals life my darling needs to be battered into shape easier said than oh for i thought you said itd get less painful i expect i lied mrs morningwood said when merrily awoke still on the chaise longue the light in the two windows was bluegrey and the light in the castiron range was molten red like the crater of a live volcano like the sun through the glass of red wine shed been given the sun had been out then when shed drunk it gone now the sun and the wine mrs morningwood was rocking gently in the bentwood chair smoking merrily raised herself up on her elbows what was in it nothing much valerian mainly whats that do a remedy for nervous debility unclenches the gut promotes sleep quite rapidly sometimes you didnt tell me that of course i didnt tell you that youdve buggered off this wasnt supposed to merrilys head fell back how long have i been here now why are you so obsessed with time youve been here as long as was necessary right dont get up yet watkins you might fall over couldnt have if shed wanted to merrily felt limp and disconnected and distinctly odd but not in a bad way and not as shed feared in a drugged way something seemed to be vibrating inside her like a motor idling where did you learn all this stuff the basic herbalism and it is basic was from my mother and she had it from her mother and so on always be a morningwood on garway hill as long as badgers shit on the white rocks right merrily felt like someone abducted by aliens taken away to the mother ship physically investigated brought back mrs morningwood supervising the experiment wasnt complicated darling bad diet insufficient sleep and nervous stress youll sleep well tonight probably wee quite a lot first mind and after that its up to you the reflexology picked that up in london seemed to be something i could do almost from the outset technique might go back to ancient egypt who knows that the templars didnt bring it back from the middle east although its not as far as i know in the traditional repertoire of the nine witches of garway garways loss i expect you feel better merrily eased herself up again nodded slowly very aware of the movements of her neck the fulcrum of bones i feel a bit worryingly relaxed smoke if you want to why worryingly relaxed you feel guilty about relaxation teddy murray says its a function of the clergy to appear totally placid at all times i realize thats his excuse for spending hours strolling the hills but maybe theres something how much do i actually owe you mrs morningwood owe its going dark ive been here over half a day lots of other tasks were performed in between you just didnt notice mrs morningwood arose from the chair went over to the range there was an earthenware teapot on the hob she detached a brown mug from a hook but since you mention recompense sadly from your point of view im not much of a christian so yes i have every intention of extracting payment in kind oh what brought you here feeling of failure partly what could you have done mrs morningwood brought over the cup steaming its only tea weak as gnats piss and i can assure you theres nothing in it that will send you back to sleep what do you think you might have done to save either of them couldve believed her thank you merrily sipped holding the mug in both hands swinging her feet tentatively to the floor although i had no reason to at the time drinking the weak tea slowly telling mrs morningwood how fuchsia had claimed to have been haunted by something which it transpired had been invented by m r james interesting youve read that one oh yes and you knew james was in garway my grandmother met him and the girl his ward jane mcbryde but thats by the by so fuchsia mary linden borrowed montys seaside ghost how very imaginative of her whats that say to you only that she didnt want to tell you or barlow what actually happened to her in the master house which was how should i know she wanted me to bless her give her protection before she came back here and then afterwards she returned and battered barlow to death what do you know about barlows history not a great deal merrily thought about it where was this going he spent time in a tepee community in west wales where he met fuchsias mother who was already pregnant felix was a bit in love with her and also i think felt sorry for her he said she was fragile and he seems to have accepted a role as a kind of godfather guardian tragically sealing his own fate if you want to be tepee community mrs morningwood said tepee city in cardiganshire why did barlow go there gap year was all he said no such thing in those days darling i think he was probably being ironic it was just a year between leaving school and having to do something responsible connected with his dads building supplies business which maybe didnt seem very appealing at a time when everyone else seemed to be sleeping around and taking exotic drugs did he mrs morningwood sat on the piano stool mention being a part of any other community before wales no he didnt what are you thinking of im thinking of the one that was in occupation at the master house in the s when the newtons were repeatedly leasing it out dont know anything about it merrily finally brought out her cigarettes some kind of goodlife smallholding did you tell me that good life not me darling bastards couldnt even grow their own dope the house was leased by the newtons to an honourable son of some minor member of the midlands aristocracy newtons were well pleased at first not realizing hed turn out to be the kind of dissolute overprivileged hooray hippie that could turn i dont know sandringham into a shell in a matter of weeks anybody ive heard of shouldnt think so lord stourport merrily shook her head endless rumours about the things that went on there mrs morningwood said orgies and the rest nude bathing in the monnow place would probablyve been burned to the ground result of some discarded spliff if there hadnt been a rather timely police raid result of which lord cokehead was sent down for three months or so lease effectively terminated so why would felix barlow have been there most of the hoorays couldnt replace a washer on a bloody tap so anybody who was halfway practical was welcome to move into one of the sheds drugs on the house long as he brought his tools thats what i was told anyway wouldnt know anything for sure all this happened while i was away well felix was indeed a very practical man but im not getting why you think he wouldve been at the master house in fact merrily sat up the cigarette halfway to her mouth what is your angle on this mrs morningwood where are you actually coming from like what did you mean when you said on the phone that someone didnt do a terribly good job merrily slumped on to the edge of the chaise longue her body felt weak but the low vibration was still there and went cruising up into her head bringing on a dizziness steady girl you got the works you know mrs morningwood turned and threw the remains of her cigarette with practised accuracy into the heart of the fire merrily lay back against the pillows the windows had dimmed crimson caverns opening up in the iron range roscoe the wolfhound rose up and stretched his front legs extended revealing the black smudges of old burn marks on the rug where hed been lying mrs morningwood stood up and moved across to the ebony desk sound of a drawer sliding open she bent and drew the piano stool towards the well of the desk switching on a greenshaded oil lamp converted to electricity placing a fold of paper on the floodlit blotter and beckoning merrily over sit there wont take you long to read it i have to go and shut the chickens in for the night toilets back into the hall second left youll probably need it now youve been on your feet merrily sat looking down at the paper pooled in lamplight apple green she opened it out what is it a suicide note mrs morningwood said kind of with hindsight like a ghost sitting on the lavatory bent over elbows on her knees head in her hands merrily was holding the first sentences in her head people say death is like sleep i just hope theyre wrong sometimes i think i must be very close to death and i hate sleep more than anything it wasnt the original that was clear there was no address and shed looked at the bottom no signature mrs morningwood or somebody must have copied it into a computer when she came out of the downstairs bathroom a bit fresher mrs morningwood had returned and was stripping off her old barbour hanging it in the whitewashed hall fluffing up her hair the first conspicuously feminine thing merrily had seen her do youve read it i had to stop had to go mrs morningwood nodded and merrily went back to the desk in the living room you wouldnt know me muriel theres nothing of me no more i am so thin and my head feels like a rotten egg sometimes and what can you do with a rotten egg except get as far away from it as possible but you cant can you if its inside your head day and night and all your dreams are addled see i remember all about eggs they were the good times merrily looked up this is a girl poor little darkie mrs morningwood came over to the desk brought out a small leather photo album and began thumbing through it it was what people called her almost a novelty in the s a black girl in these parts mixed race actually used to come here on holiday with her parents in a caravan on a farm at bagwyllydiart there the photo its colours faded showed two girls sitting together on a fivebar gate thats you frightening isnt it the young muriel willowy and lovely linking arms with the other girl who was laughing so hard that her face was fuzzed and her white hoop earrings had ghosts they were from coventry black father white mother they didnt appear one year and then we heard the parents had broken up learning later from the poor kid herself that she was being interfered with by the mothers new man shedve been fifteen or sixteen ran away a couple of times finally hitchhiking to just about the only place that had good memories for her here twenty quid in her pocket got picked up by the chip man there was a chap in monmouth ran two or three fishandchip vans came out to the villages one or two days a week he recognized her picked her up gave her a job in his shop in monmouth let her sleep in the room over the top until his wife found out oh it was probably quite innocent shed never have told anyway he was there when she needed help upshot of it she turned up at our door ended up moving in wouldve been on the streets otherwise im sorry to keep on at you but you were always strong and i dont know anybody else i can tell who wouldnt just hate me more you didnt try to contact her parents so she could go back and get fiddled with again not a chance darling she asked us not to anyway and she was sixteen or seventeen we knew that besides i was going to london had a job lined up with a distant relative theatrical agent she filled the space mrs morningwood took the photo back put it in the album left the album on the desk and went back to the hob house was only half as big then i suppose she was here nearly a year my mother found her a post as housekeeper not livein farmer called eric davies whose wifed walked out because she couldnt stand the isolation and erics refusal to take a day off go on read the rest im writing this now because theres times when i still think i can get rid of it if i want to like oh its not that bad its only your body and look at the money your getting i take it this is not about eric davies hardly that came later we exchanged letters for about a year most of them more coherent i have to say than this one she was actually an intelligent girl resourceful adaptable so this is referring to the master house is it mrs morningwood chose a wooden block from the log basket wedged it into the fire and talked about the master house commune two or three couples there originally but there was always room for more bodies in the five bedrooms and outbuildings then two of the women left and one of the men eric davies meanwhile had been made aware of gossip he was in line for chairman or president or something of the local branch of the nfu and someone had discreetly pointed out that perhaps mary roberts was not good for his image middleaged farmer with a little darkie on the premises several hours a day merrily said mary roberts i dont know where she got the name linden from perhaps she thought it sounded pretty bloody hell merrily said youre absolutely sure about this soon as i saw the girl with the builder look at the photo again look at the eyes the eyes were blurred in the picture but the size and the separation well maybe if i had one of her a couple of years later even you would be in no doubt fuchsia the first time i saw her and barlow they werent here to work just look around so not in overalls she was even wearing the same kind of clothes as mary had highly coloured as if shed seen some old photos of her mother and gone out of her way to recreate the image barlow was asking about the house and i tried to help him rambling on in a state of slight numbness trying not to keep staring at the girl hell of a shock watkins like seeing a ghost did you say anything no i needed to know if she knew needed to get her alone the name you that was the clincher marys few possessions included a decrepit muchthumbed paperback copy of titus groan mervyn peake leading female character fuchsia pretty conclusive and did she know never got her alone to ask barlow came back alone some days later telling me shed been troubled by something in the house wouldnt go into details you didnt tell him you may have known fuchsias mother of course i didnt mrs morningwood bit her lip youd better tell me the rest merrily said when you dont go to bed no more because they come to you in your sleep thats pretty bad isnt it and when you wake up its like your body is not yours no more its theirs they can make your arms and legs move about and make you see what nobody should have to see well thats when you think you must be getting close to the end of this sick life and thank god for that id actually wanted her to come to london with me mrs morningwood said i was working for a magazine by this time making better money in the process of moving to a flat in clapham but for reasons i didnt know about at the time she declined i didnt make proper arrangements for the forwarding mail so may have missed a couple of letters from her and then that one arrived five months after it was posted that does not sound good at all i phoned my mother straight away and of course it had all gone wrong mary had been staying away for several nights at a time and then a whole week having taken up it emerged with one of the master house people and taken various drugs obviously possibly judging from the letter lsd or mescaline you wouldnt recognise me now youd walk past me in the street i probably look like some old bag out the gutter i went into hereford once into the shops but i could sense like a shadow behind me all the time and once it touched me and run its fingers down my back and i turned round and i screamed get away get away from me and people did get away they all crossed the road thinking i was drunk or doped up and that was awful i really need normal people not to hate me like your mum does now and your mother hadnt told you any of this there was a distance between us at the time mrs morningwood was smoking again the room clouded roscoe prowling thinking i was doped up merrily said shes saying fairly categorically here that she was neither drunk nor stoned then what mrs morningwood said how would you explain the rest of it i went into the cathedral but it didnt feel right it was too big and quiet and i had to keep walking round to be near people because i dont like being on my own in a big empty place and then i found i was standing in front of the old map you know the one called something in latin and these disgusting things were grinning out at me and the shadow was leaning over me like when the sun suddenly goes in and you feel cold the old map merrily looked up the mappa mundi displayed in the cathedral in those days yes herefords only worldclass treasure medieval map of the world now on view along with the historic chained library in a recently constructed building of their own in the cathedral grounds merrily had seen it a few times never really had time to study it remembered the bizarre drawings around the primitive topography a bear a mermaid a griffon a unicorn didnt remember any of them as grinning or obviously disgusting but and i mustve screamed out or something because there was this man in black clothes and he said ive been watching you he said i can see your in trouble let me help you and i screamed at him get away get away get away your evil i think it was just that he was in black clothes i thought he must be evil he gave me a card to get in touch with him but i never have whats the use one of the cathedral canons might even have been dobbs the exorcist she mustve been looking a bit deranged to get that kind of approach evidently mrs morningwood nodded what does it suggest to you extreme paranoia which obviously could be linked to drug use did the police find any acid if she was still tripping she might look at the mappa mundi with all these mythical beasts and it becomes like a nest of monsters or something ive never seen an inventory of what they found i could probably get some background theres a cop i know no mrs morningwood backing away well out of the pool of light leaving merrily blinking sorry whats the point of involving the police theyre not going to find her now are they not going to be remotely interested find her i thought she was i dont know shes dead i simply never heard of her again nobody i know ever did we even tracked down her mother in birmingham not interested didnt seem to care nobody cared except me because i couldve saved her couldve got her out of there but somebody obviously did mrs morningwoods face was grim amongst the shadows mary came back to my mother apparently unwell stayed for four days quiet penitent and my mother would awake in the morning to hear her throwing up coming to the obvious conclusion which she put to mary when she got up the next morning mary had gone for good didnt leave a note or anything only this one which took weeks to find me i came back at once but of course it was all too late i expect you guessed im writing to ask a favour you were always so strong muriel and i cant go back on my own you see ive got a baby now directionality not that jane was fooled or anything this woman was a former barrister barristers defended people they knew were guilty and prosecuted people they guessed were innocent you didnt need to watch much tv to know that you didnt trust barristers you paid them and if someone else was paying youd mean less than nothing to them theyd take you apart with merciless precision and discard the bits ok siân was a priest now but you could still sense this kind of to borrow a stupid word from one of those higloss us forensic shows directionality focus everything she said was coming from somewhere down in the small print of her personal agenda like when jane was showing her round the vicarage entering the nest of rooms around the back stairs siân going its awfully large isnt it for just the two of you translating as even in its present condition we could flog this place for well over half a million and put you in a bungalow with no attics and no apartment well you know i used to think that too jane had said but that was before we had to take people in like deliverance cases people who think theyre mad need a big house for that so nobody can hear the screams knowing as soon as it was out that if shed been in the witness box siân would have dismantled her having studied all the cases in her capacity as deliverance coordinator shed know this was not even loosely true well except for like dexter harris jane pointing at the blackened oak beam where a door had once hung at the bottom of the stairs that was where he you know yes i heard about that regrettable mum had to do the necessary for quite a few nights afterwards to make sure there was no like detritus yes im sure she would have felt that was necessary like your mother is a superstitious idiot it really hadnt been easy last night having to watch what you said all the time looking for the loaded questions now with dusk and rain seeping in jane in her old parka airline bag over a shoulder was standing between the oak pillars of the market hall looking across at the vicarage psyching herself up before going home except it wasnt really home at all right now was it after school shed slipped into leominster in the vain hope that woolies might have any cd by sufjan stevens who shed just discovered was sufficiently like lol to be interesting catching the last bus back to ledwardine predictably sufjanless shed realized this had been just an excuse to shorten the evening the hardest bit of all was when mum rang and jane taking it from the privacy of her apartment had been like oh no fine shes really quite nice we had a long chat about how shed wanted to be a barrister from the age of about eight mum trying hard to conceal her dismay jane going hey mum its not my fault she wasnt being a bitch knowing that if shed come out with the truth mum would be on edge the whole time imagining this cataclysmic row exploding jane screaming at siân mum imagined her daughter was still fifteen or something and had no subtlety but jane was changing she had to during the lunch hour shed called the vicarage from the school library stockroom borrowing kayleigh evanss mobile in case siân checked getting the answering machine and deepening her voice sounding posh shed asked for the time of the wonderfully inspiring meditation service and would it really be all right if someone from outside the parish attended shed heard it was always so packed a few more calls like that carefully spaced would do no harm at all maybe a toneddown scottish accent next time go careful though because this woman was oops coming out jane stiffened it was strange almost surreal watching another woman cleric emerging from the vicarage drive siân had on a dark belted coat unbuttoned over her cassock the dog collar luminous and her pewter hair gleaming in the lights from the square walking purposefully with directionality up towards the church through sporadic rain on the edge of the square siân was ambushed by brenda prosser from the eight till late nobody else was about so jane could hear most of what they were saying yes i am indeed siân said we couldnt leave ledwardine without a priest for a whole week could we well you know i hadnt seen her since church on sunday brenda said and i thought she might be ill or something she works a bit too hard i think sometimes well thank you brenda merrily is very conscientious siân said now i know youre at the shop mrs prosser and i fully intend oh quite a few years now mrs clarke came over from midwales we did when my husband was made only i hope you dont think im being terribly rude but i did arrange to meet someone at the church at six oclock and ive just realized im going to be late oh im sorry no its not your meet someone hadnt taken her long to get her feet under the table had it and why not meet whoever it was at the vicarage unsettling as the situation may appear trust your instincts listen to your inner voice and by next weeks climactic conjunction of janes horoscope in the sunday times right sod this pulling up the hood of her parka transferring the airline bag to her left shoulder she came out from behind the pillar walking directly towards siân and brenda and then drawing the fur trim across her face she was gliding anonymously past them towards the end of the square crossing the street slipping under the lychgate and running through the spitting rain down to the church calculating that the lower door would be unlocked because tuesday night was choir practice it always felt better sidling in by the smaller door ok she might be coming around to accepting the sense and the structure and the basic morality of christianity but she couldnt imagine ever going the whole way not even when she was old and scared it lacked thrills wasnt sexy and yet its buildings were somehow the church yawned around her that sudden sense of live air you never quite got used to the secondary lights were on high in the rafters jane didnt move until she was sure that all the pews were empty then padding down the aisle listening for footsteps voices sliding into the bull chapel always a good place to hide if anyone came in you could slide around the wooden screen to where the organ was and then out through the chancel the effigy on the tomb of thomas bull longdead squire figure had a naked sandstone sword by its side and instead of the eyelids being humbly lowered the eyes were wide open part of this selfsatisfied halfsmile lowering herself into the only pew jane smiled back dont smirk at me pal your family counts for zilch these days siâns meeting she was thinking maybe uncle ted retired solicitor maybe hed even worked with siân ted in senior churchwarden mode was a hypocritical old sod suspicious of mums deliverance role for ever whingeing that she should be devoting all her energies to the parish ted would love that the village was getting increasingly uppermiddleclass and given the choice between ancient stones and executive homes in colemans meadow hed sell you down the river jane patted tom bulls eroded cheek hoping his bones were twisting and tangling up in fury turn this chapel into a wine bar she jumped as the main doors creaked and they came in together the famous acoustics soon making it clear that this wasnt uncle ted no smoke there wasnt much doubt at all any more was there let me try to understand this merrily said mary was writing to you from tepee city yes mrs morningwood was squatting on the floor now arms around the dog face in deep shadow roscoe panting merrily picked up the letter she wanted to meet you back at garway she wanted you to go with her to the master house because youre the strong one and yet you read this and it doesnt seem right its in my dreams muriel i thought id got away but i cant when i was having the baby it was terrible the dreams i was having then i cant tell you rachel who was looking after me said it was just the hormones and they got rick who was a priest to pray with me and it was all right for a while but then it started again after the baby was born shes had a very bad time at the master house and yet she wants to go back she needs to deal with it mrs morningwood said and now its different now she isnt the only one affected the baby cries too much the baby cries day and night i cant get no sleep and when i do the dreams start the baby cries whenever shes with me thats not how it should be it really frightens me please help me muriel theres nobody else i can go to to do what i need to do you agreed to meet her you replied saying youd i didnt waste time replying i came back drove across to west wales found this rather pathetic community boiling their drinking water from the ditches shed left nobody knew where shed gone they werent terribly helpful nobody told you about a baby then not a word probably thought i was a spy from social services and you never heard from her again nobody did and then of course while i was in wales something else happened the police carried out their famous dawn raid on the master house removing quantities of drugs and the future lord stourport just lord stourport he carried the can couple of others i think nonentities there were said to be some more people involved in the activities but not living in they may have got away minutes before the police broke the door down a dawn raid tends to be less effective when its targets are habitually not going to bed until dawn have you still got the original letter somewhere it was getting worn with repeated agonized readings so i retyped it word for word preserving the erratic application of the apostrophe as you may have noticed and this is all of it i mean is this all she said no explanation of exactly what happened to her at the master house no it perhaps shed explained in a previous letter that went astray that seems the most likely explanation or that she didnt want to put it in a letter anyone might read or that she couldnt bear to write about it whats all this about money look at the money your getting i dont know the people at the master house seem to have been paying her for what evidently not merely as a housekeeper no local gossip about it of course there was gossip sex drugs orgies but nobody really knew what about lord stourport whats happened to him became some kind of rockmusic promoter putting on concerts and festivals and making a ridiculous amount of money last i heard of him he was languishing at his family seat in warwickshire i think he acceded to the title within a few years of coming out of prison i actually wrote to him once asking if he remembered mary roberts had quite a polite civilized reply under the circumstances he could hardly deny hed been at the master house saying thered been quite a number of young women at the house over the months and to his shame he didnt really remember their names that figures lying i dont doubt but darling what could i do you know what always haunted me the thought that mary might have gone back to the master house without you youre very perceptive its merrily shrugged its what wouldve haunted me too look the only thing that occurs to me if shes out there shes likely to have heard about what happened to fuchsia i shouldnt think its made that much impact in the national press but its not a common name is it fuchsia mary linden and if mary is out there you mean if shes still alive youre fairly sure that fuchsia was conceived at the master house almost certainly so her father could be lord stourport himself the story felix gave me was that the father had gone to america but thats the sort of thing mary might just say to forestall questions and you were obviously wondering about felix himself i was simply thinking of reasons why the girl might suddenly have wanted to smash in the skull of the man she was living with mrs morningwood waved an unlit cigarette might she simply have found out coming here that barlow was at the master house at the same time as her mother the same time in fact as her mother got pregnant with the worst will in the world i really dont think were looking at an incestuous relationship some strange and complex alliances are formed watkins i merely floated the possibility yeah well i feel fairly confident about sinking it if felix was fuchsias father why would he tender for the building contract at the master house in the first place and bring her with him wouldnt a few people have recognized him hmm mrs morningwood sniffed stourports people didnt exactly mix in the community but i take your point it would have to be unusually perverse especially whilst employed by the duchy of cornwall who were the other girls lord stourtport mentioned i ive no idea i suppose you didnt have to be able to change a washer to get a bed at the master house you could also be a woman and probably didnt have to be all that goodlooking either towards the end when everyone was perpetually stoned no idea where mary got to between walking out on your mother for the last time and turning up in tepee city she mustve been introduced to the community i have no idea tell me why do you think fuchsia did it killed barlow dont know its why im here partly roscoe hauled himself up stretched and wandered over to merrily tail waving she stood up he wants me to go would it be his dinner time youre very perceptive mrs morningwood said i wanted to be a vet when i was a kid and then discovered about all the pets they had to put down she patted roscoe didnt need to bend its surprising how well behaved he is isnt it when hes not in a churchyard good icebreakers dogs mrs morningwood smiled disarmingly girlish in the glow from the range had to get your attention somehow i thought and still do that you would be my best bet for finding out not only what happened to mary but other things i cant quite put my finger on the girl showing up like that after all these years and then you made sure you kept our attention by telling jane just what she wanted to hear about the mysteries of garway it was all true what including the gruesome tale of mrs newton laid out in her coffin to be pawed by the whole village that was true in essence garway was almost certainly the last village in herefordshire to maintain the watch night traditions so which bits did you exaggerate well it wasnt the whole village just a few neighbours but i really didnt like the place and like it even less since mary disappeared whatever you propose to do there it needs it what will you do i was thinking some form of requiem eucharist a mass a service for the repose of the dead thinking originally of felix and fuchsia but from what youve said we could be looking at something more extensive mrs morningwood look thank you for all youve done i do feel better if a bit tired face it without the reflexology shed most likely be on her way home by now driving slowly popping aspirins thats normal thats good you need to come back in a couple of days have it topped up and of course tell me what youve found out this requiem eucharist would that aim to deal with what one might term evil residue evil residue those accusations of heresy and idolatry against the templars no smoke without fire we get people here a handful every year poking around taking measurements in the church freemasons some of them believing themselves to be the inheritors of the templar legacy idiots in robes sometimes think about what mightve destroyed marys sleep what they were doing to her what continued to throw a shadow over her wherever she went well merrily picked up her bag the eucharist can be very powerful i need to go away and think about it they walked out of the cottage roscoe between them into a greyness of fields a blackness of woodland two windows were lit up at mrs morningwoods end of the terrace the rest of it dead like a neon sign in which most of the letters had fused what are the neighbours like absolute worst kind mrs morningwood snorted these are all holiday cottages we were isolated in garway at one time but now its getting just like everywhere else local youngsters priced out by london lawyers and stockbrokers and junior government ministers here for an average of about three weeks a year three out of four in a single terrace all socalled weekend cottages and the bastards wonder why we have a housing crisis answer is we dont were simply topheavy with selfindulgent secondbloodyhomers merrily stood looking back at the terrace an empty holiday home conveyed its own distinctive form of dereliction but then what right did she have to moralize her and jane rattling around in their sevenbedroom vicarage i cant get my bearings up here eyes adjusting now she looked away along the limited horizon hills concealed by the woods wheres the church the church this church is always closer than you think mrs morningwood said go carefully watkins hysterical frenzy for agreeing to meet me canon a woman my pleasure thats what im here for you see its difficult and let me say that although im only here for a few days and you dont really know me at all you can safely tell me anything you would have told merrily safely jane glared at tom bull oh yeah mrs clarke look its all right no this is about merrily you see jane stood up quickly her back to the wooden screen i think wed better sit down siân said firmly and jane well out of sight automatically sat down again before realizing ive agonized about this you see the woman was saying really intense when i heard that a very senior minister had taken over for a few days i knew what i had to do i said to myself youre not going to get a better opportunity than this are you in fact to be honest i thought well i thought this was a sign from god i see siân said oh sure like shed believe in signs from god jane stood tensed against the wooden screen airline bag at her feet hands clenched into fists pushing at the pockets of her parka listening to it all coming out this senseless stream of totally unfounded bollocks no sublety at all no restraint no no basic intelligence i know people were beginning to have their doubts when she reduced the number of hymns at the morning worship from three to two hymns are traditional arent they songs of praise we all know and the church i went to before there was always an evensong well yes siân said im afraid quite a few parishes have had to dispense with it mainly due to falling congregations especially in the winter many people really dont like leaving their firesides and indeed in some places simply dont feel safe any more going out after dark especially the elderly but replacing it with this socalled service of meditation it seems to be rather popular but its not christian is it canon clarke its eastern religion thats what it is sitting there in a circle with candles men and women dressed in in casual clothing socalled opening themselves up well you know there is a fairly wellestablished tradition of christian medi not in the bible well that depends on how you however siân you had to give her some credit was doing her best but you could hear the womans voice rising higher when she wasnt getting the reactions shed obviously expected the accusations getting wilder crazier jane getting madder and i think what offends many of us is the way she makes no attempt to conceal her private life which is not well she has a boyfriend see and theres no doubt no doubt at all that theyre sleeping together out of wedlock a priest what kind of example is that setting to young people jane fought for control all the time and energy shed spent bringing mum and lol together and this smallminded at least shes one of the women hes sleeping with hes a socalled musician see a rock musician of some kind and we all know the level of their morality im sorry shirley im not sure i understand precisely what youre saying here shirley well ill tell you canon my brother overheard some young women talking in the black swan they were drunk as so many of these young women are today and one of them said she well there are words i will not use in church or anywhere else but she seemed very much to be implying to her friends that shed had sexual congress with this man jane froze up thomas bull smiling at her and she wanted to kick his smug face in the despicable smalltime viciousness of this village anyone who really knew lol but they didnt want to did they they just watched from behind their curtains and muttered and fantasized she wanted to storm out there snatch this bitch out of her pew point out that people like her were the reason the church was dying on its celtic foundations losing what was left of its real spirituality haul her to the door and throw her out and the smoking its not nice is it theres no excuse any more all the help thats available its a sign of weakness ive seen her smoking in the churchyard with the gravedigger its a public place i could have them arrested jane let her face fall into her hands and you do know i suppose that shes supporting these people who want to reinstate a pagan temple im sorry siân said a pagan temple in the field where they were going to build a housing estate starter homes for our young people executive homes you ignorant nobody can tell me that those stones were not buried for a good reason oh the stones siân said i see you would expect our parish priest to oppose that on principle no reply from siân she must surely have realized by now the level of insanity she was dealing with here and if it wasnt for the daughter jane the daughter well that explains a lot youve rather left me behind here shirley shirley shirley west mum had talked about this woman a few times jane only halflistening because this had been mum as doormat feeling obliged to help someone whose attentions had become kind of smothering just another vicarhugger jane had figured and all the time behind mums back put it this way shirley west said how often do we see the daughter in church im afraid i dont know never jane had to hold on to the screen to prevent herself from walking out there and going not quite never believe me canon clarke shes had a terrible time with that girl hated the idea of her mother becoming ordained and has just gone out of her way to make her life a misery impossible to control absolutely no respect and this is not gossip canon ive had this from a respected public figure this girl and that old man who digs the graves and smokes they were very nearly arrested for vandalizing the buildingsite in colemans meadow did you know that she was in a kind of hysterical frenzy shirley i siân paused regrettable as all this might be im afraid youd probably find similar situations in the homes of over half the clergy in this diocese most teenagers go through a period of rebellion against their parents values the only consolation being that if children are left to make up their own minds without being pressurized they will often find their own way into what we still like to think of as the fold but is it im sorry is it a rebellion because merrily is involved with the other business isnt she ghosts and the demonic you mean deliverance which is to do with the occult ive been in the vicarage canon clarke ive seen the occult books on the shelves well shes had to study all that shirley shes had to go into areas of study that many people would find distasteful but does she i dont understand does she find it distasteful ive talked to people about this i have many christian friends all over the country my information is that this is a job thats always been done by men before she was probably the first woman exorcist in the country thats my information and shes also the first that i or any of my friends in the church have known to introduce this socalled meditation this opening up of a congregation to unseen presences i dont think youll find its that uncommon nowadays as for deliverance being a male preserve just a few years ago the whole ministry i think we have to look at all these things together the interest in exorcism the meditation the pagan temple and the nearsatanism practised by the daughter and see what it adds up to i think it adds up to a terrible danger the silence was so absolute that jane could hear her own breathing jesus this was not a joke she made eye contact with tom bull his bearded face openly malign jane thought of the green man and baphomet anger giving way to a kind of fear of the unknown fear for mum out there on the unknown border lol gigging somewhere miles away their little nucleus fragmented and she was alone here in this supposedly sacred place this sanctuary watching the poison dripping into the chalice shirley west said i think before merrily goes around encouraging people to open themselves up she needs to take a good look inside her own family dont you and then siân who so far had been displaying a reasonable attitude to this insanity siân blew it youd better tell me everything she said turn over stones over dinner rain rolling down the dairys main window silent as tears of old grief merrily asked the murrays how much they knew about the grays and the gwilyms our friends either side of the great divide teddy said lifting his wineglass as if in a toast his silhouette a magiclantern show on the white wall behind him in the lamplight not that youd know it beverley said they sound exactly the same not as if the gwilyms have welsh accents let alone speak welsh well certainly not oh i never know how to pronounce that mans name sycharth bevvie were inclined to say sickarth but its suckarth yes its an odd thing if someone lives just a few yards over the border in what might seem to be a very english part of wales they become determinedly welsh welsh perfectly affable chap though not that we see much of him beverley said since his business has become more herefordbased rich enough now to have a farm manager and his family owned the master house merrily said since medieval times i believe teddy nodding i can certainly tell you something about that his version tied in with mrs morningwoods as a result of the sudden death of the head of the family the house had been sold around the turn of last century the wife embittered at the way shed been treated over the years had got rid of it almost before anybody noticed causing an awful fuss but there was nothing the gwilyms could do teddy said but the master house is in england well yes merrily but a part of england that seems to have been more welsh in its time than many parts of wales in religious terms particularly both early welsh christianity and welsh nonconformism in the nineteenth century have their roots hereabouts and of course if owain glyndwrs rebellion had been successful in the fifteenth century the border would have been redrawn putting this whole area in glyndwrs new independent wales you do know about glyndwrs connection with this area hes supposed to have retired here after his campaign collapsed it had always seemed odd to merrily that glyndwr should spend his last years in the border area where hed caused maximum damage burning down most of the major castles youd have thought hed feel safer in some welsh heartland hidden away more like with a price on his head teddy said a celebrity outlaw his daughter alice had married a scudamore from kentchurch court and they might have helped to conceal him he was never caught he just disappeared there is a legend that he once hid out at the master house but then lots of places claim that connection beverley said its the sort of legend i imagine some of the gwilyms liked to pretend was actual history and theyve been trying to reacquire it merrily said i mean the master house periodically yes im not sure how bothered sycharth is now i heard he was totally hellbent on getting it back well you could be right teddy shrugged i dont know how are your plans going as regards ah still thinking it would be good to get the gwilyms and the grays under that roof especially as it no longer belongs to either of them no better time to heal old wounds would you like me to have a word with the grays at least they come to church paul in a wheelchair now poor chap my feeling is that they were more than glad to get rid of that house whether you believe in some sort of spiritual malaise or not they havent had much luck the question is will they come if the gwilyms are going to be there i dont know ill talk to them ill do what i can thank you teddy if i tell them someone from the duchy of cornwall will be there ill try and talk to the land agent tomorrow not the ah duke himself presumably at a rite of cleansing quite teddy smiled although that would certainly bring both families out of their cupboards wouldnt it it would also bring the special branch out of theirs merrily said and on the whole i dont think my nerves would stand it earlier sitting on a corner of the bed at the ridge with the bedside lamp on shed called lol on spec a bit surprised to catch him in ive been back all day lol had said patiently last nights gig was brecon thirty miles of course sorry old hippies and young soldiers mainly what brecon its a garrison town plus a few girls who couldnt have been born when hazey jane started groupies in brecon the power of bad dreams merrily closed her eyes sometimes you could punch yourself in the mouth lol said been watching canon callaghanclarke familiarizing herself with the village landmarks church market hall black swan gomer parry im sorry couldnt even let you know we were getting her events overtook lol had met siân only once last spring during a tense and troubling evening in ludlow castle when siân had finally been exposed to the blurred reality of deliverance not a comfortable night for any of them not a problem lol said i kind of thought youd wind up going under the circumstances not a problem why wasnt it a problem lol im sorry its im still a bit tired got up feeling lousy and wound up having footreflexology from this mrs morningwood it was strange but it worked something worked i think its just knocked me out a bit after some moments of rare clarity im tired and confused again but yeah i feel better dont knock it merrily never straightforward this job you turn over stones things crawl out you ever come across lord stourport lord stourport well weve obviously exchanged nods at various receptions lol said buckingham palace garden parties that kind of youve never heard of him then no merrily took a long breath and told him in some detail about lord stourports time at the master house his supposed connections with the music industry about mary linden nearly thirty years go it was good to talk about it to bring it out of the dreamlike fug of the day we think she was abused abused how dont know dont know anything for certain or even if there was an element of fantasy drugfuelled i mean it was a very long time ago but i really really dont like the feel of it how about i ask prof about this guy lol said prof of course that would be what the hell is that her head wouldnt process the clamour but its vibration brought her to her feet you ok merrily its she started to laugh its a dinner gong and no time to hang out of the window to smoke half a cigarette a period boarding house lol had said i so envy you there was a strained kind of formality about the murrays as if she was a child they were in the process of adopting if you dont mind me saying so merrily beverley was putting out nut roast why did nonveggies always think it had to be nut roast you seem rather sleepy i was quite worried about you this morning now you dont look unwell but you do look exhausted and teddy please dont say anything about the powerful air of gods own country actually merrily said anything to get this sensible woman off her back i had some treatment today telling them about mrs morningwood no reason not to presumably it was a legitimate business the reflexology beverley frowned teddy looked intrigued it was effective because ive often thought of consulting her myself a lot to be said for preventative therapy beverleys not so sure though are you bevvie beverley didnt reply until shed finished serving the nut roast the onion gravy and the veg its nothing to do with alternative therapy which im sure has its place i just never know quite what to think of mrs morningwood in what context merrily realized how hungry she was the body craving food even nut roast beverley sat down pushing a strand of blonde hair away from an eye oh you hear things put it this way if teddy was to go id certainly make sure i went too merrilys fork froze just short of her lips something of a maneater beverley said thats what they say anyway mrs morningwood always strikes me as a little threadbare for that sort of thing eccentric deranged the way she drives around in that big jeep taking corners too fast sorry i didnt mean deranged i think i meant disarranged cant say anyones said anything to me teddy said apart from you of course bevvie well they wouldnt now would they blimey merrily said she ate slowly aware it seemed of every spice in the roast aware of herself eating that element of separation which sometimes came with extreme physical tiredness when the senses for some reason were still alert gossip there was unfortunately a place for it it was often the most direct route to if not the truth then something in its vicinity she looked at beverley who are we talking about then mrs morningwood and who oh dear beverley pouring herself some water from a crystal jug i wish id never ah now youve started a slightly sinful sparkle in teddys blue eyes cant not tell us now bevvie he knew of course merrily watched their eyes they must surely have had this discussion before now they were having it again for her benefit passing on something they thought she ought to be aware of especially if submitting to further reflexology farmers i was told beverley said farmers plural merrily blinked i mean how plural well at least two certainly i suppose she has that sort of rough edge that i imagine a certain kind of man would find attractive admittedly always farmers living alone and it never seems to lead to anything no evidence that shes after anyones money if you see what i an independent sort of woman teddy said was she ever married im never quite sure in london beverley said she was in london for over twenty years long enough to lose her local accent certainly but she came back unmarried readopting her maiden name and whatever she gets up to is a question of roots i suppose they go back many generations in garway the morningwoods whatever they do is accepted whatever they do well her mother oh i hate this beverley drank some water teddy leaned back its all right i know the family has quite a history of what are now known as alternative remedies folk remedies what were known as wise women theres an old tradition of nine witches of garway and her mother and grandmother were more in that mould allegedly they were merrily looked up considered to be witches they dispensed herbal remedies they were also said to no way to dress this up im afraid merrily assist girls who got themselves into trouble oh used to be a local social service didnt it no great need for it now merrily remembered gomer parrys uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of mrs morningwood beverley looked down at her plate lord stourport lol was surprised to find out that he did know him well knew of him mainly theyd met briefly maybe a couple of times i never realized he said on the phone to prof levin jimmy hater hed called around nine pm when prof habitually took a coffee break from whatever album he was mixing often he would work through midnight the cafetière at his elbow an addictive personality but caffeine was safer than the booze of old lol said i remember he always sounded kind of upperclass in comparison with most of the others real name james hayterhames prof said if you were rock n roll management in the punk era that was not a good time to let it get out that your family was even posher than joe strummers hayter on its own however that was a strong and impressive name to have especially if you left out the y i didnt even know about the y for a long time lol recalled a stocky strutting guy napoleonic i used to think it was a completely madeup name like sid vicious you ever produce anything for any of hayters bands produced no engineered for my sins postpunk deathmetal not my favourite period laurence bearable at the time with three or four bottles of red wine god forbid on the mixing desk that era i like to draw a curtain across it death metal mostly foul jimmy hayter a twat still prof said once a twat where does he live i mean is he accessible yes and no he inherited the pile eventually of course its a responsibility nobody wants to besmirch the coat of arms on the other hand the family seat gobbles wealth and farming even bigtime farming doesnt pay half the bills any more so the earl whatever he is now he keeps his hand in and when the roof falls in on the orangery or something he puts on a festival on the very fringe of his estate naturally the house a mere dot on the horizon where is the house i dunno someplace south of brum stratford way possibly i could find out death metal lol said a lot of occult there generally pseudo guys on harleys with skull rings and slashhere neck tattoos so occult this would be a merrily inquiry would it would he talk to her do you think say on the phone on the phone laurence he wont say anything worth the price of a cheaprate call and frankly the last thing you want is to expose a woman as appealing as little merrily with or without the dog collar to jimmy hayter especially with his lovely wife her ladyship living a lavishly subsidized life in france her physical role in his life complete and from what i hear bloody grateful for that would he speak to me do you think why should he do that maybe in the interests of i dont know keeping the past where it belongs lol had the map book open on the desk in the window marking out the route to a village he didnt know outside gloucester tomorrow nights concert a big pub with a folk club the kind of intimate gig which on the whole he preferred he pushed the page under the lamp how far from stratford forty miles fifty the situation is prof that in his youth jimmy hayter seems to have been part of a commune in a farmhouse down on the welsh border some of what they might have got up to it would help merrily to know about that might have got up to prof said whats that mean do i like the sound of that i dont what does merrily say she says it gives her a bad feeling never dismiss a womans feelings good or bad prof said and lol could hear the clink of the beloved and necessary cafetière the slurping of the brown elixir then a silence then jesus lol you need to understand you must not threaten this man dont take the glasses off then laurence listen to me jimmy hayter stately home dinner parties with the gentry but the guys with the skull rings and the slashhere tattoos they still dig his garden you know what im saying shaman teddy was right it had once been an accepted rural service like blacksmithing and there had been an opportunity for muriel morningwood to talk about it and she hadnt my mother would awake in the morning to hear her throwing up coming to the obvious conclusion which she put to mary merrily lay on the bed gazing up at the wardrobe just a wardrobe mesh over its ventilation slits nothing like garway church there was a different light now on mrs morningwood seniors motherly concern for mary linden finding out about marys pregnancy would she have offered to terminate it or what what had actually passed between them to cause mary to leave the morningwood house before morning need to know did she need to know was this important you kept turning over stones and uncovering other stones at which point did you back off there were times when deliverance could seem like the most rewarding role in a declining church but it was also the most illdefined it was not yet nine pm needing to think about all this merrily had accepted beverleys assessment of her level of fatigue taken herself upstairs had a shower put on a clean tshirt lay down her body instantly falling into relaxation but her damn head just filling up with questions anomalies tomorrow shed need to talk to sycharth gwilym might find him at his farm or it might mean driving into hereford before or after facing up to mrs morningwood this time no flam no bullshit she sat up there was an electric kettle on the dressing table she prised herself from the bed filled the kettle in the shower room and of course she needed to call jane perhaps talk to siân make sure everything was ok sitting on the side of the bed she switched on the phone and it throbbed in her hand message merrily its sophie could you ring me at home sounding strangely close to excited sophie said she might have solved the mystery of the cuttings cuttings canon dobbs merrily oh sorry hell the cuttings on hands and knees on the carpet merrily pulled one of the overnight bags from under the bed dug out the plastic folder i was just going through them again in which case youve probably noticed several mentions of the late sir laurens van der post yes scrabbling through the papers thats erm uncovering an article enclosing a picture of this benignlooking old guy with a grey combover sideon to the camera princes guru sage or charlatan you havent read them have you merrily i merrily sighed i havent read them all things have been complicated just inconveniences really but timeconsuming do you know anything about van der post this and that van der post laurens white south african who bonded with the bushmen of the kalahari studying socalled primitive belief systems and showing what western societies might learn from them while drawing public attention to the horrors of apartheid a war hero but known primarily in later years as a close friend of the prince of wales a seminal influence the church wasnt happy merrily recalled when charles decided he should be williams godfather on account of van der posts own belief system being not strictly c of e correct he believed that all religions were essentially one sophie said which possibly accounts for charless declared intention of becoming defender of faiths when he becomes king which almost certainly does account for it the extent of van der posts influence can never be overstated he was extremely mystical in a way that i suspect your daughter would understand pagan that would be too simplistic he died in at the age of ninety having been far closer to the prince in his crucial formative years than i would guess anyone in the church of england youll find details in the cuttings about the time they went together into the wilderness of kenya and van der post imparted his knowledge of i suppose the word shamanism would not be inappropriate its coming back to me closeness to the land anyway and the alleged spirits of nature evidently a very powerful experience for a young man they were camping out in a very remote area without guards or detectives and there if you want to look for it lies the basis of this much publicized and possibly much misrepresented communication with plants it might have sown the seeds of the princes passion for conservation and green issues generally interesting what was also interesting was the way sophie who worked for the cathedral talked about it with no hint of condemnation as if even the fringepagan became less obnoxious for her if it happened to be championed by royalty if it ever came to a standoff between the church and the crown whose side would sophie be on but wheres it leading sophie it leads sophie said directly to canon dobbs when he first came over here in i think the late s van der post became a farmer in gloucestershire for some years canon dobbs grew up near cirencester my information is that he might even have worked on the van der post farm as a boy during holidays who told you that ive been speaking to a retired clergyman nobody you would know so dont ask who knew dobbs years ago he said dobbs would often talk about a south african farmer hed known before the war who had helped to awaken his spiritual faculties if they stayed in contact sophie that doesnt totally add up dobbss attitude to spirituality while not exactly fundamentalist was certainly tightly focused merrily you only encountered him at the very end were talking about the s when he was a boy and laurens van der post a young man they may not subsequently have followed the same spiritual paths but in their questing years anyway they were exchanging letters almost until van der posts death you know this for a fact i confirmed it about an hour ago with mrs edna rees you remember her yes i do dobbss housekeeper in gwynne street who had once told merrily he hardly spoke to her a cloistered existence in his later years she sometimes in his absence managed to clean his office sophie said and she remembers the letters merrily recalled mrs rees stolid west herefordshire countrywoman shrewd ok crafty she read these letters as canon dobbs was apparently shutting her out unnecessarily she felt i would guess she saw it as justified how far she understood them is another matter the parts that stuck in her mind inevitably were the references to the late princess diana by dobbs its been widely reported since that sir laurens was not entirely in favour of that marriage once describing the poor child as i recall a pinhead sharing his opinions with dobbs elderly men conspiring against diana so it seemed to mrs rees a big diana fan id guess until then she hadnt really known who laurens van der post was when was this early nineties i would guess mrs rees made it her business to find out about him afterwards of course and although she insists she never discussed the correspondence with anyone from that day to this i think she was rather glad to have finally unloaded it all on someone someone who worked for the cathedral and who humiliatingly excluded for the first time from the bishops confidence would be bitterly identifying with mrs reess dilemma well merrily said its certainly fascinating from an historical perspective but theres more mrs rees believes something was entrusted by sir laurens to canon dobbs information perhaps even a package of some kind canon dobbs never actually accused her of reading his mail but a locksmith arrived one day to change the locks on his study door and this time mrs rees never found the keys any idea what it was there was one significant reference in the last letter she saw from sir laurens he believed he was under surveillance well that would figure anybody that close to the heir to the throne the security services would be bound to check him out yes i suppose i dont know what to say about this sophie its intriguing but unlikely to have any bearing on what im supposed to be dealing with its all getting too crowded for me i just want to strip it down to the basics get the right people in one room hold a suitable service im just a smalltime cleric in the sticks lets not get too ambitious oh sophie said what the bishops here with you now standing in my porch i can see him through the window he usually show up this time of night no im going to have to go and let him in of course you are jane said everything was absolutely fine which if you knew jane at all meant that everything was very much not fine can you talk i mean is siân there shes not far away whats wrong nothing i cant handle jane i dont want you handling anything mum have you seen the baphomet again i mean have you been back to that house dont change the subject do i need to come back to deal with anything of course not dont even think about it if you need any advice merrily said you go to lol ok sure when hes here listen if youre going to like cleanse that place its going to be a problem isnt it what is the baphomet youll be taking it on some kind of power symbol that maybe goes back to celtic times the baphomet is also a representation of the great god pan nature at its most merciless and ferocious id be a bit careful you watch too many weird dvds jane yeah well even practising satanists have to relax sometimes jane said goodnight mum sleep well unleashed the sleep as mrs morningwood had predicted had been deep and there were no clinging dreams the muted chimes of the phone awoke merrily she rolled out of bed the mobile clutched like some throbbing fledgling in her hand dislodging the bedside table the lamp wobbling her watch falling and then the bishop saying very clearly merrily im going to ask you to wind this up she sank down to the floor give me a moment bernie on hands and knees patting the carpet for her watch the window was flushed with pink and orange what the hell time was it im sorry if youre not yet up and about bernie dunmore said but i wanted to catch you before you went anywhere after all you didnt even tell me you were doing this doing what didnt tell me that you were going to stay at garway hill his voice distant abnormally formal in fact my information i couldnt you werent there my understanding of the situation was that youd found some obvious discrepancies in this pitiful womans story which had rendered further inquiries unnecessary you told me yourself last saturday that you could prove fabrication thats not im afraid thats not true not any more and as for not knowing i was coming here on her feet now couldnt believe this you wanted me to come and stay at garway remember full attention need to get you a locum i may have overreacted the bishop said that was what i thought at the time but its a bit you know its a bit late now late two people died she walked barefooted to the window the valley rising into view then plunging into a mist that was opaque like set honey she was wide awake now and she didnt understand merrily lets be sensible about this im trying i do know about the deaths i also know of no one apart it seems from yourself who is connecting them in any way with these alleged disturbances at garway bernie furthermore i do not believe that it would be in the best interests either of the diocese or the deliverance ministry if it were to become known that we were making something out of this do i really need to remind you why having deliverance linked with the taking of life whether its suicide or murder or in this case god forbid both is no you dont good and the subtext here is what bernie just come home the bishop said as though she was abroad administer a blessing if you think its necessary and then come back there are other issues we need to discuss organizational issues re organization of parishes merrily i dont want to get into this over the phone its very early days and you know how i feel about it i generally think youve been doing a terrific job under less than ideal conditions and i dont want to see your position prejudiced is this something to do with siân callaghanclarke does sophie know about it its nothing to do with siân essentially and i talked to sophie last night essentially and asked her not to telephone you until id spoken to you myself ive also in the meantime spoken to the duchy who are a little worried about what might have been unleashed unleashed you merrily we unleashed you or rather i did i she rubbed her eyes maybe she wasnt actually awake im sorry would you mind spelling this out for me bishop preferably in big coloured nursery letters traditionally bernie dunmore hesitated his uncertainty was almost audible traditionally the role of the deliverance ministry has been in the way of of administering balm to what might be seen as an open wound a psychic wound if we must youve displayed a tendency to go beyond the brief which in normal circumstances is not necessarily a bad thing however youre saying you dont consider these to be normal circumstances this case might be tiptoeing around the edges of nationalsecurity issues which are obviously more important than the little lives of ordinary people merrily please dont make this more difficult than it has a detective called jonathan long been to talk to you by any chance no ive never heard of a detective called jonathan long all right merrily sat down on the bed i accept that you might not be able to tell me if he had been round but if you could listen for just half a minute yes initially the evidence did suggest an element of scam but now now i feel strongly and sometimes you have to run with feelings that theres something that needs looking into then let someone else look into it you really think someone else is going to thats not your problem i cant believe you said that look give me one more day and ill submit a written report which ill email to sophie so its on your desk by ten oclock tomorrow it will explain exactly why with the underlying issues here i feel this is not something we can in all conscience ignore merrily you clearly havent been listening and as youve accepted that there should be at least a blessing at the master house theres at least one person i need to talk to before i can organize it and that would be his names sycharth gwilym mrs watkins the bishop said the only thing i want to see on sophies desk tomorrow morning is the reverend murrays bill tell him well pay him for the full five days this is totally i most certainly dont want you to talk to anyone else please humour me pack your case bishop be honest i think weve always been honest with one another have you been how can i put this got at dont be ridiculous merrily saw her watch glinting underneath the bedside table bent and retrieved it peered at the face and was initially relieved it wasnt yet ten minutes past seven she knew the bishop always rose early these days but this was im sorry merrily said that was a bit offensive dead silence hed hung up christ jane had been down since seven in the cold kitchen fully dressed for school shed fed ethel put the kettle on was spooning tea into the pot when siân callaghanclarke appeared in the doorway wearing a silk dressing gown sea green very expensive almost swish good morning jane took a breath actually she said im not sure it is shed avoided siân last night claiming that she had essays to do and escaping to the apartment where she seemed to have lain awake half the night replaying the drab whiny voice of shirley west listening to edited highlights of her own history twisted by an expert siân walked into the kitchen pulled out a cane chair near the head of the refectory table and sat down gathering her robe across her knees this was where mum would have lit a cigarette siân didnt move jane pulled down two mugs sorry ive forgotten is it one sugar its no sugar jane right might have guessed ive only just put the kettle on so itll be a minute or two thank you ok jane said there was no clever way of dealing with this heres the situation i was in the church last night while you were talking to that woman i was in the bull chapel behind the screen i know siân said jane stared at her siâns sleek metallic hair was brushed back from her face which had surprisingly few lines even first thing in the morning and no expression a barrister face i was mildly concerned a barrister tone of voice when you didnt get off the school bus at what id been advised was the appointed time and i didnt like to leave the house until you were home i know you arent strictly speaking my responsibility but i did think it wise to wait until the last possible moment when i eventually saw you on the square i decided it was safe to leave and when you walked directly past me and mrs im sorry i prosser yes of course when you walked directly past us particularly mrs prosser without saying a word and with your face concealed i rather anticipated your intentions shit look jane said i just you were curious i was suspicious why because i jane tossed the spoon onto the worktop oh for come and sit down jane im not going to apologize what have you to apologize about you were simply i would guess trying to protect your mother jane said nothing siân steepled her fingers jane there are certain issues on which merrily and i are unlikely ever to agree but for what its worth i suspect the level of my regard for her somewhat exceeds the level of hers for me siâns smile was kind of wan and regretful jane didnt know how to respond and didnt i realize that i would hardly have been her first choice for looking after the parish siân said she was probably dismayed erm yeah jane sat down near the bottom of the table couldnt get anything right at the moment could she walked right into this one thinking she was going to nail callaghanclarke first thing in the morning while her senses were fuddled as if the tables had been turned jane stitched up like a unreliable witness in the box stitched herself up in fact mum might almost have predicted it last night jane i dont want you handling anything siân callaghanclarke practised in silence just sat there waiting for you to dig yourself further in ok jane proceeded with extreme caution if you knew i was there in the church why did you get her to go through it all all the stuff about me being a notsocloset pagan worshipping the goddess in the vicarage garden do you no i mean i did once maybe a couple of times in a halfhearted kind of way but not any more and like all the stuff about me having an altar in the attic and like chanting and trying to raise dark forces that is total crap i wouldnt do that i mean ok i thought about it an altar but only as a kind of a focus point i didnt i mean i was just a kid a teenwitch never that much of a kid siân my apologies and for heavens sake its not satanic is it shes making the fundamental mistake that all these ignorant fundamentalists i mean satanisms just a perverse reversal of christianity it doesnt even qualify as any kind of paganism yes jane i have read my deliverance handbook and since you ask the reason i invited shirley to pour out everything was that i thought it might help if we both knew the extent of it theres one in every parish jane often more than one a faction even sorry probably harmless most of the time but she needs watching she might well be used for instance by opponents of the plan to reerect your standing stones in colemans meadow right although i wouldnt imagine it would improve their case to any great extent no well siân sat back and there was i feeling rather pleased with my success at drawing shirley out in a way that perhaps wouldnt have been open to merrily im sorry you felt the need to put a rather different interpretation on it jane sagged in her chair but im glad you brought it up this morning siân said it says something about you like that im a totally immature idiot who shouldnt be allowed out i think the tea should be almost brewed by now siân said would you like to pour for us jane and have you eaten yet or were you waiting for me jane stood up and went over to the worktop taking the opportunity which the bloody woman had obviously deliberately just given her to hide her reddening face i just want to say in case you were wondering talking into the mugs all that stuff about lol and other women its nonsense of course you jane looked up you do believe that i met mr robinson once siân said he wasnt what i might have expected no no he isnt look jane started talking in this great hot rush before she could stop herself why are you really here why did you offer to come why do you think im here lawyers always elegantly turning your questions around all right then mum thinks that theres a possibility theyre putting together some kind of carveup and that shes going to end up with about eight parishes and lose the deliverance thing or it gets divided up and like run by a committee i see i dont suppose i shouldve said that but you know why not its true oh there is such a proposal and i have been asked to make an unofficial report oh im sorry right siân shrugged in the end the bedroom had been too small to contain merrilys emotions she came out of the shower room and dressed in a hurry jeans sweatshirt trainers within ten minutes she was at the foot of the stairs sliding back the bolt on the front door of the ridge letting herself out into a breeze swollen with rain it wasnt cold and physically she was feeling much better still slightly well not weak exactly but a bit tender a bit raw oh come on very bloody raw the blowing rain was stinging merrilys face like the bishops veiled threats threats from good old easygoing bernie dunmore could she possibly have misheard i dont want to see your position prejudiced no it wasnt even subtle it wasnt veiled at all and shed thought she knew him thought he was a friend but a friend would have said come over and well talk about this there are some things i cant say on the phone he hadnt said that he hadnt wanted to talk about it at all there were other issues they needed to discuss of an administrative nature and if it was hard to fire an incompetent vicar it was a lot less complicated to remove a deliverance consultancy from someone who tended to go beyond the brief the mist was lifting over the woods in the valley the landscape forming in a watercolour wash as merrily walked down the steps to the parking area and the intersecting footpaths one up to the hill one down to the church behind her the steep tawny house was silent nobody about yet no real need to be she was the only guest and she hadnt exactly been demanding an early breakfast maybe by nine shed feel up to talking to people and then what she could go on her own to the master house suitably attired and equipped with holy water a straightforward roombyroom blessing an end to it or merely a reprieve because bernie dunmore would know thered be no easy retrieval of their old relationship on which basis she might just as well ignore the bastards instructions and go in search of sycharth gwilym angry now but she cooled it she unlocked the volvo reached behind the driving seat for her waterproof and then on impulse tossed it back and climbed in switched on the engine and let the car slide away down the hill merrily drove slowly although there was no other traffic around not even a tractor or a quad bike she was looking for a layby a field entrance a patch of grass verge wide enough to park on she needed to sit alone somewhere and listen this sieve of our own needs desires fears what were afraid they might really be saying were processing the words analysing our minds are taking an active role were not listening in a service with no sermon it had probably been the best sermon shed delivered all year she needed to listen she took a left turn high hedges either side trees still laden with a summerload of leaves the point of the tower of garway church with its bent cross appeared over the trees why not weighted as it was with the density of the templars it was still a church and merrily wondered if it was open yet never did find out though because that was when the dog ran in front of the car only darkness shed pulled hard into the verge a thorny hedge screeching against the volvos side panels its scratchy mesh compressed against the window finishing up in a cage of brambles with a back wheel in a shallow ditch and the engine stalled oh god no shed been travelling at well under thirty mph but the road was wet and the brakes were spongy shed slammed on and gone into a skid on the overflowing verge of grass and mud letting go of the steering wheel as she was flung back into the seat the frayed belt slipping and cutting into the side of her neck what was she doing in the bloody car anyway driving off in a selfrighteous fury resentment inflated selfesteem they cant treat me like this releasing the belt she inched painfully across the slanting seat over the gear lever and the handbrake to reach the passengerdoor handle pushing the door open climbing out and staggering around to the front of the volvo merrily went down on her knees halfsick with dread looking underneath couldnt see the grass was still kneehigh on the verge around the bumper she had to lie down on the wet tarmac edging between the front wheels and face it there was unlikely to be more than one irish wolfhound in this part of garway roscoe with one wheel in the ditch the other on the edge the big car was tilted in the undergrowth its belly hard into the muddy bank impossible to squeeze underneath she just about managed to push her left arm under feeling around in the soaking foliage roscoe nothing moving under there only multiple stabbing pains in her left hand and up the inside of her wrist told her shed grabbed a handful of nettles this was no use basically shed have to get back in and try to shift the car with extreme care warm breath on the back of merrilys neck made her body retract twisting over onto her side like they always did when you were on the ground he thought she wanted to play he was standing over her with his nose above her ear poised and quivering oh jesus roscoe collapsing into the road in a moment of wild relief head in her arms before pulling herself up the dog waited panting his coat was messed up matted spiked and sodden a thorny twig trapped in his collar hed been through hedges and perhaps a stream merrily pulled herself up clothes wet through cold and clinging there was no sign of mrs morningwood and it seemed unlikely that she habitually turned her dog out in the mornings to take exercise in fields full of sheep detaching the thorn twig merrily slipped a hand under roscoes collar he squeaked whatve you done she ran her hands down his flanks at some point he squirmed away as if in pain but eventually let her lead him to the car tried twice to jump in she had to help him into the back seat before dragging herself back through the passenger door the easy bit she started the engine one wheel spinning another spurting mud and the old chassis creaking and moaning as she fought to wrench the volvo out of the ditch lol had set the alarm best to leave early he had no knowledge of warwickshire only its awful motorways prof levin had called back just short of midnight as the ashypink embers of last nights hastily built fire had been quietly crumbling into the hearth get a pad laurence ill give you the directions you actually called him i phoned his office left a message and he was back within half an hour must be some callreferral system im impressed lol said hed always known prof had some serious clout in this business but even so hayter and me first time wed spoken in some years i knew hed get back if he was in the country if only because he was always on at me to tell him what happened at the abbey on the anniversary of lennons murder you told him that lol knew two other people whod been involved in this notorious mythsoaked session neither of them nor even prof had ever disclosed what had taken place and it wasnt something that had ever bothered lol the dark narcotic side of the music business like parts of the old testament was best left alone if your faith was shaky so this telling hayter was above and beyond and it spoke less of profs friendship with lol than his admiration for merrily and what she did the explicit nature of which prof would often say was not something on which as a recovering alcoholic he ever wanted to dwell i told him some of it laurence he wont put it around if only because everybody knows he wasnt there but hell see me and you will see him thats the downside eleventhirty in the morning you get half an hour you dont get lunch you owe me one needless to say i think i do you also owe it to me to listen i may have said this earlier hayter if hes doing business prefers to deal with people in the flesh rather than talk on the phone or exchange emails this is because he needs to have them exposed to the full awesome glory of his repellent personality but do not make the mistake of thinking this is all special effects you know what im saying lol shook his head you still there laurence im nodding lol said its because my mouths gone dry with fear its not a joke and be sure you call me afterwards if you still have fingers to push the numbers now memorizing his route from the map book lol looked at the clock on the desk he needed to call merrily to find out exactly what she wanted to know from hayter but it was probably too early hed leave it an hour and meanwhile get on the road his stuff was still in the hall where hed left it yesterday the guild acoustic amp the takamine jumbo the exquisite luteshaped boswell the harmonicas and the little drum machine loading and unloading the truck without injury to the kit was getting to be a serious chore he just couldnt imagine years of this he put merrilys number in the frame on his mobile merrily had never really looked at the morningwood house in the light of day too feverridden yesterday morning to take it in with its shambling pergola its rampant chicken wire and its chaos of sheds it was an almost comical contrast to the manicured holiday homes at the other end of the terraced row the only one of them though with any signs of life the smoke like a curl of wispy hair above the chimney stack the clutter of freerange chickens but if morningwoods had been on this hill as long as the badger shit on the white rocks it hadnt always been here at ty gwyn this row couldnt be more than a century and a half old its angles too sharp doors and windows too regular too uniform for real age the rain had stopped but dirty pink clouds were still bunched like muscles over the hills not a promising day the car window was halfway down roscoes snout halfway out his head up against merrilys hair she could hear the chickens from the sloping land behind as she drew up in front of the two end houses blocking the lane but it was a dead end apart from mrs morningwood it seemed unlikely that anyone else would be here until next spring roscoe im going to leave you in the car in case shes out looking for you or something ok maybe this visit was meant she thought about the prince of wales his attention to coincidences and signposts it was just gone seventhirty at the front door she looked around for a bell or a knocker sense of déjà vu at this stage yesterday shed been ill and the door had been opened for her lifting a fist to beat on the panels she thought she could hear movement from the back of the house or one of the others the holiday homes she glanced along the terraced frontage of emptied hanging baskets smokeless chimneys at mrs morningwoods end of the block there was a long fence reinforced with chicken wire lining an unmade drive leading to a carport with a roof of galvanized sheets under the carport was the back end of an old black jeep cherokee merrily glimpsed a figure moving along the side of the garage towards a barn or a stable mrs morningwood she stopped up against the house wall the figure kept on moving looking back just once on the edge of the barn it didnt look like mrs morningwood it didnt look like a woman it didnt seem to have a face only a darkness come on this didnt mean a thing it didnt mean a thing that the back door was ajar like another door had been last summer or that curtains were drawn across two downstairs windows like on the days of funerals when shed been a kid but still merrily drew a long breath and still it came back out as jesus jesus jesus half oath half prayer and because she really didnt want to she went in entering the kitchen to the smell of something overboiled and a rumbling refrigerator or a rayburn overlaying a sound from deeper into the house like a roll of carpet being dragged across the floor call out she opened her mouth to do it but no sound came a door was halfopen to the living room the treatment room where shed spent most of yesterday merrily stayed just short of the doorway a dimness in there and a drifting smell salty and sour a smell that had not been apparent yesterday a smell she halfrecognised and ok phone she pulled out her mobile switched it on and then plunged it back into her hip pocket cupping both hands over the bump one day shed figure out how to mute the electric piano chord that told you and everybody else that the phone was awakening waiting mobiles these days all this techno they took for ever to boot up in the living room there was a gap at the top of the drawn curtain which lit a triangle of bluewhite across the room like a flickering sail on dark water and then it vanished she took out the phone again pressed the nine key three times didnt send it not yet the darkness pulsed and jittered someone was fumbling about in there merrily was feeling around for a light switch when something fell over with a bong and then a sharp tight shattering of glass jerked her back into the doorway halfway down the wall her hand found the metal nipple of the switch and she flipped it down come any closer a voice high and cracked and i shall take out your the light flickered on a frosted bowl flat to the ceiling exposing a woman crouching in a corner merrily said oh dear god take your throat out mrs morningwood was a cramped detail from an engraving of hell her hair crimsonrinsed thick ribbons of dark red unrolling from her scalp collecting in her eye sockets blotching on her bared teeth both her hands were bleeding freely around a shivering tube of jagged glass mrs get back the glass shuddered in her hand and merrily saw that it was the smashed chimney from the greenshaded oil lamp its tip serrated but the whole thing cracked cutting into the hands that gripped it she saw the brass body of the lamp on the carpet at the end of its flex the darkwood piano stool on its side bloodflecked the log basket overturned leaving the rug cobbled with logs the bentwood rocking chair still in motion as if someone had just stood up mrs morningwood was wearing a pale blue nightdress she was squinting through the blood trying to divert a river away from an eye and making a red delta across a cheek and over her chin spatters sporadically blossoming like wild roses on the blue nightdress it seemed likely that she couldnt see who was with her in the room because her eyes were full of blood its me merrily said merrily watkins mrs morningwood held on to the lampglass hes gone merrily said she crossed the room watching the jagged lampfunnel now in mrs morningwoods right hand i saw him running into the trees i think he had a hood black bag over his head with eye holes just let me no dont touch me merrily said im getting an ambulance all right she opened up the phone just no mrs morningwood edging crablike around the wall go away forget you ever came here who was he there was nobody mrs morningwood i saw him i saw him running towards the barn forget it what are you doing here anyway reaching the chaise longue mrs morningwood tried to heave herself up sudden frightened pain came out in a compressed mousesqueak from the back of her throat dragging a handful of tissues from a kleenex box on the desk merrily moved across kneeling down beside her mrs morningwood turned sharply away with a snort tossing her head like a horse blood bubbling in her nose and on her exposed and blueing throat you could also see red indents which jesus christ youve been mrs morningwood felt at her throat and winced did most of this myself and she probably had with her nails trying to prise his fingers away put that fucking thing bloodied hands clawing out the phone dropped to the carpet leave it we need the police mrs morningwood shush was that its all right hes gone but suppose he hadnt they waited listening merrily was aware of the clock ticking in another room out in the car roscoe barked once mrs morningwoods head jerked up the dog in the car dogs all right i thought hes fine i picked him up in the lane thank you mrs morningwoods bloodied head fell back into the pillows on the chaise big bruises on her thin arms were almost golden in the light thank you watkins owe you a whole course of bloody treatment she started to laugh and sat up and went into a spasm of coughing and had to spit out some blood into the wad of tissues merrily pulled out some more from the box could be internal bleeding you have got to let me get you some help help myself darling what i do get me a cigarette would you mantelpiece just wouldnt give the bloody doctors the satisfaction one other thing you might do just listen please we cant put this off hes going to be miles away if we dont lock the back door all right but and then go into the bathroom and turn on the shower for me would you its a crime scene mrs morningwood youve been subjected to a a savage bloody we need an ambulance and we need the police theres no way you youre wasting your breath darling not as if theyre ever likely to get the bastard take you in strip you down probe your bits accuse you of lying therell be dna he was masked wore surgical gloves and a fucking condom he silence merrily gasped mrs morningwood began to laugh again with no humour the blood already drying in the deep lines in her face part four there are many symbols that are not individual but collective in their nature and origin these are chiefly religious images their origin so far buried in the past that they seem to have no human source carl jung i dont think a man who has watched the sun going down could walk away and commit a murder laurens van der post threadbare siân said youll need to explain this again cant sorry not my decision look sorry the signals not great im sorry youre in the car im coming back keep it short less chance of voiceshake bishops decision i think he should be the one to explain im baffled frankly siân but he makes the rules if merrily was quieter inside now it was the result of an hours violent scrubbing of the floor the walls and the legs of furniture the painstaking removal of sticky blood from the fabric of the chaise longue the careful and complete incineration of a blue nightdress in the range a full hour of scrubbing and squeezing until her hands hurt and her knees were abraded from the flags so calming these domestic chores the car was at the side of the track engine running merrily sitting quite numb looking directly in front of her at the raingreyed hills and thanking siân for looking after things saying how very grateful she was playing a part now would be the time for siân to point out that she was still if only nominally the deliverance coordinator for this diocese and therefore entitled to the facts but siân said nothing for several seconds so you want me to leave merrily obviously had we known it was only going to be a couple of days there wouldnt have been any need to bother you or anybody im really sorry siân was smart would pick up any stray nuance any hint of the spiralling descent into madness represented by the woman sitting stiffly beside merrily like a badly wrapped parcel outsize sunglasses the scarf around her discoloured swollen face the cracked barbour stormflapped over the pink silk scarf covering the lesions on her throat ah there will probably be issues for us to discuss siân said after you talk to jane oh merrily laughed lightly i wont ask the other stillvisible damage two black eyes from the fists two deep cuts just above the hairline from falling against the piano stool a split lip a broken tooth it was what they did first they beat you into semiconsciousness it was about violence more than sex most experts agreed on that siân said if youd like to talk about the bishops attitude i can wait i am so pissed off about this merrily said i dont think i want to talk to anybody for quite a long time shed phoned the ridge not tarting it up for them either the best lies were always the bald truth the bishop had told her to come back at once she was bewildered and resentful and trying to conceal it shed have to return sometime for her things sorry sorry sorry and teddy was like i really dont think i could cope with your job merrily so garway thats over siân said yes its over against your advice i wasnt asked for my advice all right siân said i think im getting the message i shall leave im sorry merrily released the clutch and nosed the volvo slowly out into the road which led past the area known as the turning above the church beside her mrs morningwood mumbled something mmm over you said it was over yes well the lies have been coming so much easier since i was ordained which was cynical and untrue and she didnt know why shed said it a sidelong glance showed her mrs morningwood trying to release a laugh through lips liked diced tomato it seemed to be getting harder for her to speak stronger woman than you look watkins i dont think so have i thanked you what for mrs morningwood laughed the fear and the pain glittering in her eyes along with the fury fury almost certainly at herself for letting someone do this to her merrily feeling much the same just dont squeezing the wheel i mustve been temporarily insane to go along with this and its done now but there is no way im going to forget that you have been in a car accident mrs morningwood said shed shut herself in the downstairs bathroom showering in water so hot that merrily scrubbing the floor had heard her screams all the rage that would find no other form of expression how long do you intend to keep this up you want to hear me sob you think theres something wrong with me something unnatural that im not sobbing my heart out you think im unwomanly on the back seat the wolfhound whimpered hed been kicked mrs morningwood said trapped in the door and then kicked theyd examined him between them no bleeding nothing broken merrily said i dont understand you thats all theres something about you i dont understand and have no need to mrs morningwood said before the shower before the scrubbing and the burning shed said if you report this i shall deny it oh sure merrily starting to lose it too by then thatll work people just wont look at you theyre tactful like that especially in the country pride themselves on minding their own business are you crazy i shall simply go out and run the jeep off the road and leave it sticking out of the hedge with my blood on the seat and the steering wheel noone will dispute it and they wont get close enough to be able to insane ive done it before crashed the car that is police find out theyll just think i was drunk police always like to think you were drunk why why are you doing this you have no need to know i have an increasingly urgent need to know in fact seems to me that the only reason you could have for covering this up is because you recognized the man who attacked you and you dont want him arrested because i dont know but you do rape violence it was usually the husband or partner all those times when the police knew about it urged the conspicuously injured party to give evidence and the victim refused it seemed unlikely that mrs morningwood had ever before been a victim she said youre wrong i do not know who it was but you dont think it was just a random thing either do you have you been followed stalked seen anybody hanging around the house no what are you not telling me no reply what if i tell the police what i found you wouldnt do that youre implicated now cleaned up his mess what if he does it to somebody else he wont this man you dont know what if he comes back silence either you tell me exactly what happened merrily had said or i ring my friend in the police who knows me well enough by now to all right but youll be the first and last to hear this muriel morningwood got up at first light as usual letting roscoe and then the chickens out into the mist her attacker had simply followed her back into the house trapping the dog with the door kicking him back out slamming the door he wore camouflage clothing no skin exposed and what had been most frightening about him was not the hood with the eyeholes but the fleshcoloured surgical gloves one of them coming at her face as she turned and then there was an explosion in her left eye and shed been thrown into the living room punched repeatedly in the mouth stomach mouth again slammed to the floor her scalp raked on a corner of the piano stool hair filling up with blood as he knelt astride her and put on the condom she was a strong woman very fit selfsufficient prided herself on it always thought shed be able to defend herself what you never accounted for was the effect of shock the way the body untrained was shocked into a kind of inner collapse by sustained unrelenting extreme violence the sound of the car had stopped it hed lifted himself listening and shed managed to scream hed been kneeling over her holding her down with both hands and when she opened her mouth hed slammed a hand across it freeing one of her arms and shed punched him as hard as she could in the balls and hed uncoiled in agony clutching himself with both hands and shed squirmed away blinded by the blood just as the footsteps had sounded on the path shed thought he looked at her once through his eyeholes and then he wasnt there only the smell of his sweat his fluids her own blood it had been obvious to merrily that if she hadnt shown up when she did mrs morningwood would by now have been waiting for dr grace the pathologist and something else was also clear you cant stay here where would i go i live in a big house oh no theres no alternative mrs morningwood therell be other people only jane and at the moment a woman priest whos standing in ill need to tell her to go is there anyone who can look after things here there was a couple graphic artists from the village reflexology patients whod helped out once before when mrs morningwood had had to go away shed got merrily to phone them explain that she had to travel to see a patient urgently in devon no problem theyd come and look after the chickens and anything else morning and night until further notice when mrs morningwood had brought down an old brown case merrily had one last try i know a good copper a decent guy mrs morningwood had held out her cigarette to merrilys lighter both hands trembling wasting your breath darling he was on foot merrily said where could he have been going when i saw him anywhere watery blood soaking into the wobbling cigarette from lips failing to grip over the hill and far away doormat on the way here lol had glimpsed a signpost and braked at the next junction hed turned round and gone back sat in the cab of the truck gazing at the three words on the sign a name with only one meaning a place of sorrowful pilgrimage he hadnt realized that he was going to be so close no time now but there would be no excuse on the way back hed turned round again and driven on into the warwickshire countryside and now the animal was in an offroad parking area a short way from the castle lodge a burger van was opening up at the far end the big man in the long tan leather coat evidently knew the burger guy because he walked past him without a glance directly to lols truck and lol lowered his window five times hed attempted to call merrily on her mobile it was always switched off hed left two messages the first one explaining he had a chance to talk to lord stourport and how far did she want him to go the second one saying that if she didnt call back within twenty minutes he was going to be late yow got business here pal the man in the leather coat said lol told him he had an appointment with lord stourport in he looked at the dashboard clock twelve minutes the man who had gelled hair and chewed gum asked for his name and lol told him and the man nodded and went back to the lodge lol sat back and waited and kept seeing the signpost in his minds eye hed never been there hed spoken to dozens of people who had been some travelling hundreds of miles but all these years hed avoided it what good would it do now when his phone rang he didnt even look at the callers number merrily uh no lol its me its eirion it is oh lol said hello eirion im sorry to bother you but i figured youd probably be gigging at night saw a piece on you in mojo theyd reviewed your gig in oxford did you know no i didnt eirion look it was pretty good eirions south wales accent kicking in usually a sign of nerves it was this guy whod seen you in hazey jane when he was young he said hazey jane were never quite as good as they might have been or as good as they would be now if theyd had the quality of material youre producing at the moment something like that well thats pretty positive not really the reason for your call is it er no eirion said no it isnt this would have to be about jane who according to merrily had not heard from eirion for a couple of weeks and was thinking shed been dumped and hed love to find out something that might help but this really wasnt a good time eirion could i call you back im expecting lol please could you give me just two minutes one minute well yeah ok as long as it only i rang the vicarage see i was going to ask mrs watkins but this other woman answered is there something wrong lol have they you know gone where gone left good god no then why isnt she returning my calls lol jane isnt returning your calls see i didnt want to bother you with this its not like shes your daughter or anything but im going crazy here man well you know this is difficult but the impression we were given was that now youre at university your lives had kind of taken different paths im at cardiff its less than an hour and a quarter away i come back every weekend i mean you know i couldve gone to oxford you could have theyd accepted me it was a bit borderline but they said yes you turned down oxford so you could be nearer to jane my old mans still fuming weeks before hed even talk to me i didnt know lol said no you wouldnt does jane know i told her i said theyd turned me down eirion dont say anything will you i dont how many calls have you made to jane bloody dozens her phoness always switched off and i leave messages and she doesnt call back i didnt know shes with someone else right its this bloody archaeologist isnt it i i dont know you know hes married dont you and hes nearly thirty i mean hes married all right jane she can be you know i mean you know what she can be yeah and yet you know what i mean oh yes lol said sorry i shouldnt be hanging this on you ill talk to her ok ill find out something look ill call you back maybe tomorrow the man in the leather coat was standing outside the lodge beckoning pointing to the gates telling lol it was time the vicarage was immaculately tidy and siân had made a coal fire in the parlour and banked it up this was thoughtful merrily rarely lit a fire before evening upstairs the guest room looked like siân had never been there it was at the rear of the house overlooking the old powell orchard the sun had come out and ripe apples gleamed like baubles roscoe plodded around on the oak boards and merrilys move to replace the duvet cover with a fresh one got a dismissive wave of the hand from mrs morningwood dont bother itll only be stinking of this stuff by morning jars and bottles some labelled were set out on the pine dresser with a glass and a spoon shed accepted a cup of weak tea declined food merrily sat on the edge of the bed at the risk of no im thinking primarily of the head injuries the doctor here hes not exactly a fan of alternative remedies but he could at least put your mind at rest you mean your mind its not necessary i dont have a skull fracture and even if i did he doesnt need to know what happened to you knowing as she said it that she was wrong kent asprey would need to know and while mrs morningwood might get away with her story about the head injury how many people emerged from car crashes with strangulation marks sooner or later this is going to hit you muriel is that supposed to be a joke no i wasnt thinking im sorry you get some rest ill pace around for a couple of hours when she turned at the door mrs morningwood was standing by the window a wounded smile on damaged lips or maybe not a smile at all just the wound it just had to be someone she knew and no you wont wake up to find police at the bedside merrily said thank you you need anything just i wont equally if you need to go out to attend to your parish affairs go ahead right merrily went unhappily downstairs and through the kitchen to the scullery sat down and stared at the blotter on the desk trying to be impressed by mrs morningwoods resilience but becoming only more mystified not to say horrified by the bloody womans ability to contain the rage and the pain which ought to be taking her apart merrily felt useless ineffectual and jane had been right some kind of doormat shed for gods sake shed just cleaned up a crime scene this monster was out there and shed mopped up his mess destroyed any usable traces of his dna and she needed to pray and couldnt her palms were moist with sweat and she couldnt summon the will even to put them together a kind of barren coldness in her chest a sense of desertion as if something had vanished from her life like the meaning of it like a basic feel for the spiritual validity of her job her role in this black farce like any kind of selfworth she made herself look up adam eastgates number in the index maybe if she hadnt been so flattened by the bishops early call shed have stood up to mrs morningwood made her see some sense stood up to a woman whod been beaten up and raped made her see sense merrily shook her head almost savagely as if this could crumble the sludge in her brain so that the fragments might resettle into some random but interpretable pattern then she lit a cigarette picked up the black bakelite phone abruptly replaced it reverted to the mobile and made the call no the bishop didnt phone adam eastgate said he came to see us merrily at home he came to your home said he was passing i live over at burghill not the kind of place you just happen to pass what he had to say made sense i suppose a pity mind he told you what exactly she was aware of her stomach contracting close to an ulcer he suggested that it might be dangerous to be connected with a murder and suicide more or less for the church or the duchy i think he meant for us but that would be our problem wouldnt it maybe suggesting it would not look good if it got out that id administered a blessing for fuchsia in a disused church just a short time before she killed her partner did he say that close and if it got out that id been involved at the behest of the duchy of cornwall he might have said something like that as well aye merrily had expected a reluctance to answer her questions but it wasnt there eastgate wasnt obviously eager but he wasnt erecting barriers did the bishop tell you id come to the conclusion that fuchsia had made the whole thing up so it had all been for nothing my information is that the inquest will be told that the girl killed felix and then took her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed i think thats the official wording so erm did you then tell the bishop that you didnt want us to take it any further no i didnt say that oh i liked felix i was wishing i could turn the clock back to the time we were first offered the property by the grays if i could unmake that deal id be a happier man she remembered him standing by the window in the duchys barn we dont often make mistakes adam when you bought it did you know about the feud with the gwilyms that is did you know the grays were offering it to you specifically because they wanted to keep it out of the hands of the gwilyms that they wanted it to go to someone richer more remote impregnable someone who couldnt be leaned on to sell it did you know any of that not then no i learned some of it later and ive since had a long chat with paul gray yesterday in fact mr grays got his problems as you may know yes he told me he didnt want them compounded by an old feud he didnt want if anything should happen to him for his wife to be left with it the feud or the house he wanted to apologize for unloading an unhappy place on us hed considered us as like you just said rich and remote hadnt realized that local people would be involved an unhappy place well hes not had much luck has he in that situation mind you can get a bit irrational i told him we were taking steps i was sorry for the man sorry for all of us this was before the bishop obviously it was disappointing the bishops attitude eastgate spoke slowly edging around something i wasnt expecting that left us in a bit of a dilemma has it as you know i was in two minds from the start about involving the church but id told them i liked the look of you and it couldnt do any harm told who you mustve realized thered be people i needed to keep informed and when the bishop backed off i referred the whole thing up that is to my immediate boss in the duchy right and he referred it further up how much further i think you know what im saying blimey when was this first thing this morning you should expect a call merrily from i was asked to provide what information i could about you im telling you this in case someone mentions it i wouldnt like you to think we were going behind your back thank you somebody went on your website found a lot about deliverance not much about you personally lowkey adam part of the brief your daughters been a bit of a feisty lass mind that isnt on the website no it isnt if youre talking about the stones in colemans meadow merrily said for what its worth im behind jane all the way im sorry if no no thats good merrily that was well received part of our heritage i was going to say that meanwhile someone else was consulted a senior person in the church who knows you thinks a lot about you as it turns out anyway you should expect a call who was this you spoke to in the church merrily im just the land agent expect a call you said aye is this a call for which i need to wear my best cassock as it were no eastgate laughed thats not how it works when she stood up it felt as if the scullery floor was tilting beneath her feet and she had to get out of here and the damn mobile was chiming again yes so whats the weather like over there reverend bracing hello frannie the way you snapped yes just then are my detectives acute antennae picking up an element of stress or what do you want just i hadnt heard from you in a while wondered if youd tripped over anything that might interest me even mildly in the impenetrable jungle that is garway you mean youve finally won the fight againt innercity crime in hereford and youre at a loose end you know merrily bliss paused experience has taught me that these small displays of facetiousness on your part often conceal a profound anxiety im a christian i dont get profound anxiety so nothings happened that you might need to tell me about nothing special at all merrily said god forgive her a place in the country lol robinson jimmy hayter said remind me have we met um very briefly at glastonbury way back we only played there once on a very small stage you wouldnt remember nah i wouldnt remember i dont like glastonbury lol said nothing he hadnt imagined there was anybody who didnt like glastonbury what he was sure of was that he didnt much like this room with its lofty cathedral windows and an elaborately carved ceiling bulging with lumpen cherubs blowing trumpets victorian gothic unsubtly different from the original soaring arboreal gothic in lols view built not so much to elevate as dominate intimidate even levin he back on the piss lol is somebody saying he is lol had a fourseater sofa to himself about the size of his truck hed shuffled himself to one end hunched forward so that his feet would actually reach the floor lord stourport was in a wellworn leather armchair close to the vast open fireplace half a tree trunk sizzling there like a whole pig at a pig roast just he wasnt very lucid on the phone stourport said about what you wanted he drinks coffee it was probably a caffeine high and maybe i hadnt explained it very well lets hope you can now then cocker hayter had a leg thrown over one of the arms of his chair revealing a small split in the crotch of his jeans he was squat and overweight but not too much of it was fat his hair was dense and white and wedged on his forehead a weighty awning over his deepset penetrating dark brown eyes this is not easy jimmy lol said hayters eyebrow lifted at the familiarity probably on account of this was not jimmys drum this was the seat of lord stourport very hayter all the same this victorian fake more powerful in its heavyduty way than some authentic medieval castles rendered romantic by time and erosion very deathmetal lol had counted four staff including the guy in the leather coat and a gardener in a greenhouse and he wondered if there was also a formal butler somewhere in a butler suit like the guy in the celeb strip in private eye so youve come up from herefordshire hayter said where your girlfriend is the official exorcist working for the council or what he wasnt smiling hard to work out whether he was taking the piss or this was genuine ignorance best played down the line the diocese the bishop shes an ordained priest right stourport nodded so if i rang the bishops office you want the number no ill trust you whats she do basically lol told him patiently about the cure of troubled souls and troubled premises like the master house at garway lord stourport leaned back contemplating the cowboy boot on the end of the leg over the chair arm im a bit hazy would that be the tumbledown shithole a bunch of us rented for the summer way back as if prof hadnt told him and he hadnt already done some hard thinking i heard it was you who paid the rent lol said and it was quite a bit longer than a summer summers could last for a couple of years back then stourport said back when we were young i think this one got a bit autumnal quite quickly hayters eyes refocused youre not here to try and blackmail me are you no lol said sincerely im not im just hoping you could give me some background its like people are saying its disturbed now but is there any history my friend sometimes people ask her to clean up a place and theyre making it up for some reason or theres an element of delusion or theyre not telling her the whole story how would i know the whole story maybe you wouldnt but you were an outsider living there no local pressure to cover anything up she goes to that kind of trouble stourport wore a grimace of disbelief a priest either you do the job properly because if youre bullshitting me why would i because if you are i should just tell you any hint of anything i say to you appears in the press you are truly fucked cocker ill come after you well not me personally obviously but someone youve found that approach helps generally lol said sometimes it does stourport waved a languid hand go on ask what you want did you get any feeling the place was i have to say this haunted could be really it was old i mean this piles old after a fashion built on the site of the original norman castle and its haunted shapes seen out of the corner of an eye on the stairs in the long gallery nobody should give me that allinthemind bullshit but i would have to say this house isnt haunted like that house was haunted or maybe the drugs were too new and lovely then lol smiled stourport brought his leg down from the chair arm inched the chair closer to the fire doubt if idve got through it without the drugs thinking back whos living there now let me guess couple of gay hairdressers from islington weekends only nobodys living there at the moment but its been bought by the duchy of cornwall has it by god the plan is to restore it sensitively right lord stourport shifted in his chair now youre starting to make sense they have weight those guys and money and there are complications lol told him about the deaths no reason to hold any of that back not as if it hadnt been in the papers stourport drew in his lips like he was about to whistle but he didnt comment so youre just the boyfriend he said when lol sat back you dont meddle yourself are you kidding you mean this is all for lerve lol shrugged lightly weve been educated out of all that nonsense the aristocracy i tell you robinson most of us were mightily relieved when punk came in and we no longer had to babble on about peace and lerve except for poor charles of course whos at least halfhippie never could stand the man personally but if hes had the master house unloaded on him one can only sympathize what will she do this woman of yours shell say some prayers bless the premises or maybe organize a small service a requiem for the people who died with people there who might still have problems with the house and people who had problems with it in the past you could come if you wanted no thanks your communes been mentioned anyway it was never a commune nothing so formal can you tell me about it i can tell you what i remember but what i remember might have very little to do with what actually happened like that huh very much like that cocker on the sunlit square merrily felt like a tourist the last couple of nights were probably as long as shed spent away from here since theyd moved in you came back it made you blink the black and white houses and shops unexpectedly exotic in the lucozade light of an autumn morning or was that because she was afraid she was going to lose it all didnt even feel safe in her own house any more which wasnt her own house which was the churchs house the church as represented in her life by the bishop the bishop behind whose back she was alone on the square a few people around the shops none of them close enough to have to greet god had it come to this she slid into the familiar sanctuary of the market hall took out her mobile switched it on to find it frantic with messages there was a bunch of calls from lol who was on his way to where she listened she called him back at once his phone was switched off she left a message lol i dont know what its best to ask lord stourport this is getting messier than you could ever imagine all i can say just play it by ear maybe dont even mention mary linden because ive only had that from one source which i dont entirely trust im sorry and then there was sophie two cautious call me back messages from her merrily called the gatehouse are you alone for the moment merrily i need to apol doesnt matter i understand sophie did you tell the bishop that id finally concluded that fuchsia had made it all up well its certainly what he wanted me to tell him when was this last night when he arrived on our doorstep in a state of some agitation he instructed me quite formally not to call you until he had i gave him until ninethirty then i began to leave messages im sorry merrily hes still my boss however eccentric hes become well look im back at the vicarage and thereve been some developments which ill explain in due course you sound upset im ok ill explain it face to face when the bishops not on your back or mine you said he was agitated why like he was getting pressure sophie didnt reply ill tell you something else he suggested that the duchy itself would be happier if i forgot all about the master house he indicated hed had this from adam eastgate it wasnt true i see who might be leaning on him sophie could it be canterbury i certainly havent taken any calls from church house but that means nothing ah who else come on sophie who else can you think of with any influence over the bishop who the bishop might be intimidated by sophie said perhaps i could call you back a little later reverend longbeach oh he was there hed walked in on her merrily killed the line and walked out on the other side of the market hall emerging next to a grey car parked tidily in its shade shed wanted to ask if sophie knew or could find out who exactly had been tapped for information about hereford deliverance and her and jane who was the other minister consulted by the duchy well obviously this described huw owen but huw would have told her no way huw would not have told her shed call him anyway she scrolled through the list on the mobile she should call him now and then merrily closed up the phone with a snap stood staring at the grey lexus parked next to the market hall noting on the back seat a lavishly labelled case of italian leather siân callaghanclarkes gloves on the dash we were not kids lord stourport said thats too easy we were young voracious adults the world spread out in front of us like a picnic we had the power of youth and that is a power because it comes without responsibility except to yourself well thats commonplace now thats almost the norm crowleys line do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law thats every fuckers motto now nobody thinks twice back then it was new and risky and seductive lol was quite fascinated by the way stourporthayter would unconsciously switch from officerclass drawl to streethard pseudocockney without a breath in between actually it was quite a sad time for a lot of them stourport said the hippie dream all gone to shit with nothing to replace it no real energy everybody seemed to be sprawled around stoned and directionless it never bothered me i was quite happy to be stoned and directionless for a while when was this seventythree seventyfour id dropped out of cambridge in disgrace but with a portfolio of musicbiz contacts par fucking excellence and a working knowledge of how to make money that would subsequently win the reluctant respect of even my old man living here in faded splendour buckets catching the drips sitting in his overcoat in winter watching his black and white tv surrounded by old masters imagine the ignominy of having your heritage saved by the illgotten millions of the disreputable punk impresario son poor old bastard never recovered how longve you been here fifteen sixteen years it was sudden really ironically living a warm dampfree existence seemed to do for the old mans health but of course all this was still far into the future when we moved into the master house how did you find out about the house cant remember i mean it was that time when bored young people of my generation would look up and go hey lets start again lets go out into the sticks be pioneers ronnie lane decamping to shropshire touring in a gypsy caravan bucolic bliss that was a myth as well of course even if youve got the money if you have land it needs to be worked scores of idle freaks lying in the grass a spade whats that about the man in the leather coat put his head round the door looking pointedly at lol but stourport waved him away lol said did you know anything about the history of the place when you took it the knights templar robinson i knew nothing about the knights frigging templar had a flat in london with my girlfriend at the time siggi and we had a lot of parties which were as we used to say busted by the pigs on no less than three occasions it was getting tiresome and my friend pierre markham you know who im talking about no the merchant banker never mind anyway it was pierre who said why dont we get a place in the country well id been born in a place in the bleeding country so the idea held no particular magic for me besides which although i had plenty of readies i didnt really have a lump sum to put down on a property but pierres saying no we lease somewhere that was siggi and me pierre and his lady and a guy called mickey sharpe who was basically our dealer kept us supplied with whatever we needed in quantity he flung his leg back over the chair arm lounging back slowly shaking his head actually i remember now what put us on to the master house it was just an ad in country life or the lady it didnt actually say no hippies but it probably did no harm at all reverting to being the hon until the deal was done anyway we move into this hovel throw some money at it scatter the sheepskins and the afghan fucking rugs set up the important item this monster bo stereo and it was summer and life passed in a bit of a haze mickey had a van and hed go off to london and come back with the stuff early mornings and we had a secret stash we called the grotto of dreams as you did in those days what broke the idyll what makes you think it broke they always do lol said this one didnt break it just got diverted got a lot more intense very quickly after some weeks we discover this guy called mathew is living with us you discover hes living with you he was just there you know people came and went any problems we had plumbing and whatever mickey would fix it for some guy to attend to it mickey was an excellent man hed go out and find the right people the ones on the fringe who in return for a small package wouldnt spread it round that we were you know dangerously subversive then this guy mathew mat with one t he was very particular about that your name the number of letters it had very important the numerological correspondences all this shit bit mystical i thought at first he was just some fucking gardener pierred hired this messianiclooking guy not much older than any of us but he had the look mat phobe he called himself obviously not his real name but who used their real names in those days you called yourself what you thought you ought to be called what would reflect your spirit so it was a while before we became aware that mat phobe was actually in charge of us all how do you mean in charge yeah exactly i dont believe we knew you did one weird thing weirdness became the norm especially if you were getting a buzz but the templars it was mat knew about the templars wed all been down this weird little church and wandered around but it hadnt meant that much to us there wasnt all this shit about the templars all over the media in those days medieval history wasnt cool stone age was cool the golden age of ley lines when the land was irrigated by mysterious energies that could blow you away we knew all about that but we knew diddlysquat about the templars except for mat and so it came out lol wishing there was some way he could record it all for merrily mat came and went hed go off for weeks at a time and come back with some new idea mat had said they were sitting on energies the like of which they couldnt imagine mat had said the master house was at the centre of forbidden secrets all this stuff that gave a deep and wonderful significance to their lives when they heard about it stoned hed told them about the templars being suppressed because of their advanced esoteric knowledge he knew about jacques de molay grand master of the order coming to garway in mat was convinced de molay had stayed in the master house he was also convinced that the grand master had brought something with him lol sat up like what he reckoned garway was i dunno the chosen place he said this guy jacques could already see the writing on the wall knew that all these kings and popes were suspicious of the order and jealous of their wealth and their influence and the secret knowledge they had all this da vinci code shit is it shit probably but we had no point of reference back then anyway the book that raised the whole bloodline of christ issue the holy blood and the holy grail wouldnt come out for several years so are you saying mat knew something of this before it was in the public domain oh man jimmy hayter raised his eyes to the cherubs you listened to that guy you thought there was nothing he didnt know he had all these charts and symbols and glyphs and astral correspondences and all this impenetrable balls he was the high priest the adept looking back i can see that he was probably full of shit but we didnt question it at the time because the women found it shall we say very alluring at first so what did he think he was going to find treasure money gold whatever the templars had massive wealth they were a multinational enterprise they ran a banking system across europe and the middle east matd got it into his head that de molay had chosen garway as a hiding place if the deal went down in france garway made sense hed say because it was not only remote it was on the welsh border and the templars were well in with the welsh and the scots they rode with robert the bruce at bannockburn mat thought there was templar treasure stashed at garway he thought we were sitting on it at the master house the grand master house which was built soon after the church just far enough away that nobody would suspect and he thought the treasure was still there oh jeez jimmy hayter laughed we were all over the place after that tapping walls looking for signs and symbols pierre and his woman whatever her name was theyd gone by then and some other guy was there and i remember him being chased out of the church by the vicar after taking a crowbar to one of the long stones that were originally the lids of templar coffins i remember mat gave him a talkingto and then he gathered us all around and he said we were going about it all wrong he said the only way to find out the secret was to get onto the templar wavelength suddenly stourport was back and his face seemed less relaxed now his eyes harder that was when it got intense that was when we started on the magic frail merrily went back to check on mrs morningwood listening outside the door of the guest room all she could hear was roscoe padding around on the other side once he growled twice she went back out to the square and siâns car was still there just after midday she rang huw owen from the scullery and asked him straight out if hed been approached by the duchy i never thought you had so few friends lass no its not me then who doesnt have to be somebody you actually know could just be somebody as knows you somebody as knows exactly what youve been doing the past couple of years could even be merlin the wizard huws name for the welshman who was archbishop of canterbury huw seemed oddly for huw fond of him which might have been down to their shared affection for the incredible string band old celtic hippies sticking together help me out here merrily said what are they likely to want huw said you might remember what i told you about royalty and the church reference to seismic shifts and little folks getting dropped down crevices i remember follow your conscience but watch your back and did it work lol asked the magic he could feel the atmosphere hardening he felt like he was stirring cement and running out of water to soften the mix soon jimmy hayters memories would become clogged lord stourport less accommodating and when his curiosity about merrily ran out it would be time to go it was magick with a k hayter said aleister crowley put the k on the end didnt he a tosser but an influential tosser lol said im told my dear friend stourport heaved himself up on an elbow if you thought i was going to tell you what we were doing well i did actually lol said hoped anyway it was a long time ago after all crowley lol remembered a discussion hed once had in a flat in rossonwye with a woman called cola french who had hung out with some weird people and had told him about the oto that was something to do with templars wasnt it ordo templi orientis stourport eyeing him balefully now sitting up in the chair somebodys been talking have they i was just thinking crowley templars crowley was into them yeah and mat phobe was into crowley stourport said you want a drink no thanks im working tonight all the more reason my dear not when youre your own roadie jeez you poor sad bleeder why do you bother lol shrugged stourport was quiet for a while looking up at the cherubs with their trumpets then he got up and went over to a chinese lacquer cabinet with dragons on it came back with a heavy glass and a squat bottle of tequila all right he sat down again but dont take any of this as gospel i was only half there it was clear that the rambling reminiscence was over hayter was being monitored by stourport now and there was more care less freeflow as he talked about mat phobe telling them how the order of the poor knights had been officially stamped out its churches closed its assets seized its leaders burned how in spite of this it had never really gone away the templars had gone underground under different names their secrets passed on through rosicrucianism and freemasonry and some of the magical orders which had manifested in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries yeah including the oto he said he could show us stourport said he said wed never look back that was when pierre split hed had a bad experience we got up one morning and he was flailing around saying we were all evil and we were laying ourselves open to eternal damnation hed been brought up as a catholic and it taints you for life what had you done stourport shook his head lol thought about the girl called cola french who had worked in a bookshop the oto was into sex magic cola french had said you use the buildup to an orgasm to channel and focus energy for a particular purpose and then boom with women lol said or men or on your own two out of three was good enough for me mat said we could employ supernatural this sounds like utter shit now but you have to remember the chemicals we were absorbing he said we could follow a path to enlightenment focus our willpower strengthened by sexual tension like for instance the templars had this girdle kind of thing they wore in bed as an aid to chastity he showed us how to use something similar only this was to prolong an orgasm hayter smiled ruefully a guy who thinks he can show you how to come for ever youll follow him anywhere what was his background never knew narcotics make you incurious he was just there you know and yeah we might have plumbed what some people may consider the depths of depravity except it didnt seem like depravity at the time me i was up to here with peace and lerve and ready to get steeped in the dirty stuff im not really getting this lol said how it ties in to the location the master house how was this leading you to whatever you wanted to find lord stourport sipped his tequila sun flooded one of the vast gothic windows you call something up and you ask it a spirit a demon you do a ritual to invoke whatever you think can tell you what you want to know i remember there was a blood sacrifice once mat sent mickey sharpe to steal a cockerel from one of the farms i didnt care too much for that fucking blood was everywhere that was when siggi split i think mat was glad siggi was getting a little flaky so that was just the two of you left you and mat phobe two men oh none of that stuff old boy anyway other people were there by then mickey had discovered a source of he smiled farm girls lol said a source country girls who knew their way around country girls are undervalued as if theyre naive or something compared to your hardnosed city chicks not the case bulls and cows rams and ewes theyve lived with it since they could walk not easily shocked is what im saying we were not corrupting innocents who was this you mat this mickey i remember mickey thought that given the circumstances he ought to be paid more i remember that what did you do paid him of course after all we were paying the girls paying them to go a little further and keep their mouths shut well hayter chuckled some of the time no problems there like i said theyd never seen that kind of money before i want to stress this no corruption of innocents you make it sound like they were working girls and that wouldnt happen in the sticks would it stourport put his glass down on the edge of the stone fireplace dont knock it robinson it has its uses so they were paying local girls to take part in ceremonial magic involving sexual practices the kind of practices you wouldnt get your own girlfriend into no matter what shed taken he said how could you be sure they wouldnt talk about it put it this way they never did you wouldnt want to would you not if youd been paid more for a couple of nights than youd normally earn in a month and like i said country girls and none of it was illegal they werent under age i was more worried about the men i didnt want any more men but mat there was one guy mat was keen to involve i thought he was a pain in the arse fortunately he didnt live in local guy oh yeah his family used to own the house had a name that was ridiculously welsh he didnt sound welsh mat softpedalled him for a while until it was clear he was up for it he didnt smoke so we gave him pills and got one of the girls to bake hash brownies which loosened him up a lot we got him talking about the house and what had happened there i remember one night him saying to me you think youre a nob im royalty man he was a pompous shit bloody welsh and their upsidedown inferiority complex didnt even sound welsh what did he mean royalty oh his family was descended from the welsh princes all this bollocks but mat was interested he constructed some kind of ritual this bloke had to be at the centre of some necromantic thing to put him in touch with his ancestors we taped it candles and incense and a magic circle and a tape recorder he went into some sort of trance and all this balls came out in welsh he swore he couldnt speak welsh actually quite shattered i remember when we played it back to him this was in the house this was in the main room yeah maybe you need to talk to him wish i could remember his name william somethingunpronounceablywelsh tell your lady to talk to him if hes still alive make the bastard squirm so did you ever manage to contact his ancestors i dont know i had to go back to london to meet my father who i did not want coming down to garway get out the suit drive up to london wouldve stayed in london if id had any sense but i was keen to get back still had the hots for one of the girls whod been away and come back one of the farm girls nah stourport sniffed the farm girls they were they didnt they werent bothered they werent fazed they just accepted it and the money of course no this was actually a black girl strange as it may seem id never had a black girl at the time such sheltered lives people had back then lol said stourport scowled wasnt to be anyway id been back from london one no maybe two nights when the herefordshire constabulary paid us an earlymorning call i think i heard about that pulled me and the faithful mickey bastard hereford magistrates sent me to jail served nine weeks a nightmare mat and the welsh guy got away and the black girl she was the only woman there at the time i didnt think about this then but maybe it was a blessing for her she was getting quite frail didnt have the stamina of the other slappers they used her in rituals sex rituals robinson watch my lips and remember this all i did at the master house was pay for the drugs and expend some testosterone the socalled magic passed over my head i didnt believe in it then and i dont believe in it now it was libidinal spice so you never found the gold or whatever it was need you ask what happened to the tapes mat took them i suppose if i should come across one ill let you know or anything else that occurs to me just write down your phone number on there hayter picked up a folded copy of the independent from beside his chair tossed it at lol who wrote down his mobile number the chances of hayter getting back to him were about as likely as alien going platinum he looked up so the girl she was black it was a novelty she was succulent there was a coldness in the room and it seemed to gather in lols spine and he sat back against a cushion stourport finished his drink and didnt pour another dont expect me to go any further than that not that any of its spectacularly obscene in comparison with some of my later escapades most of which have been extremely well chronicled as you know what happened to them the ones that got away dunno i was in the slammer a nightmare you couldnt even get decent dope in british prisons back then you didnt hear from mat no dead now somebody told me hed gone out to the middle east or somewhere and hed died or been killed i wasnt sorry he was a cold bastard what about mary dunno where she went i was in the pokey like i said when i came out just about the last place i was likely to go near was the master house in fact lord stourport broke off slowly put his glass back on the hearth and looked out from under his shelf of white hair levelling at lol a steady gaze that went on for a long time all the time it took for lol to realize that hed said the name mary and jimmy hayter had only ever mentioned a nameless black girl time of no reply on the back of the stone it said now we rise and we are everywhere where are you now merrily was asking in lols ear in a churchyard under an oak tree tried to call earlier but your phone was busy all the time on the grave in front of the stone strewn like the fallen petals of plastic flowers lol had counted fourteen plectrums above them on the small grey memorial a blunted plectrum of stone in the grass the names of molly drake and rodney drake and their dates at the top the name of the son who had predeceased them both his dates churchyard where um tanworth tanworth in arden in warwickshire pause lol thats nicks village oh god lol its ok his glasses had misted he took them off it was on the way i saw the signpost had to stop obviously never having been maybe you know avoiding it of course you had to stop slightly awkward pause what do you i mean whats it like you know the very quiet and modest really not unhappy listen there are things i need to tell you lord stourport you saw him i tried to reach you um you wont find this edifying lol put his glasses back on took out a folded tourschedule full of the notes hed scribbled in the truck back near the burger van and told her what hed learned from jimmy hayter standing next to the grave of nick drake and his parents decent prosperous residents of this increasingly wealthy village while the sun was hiding in the oak tree making an autumn bonfire amongst the turning leaves merrily made notes on the sermon pad she wrote down the names pierre markham mickey sharpe siggi mat phobe de molay treasure with a kind of mental shiver she wrote down crowley oto and then grotto of dreams and in rapid sucession blood sacrifice country girls paid underlining this remembering marys letter its only your body and look at the money youre getting because he was safely out of there in the sanctuary of the tanworth churchyard at the shrine of his first tragic hero she was able to smile at the way lol had blown it dropping marys name when stourport had referred only to a black girl she wrote frail and then finally sycharth amid the distaste an unexpected fizz of excitement as merrily put down her pen lol did lord stourport miss something when he was in london do you think i cant help wondering if he even went to london lol said or if whatever happened towards the end he was effectively dissociating himself from it giving himself an alibi and the way he was stressing that he was only in it for the sex wasnt really involved in the ritual magic was that true do you think or just a blokey thing to say well it was blokey but the sex the magic i dont think you can divide them i think he did get off on all that you sensed a kind of pride after a while he was enjoying talking about it his decadent youth before he had the responsibility of property and a title dumped on him i think hed do it again tomorrow if there was another mat phobe around to set it up but he never went into detail no youd probably be looking at whatever rituals crowley did in that context templars he was always intrigued by the templars thinking of the time while she was waiting for the first deliverance course at huw owens chapel in the beacons when shed been reading heavily about magic and crowley in particular all the books came back to crowley his attempts to raise spiritual and demonic entities representing various energies sexual arousal going handroundcock with higher consciousness his ambition to become godlike in a seedy kind of way she remembered once making the mistake of reading in bed about how at his abbey in sicily crowley had supervised a ritual which involved a woman having sex with a goat culminating in crowley cutting the goats throat so that the blood washed over the woman it was about the magical energy of blood crowley liked to call them scarlet women and that was how theyd end up the sick bastard the welsh guy lol said he mustve been there at the end yes thats your big discovery lol and im truly grateful for this i need to talk to the guy dont i if its who i think it is was she going to talk to sycharth in defiance of the bishop oh yes oh god yes lol said you foresee him reacting with the same kind of halfsuppressed glee as jimmy hayter not exactly hes a big businessman in hereford now he owns the centurion on roman road do not go on your own whats he going to do sacrifice me you need a witness i just want to invite him to a small service god was she still going to do that a deliverance swansong youre not going today are you lol said ill call him make an appointment get sophie to do it makes it seem more official merrily said nothing it would take too long to explain youre ok arent you lol said i mean youre feeling all right im feeling surprisingly well surprisingly well what time will you be home gigs at nine decent gig not bad do this one for nick merrily said you know what i mean and when you get in come round i dont care what time well then lol knelt down next to the grave made it at last two blokes in the same business one who went down one who having begun his career by shamelessly copying the other had somehow come through this was silly embarrassing futile not only did he not know what to say he wasnt even sure who he was addressing he was now over a decade older than nick had been when hed died alone in his bedroom in a big house in this village from an overdose of antidepressants having already overdosed on cannabis and commercial failure the house was called far leys and apparently was quite easy to find but lol had decided that he wasnt going to if nick drake was alive now hed be nearly sixty what would he sound like now now we rise and we are everywhere could hear him breathily singing those words on the summery from the morning the last song on the last album released in his lifetime like a prophecy the last one his songs had always been full of dark prescience if you wanted to hear it as if hed seen the design of his short life laid out in symbols he was the fruit tree that would only flourish when his body was in the ground when the pink moon had taken his life after the years of the blackeyed dog howling at his door asking for more giving nothing this man who could stand in silence for two hours on the periphery of a party like a halfformed apparition some people had actually seen his possible suicide as part of a lifeplan others thought he was just plain screwed up and smoking too much dope maybe it was often said a woman might have saved him if hed been able to let a woman in or a man gay men liked to suggest that nick who despite his elegance his good looks and his profession never seemed to have had a physical relationship had been in the closet the most likely answer was that he was too well brought up in the careful postwar agatha christie fifties too plain uptight middle english i cant really imagine nick having sex with anyone a friend quoted in the latest biography because he would have to take his clothes off and he was always far too shy this in the seventies when jimmy hayter close to the same age as nick and actually far more upperclass had been up to here with peace and lerve and ready to get steeped in the dirty stuff jimmy hayter who was lord stourport who hadnt spoken to lol again as lol stood up murmured thank you nodded and walked away like he was walking on an open blade hayters body never moving only his stare coldly following him to the door youd have encountered people like him right lol said i mean you were just a little too late especially with your background to have been a real hippie lol picked up one of the plectrums tortoiseshell and then put it back finding hed rearranged them into a rough semicircle around the gravestone you came in at the wrong end of the dream when everybody was waking up into the cold daylight trying to pull the covers over their heads and it was all going rancid under there those sublime albums bombing one after the other no reason for it they were massive these days the songs ubiquitous now he had risen and he was everywhere the last prophesy fulfilled there was nothing left to say lol stood up he had no plectrum to leave hadnt used one in years just his fingers and his nails on light strings as he walked away a slow breeze passed through the brittling leaves on the oak tree like a low sigh and lol turned and thought for a moment that a tall figure was shadowed under the tree slightly stooped raising a languid hand in a brief shy salute lol smiled and waved once and ran out of the churchyard all the way back to where hed left the animal at the side of the road in a quiet lane with trees only it wasnt there using the landline merrily rang the centurion in roman road a woman said im sorry mr gwilyms in a meeting who shall i say called when will the meeting be over im afraid i dont know can i take a ill call back merrily said the mobile starting to chime at her elbow its adam eastgate merrily about that call i warned you to expect it hasnt happened yet well no as it turns out this is it sorry ive been asked to make the call rather than somebody whose voice you wouldnt recognize bottom line merrily i have to ask you if you ever do any work privately like privately you know what im saying independently of the diocese and on a confidential basis like what like the service in the master house paul gray says hell go along with it though perhaps im not the best person to make an approach to mr gwilym you want me to go ahead despite the bishop its not seen as a confrontational thing just something we feel should take place and if its done quietly there wont be any of the problems bernard was afraid of who else would be there me anyone else it wouldnt be wise for there to be anyone else this is a tough one adam aye i can see that if i did it merrily said and it got out it could get me in a lot of trouble because there was a difference here if she just went ahead with it on her own it would be merely a small rebellion out of conscience where the royals are concerned the royals and canterbury the smallest rumour can cause a seismic shift and little folks like you can get dropped down the nearest crevice it wont get out merrily nobody wants it to get out and the ideas been approved has it at the highest level i referred it up the suggestion came back from just from higher up when did they have in mind soon as possible soon as you can get the people together whats the earliest do you think i suppose merrily thought about it counting days i suppose the earliest might be the day after tomorrow that would be friday she looked at the calendar and her gaze caught the sermon pad propped up now against the computer open to the list of names pierre markham mickey sharpe siggi that would be friday the twelfth adam eastgate said im writing it down mat phobe or saturday i suppose merrily said the thirteenth it was like one of those damn signposts being erected in the scullery hammered into the floor in front of the desk mat phobe something about that name not a real name obviously think about it and let me know early tomorrow adam eastgate said ok ok i will her stare travelling up and down the names alighting on sycharth adam tell me something if i can the threats received by the duchy oh now itll go no further i promise come on someones given you the green light to trust me where did you get this from jonathan long which she had in a way wales merrily said he was talking about wales aw look it was rubbish merrily they decided it was all complete rubbish a joke what sort of threats were they please its important i have to refer these things up you know they have to be looked into once we got them translated the grammar wasnt even right apparently i cant tell you any more ok thanks im sorry ill be in touch merrily said going up the list from the bottom as she clicked off crowley de molay mat phobe printing that last one out again separating the letters mat phobe then in slight disbelief she began to pick out individual letters writing them down in a different order very lightly so that it was almost a ghost of a word as if she couldnt bear to give it more solidity baphomet contex too early to panic it couldnt happen not on a mild autumnal wednesday afternoon in tanworthinarden in middle england and he must have done this a couple of times before distinctly remembering leaving his car in a particular place when it was actually somewhere else it had definitely happened before if never with nearly four thousand pounds worth of kit in the back not including the boswell guitar which was as close to priceless as anything hed ever possessed who was he trying to fool lol stood in the road in the empty space between two vividly greengold beech trees standing exactly where he remembered parking the truck and parking it not too confidently because the animal was so much longer than his old car but it had been a strange unpredictable day he needed to check and doublecheck before reporting it to the police damn damn damn the sky was clouding over the sun hazed like a smear of butter on white bread and hed begun numbly retracing his steps to the churchyard when his mobile played the riff from heavy medication day when he opened up the phone a phone number he didnt recognize appeared in the screen a male voice he didnt recognize either robinson yes try the pub car park lol said whos that there was no answer lol said listen there wasnt going to be an answer this was the time of no reply he began to breathe hard that sense of dislocation again he turned around and the pub was directly opposite he didnt move realizing he could actually see the truck from here silver blue centrally parked a man in a suit with a briefcase under one arm came out of the pub and bleeped open a bmw nobody else was about lol approached the animal slowly walking all around it from a distance until he was sure there was nobody sitting in it clutching his keys very much afraid that he wasnt going to need them not to open the drivers door anyway nor as it turned out the rolltop that gomer and danny thomas had fitted onto the box now bunched up at the end like an accordion there was a gap at the tailgate where the lock had been prised when lol pushed it it jammed halfway but that was enough for him to read the message you wont be needing this any more trust me the lettering was black and ragged it had been wireburned into the lightly polished face of the boswell guitar which lay in its rigid velvetlined case like a childs body in an open coffin the hinged top of the case had been bent back snapped strings writhing in the air where the boswells neck had been broken on the square the shadow of the medieval market hall had lengthened over the grey lexus in other circumstances you could almost start to worry about what might have happened to the driver it was nearly four pm and merrily realized she hadnt eaten today at all not good but still wasnt hungry in her mind the candle was burning between the horns of the hermaphrodite goat and would not go out this is the fourth time you been out yere vicar she spun round and the candle flame seemed to waver someing on your mind i reckon gomer parry said not that i been spying just doing a bit o tidying round the churchyard collecting the ole windfalls kind o thing sorry gomer im you ent bin around these past two days vicar no i meant to tell you it was all done in a bit of a rush shed thought perhaps he was slowing down pottering around the village more leaving the big digger jobs to danny but he looked bright enough his bottle glasses full of light his white hair projecting like the bristles on a yard brush ciggy tin poking out of the top pocket of his old tweed jacket no problem i seen janey and her explained id come out a time or two see if i could spot you thing is vicar you got a minute gomer took her arm and nodded towards the market hall and they moved between two oak pillars whatever it was she didnt really have time for it but this was gomer parry thing is vicar last time we was talking i wasnt exacly straight with you that had to be a first this man was embarrassingly straight im sorry been a bit preoccupied what are we talking about here gomer you asked me about a particlar woman oh and i was kinder talking all round the subject if you recalls well i didnt really which was wrong things between us that ent how its ever been no what i shouldve said see was theres stuff i could tell you tell you that shouldnt ever be repeated to nobody on account of theres some things what on the surface is a bit your job youd most likely have to say sinful not really one of my words but never mind but it ent not really not in the how can i put this not in the circumstances in which these things is being looked at kind o thing not in the context of a particular situation contex thats the word vicar in this yere contex sin is relative exacly and the context is garway vicar garway is its own contex theres hereford and theres wales and theres garway and garways its own contex gomer i just want to say you dont have to tell me everything i mean im not i knows that vicar however as it happens a situation has arisen where the more i know about the particular woman you were referring to the more i might actually be able to help her that a fact so frankly any dirt you have on mrs morningwood im up for it basically gomer nodded plucked the ciggy tin from his pocket this qualify as a public place vicar under the law as theres no actual market on at the moment i dont really know merrily pulled out the silk cut and the lighter an old rage pulsing through her at the attempted management of peoples lives the negation of godgiven free will but who gives a shit go on this person i think i tole you this person helps farmers kind o thing with tax problems and defra forms defra thats a war them bastards vicar but that ent really the issue in hand and it ent only farmers and it ent hexclusively garway like for instance you met my ole friend jumbo humphries talgarth merrily recalled a man the size of a double pillar box who ran a garage and animalfeed operation up towards brecon while doubling as a private inquiry agent now jumbo when his wife walked out and this is confidential vicar goes without saying jumbo was lonely you know what im sayin not that he dint have no offers but the kinder women making the offers they had an eye to the business which is worth a quid or two what i mean is not jumbo they wasnt looking at jumbo not even in the dark and he knowed it its sad gomer merrily lit his rollup stepping back as a bus pulled in with a hiss of brakes but it happens so this person over at garway this person we been discussing it was this person got jumbo through a bad patch fixed him up with his michelle oh i see she looked at gomer his glasses opaque she was thinking not a thaibride situation do i see no gomer said likely not first siân then robbie williams getting home half an hour earlier than usual jane was as unhappy and confused as when shed left this morning life in flux nobody you could count on siân it had been encouraging in a way all that about holding mum in high esteem treating shirleys crap with the level of respect it deserved it had seemed encouraging but it could be a screen couldnt it you couldnt trust people in the church because the church was in flux too a time of rapid change everybody grabbing what they could that was the trouble with the present it was always in motion and if you let yourself get dragged in you could be pulled to pieces the past was different you could get a feel for the past jane looked around at the black and white village settling in for the dusk the first lights kindling way back inside the black swan the sense of an ancient heart you could stand here on these cobbles at dawn and dusk particularly and feel part of something at the deepest level this was most apparent when she was in colemans meadow on the prehistoric trackway to the top of cole hill in the meadow where gomers jcb had as if this was meant uncovered the first stone eight to ten feet long awesome finding the stones fighting for the stones had grounded her in a way she hadnt thought possible but now she was expected to break it the system said she must go away next year to college develop around herself a new kind of life with all the bureaucracy involved it was even likely she wouldnt be here when if the old stones were raised again ancient signposts to a mystical communion with the planet as above so below shed wanted to talk about this with robbie williams again discuss what shed gathered from the internet as a result of his suggestion about the real identity of the garway green man if that is baphomet is he guarding the altar or is he drawing attention away from it history had been the last period before lunch and shed hung round as robbie packed his notes into his briefcase but hed looked up with a faintly worried expression in his eyes ah jane in a bit of a hurry today unfortunately this is just a quick question mr williams its basically about what happened to the templar tradition after the order was dissolved ive been reading about eliphas levi and baphomet and he was french what i was really interested in was what happened here jane robbie had come to his feet buttoning his jacket over his beer gut i need to make something clear while one can only applaud your interest in the fringe issues of history this is not part of the syllabus i never thought it was jane said its far too interesting however i get paid and not as well as id like to be to improve this schools reputation as an alevel factory its not about knowledge any more jane its about results and statistics thats a pretty cynical attitude mr williams if you dont mind me saying so jane if you were as close to blessed retirement as i am having seen all that ive seen but like i thought you were interested in garway church and everything you seemed interested the other day well all im interested in at the moment robbie said is my lunch and if you want to make the best use of your time here i would suggest you pay more attention to the syllabus because your essay on charlemagne was skimpy to say the least he swung his briefcase from the desk thank you jane it made no sense it was like hed become a different person shed never ask him anything again it was like there was suddenly nobody she could count on mum was working away and lol was out there making a career which if it continued to build would take him out of the village for months at a time lol and mum maybe their relationship had only worked when one of them was a loser and then there was eirion shed chosen to end that before he did because the writing was on the wall anyway one way or another all the foundations were cracking and jane had spent the whole afternoon in a state of increasing isolation until with the last period free she couldnt stand it any more shed walked out of the school and caught a bus into leominster strolled around the town in a futile kind of way shrouded in gloom before grabbing the chance of a bus to ledwardine she shouldered her airline bag and tramped wearily across the cobbles and oh the volvo was parked in the vicarage drive the way her heart leapt well you despised yourself really i missed you mummy god jane folded up her smile buried it deep as she walked into the drive inside the vicarage a dog barked when she fitted her key into the front door inside the hall she recoiled at the sight of the woman in the kitchen doorway with her hand on the head of the wolfhound like britannia or something from an antique coin only made more sinister by the dark glasses the dark green fleece zipped all the way up the crust of foundation cream and the ruin of a smile which when you looked hard wasnt a smile at all you dont tell her where you got this mind gomer said hers gonner have a bit of an idea where it come from nodding at her sweatshirt where it said gomer parry plant hire i think merrily said that i need to persuade her to tell me may have to use you as a threat but no way have we spoken gomer this i dont know what to say this fills out so many gaps in my meagre knowledge just need to have a walk around for a while to think it all out work out how to approach it good luck vicar gomer squeezed out the end of his rollup fanned the air he hadnt asked about her own involvement with mrs morningwood hed know shed have told him if she could they came out of the market hall from separate sides in this village you could never be too careful merrily leaned against one of the pillars for a few moments gazing out towards ledwardine fine arts and the eight till late information overload she didnt know where to start but once again circumstance decided when siân came out of the eight till late in her black belted coat with the collar up an evening paper under her arm merrily walked out siân she said something you forgot shadow in the lounge bar at the black swan they ended up at the corner table where merrily had sat with lol the night shed met adam eastgate seemed like weeks ago merrily made a point of buying the drinks coffees and a cheese sandwich still not hungry but this was no time to be lightheaded unfinished business siân said hate to leave loose ends luckily she was out who shirley west i expect janes told you i havent spoken to jane shes at school youve been to see shirley west well get to that have your sandwich merrily you look as if you need it thats taken you all day not only that although it did swallow several hours tell me merrily are you on a fixedterm contract here five years why what about deliverance no contract at all i just do it i think youve been rather remiss there well i merrily put down the sandwich barely nibbled you dont think about these things do you i do but then i was a lawyer for over twenty years siân had unbuttoned her coat underneath she was in civvies navy skirt pale blue sweater looking almost uncomfortable in them and merrily realized how similar apart from the wig clerical clothing was to what a barrister wore in court someone wants to get me out she looked steadily at siân who shrugged wherever you are theres always someone who wants to get you out but since you ask when your contract comes up for renewal its quite likely the terms will have altered extra parishes thats the most likely and if you dont play ball the contract doesnt get renewed doesnt happen often but it happens how much have you had to do with mervyn neale the archdeacon not much at all its been mainly the bishop as you know which might partly account for it im sorry mervyn doesnt like you merrily he hardly knows me perhaps siân sipped her coffee he simply dislikes what you represent which couldnt be womankind without the female clergy this diocese would be in trouble merrily bit off another corner of her sandwich neales a traditionalist siân said he doesnt on the surface object to the womens ministry but he does expect us to keep a low profile what like you have well yes he was quite angry when it was suggested that i should shadow him for a month with a view to possibly succeeding him when he retires thats on the cards is it i hope so i think its something i could do mmm i think it probably is because im a ruthless ambitious bitch presumably merrily leaned her head back against the oak panelling shook her head smiling faintly and you thought gomer parry was direct you dont like me you dont trust me siân said siân its not that i dont like you merrily rolled her head against the panelling oh god you know what the problem is with shirley west dont you sure she thinks im some kind of chainsmoking punk priest who dabbles on the fringes of the occult well that too but what it really comes down to is her exhusband being distantly related to the man often said to be britains most appalling serial murderer ever merrily sat up spilling her coffee fred west a sexual predator and of course a herefordshire man shirley told you this how youve only been here a couple of days do calm down merrily im not trying to take over your parish i met shirley west jane will tell you i met her in the church last night youd hardly left before i had a phone call from shirley asking to meet me jane protecting your interests eavesdropped on our meeting jane is well how many teenage daughters would even spare the time shes a good girl merrily i know shirley was desperately eager to tell me about the evil to which you were exposing your sundayevening meditation group among other things she made a bit of a scene on sunday night i didnt handle it very well wasnt feeling too good actually no you didnt look at all well when you left for garway still i shouldve made time to talk to her if you made time for everybody you wouldnt sleep however as i explained to jane i was rather concerned that shirley might be causing mischief where you really didnt need it so when you liberated me this morning i decided to drop in on her on that estate off new barn lane not thinking shed be at work her sisterinlaw saw me and came out and i identified myself and she invited me in for a cup of tea and i was there nearly three hours her sisterinlaw joanna i think ive met her once joanna harvey she doesnt come to church and in her place i suspect id probably stay away as well or attend another one miles away shirley moved here after her divorce to be near her older brother colin after just a few months of shirley as a neighbour joannas at the end of her tether desperately wants to move just to get away from her but colin feels a certain family responsibility all the things i ought to know shirley had been married seven years before discovering at a party that the late frederick west had been some sort of distant cousin to her husband who hadnt bothered to tell her doubtless suspecting the effect it might have an effect evidently worsened by the way shirley found out and the thoughtless jokes about what might be under the concrete patio that colin had made it preyed on her mind becoming an obsession she came to believe that her husband was tainted by evil that evil hung over the family for a shortish man fred west had thrown a long shadow merrily said his brother john was facing a rape charge when he hanged himself exactly the way fred had other members of the family have suffered emotional damage with predictable effects on their domestic situations but there are dozens of perfectly normal wellbalanced wests its clear that shirley herself has psychiatric problems though not immediately clear to me apparently merrily said she moved into a separate bedroom from her husband accusing him of unnatural sexual behaviour he worked still works presumably for a feed dealer making deliveries to farms and she accused him of having a relationship with two sisters who had a smallholding entirely unfounded according to joanna theres more but you get the idea oh god she washes her clothes compulsively she doesnt watch television and she doesnt read newspapers because of the filth they transmit she began going to church for the first time since childhood about four years ago obsessively she joined christian internet chat groups particularly in america before moving here she used to attend services at leominster priory where she attached herself to a curate tom dover i knew him slightly he moved on and faster than he might have normally shirley would insist on doing his washing washing his vestments in particular hes still a curate near swindon i called him on my mobile about an hour ago he said he felt guilty ought to have told someone about shirley but shes a professional woman branch manager at a bank where according to joanna harvey she frequently offers unsought moral and spiritual advice to customers having kept her married name as a sort of penance you really should be more careful merrily especially after your problem some time ago with jenny driscoll as i suggested to jane this is not an uncommon situation particularly for women priests i realize that what do you suggest she needs guidance not someone like our friend nigel saltash but i do know a person a psychiatric nurse and a churchgoer who i would have suggested as suitable for your deliverance team if i didnt think youd be suspicious of anyone proposed by me merrily sighed siân and yes after saltash i can accept that one reason why i elected to be your locum if i do become archdeacon id hate us to start on the wrong foot due to misconceptions i accept we have theological differences but i respect what youve achieved against the odds siân i merrily found shed finished both her cheese sandwich and her coffee she felt like a real drink i dont know what to say any more no need to say anything at all siân said because i havent finished yet siân had been the archdeacons shadow for a month learning the ropes learning many things you know hes a freemason no i didnt on the edge of a minefield here it had often seemed to merrily that paranoia about masonic influence was exaggerated shed never had any problems never really had cause to notice the masons although she was aware there were some in the church besides it was in decline wasnt it all the existing masons getting on in years very little new blood freemasons claim to be christian siân said although you would be hardpressed to find within masonic dogma any recognition of christ theres a very interesting book by a former vicar of new radnor whod become a mason in he maintains all innocence and began to find it alarmingly incompatible have you read that no ill send you a copy making my own position on this quite clear from the outset as a barrister i came up against it time and time again i made a point of learning the masonic signals so that i could spot them in court youd be surprised how often i saw them directed towards the bench from the dock and i still believe its one of the best arguments we have for more women judges and women archdeacons siân didnt smile and women bishops she said the bar noise meshed into white noise the lights receding into a single point of light merrily pushed her plate to one side her coffee cup to the other what are you saying siân even siân looked around at the handful of customers merrily spotted a couple of farmers she knew slightly and james bulldavies former army officer ok surely the position of bernard dunmore is an ambivalent one siân said he was a freemason many years ago like a number of clergy he apparently became aware of an incompatibility and hasnt had anything to do with the craft in years but hes never actually renounced masonry and as far as i can tell i dont think hes ever formally left how do you know this i think youll just have to accept that i do call it a nervous hangover from my years at the bar and what does it mean i wasnt sure it meant anything in his allocation of livings the bishop appears to have been fairness itself doesnt seem to have been unduly influenced by mervyn neale although obviously reliant to some extent on his organizational recommendations and the archdeacon nothing i can prove although perhaps i will one day he doesnt like you doesnt like deliverance as a ministry and he doesnt like the way you handle it the way youve widened the brief i dont think what have i said this morning the bishop told me id displayed a tendency to go beyond the brief like theyre all saying the same things i do know hes had a number of meetings with the archdeacon in the past few days far more contact than in any of the weeks since ive been shadowing neale we unleashed you and now were reining you in youre fully aware of what ive been working on in garway i think so and i think it might well be relevant your attitude on the phone this morning was rather extraordinary i was in a state of shock evidently it made me wonder what on earth the bishop had said to you he it all began to tumble forward the rape the coverup the desperate need to tell somebody just to stay sane she held it back all the same you dont have to tell me siân said he trotted out the usual stuff about the dangers of deliverance being connected with yet another murder which is valid enough but then he said the duchy of cornwall also wanted me to forget it i rang the duchy hed lied why would he do that i dont know he might simply have developed cold feet are you going to do what he says erm merrily sat back siân this might be a naive question but if you were to expose mervyn neale as having used masonic influence in the course of his executive work in the diocese how would that affect your chances of getting his job thats a very interesting point siân smiled mouth only i imagine i could say goodbye to the job even if the church wanted to make a point of distancing itself from freemasonry appointing me in the wake of a scandal even if it were only an internal one might be seen as a step too far its still a conservative organization but youd still do it if you had the evidence first and foremost im a christian siân said of course id do it are you going along with what the bishop wants no then youll need support siân said or you could very soon find youve become a very small footnote in ecclesiastical history huw owen said much the same interesting siân looked at her watch frowned and rose to her feet you trust him dont you i used to trust the bishop its a slippery slope merrily letting trust slip away you lose some you win some yes i suppose you do siân picked up her bag the kind of doctors bag that exorcists were often assumed to carry when we get outside however id really rather you didnt hug me merrily smiled but get help siân said i implore you the morningwood heritage ive been telling jane about my car accident mrs morningwood said quite softly looking at merrily and how you came to my rescue mmm merrily frowned sometimes people just happen to be in the right place at the right time jane and mrs morningwood were on the sofa roscoe stretched across both their knees ethel the cat watching warily from the edge of the hearth where the fire glowed red and orange through a collapsing scaffold of coal and logs merrily wondered how to get rid of jane and other stuff jane said you thought much about the significance of the number nine mum john lennon always liked it revolution nine number nine dream jane i wonder if in the garway context the nine witches of garway why nine its three squared the trinity and the sacred number of the druids but the point is the number nine was also a sacred number of the templars when they first started out in jerusalem there were supposed to have been nine of them which when you think about it is ridiculous nine knights to protect all the pilgrims in the holy land maybe it was just the nine senior knights with a lot of armed underlings nah symbolic gotta be also get this nine templars were required to form a commandery like at garway plus the order was in existence for years which like one plus eight equals nine sometimes jane i think that without the internet the world would be a happier and less confusing place ok ill skip some of the other examples and cut to the chase the burning of jacques de molay he died on march one and eight in the year one three one four do the math as they say its intriguing jane however and how long did he take to die nine minutes hours actually ouch and all this means its to do with cosmic correspondences as above so below you dont actually know do you well no but if you put it all together its like the landscape and the community of garway was being primed for some sacred purpose the number and the symbols that keep recurring the astrological pubs you could probably go into the church and find the numbers nine and three of course reflected in all kinds of architectural features they were like building something into the landscape like just bear it in mind nine witches nine original templars maybe youre looking at the need for there always to be nine people in the know nine people preserving the tradition merrily said have either of you eaten we were waiting for you mum do you want me to make something i know were trying to stop doing this flower but why dont you pop over to the chip shop its peak time therell be a queue a mile long chips mrs morningwood said yes i think i should quite like some chips it was fully dark now the light came from the fire and just one reading lamp quiet light merrily sat down in the armchair opposite mrs morningwood whod removed her sunglasses how do you feel now im sore what would you expect im sorry but rested thank you i may go home tomorrow we can talk about that later erm ive been finding out some background my friend lol has been to see lord stourport has he indeed which means i can now tell you quite a bit about the days before the police raid on the master house only its its a bit of a oneway street at the moment isnt it muriel dont call me muriel hate it sounds like a bloody librarian ive had some background on you too merrily said hard to avoid it really mrs morningwood shook her head gently even this was clearly painful just been talking to an old friend of mine merrily said in a community this centralized watkins it would be surprising if you hadnt we didnt talk much about you but we could have who was this mrs morningwoods gaze was on the sweatshirt as if i couldnt guess this friend i think he knows a lot more about you than he felt able to tell me so go back and ask him you dont think hed tell me you can try and you know i think i could probably persuade him to tell you what you think theres some big secret im the popes secret lovechild the thing is merrily said i dont want him to have to tell me i dont want him to feel hes betrayed you i dont know what youre talking about and i dont think you do either although i do think he would tell me im just trying to convey to you that im merrily held up a thumb and finger minimally apart that close watkins this is not about betraying me the first time we met you took a phone call from a mr hinton i dont remember you were obtaining something for him at first putting this together from what i heard i thought maybe you were fixing up thai brides for lonely farmers doing the paperwork mrs morningwood laughed then i heard about what your mother did on the side and there was something that lord stourport said to lol about country girls country girls mrs morningwood sniffed she was livid about that do you know how much they were paid well i suppose it wouldnt sound very much in todays money but then absolute fortune rural wages were a complete joke even then farm labour one up from slave labour and ordinary people would need two or three jobs to get by many still do of course as you know ironically its largely the farmers themselves now tragic these were your mothers girls were it all rather fell apart after that i had to laugh shed been ripping those girls off for years and my grandmother before her the morningwood heritage how far does it go back thats it really two generations before that i imagine they were witches lived in a tiny little place over towards the white rocks i think its a sheep shed now but you see watkins it was part of the rural culture a necessary part of the culture were talking about abortions and the rest my grandmother who never married raised three daughters on the profits of what basically was prostitution she was doing it herself merrily trying for surprise but once you knew you knew and then as she got older began pimping for youngsters trying to earn enough money to make something of their lives it was like mrs morningwoods mouth twisted at the thought and her lip began to bleed again almost a gap year for some of them before they left the area went to college got themselves good jobs strong independent young women whod learned how to handle men can i get you something for that lip wont die watkins and when i say handle men that was all it amounted to in most cases you make it sound like an essential social service which i suppose well isnt it still mrs morningwood sighed a shift in terminology for the new millennium sex therapist specializing in rural needs as a teenager shed grown despicably she said to despise her mother shed gone to london to work as a secretary for a theatrical agent loose term very loose had ended up working on what she described as adult magazines very adult all very enlightening and destined to alter her opinion of her mother and her grandmother got married not for long had been single again when the letter from mary roberts had finally reached her so was mary not up to the time i left eric davies that was a respectable job but afterwards perhaps inevitably she made friends with the other girls how many girls were there at the time three i think a very informal arrangement by then my mother really was more of a herbalist and the demand for herbs was increasing from middleclass people by then able to pay more alternative health becoming quite an industry she was still furious though when two of the girls took the stourport shilling and mary my mother always claimed she didnt know about that until it was too late i would have thought maybe she wouldve offered to get rid of marys baby oh no shed stopped doing that no she was still doing it she simply wouldnt tamper with a foetus conceived at the master house call it superstition im not getting this it doesnt matter it doesnt change anything but the tradition that didnt end it altered my mother became ill i nursed her over the final weeks all over very quickly as it always used to be before the medical profession became part of the drug culture during that time i fielded seven phone calls from hesitant men two of whom i felt so sorry for that i well what was i supposed to do a warm heart under that bluff exterior you cant embarrass me watkins rural needs are essentially different to urban needs no vergecrawling in the land rover extreme discretion is crucial and theres a certain mutual respect wasnt going to dress up mind take me as you find me literally god youre prurient it was nothing where i couldnt pretend i was milking a cow so mr hinton the other day all sorted safely delivered delia i think hes called her its not a major enterprise or anything i think ive supplied seven in two years a comfort for mildmannered chaps lacking in social skills in one case because of the cost one was shared between two brothers i see do i delia she and her sisters the point about them is that theyre not impossibly beautiful they dont pout theyre not hollywood the fantasy in these parts its the girl in the tshirt behind the counter at hay and brecon farmers you know what i mean sometimes the outlet i deal with ive actually provided them with photographs to work from from the local papers jumbos michelle he really loves her see gomer had said wouldnt swap her for a top o the range quad bike had her reconditioned twice jumbo weighs seventeen stone mind mum janes head came round the door you going to have them by the fire or what no i think well come into the kitchen flower if you want to get some plates down ok rubber dolls merrily said inflatable girlfriends thats why you wont go to the police how could i mrs morningwood easing roscoes head from her lap seriously how could i all right its mainly the inflatables now nothing illegal there but theyd start excavating i think you could handle it the identity of rape victims oh dont be ridiculous this is garway hill besides even if they believed me after they discovered what they would very quickly discover it isnt just me is it youre worried about the clients it would be like a bomb under the hill dont get me wrong watkins i dont fear personal exposure but the handful of shy vulnerable men throughout south herefordshire monmouthshire the black mountains whose private lives would be taken apart whod would be subjected to the most degrading ok i understand and as they went through to the kitchen she finally did understand she was asking for it of course been asking for it for years the old slag generations even besides mrs morningwood murmured in the hall what he intended was to kill me dont you think past rising obviously jane knew there was something she wasnt party to at one stage washing the dishes she looked at mrs morningwood and then tentatively grinned at merrily i hope siân was still here when you got back erm no shed gone pity i was only explaining to her why it was so essential we should have a big vicarage like because of the you know damaged people you had to bring back sometimes sheepish smile for mrs morningwood sorry damaged mrs morningwood said tonelessly and yet somehow still alive and perhaps sensing the need for a mother and daughter to talk in private she went off quite unsteadily merrily noticed still worried to the bathroom mum jane said when shed gone theres something i have to tell you about and its not going to shirley west oh siân told me as an example presumably of why your daughter would be unlikely to make it as a private eye that was the encouraging bit im now going to tell you the rest in absolute confidence just sit down for a minute even summarized the story of shirleys obsession made a sad sense more than twelve years since fred west had hanged himself while awaiting trial a core of unexplained evil still hung in the air like an invisible planet shirleys story was not so ridiculous might not even be an illness well jane said im quite glad shes certifiably insane i mean it helps doesnt it thats typically selfless of you flower so you know what will you do about her i think siâns going to handle it herself with some psychiatric support makes sense for me not to be involved i think siân was proving something to me she didnt need to do that yeah shes not quite what i imagined from my comprehensive character assassination shes made me feel a little wanting in the generosityofspirit department maybe shes changed or maybe shes just seen another side of you this kid was getting so smart she could scare you sometimes merrily sighed she has principles moral fibre she tapped a teaspoon against an open palm perhaps its time i got some along with five more parishes yeah well who knows jane look go and hang around in the hall will you in case mrs morningwood needs any help at the door jane looked over her shoulder she wasnt in a car crash was she i wasnt there huh look i need to make a phone call and it might take a while youll have to talk among yourselves numerology renaissance cosmology in the scullery the sermon pad was still open to the word b a p h o m e t she tore off the page and screwed it up very tight looked at the mobile and then why fry your brains for these bastards picked up the big black bakelite receiver i need some help she told huw owen badly sycharth mrs morningwood smiled thinly i ought to have known how would you merrily said hed want to keep it very quiet that hed been spending quality time at the old family home certainly wouldnt want the grays to know or would he newtons still the newtons then sorry yes the newtons the fire was burning low jane had taken roscoe for a walk with a clothes line doubled up through his collar and a homemade poopscoop dogshit watch smoking watch ledwardine heart of the new cotswolds had them all now and they never slept getting a foot inside the ancient portal mrs morningwood had a cigarette and a glass of neat brandy that alone would make it worthwhile to sycharth other obvious attractions of course nubile young things bathing naked in the monnow wouldve taken a youth with more willpower than suckarse to look the other way this would be the girlfriends before they left wouldve been the time when sycharths father gruffydd keen as ever to shaft the newtons was apparently complaining to the parish council about lord stourports habit of biking around the lanes stark bollock naked except for a pair of doc martens you ever meet stourport ive told you i wasnt there you knew sycharth though when you and he were young he made a play for me once at a barn dance i was almost tempted to go out with him he had an old triumph spitfire yellow passed his test on his seventeenth birthday it used to roar sexily up and down the lanes i always liked speed a moist sadness came into muriel morningwoods bruised eyes days of innocence yeah sure long time on the phone watkins i was consulting a colleague didnt want to miss anything out dont look at me like that its a priest a proper priest nothing gets out mrs morningwood drank some brandy tell me what were they doing apart from taking drugs and shagging do hate the way another generation has appropriated the word shag as if they invented it why cant they they come up with one of their own sorry im rambling again i dont think i want to know what they did to mary roberts not in this state didnt you ask any of the other girls who were involved as far as i know there were only two my mother wouldnt have anything to do with them again i tried to talk to one about it she just walked away too well paid theyve both left the area now i dont think either of them was there at the end you should get to suckarse before he has time to fabricate a story you ever hear of a man calling himself mat phobe never whos he it was all apparently stagemanaged by this man he seems to have decided there was some kind of templar treasure hidden at the master house never heard of that mat phobe its an anagram of baphomet the sacred head also the name adopted by the occultist aleister crowley as leader of a templarbased outfit experimenting with the magical power of sex that what the knights templar did do you think they were more less accused of it werent they maybe riches led to decadence i can certainly see sycharth in ceremonial robes they seem to have tried some kind of mediumistic thing to put him in touch with his ancestors the welsh princes he claimed apparently his ancestors were sheepshaggers people keep saying he doesnt speak welsh merrily said is he likely to know any welsh at all shouldnt think so wasnt compulsory at school when sycharth was a boy not in an anglicized area like monmouth his son would have to learn it i expect cynllaith how olds he fifteen or sixteen cynllaith whats that mean could be something to do with milk llaith or more sinister according to my dictionary battle or slaughter youre kidding pretentions to warrior status these sex rituals was that just an excuse was for lord stourport but in the course of it mrs morningwoods voice hardening one of them seems to have impregnated mary roberts thats how it looks and was therefore fuchsias father yes merrily heard the phone ringing let it ring ive thought of that suppose its sycharth were unlikely ever to know but does he and if that child was born as a result of some degenerate ritual watkins what might the effects of that be im asking you as a priest as a priest i dont really have an answer merrily stared into the fire looking at it psychologically i would think that would depend on whether she knew about it wouldnt you if she knew might she think of herself as inherently soiled and corrupt because of the circumstances of her conception its possible and did she know do you think it would explain some things wouldnt it but if she knew of her own connection with the master house before felix tendered for the job why did she go along with it then throw a wobbly what was she like when you first met her inquisitive lots of questions not spooked at that stage no suggestion of it this wouldve been their first visit and they were both fired up with the idea of restoring the house in a sympathetic way she wanted to know what i could remember about it the atmosphere the colours of the walls hard for me to recall what she asked in much detail because of course i knew at once who she must be and it had as we used to say rather blown my mind you definitely didnt say anything to her about that or give any indication i mean if she saw you looking shocked i dont give anything away unless i want to suppose fuchsia really didnt know about mary and the master house until she actually came here something happened to make her go dashing into the church demanding a blessing and spiritual sanctuary from teddy murray who wouldve recommended a fivemile walk in the fresh air mrs morningwood said sourly if someone had already recognized the resemblance to mary the way you did and made fuchsia aware of it then the idea of the place being haunted something rising from under the dust sheets might have been her own way of externalizing her feelings or is that psychobabble the past rising up to haunt her and shes a devotee of m r james and perhaps shes learned that james went to garway where something happened to disturb him and all that goes into the emotional mix shes afraid shes carrying around something corrupt tainted she wants to be blessed purified what is this that is coming perhaps for the first time starting to question the fate of her mother mrs morningwood said did mary come back to garway after she wrote to me and i failed to respond was your friend able to find that out mmm i think so so they would have known about the baby sycharth and the other clowns i presume mrs morningwood was silent merrily heard jane coming in with roscoe big paws skidding on the flags in the kitchen sycharth would hardly have wanted a bastard child mrs morningwood said at last perhaps ill get to talk to him tomorrow but first i think you need to talk to the grays it was after midnight when merrily switched off the lamp in the parlour mrs morningwood had gone to her herbal bed taking the dog up with her jane had gone over an hour ago to her apartment in the attic merrily went through to the kitchen for the last time put some food down for ethel smoked half a cigarette and listened to the answering machine bleeping in the scullery eventually she stubbed out her cigarette went through and hit the button coming over lass ive things to clear in the morning so itll be midafternoon huw seemed about to hang up then came back the bloke who cleared you for the duchy nowt to worry about another silence questions drifting like steam in the scullerys sepia light there was a soft tapping at the window merrily turned sharply but dont go near dunmore yet huw said you did say it didnt matter what time lol said at the back door ive been back an hour but you were obviously busy why didnt you just come in theyd swapped keys months ago i thought id walk around for a bit maybe it was the light or the lateness but he looked washedout stripped down drained as sorrowful and weary as jesus in the light of the world that still hung in the hall do you want something to eat no thanks not hungry you sure im fine really come to bed then merrily said call it superstition she was at the farm by eightfortyfive not a problem roxanne reckoned shed been up since five a wiry woman early thirties in a dark blue fleece and a baseball cap over curly hair already greying at the front out by the gate with two sheepdogs when merrily drove in now in the kitchen clinking mugs scraping toast youve just missed paul hes taken the kids to school then hes got an appointment at the hospital which always puts him in a bad mood very wary of the drugs reckons your mate mrs morningwood does him more good the doctors humour him on that score and that makes him even madder what reflexology has it once a week now probably just as well he isnt here actually you talk to him about the gwilyms it takes him the rest of the day to calm down and he isnt even family the farmhouse was red brick and pebbledash with bay windows downstairs built to function two barns in front no name displayed the kitchen table was scrubbed pine the coffee as bitter as roxanne you know they brought foot and mouth into the valley in you know that do you way to get rid of all your stock clean up on the compensation well a lot of unscrupulous farmers did it but rarely anything so blatant he made no secret of it he wanted it he embraced foot and mouth you mean sycharth gwilym had his farm deliberately infected yeah but try to prove it well we did we told the press but the press wouldnt use it hes a big man now sycharth the king of hereford most of his moneys in property and he wanted his stock gone and he grabbed the opportunity and sod the rest of us we had a lovely herd of herefords wiped out in an afternoon by the triggerhappy bastards from defra paul cried he stood out there and he cried i wouldnt give them the satisfaction im a newton i know what they are the gwilyms scum is what they are roxanne brought her coffee to the table snatched off her baseball cap adam put us in the picture about what youre doing ill be there never fear well it should be me im the newton no way paul should be put through that its not meant to be an ordeal merrily spread some honey on a halfslice of toast most people say they feel much better afterwards some people even she didnt like to mention the sense of healing an occasional side effect of a cleansing and not necessarily restricted to residents of the affected property but too many false dawns in this household you could tell im sorry roxanne said i didnt mean you sycharth gwilym always so considerate to paul opening doors laying ramps with a sneer on his face that he barely tries to conceal gives him a sick buzz or it did when he thought wed have to sell up and get out so yeah ill do it you can count on me ill stand shoulder to shoulder with adam eastgate and ill look sycharth in his shifty eyes and ill pray to god for anything that remains of the gwilyms to be eradicated from that house until the end of sodding time knows all the history that girl mrs morningwood had said when she came off the phone at seventhirty am but youll need to keep her on track all she really wants is to pour venom on the gwilyms was the venom deserved rage could be inherited the reasons for it long forgotten sinsofthefathers you know what this is about merrily said to roxanne some people refusing to work in the house poor bloke i showed him round the first time he came he was all right i thought but did that make any sense to you why people were scared just the one person i think maybe one more the darkness of the inglenook the crackle of bird bones the face she took a hit of the coffee possibly well i never lived there obviously roxanne crunched toast my parentsd been over here for some years when i was born so this is the only home ive ever known but i know my mother was glad to move out of the place you know why not really when i was a kid the times it was empty between tenants i always wanted to get inside it looked so mysterious like an old castle or something but it was always kept locked up and my mum told us it was dangerous i mean falling slates and stuff then it would be let again to some family people with horses once but they never stayed long i remember one couple the rogersons banging on the door one morning and the woman yelling you shouldve told us shouldve told us about it wed never have taken it you ever find out what had happened to them nope roxanne shook her head wasnt talked about in front of us kids any more than id talk about it in front of mine they didnt want to sell it no they didnt i suppose the farm was doing well and it was an asset also the master house is in the centre of the land and they didnt want to sell any land so thered be access to organize a road to put in rights of way and the gwilyms were always hovering theyd bought another farm the one sycharth has now and the master house was between us and them and even if wed sold it to someone else what was to stop them selling it on to the gwilyms whats to stop the duchy doing the same i dont think they would he doesnt give up on things the prince what ive heard i wouldnt really know was much said about what happened when it was leased to a commune that was before my time but ive heard there was a lot of drugs and wild parties oh and i also remember when i was little some chap with a big beard coming to the house saying he was researching a history of i think it mustve been the templars and could he have a look around the master house and my dad was quite rude he said no bugger off weve had enough of all that so you heard that they were into the templars the commune must have did you ever hear any stories about treasure what treasure being hidden at the master house treasure roxanne laughed pushing fingers through her curls if there was any suggestion of treasure at the master house you dont think wedve ripped the place apart to try and find it the only thing they ever found my dad used to say was a priests hole when he was a boy there was a lot of persecution of catholics around garway but that was completely empty so they blocked it up again what about the history generally you know much about that only that it used to be very important apparently when the newtons first came we have an old hang on ill show you wont be a minute roxanne put down her toast and got up brushing crumbs from her fleece vanishing through a door merrily looked out of the bay window it had been dark when she left and the early sun was still muffled she couldnt see any landmark that she recognized not the church nor the top of the hill with its radio mast certainly not the master house it was as if the newtons had sought out a spot without any prominent landscape features somewhere with no visible history when roxanne returned she was carried a wedge of dark wood a couple of feet long and a paperback book she put the book on the table and held the piece of wood up for merrily it was a plaque giltedged it said honour the master care for the customs roxanne leaned the plaque against the table my family when they moved in there was a maiden aunt who threw herself into researching the history weve still got a box of her papers we keep being told we ought to have it all published as a book but it would take a lot of work but this aunt aunt fliss said it was important for the family to realize that we hadnt just bought a farm wed taken on a very powerful piece of history that one day would come into its own what did she mean by that dont think she ever worked it out fully but it was obviously about the grand master of the templars people think its called the master house because it was the main farm but its because the grand master stayed here when he came to garway aunt fliss had had this thing made to put up over the fireplace so future generations wouldnt forget my mum and dad brought it with them when they moved out we still have it hung in the hall sentimental value i suppose but is there any actual evidence that de molay came to garway its here roxanne put the book in front of merrily knights templar and hospitaller in herefordshire by audrey tapper you read this one not had time to read anything much to be honest this has all happened very quickly well there you are roxanne opened out the book and flattened its spine this is the bit this is when edward ii started imprisoning english templars after they were closed down in france accused of all this heresy and stuff one of them was called john stoke whod only been a templar for about a year and he came to garway and he made this confession about what they made him do the account of it merrily read had come from the st john historical society presumably linked to the hospitallers who had taken over garway from the templars he was in garway during the visit there by grand master jacques de molay stokes deposition when the templars were arrested was that he had been called to the grand masters bedchamber at garway and in front of two other foreign knights he was asked to make proof of his obedience and to seat himself on a small stool at the foot of the grand masters bed so de molays bedchamber was that definitely at the master house thats what we were told roxanne said he was a bit of a boy wasnt he old jacques de molay then sent to the church for a crucifix and then two other templars placed themselves at either side of the door with their swords drawn stoke said that he was asked to deny him whom the image represents but he replied far be it for me to deny my saviour the grand master ordered him to do so otherwise he would be put in a sack and carried to a place by no means agreeable through fear of death he denied christ but with his tongue and not his heart makes you think doesnt it roxanne said i like that bit where the poor guys threatened with being put in a sack if he didnt renounce jesus christ toss him in the monnow you reckon or just the nearest slurry pit so i mean were the templars christians or were they into something a bit offcolour its interesting really wish i had time to go into it or the confession could be fabricated after the suppression of the templars it was easier to slag off jacques de molay than go into some dungeon thats what aunt fliss used to say apparently she said he was a good man but then who wants to think theyre living in the house where some psycho was holding court roxanne can i ask you i mean you probably wont have an answer to this under the circumstances but how do the gwilyms tie in i mean theyre supposed to have been in that house since the middle ages is that right so they say so are they claiming to be descended from the templars or what i dont know i mean yeah it was their house and they were pretty pissed off about losing it to us but i thought it was just about money and land but then ive never had anything to do with them i was being told not to from a very early age and then i learned the sort of things they did and what a shit sycharth was i mean theres got to be something hasnt there but hes clever when he learned about paul he was like look i know the fix youre in and why dont i take it off your hands oh yeah like i want my dad and my grandad turning in their graves you werent ever tempted no and he blew it anyway didnt he i mean yeah the master house was falling into ruins and nobody in their right mind was going to want to rent it now so the only option was to get rid of it and like when we had another approach six or seven months later from a chap in abergavenny we did start negotiations until we found out he was a proxy bidder for sycharth devious no more than youd expect then paul was reading about harewood park and all the property the duchy of cornwall was buying in herefordshire and we thought whats to lose so we took a lot of photos and printed up stuff on the history and posted it off couldnt really believe it when they went for it but well good things happen sometimes and it meant the gwilyms were stuffed so maybe old jacques was on our side getting de molay on your side merrily nodded at the plaque thats what this is about i mean the caring for customs bit you the newtons clearly went out of your way to observe local traditions the watch night not in my time roxanne put on a shudder thank god but there was always a feeling and i do feel that way myself sometimes that either a place is working for you or its working against you its very much a thing you get with farms and the master i wouldnt go that far but then were not in the house thats prince charless problem now did did mrs morningwood tell you about naomi newton i dont think so thought not thats the one she doesnt tell the lovely naomi she was the youngest sister of my greatgrandmother and of aunt fliss all daughters of john newton who bought the farm off mrs gwilym naomi she was the beauty well this was during world war one and there werent many men around all off getting killed in france except for madog gwilym cant remember how he avoided it running the farm or a clubfoot something they all had very distinguishedsounding welsh names didnt they pretentious gits anyway madog gwilym didnt go to war and he fancied his chances with naomi this was before the feud set in all the anger was on the gwilym side until this happened maybe madog suggested naomi owed him one for the way the newtons got the farm i dont know but he had a go and she wasnt having any and she actually called him a coward in public in church actually garway church before a congregation of mainly women praying for the boys at the front naomi newton publicly telling madog gwilym he wasnt a man imagine what did he say hes supposed tove walked out of the church in this absolute dead silence following day naomis out collecting the eggs and hes waiting for her and hes like ill show you whether im a man or not drags her into the trees and forces himself on her she was raped he denied it of course he said she was up for it well dont they always well no let me get this right neither of them said anything at the time naomi didnt tell anybody at first her brothers were at the war the only man around was her father john well over sixty by then and working day and night to hold the farm together and she knew what hed do if he found out and she was afraid for his health but then the worst happens finds out shes pregnant and she goes along on the quiet to the local woman who deals with eventualities like this would that have been mrs morningwood oh you know thats all right then her gran this would be she goes to mrs morningwoods grandmother for an abortion mrs morningwood obliges but it all went horribly wrong i dont know what happened but she got home and there was nobody in at the time and she began to you know haemorrhage oh god it wasnt like you could pick up a phone and call for an ambulance no whether she tried to you know sort it herself nobody quite knows but when my greatgrandmother came in with fliss they found naomi on the floor in the big room in a big pool of blood her life just ebbing away they hadnt even known she was pregnant theyre desperately trying to stop the bleeding and make her comfortable got a big fire going and somebody sent for mrs morningwood but of course it was too late mrs morningwood was stricken with remorse and my grandmother and fliss well mustve been shattered and furious they say mrs morningwood could never show her face at the master house again something clicked aunt fliss merrily said felicity newton thats right first time id seen a dead un face like the skin on a cold eggcustard she was ninetyeight when she died roxanne said whole village came to pay tribute they say she was a lovely old girl they laid her out where naomi had died in front of the inglenook and everybody came even the morningwoods id guess likely the first time any of themd been through that door since naomi died wasnt her fault mind she only tried to help but they say my greatgrandmother and aunt fliss could never sit in that room again without seeing naomi trying to raise herself up on an elbow you really want to know this gives me the creeps even now well i probably dont merrily said but on the other hand she simply wouldnt tamper with a foetus conceived at the master house call it superstition something else explained roxanne leaned on the shoulders of a dining chair yeah i know what youre saying something else to remember when you go in there with your bible and your holy water i was eighteen before my mother told me about it wish she hadnt bothered sometimes roxanne sat down and poured herself some more of the powerful coffee from the pot and told it quickly seems naomi sits up in the blankets blood all over her legs and the fire roaring behind her and she curses madog gwilym curses him in the name of the grand master jacques de molay kind of you know last breath before she lies down and dies oh yeah ironically the sun slid out in the southeast and filled the bay merrily said madog didnt last the year out roxanne said came out of one of the pubs one night the sun or the globe one or the other saying he didnt feel too well and collapsed stone dead at the side of the lane roxanne drank some coffee winced what a place this is a rough saw a whole summer had come and gone since merrily had seen him last his hair was still long and rough but more yellowwhite now like old bone his dog collar faded to the colour of parchment he likes the effect he has she thought one hand on the kettle one hand on the tap this combination of old hippie and victorian scholar hes very much aware of his image she hadnt been back from garway more than a few minutes before hed trudged in with his case a hand raised to merrily a nod to mrs morningwood before pulling out a chair and spreading papers and books over the refectory table like dealing hands of cards i thought you werent coming till this afternoon got someone to see at two might be a bit knackered after that merrily up far too late last night thanks to you sorry no consideration this lass leave that for now sit down here read this this is huw owen mrs morningwood huw oh aye huw looked up over his reading glasses mrs morningwood was wearing black jeans and another army sweater with shoulder patches her injuries looked like war wounds and if anything worse than last night one eye was halfclosed and weeping she wiped it with a tissue and put on her sunglasses ive got a sore shoulder huw said reckon you can do owt massage mr owen i were thinking summat in a pot that can be arranged ta outside it had started to rain out of a halfblue sky merrily accepted the pages of text huw was waving at her glimpsing a maltese cross before he grabbed them back save you some time and bullshit he turned over a couple of the sheets tapped a paragraph start there what is it its about how to become a knight templar huw said now or then for you never its a lads thing who comes here merrily read answer a pilgrim on his travels hearing of a knights templar encampment has come with a hope of being admitted this somebodys primary school project huw save the sarcasm over the page and read the bit ive marked merrily sat down under the heading obligation she read about the pilgrim having his staff and cross taken away in exchange for a sword placed in his hand by the grand commander after which he swore that he would never knowingly take the blood of a brother templar but espouse the brother templars cause knowing it to be just and if he failed oh dear may my skull be sawn asunder with a rough saw my brains taken out and put in a charger to be consumed by the scorching sun and my skull in another charger in commemoration of st john of jerusalem that first faithful soldier and martyr of our lord and saviour if ever i wilfully deviate from this my solemn obligation may my light be put out from among men as that of judas iscariot was for betraying his lord and master merrily sighed put down the papers masons masonic order of knights templar huw said but fear not only christians are admitted thats good to know its in the rules lass if youre going to have your skull sawn open and your brains fried best to have it done by a good christian thats what i always say merrily propped her elbows on the table chin falling into cupped hands huw im feeling tired already this is a big subject im a little woman i know nothing about freemasonry why ive come over lass im a man and i know a fair bit what she looked up does that mean no not that i havent been approached mind twice in fact since being ordained only since i were ordained despite all the disapproving noises and a number of critical reports theres still scores of clergy in the masons most of em at ground level not so many in the templars unless theyve got a private income cant pick up your surcoat and sword in asda they actually dress up like templars oh aye full bit costs an arm and a leg for a full templar kit but they get it back one way or t other so ive heard huw huw looked at her thin smile why do i need to know this are you telling me the bishop of hereford thatd be nice wouldnt it but sadly brother dunmore according to my information never progressed beyond basic craft masonry and hasnt been to a lodge meeting for a number of years although the buggers never formally resigned why would a man like bernie get into it in the first place happen his dad were in it thats how it usually happens fathers brothers family tradition what do they get out of it apart from contacts and favours allegedly get out what you put in most of em its a social club relaxed night out well relaxed after youve gone through the bit where they hold you at knifepoint for others its a spiritual journey sounds like a joke but for some it becomes just part of your life it is your life endless passageways lass leading to the light masonic light youre travelling towards enlightenment through knowledge gnosticism a prominent mason canon richard tydeman said famously that trying to describe the joys of masonry to an outsider was like trying to describe the joys of motherhood to a spinster how would he know suffice to say it brings a sense of order and direction and personal satisfaction to men who were just meandering along gives their lives a very clear focus whether this huw shook the papers mirrors any actual templar rituals well never know because the templars never wrote owt down but its become one of the most popular and soughtafter degrees in masonry read the next bit the sword is taken from the candidate and a skull placed in his hand furthermore may the soul that once inhabited this skull as the representative of john the baptist appear against me in the day of judgement whats that say to you lass baphomet mrs morningwood said and huw smiled at her and stretched his legs under the table hands behind his head one major theory is that baphomet translates as baptism the official start of a spiritual life the head in this context is therefore the head of john the baptist and some scholars are convinced thats what the templars venerated and thats the christian bit is it merrily said or the christian veneer borrow a biblical figure make him your own regular groundfloor masonry you only have to accept a supreme ruler of the universe whose name for the record is jahbulon which theyre not supposed to say outside the temple and which opponents of masonry say is a weird combination of christian and satanic principally jah for jehovah and baal the opponent or devil the methodists brought out a report in that reckoned the name jahbulon constituted the single biggest barrier to a true christian being a mason personally idve thought that threatening to saw open somebodys skull thats just the masonic templars your bogstandard craft mason merely accepts that if he gives owt away his tongue will be ripped out by the root and buried in the sand of the sea at lowwater mark oh well thats ok then merrily thought of the templar who claimed hed been brought before jacques de molay at garway and ordered to deny him whom the image represents or get himself put in a sack and dumped somewhere less than congenial huw was looking at her over his glasses the skull bit its quite likely the original templars swore a similar oath fightingmen in brutal times the idea of jahbulon is a total composite god three syllables note a trinity again in line with what many scholars accept as templar belief which was a cobbling together of christianity paganism judaism and islam i believe some of the templars were gnostics i think its likely that some did support the bloodlineofchrist theory and i think some of them were devoted to undermining christianity from within mrs morningwood got out her cigarettes mind if i aye please yourself huw said mr owen how many of these knights templar masons are there thousands in this country a proportion of them higher clergy and theyre here in herefordshire you could say that ok merrily sat up wheres this leading huw all roads lead to the cathedral but you knew that you had it from callaghanclarke she said the archdeacon was a mason mervyn neale is grand commander im told of the templar masons on an archdeacons screw you can afford the kit huw said oddball think about it huw said the oldest cult in the west he talked he was persuasive clouds had closed the skys one sunny opening like a cut healed over and the kitchen had gone grey merrily left the lamp off occult it meant hidden freemasonry was occult in every sense huw said a template for all the nineteenth and early twentieth century magical orders notably the golden dawn where crowley started and wb yeats the symbols the ceremonial all there but how much of basic masonry merrily asked him is actually based on the templars some masonic scholars would say the lot the temple of solomon all the architectural jargon god with a set square and protractors where did you find all this out general knowledge lass i mean about mervyn neale huw said that was fairly widely known too not as secretive as they used to be the masons not in much of a position to be now theyd been outed in popular books and most of the rituals were online taken huw all of twenty minutes to find and download the templar initiation ritual with the sword and the skull and the threat of sunburned brains the archdeacon merrily recalled was with the bishop at the duchy reception in hereford where adam eastgate first mentioned the problem with the master house mervs ears pricking up always been fascinated by garway the masons funny youve not run into the bugger up there huw looked at mrs morningwood where do you come into this lass lass mrs morningwood smiled wistfully how kind this sycharth gwilym on the square you reckon ticks all the right boxes i shouldve thought mr owen his particular business in a city like hereford still a lout of clout in hereford the masons huw said so im told cathedral tory council you going to see gwilym today merrily ill call the centurion again go this afternoon if hes free well have a quick chat before you go just go over them family names again sycharth gruffydd fychan madog aye thats a good one and merrily glanced at mrs morningwood cynllaith cynllaith huw said lovely people round there really dont know where all these names come from mrs m were inclined to suspect wales mrs morningwood said and huw smiled ill do a last check use your computer lass he stumped off into the scullery shutting the door and merrily turned to mrs morningwood people certainly seem to know about jacques de molay or they did naomi newton mrs morningwood took off her sunglasses and applied a tissue to an eye i suppose roxanne related that episode in all its gory detail well you certainly didnt better you heard it from them not my familys finest hour haunted my poor grandmother to her own dying day anything else youre keeping to yourself that might be relevant darling i have over half a centurys worth of knowledge who knows whats relevant huw was back within a few minutes nodding satisfied if you were worrying about the duchy of cornwall no need youre looking at the first generation of male royals not tied up with masonry duke of edinburgh he were one lasped now mind queens not eligible of course but her old man george vi he was well in and so it goes if charles broke the chain merrily said how does the masonic hierarchy feel about that aye well you mightve put your finger on summat there lass erm merrily shook out a silk cut in your message on the machine last night you talked about the feller who advised the duchy of cornwall that you wouldnt blab i think ive managed to contain my curiosity quite well huw looked at mrs morningwood who gathered up her cigarettes and matches i need to go and bathe my eyes she stood up roscoe stretching at her feet perhaps apply something foulsmelling to other abused areas nice dog huw said interesting woman he said when shed gone always been attracted to strong ladies when you get past a certain age mind almost all womankind develops a strange and sorrowful allure merrily sat back arms folded gazing at the ceiling all right huw said sorry for the anticlimax you were right first time well i couldnt say owt on the phone could i you bloody denied it no big deal anyroad im not an official consultant or owt like that just acknowledged as not linked to any of the factions in the church safe pair of ears in other words youve met him no never no need best not to really basically this is summat i inherited from dobbs no offence to you but he could never trust a woman and you werent around then anyroad essentially theres a handful of us jeavons is another ah canon llewellyn jeavons once tipped as the first black archbishop of canterbury until his wife died and he went strange becoming an expert on healing and deliverance with an email address book containing somali witch doctors and aboriginal songlinehoppers it figured it was decided that certain people close to the throne needed a bit of looking out for with regard to spiritual aspects of their lives and work this lad his hearts in the right place but he will keep putting his foot in it bma chauvinism and architectural carbuncles tip of the iceberg lass he gets frustrated and fires off letters to government ministers well fair enough i say an independent mind if a man thinks he can see the civilized world going down the pan and he wants to use whatever influence hes got to try and stop it im all for it but they dont like it far as the governments concerned the family ought to know its place which is on the sideboard strictly ornamental exactly you heard from that chippy little copper bliss yesterday got a feller on his back you said jonathan long aye slime like him see timesve changed used to be the spooks automatically supported royalty as an institution now theyre government animals servants of spin and if the government of the day should contain a number of people of shall we say republican instincts in key positions you know what im getting at go on for instance governments national and european dont like alternative medicine they like straight doctors drugs and drug companies they like gm foods and meat imports and they dont really give a shit for animal welfare or farmers for that matter huw stopped and looked at merrily merrily shrugged plus unless youre islamic and they cant decide whether to bang you up or kiss your arse this is now a secular country merlin the wizard he could be heading for the sideboard too and he knows it and yet despite what anybody says theres a great spiritual yearning out there just that the way some of its expressed doesnt please some of our more traditional colleagues merrily said and if some of these oddball spiritual pathways appear to have been trodden by the heir to the throne well not good news for the church but not necessarily bad news for the republicans use it to shaft him again eccentrics one thing bonkers summat else theres quite a body of opinion thinks this could turn out to be a good time to lose em dump the monarchy or stand well back and allow it to dump itself a lot of cynicism about the family right now whats your view expensive undemocratic and some on the fringes have been freeloading airheads but at the end of the day i suppose i feel happier that theyre there they represent something i feel kind of reassured to have around plus can you think of a contemporary politician you could stand to see as president happen youdve got on with dobbs better than either of you thought possible im guessing dobbs was closer to all this than you he knew laurens van der post for a start aye he did knew him way back and renewed the contact not long before his death see theres a lot of superstition around the monarchy and charleses havent been too lucky charles i executed very public human sacrifice charles ii had to hide in an oak tree thus becoming the green man you heard that one dont think so the head of charles ii peering through the foliage the green man to the life i suppose it is whats the significance a title which for different reasons of his own choosing could easily be applied to the future king charles iii but because charles is seen as an unhappy name for a king the word is hell adopt one of his other names and become king george vii which doesnt change things much as your green man in churches has also been associated with saint george but thats by the by huw arent we getting just a bit im giving you the folklore the mythology the superstition dobbs was a mystic he believed the monarchy good or bad strong or weak was preserving something fundamentally essential to the spiritual welfare of britain part of the soul of the nation if you like that if church and state were still in bed together nowt much would go wrong in the great scheme of things so charles suddenly announcing he wants to be defender of faiths plural weakens it at the wrong time dobbs thought thats where he and van der post fell out all that about all religions being the same dog washed that came from van der post i dont knock it merrily said if we can coexist aye in theory in practice it gets politicized and islam wants to run the show and thats where the templars came in the first fusion picking up islam from the saracens jewish mysticism egyptian mysteries happen some celtic paganism and goddessworship via the cistercians they were accused of undermining christianity from within and happen theres some truth in it a multifaith multinational building up massive wealth very very quickly undermining kings and popes and did they practise some kind of ritual magic it were said they used their knowledge of the socalled dark arts in warfare change the weather bring down mist create storms were never really going to know what they were about and you see van der post in the templar tradition in some ways mate of carl jung who was an admirer of the gnostics and can you find a better jungian archetype than the green man or the baphomet ah you can go on like this for ever huw started gathering up papers folk might well be asking why the duchys suddenly buying templar properties in herefordshire just the one surely no lets not forget the big project harewood park large estate with an old chapel in the middle granted to the knights templar in by king john upstairs roscoe started barking why dont i know these things merrily said and a satellite of garway as it happens could be pure coincidence but some folks might see a significance the masons for instance they dont like no longer having a foot under the throne if he appears to be into templarism theyre happen wondering if he might not be ripe for a new approach huw looked up how do lad lol had let himself in having slipped off home in the early hours merrily thought he still didnt look too happy for some reason he was insisting that when she went to see sycharth gwilym she shouldnt go alone let her squirm the word across hereford was that the centurion was already a gold mine converted out of a singlestorey derelict factory off roman road to the north of the city good access sweeping views plenty of parking and now that roman road had become the outlet for the network of new roads serving herefords secret bypass why youd almost think sycharth gwilym had learned something in advance merrily had been thinking about this and what it might imply but now suddenly she wasnt he did what sitting up hard the seat belt straining didnt seem a good time to tell you last night lol said for gods sake im not saying gwilym operates on the same level but maybe its as well to know the kind of people you just might be dealing with this merrily shutting her eyes is all my fault broken into the truck hotwired it driven it away and forced the box then used another kind of hot wire on the boswell she stared at lol an acid sensation in her chest knowing he hadnt gone to the police because that would have meant explanations same with the insurance its not your fault cant say prof didnt warn me about the kind of people he employed it was your most precious it was just a guitar four grands worth more than that a huge sentimental maybe lol admitted im going to call al boswell see how much it would cost for him to replace it merrily we dont even tell al boswell hed take it very personally and he isnt getting any younger and all his guitars are like children and neither of us has four grand to spare and even if we did bastard tears stinging her eyes plus hes giving you a clear warning that hes going to try and destroy your career what could he do independent producer independent label reliant on major distribution networks and chain stores sorry if this sounds like im getting drunk on conspiracy theory but you lol glanced sideways youre ok though mrs morningwoods offered to give me more reflexology tonight merrily leaned back trying to kill the tightness im fine much better so this is why you were insisting on coming with me ill stay in the truck when you go in but ill be just outside call you on the mobile after an hour how could they know the importance of the boswell look he sighed lets leave it for now but how it was in mojo someone showed me a copy at the gig concert review picture of me and what unmistakably to any musician is a boswell how did you manage at the gig still had the takamine which they hadnt damaged you said do it for nick so i did he was sitting at the back he didnt walk out lol kidding i think but it went well strangely it did i felt very tired afterwards slept for half an hour in the car park with the top of the box held down with bailer twine look be careful in there none of this smells good stourport gwilym mat phobe shed told him about the anagram of course we only have hayters word that mats actually dead lol said this the entrance merrily looked up at an archway of sandstone think its supposed to look like a roman villa chapel of rest circa maybe merrily said this time when shed called the receptionist had said that mr gwilym would be happy to talk to her at twothirty when she walked in five minutes early best black woollen coat he was already waiting on the edge of a mosaic tile circle standing between two small fountains burbling into bidettype projections bending to her handshake smooth and soft like suede mrs watkins good of you to spare the time how could i not all so intriguing my office is just here can i order you a drink coffee wine just had lunch thank you mr gwilym here a sandwich at home most remiss of me not to have offered you a proper lunch my apologies he shouldered open a mattwhite door in a recess business of late has been utterly frenet ic his voice was publicschool english but whatever anybody said there was posh south wales down there something slow and rhythmic like an evening tide washing against a jetty i wouldnt have had time merrily said but thank you anyway for some reason shed been expecting barrel chest spider veins flashing eyes belligerent someone it would be easy to goad into saying too much but sycharth gwilym was a loose bigboned man with a jutting chin and greybrown hair which rose and fell like the plume on a knights helmet and his manner was relaxed his eyes pale and tranquil and when you looked into them you didnt see anything of fuchsia mary linden merrilys confidence waned this was going to take time and maybe skills that she didnt have mr gwilym waited for merrily to sit before moving behind his desk the office had a picture window with a view over the car park over the city towards the cathedral and the river white walls and a glasstopped whitepainted desk with the wood grain showing through twin swivel chairs in grey leather a small conference table so he sat down leaning back composed you wanted to ask me about the master house behind his head was a large framed print an engraving of a robed man with a forked beard sitting in a gothic canopied throne holding a sceptre no prizes you do realize sycharth gwilym said that the house hasnt been in my family for over a century i do know that but it does seem to have been occupied by gwilyms for several centuries before that im not entirely sure about gwilyms as such but various of my ancestors yes start off with the routine stuff merrily brought out a pad and a pencil do you know exactly how long the family was there i do not know when the family was not there although records such as they are go back no further than the fifteenth century that would be the time of the owain glyndwr rebellion indeed mrs watkins may i inquire the purpose of this the stories i hear about the nature of your mission to garway are probably far more lurid than the truth merrily told him why the late felix barlow had refused to work in the master house what had happened to felix and fuchsia and he lifted his jaw oh not more lurid then he didnt smile there was always a point during every inquiry of this kind where you felt fairly foolish where you thought what am i doing here mr gwilym look im well aware that we live in a secular age and most people consider me some kind of anachronism and the basis of my job barely rational but he didnt say anything why should he let her squirm all i can say is that sometimes ive been able to help people feel more comfortable about their situations or a particular place sycharth gwilym crossed his legs and who would you be helping in this particular instance mrs watkins the prince of wales well i dont imagine anyone knows at this stage wholl eventually be occupying the master house wed just like them not to be bothered by whatever remains of whoever was there before them or whatever they did ghosts if you like by which you mean the spirits of the dead or aspects of memory lingering guilt sycharth gwilym nodded patiently i appreciate mrs watkins that you are doing your best to tread carefully and i shall try to assist you however i can thank you he extended a hand offering her the floor it seemed a wide and exposed area sycharth she sat in the grey swivel chair trying not to think of cigarettes do you remember the last time you were in the master house mr gwilym he didnt hesitate nodding in a resigned way yes i am rather afraid that i do when would that have been oh more than thirty years ago certainly i was a young man id been invited along with other local youngsters to a party the kind of party i would not attend today but i expect that in your own clearly more recent youth you also gwilym said that the master house had been leased by the newtons to a group of people who had money to spare took drugs and behaved with a certain lack of inhibition he supposed that as country kids theyd been fascinated and flattered to be invited to join in halfexpecting celebrities to be there merrily said so that wouldve been you and mainly young women perhaps another reason i was keen to go do you remember their names by any chance do you remember the black girl a minimal shake of the head pointless asking that at this stage and what happened at the party i was offered cannabis which i felt obliged to take and which must have had an effect because i recall very little of what happened afterwards thats a shame although i do remember towards midnight someone suggesting that given the age of the house and its atmosphere by candlelight we should hold a sort of seance with the intention of making contact with the dead for what purpose i doubt whether theres a logical answer to that a sort of seance i do remember some of the people there being excited to discover that many generations of my family had lived in the house someone suggested that it would be interesting for me to be put in touch with my ancestors how did you feel about that hardly in a position or i would guess in any state to say no and how did they go about it all a blur im afraid mrs watkins ouija board you mean letters and an upturned glass not that i recall do you remember which of your ancestors they were trying to reach i imagine any one of them would have been more than welcome why do you think we might somehow have conjured up something that is still ah walking the place its just that your first name the names of several of your forebears and your son seem to correspond to a particular pattern one called owain then there was gruffydd and fychan my father and my greatgrandfather merrily looked up at the engraving of the forkbearded man with the sceptre the last man to try to bring about an independent wales by force in the fifteenth century having himself declared prince of wales was owain ap gruffydd fychan was that an actual movement in sycharths sleepy eyes widely known as owain glyndwyr and his fathers name merrily consulted the pad was i believe gruffydd fychan ap madog you have a better knowledge of welsh history than most of your countrymen mrs watkins welsh friends now owains father i think was baron of somewhere called cynllaith owain no reaction and glyndwrs own mansion in northeast wales was of course called sycharth well done indeed mrs watkins so the gwilyms have a family tradition of male children being given names connected with owain glyndwr who is said to have stayed at the master house while on the run from the english after his campaign collapsed i believe that is the story yes one your family is evidently very proud of yes he said i suppose we are especially now in a time when owains vision is becoming reality how gratified he would be to see the formation of the welsh assembly as a start not yet enough but a start and all done without anyone being killed merrily said or a single castle being burned to the ground yes quite a number of castles in this area were destroyed and people killed still many landowning families in the vicinity of garway supported his campaign the whole area even as far as hereford itself had been part of the old wales and allegiances remain to this day and here he is on your wall here in england the mab darogan son of prophecy who according to legend never died just faded into the landscape of his beloved wales until such time as wales has need of him again i am a fan mr gwilym said but if his daughter was at kentchurch court just down the valley why would he need to spend time at the master house to his enemies kentchurch would have been a rather obvious place to go not that he didnt but maybe there were other attractions at the master house im sorry i was wondering merrily was gazing up at owain the sceptre rising meaningfully from between his legs if perhaps there was i dont know a gwilym daughter who when owain was in hiding and understandably a bit depressed about the way things had turned out devoted herself to kind of cheering him up a bit you are suggesting that we might be descended directly from owain glyndwr merrily shrugged all right he said some of my family have believed that there was a woman called elinor gwilym born around the turn of the fifteenth century who became quite a matriarch in my family some of my ancestors bore quite a resemblance to he glanced up it has even been said that i anyway which of my countrymen would not wish to be related to the greatest welshman in history the last real prince of wales quite merrily was remembering the way adam eastgate had looked at her when shed reminded him rather tactlessly that edward ii was only the first english prince of wales however gwilym said i doubt that the great man would have deigned to appear to a bunch of stoned kids of course owain wasnt the only great historical figure to have stayed at the master house would your ancestors have been there while the templars were in garway it was a templar farm perhaps hosting jacques de molay in so it is said and whatever he brought with him i dont understand im not sure i do either but people keep mentioning the possibility of templar treasure winding up in garway sycharth gwilym laughed your family never looked for it although when you think about it i expect the gwilyms had already lost the house when all this speculation started about the templars and their wealth and the secrets they guarded no response be a good reason to want the house back merrily said especially if you had all the family records what are you suggesting just passing on gossip ridiculous yes i expect it is its just that a friend of mine a welsh friend was pointing out that glyndwrs campaign was fired by the unjust treatment of the welsh by the english marcher lords and more specifically a personal injustice when some of his own land in north wales near the english border was seized by his neighbour the lord of rhuthun thats recorded history owain then sought justice from the english parliament and was turned away lord rhuthun kept the land another version of the story suggests that lord rhuthun was close to the king of england henry iv and blackened owains name at court either way it started a devastating war and lord rhuthuns name was reginald grey thats an interesting coincidence isnt it sycharth gwilym raised an eyebrow i mean the way the master house fell quite recently by marriage into the hands of the grays unlikely to be any relation but i suppose it has a certain poetic resonance gwilym shaking his head dismissively but merrily wasnt abandoning the punchline and then just when you thought you were going to be able to buy it back and can well afford to this house the house that puts you at the centre of so much crucial history handed by the grays to well not to the crown exactly but even worse to merrilys phone chimed in her bag not now lol please she saw sycharth gwilym wetting his lips and shut her bag on the phone to the latest english prince of i think you had better answer your call he said go outside if you like thank you im sorry when she stood up and was taking the phone to the door merrily saw sycharth gwilym standing up too following her out when she was holding the phone to her ear hed closed the office door behind them lol she said look do yourself a favour lass huw said get over to the cathedral now huw if you can give me just a few minutes ill call you back i wouldnt hang around i were you most pleasant talking to you mrs watkins gwilym said as she folded the phone you are a most intelligent and charming woman but im afraid i have a meeting at threethirty mr gwilym dropping the phone in her bag feeling a fizzing of panic in her stomach before you go the main reason i came was to ask if youd be interested in joining me and one of the grays and a representative of the duchy of cornwall at a short requiem service at the master house i think i shall probably discover a prior appointment on that occasion gwilym said as it is not our house any more the two fountains trickled merrily felt spray on her face i was thinking that as the house no longer belongs to either of you this might be a good time to draw a line under the years of bad feeling between the two families for instance i was hearing only this morning about your greatgrandfather madog the way he died i beg your pardon outside the pub thats a lot of nonsense madog seems to have had a heart condition anyway i was just thinking we might heal some history the idea gwilym said that history can or should be healed is to some of us anathema merrily looked over at the woman receptionist who wore a pale dress secured with a brooch at the shoulder romanstyle she was on the phone the people leasing the house lord stourport mrs watkins i dont remember his name but im sure he wasnt a lord and another man who called himself mat phobe do you remember him no do you remember a black girl called mary no im sorry youll have to excuse me do you know what happened to she watched him slip away under an archway the phone rang and this time it was lol merrily if gwilyms there dont react but ive just seen jimmy hayter going into the main bar the deal when jane got in from school the volvo was parked in the vicarage drive but there was no sign of mum just mrs morningwood and roscoe mrs morningwood was unwinding her scarf ive been across to the shop jane he was getting tired of cat food my god i felt like the phantom of the bloody opera in there the way people stared you shouldve asked me to go jane said as i understand it nobodys supposed to know youre here felt liked a caged tiger today darling i can tell you wheres mum in hereford talking to suckarse wish i was a bloody fly on that wall mrs morningwood while were on our own jane shed her bag and her parka in a pile on the flags pulled out a chair at the kitchen table you got beaten up didnt you whats wrong with a car crash whats wrong with it is im seventeen as distinct from like nine poor jane mrs morningwood sat down balancing on the cusp whats that mean jane looked at the ruins of what she guessed had once been a seriously cool woman who did this to you why cant you just spit it out i well remember being your age the fear of making a commitment to the wrong future the future right i hate the sodding future yes thats how things have changed isnt it when i was your age we couldnt wait to plunge into it like a deep blue swimming pool now the pool seems have gone and youre looking down into hard cracked mud yeah jane decided she wasnt going to get anywhere on the phoney car crash you believe in clairvoyance mrs morningwood depends how youre spelling it mrs morningwood broke into a fresh packet of cigarettes i accept to an extent the phenomenon of clairvoyance while remaining generally sceptical about clairvoyants people who profess to prophecy a woman once did a tarot reading for me jane said she said for instance that id have more than one serious lover before i was twenty not the most ambitious prediction darling i went out with this guy for like ages well over a year a serious commitment we were good friends quite rare and im thinking youre seventeen and youre in danger of becoming like half of a couple too cosy i mean wed nearly broken up a couple of times but it never lasted then he went to university last month and i just stopped answering his calls mrs morningwood sat and thought about this you mean you were angstridden because your love life was lacking in angst no one else on the horizon there was this guy i quite fancied not realizing that he was married at one stage i was kind of thinking that could be you know quite quite an experience being the other woman but then i thought breaking up someones marriage then i thought of my dad betraying mum he had another woman he was a lawyer and she worked in his office and they got killed together in a car crash when i was little oh dear mrs morningwood sounding less than sympathetic i did that once you know broke up a marriage what happened i married him and it was a disaster after the decree nisi i ran into his first wife and she was into a new relationship and very happy she said she was grateful to me quite and what about you pretty pissed off darling but thats life isnt it nobody else since oh quite a few but none of them ever became friends and thats the moral is it jane said if hes also a friend hold on to him oh i never talk about morals of any kind nor do i give advice what else did your tarot reader tell you well thats the problem she knew what mum did and she had an agenda so i cant really trust the rest but you trusted what she said about your love life i dont know have you had sex with the married man actually erm no but i think i could make it happen well of course you could actually its already been kind of good for me in a lifechanging way really whats he roscoe was on his feet about half a second before the front doorbell rang ill get it jane stood up youd better pop into the scullery in case its bliss or somebody who asks questions in the hall she opened the door to a guy in a green hiking jacket clergy shirt and a dog collar underneath familiarlooking baggage at his feet hullo dome head big friendly smile through his white beard would you be jane by any chance um yeah im afraid mums out though oh well look im teddy murray oddjob man at garway your mother was staying with us for a couple of nights and had to leave in a hurry said shed come back for her stuff but i know how busy she is and i happened to be passing through en route to hereford so he picked up the bags and beamed oh right jane said great must say this is a lovely village jane youre both very lucky yeah i suppose we are well ill just leave them here shall i teddy murray dropped the overnight bags over the threshold into the path of roscoe whod come trotting through from the kitchen and roscoe just went totally crazy snarling like allsnarl huge jagged teeth exposed like the ripper teeth on a circular saw this teddy murray backing away into the drive roscoe jane down behind the dog desperately hauling on his collar through the hackles she could be in trouble here oh god sorry sorry getting dragged through the doorway roscoes jaws opening and shutting like a gin trap on a spring guard dog eh teddy murray trying to smile from a few metres back i suppose two girls on their own in a big house back to the janes knees grazed on the mat obedience classes tell your mum ill talk to her again teddy murray said jane got the door shut the dog inside the snarl reduced to a low rumble blowing out a lot of air in a whoosh she went back into the kitchen where mrs morningwood was standing in the middle of the floor face like hardening plaster my fault darling her voice clearly on autopilot somewhere different from her thoughts should have shut him somewhere he hasnt done it before has he jane said i mean like tried to savage somebody oh mrs morningwood was expressionless no no he hasnt huw was in the north transept with his old mate tommy canty lighting a candle dunmores here where merrily looked around six candles were burning on a tiered stand in front of the renovated shrine of st thomas cantilupe back in the middle ages thered been long queues scores of pilgrims sick people and relatives of the sick tommy canty had been beckettclass in his day there was a container of candles you could buy to light and ask for the saints help huw fitted his candle into one of the holders bishops in one of the chantries trying to reach an arrangement with his governor thats why youve got me here to face up to the bishop she was feeling very much on edge lol had driven her down to broad street dropped her on the corner by the cathedral green and then against all her pleas driven off back towards westgate and roman road to find the man whod destroyed the most beautiful guitar in the world dunmore wants to talk to you huw said about what about what hes just trying to clear with his god bernies who you came to see he was your appointment and every bit as knackering as id figured you forget how shitscared they are bowed under the gross weight of centuries of solemn dark ceremonial not as many centuries as the church has not by a long way only the church doesnt threaten to rip your tongue out by the roots if you finger a brother or shout out jahbulon on the bus fair enough whats he going to tell me id say whatever you want to ask so have a think about it before you go in seriously unless he chickens out what did you say to him mr gwilym helpful was he didnt intend to be but i rather think he was what did you say to the bishop id better be off lass youre going nowt else i can do here he looked over the candles to the shrine see you then tommy nodding to the tomb in which there hadnt for many years been anything of tommy huw i think id rather you stayed lass huw bent to her its part of the deal just you and him oh i wont pray for you he put a hand on her shoulder already done that bit he pointed to the seventh candle what did you say to him huw didnt need to say much callaghanclarked already been in oh just get on with it eh looking slightly irritable huw left merrily in the cold light of the north transept the handful of candles a small and lonely glow male thing lol was standing next to jimmy hayters champagne jaguar the formula fantasy flashing past he hotwires the jag takes it away calls hayter on his mobile with directions and then what as he didnt know hayters mobile number or how to hotwire a car there wasnt much point in taking it further he just stood there leaning against the front of the jag in full view of the picture window identified by merrily as the window of sycharth gwilyms office the sky had gloomed over again and it began to rain lol didnt move the mobile in his pocket was switched on until he had a call from the cathedral there was nowhere to go after twenty minutes his grey alien sweatshirt dark with rain he still hadnt moved he was very cold after twentyfive minutes it stopped raining and lord stourport came out the walls and ceiling of the fifteenthcentury chantry chapel of bishop john stanbury were of richly foliate stone it was like being under a copse of low weeping trees in winter im going to retire merrily the bishop said it wasnt warm in here but hed taken off his jacket there was a small green stain on a shoulder of his purple shirt you always say that merrily said she was sitting next to him facing the goldenhaloed virgin and child in the triptych gothicspired over an altar the size of a boxed radiator bernie dunmore had lost some weight in the past year and his tonsure had expanded it is possible you know he said to be a freemason and a priest without compromise but hard idve thought hard yes my father and two uncles were masons when i joined i was barely out of theological college for a while it seemed almost compatible the lodge included two canons and the dean several bishops were still active masons then not now of course you couldve left yes of course you can leave but they consider that the vows once made cannot be revoked but you never actually did havent been to a lodge meeting or a social event for well over twenty years but it always seemed to me that to publicly renounce the craft wouldve caused more fuss than it was worth ive never courted controversy as you know why did you stop going in the end they they tell you it cant be incompatible because it isnt a religion and then you find yourself asking but is it an antireligion antifaith anyway merrily kept her eyes on the virgin gnostic the search for some kind of god within yourself yes in a way and is it antireligion i still cant decide we even have masonic services as you know at the cathedral all i know is that at some stage i prayed for help the answer was get out but you didnt it wasnt a problem merrily not until last week dunmore was silent for what must have been close to half a minute it had become darker in the chantry the stained glass in the window dulled merrily sensed that it was raining outside you were approached she said nothing so formal i was advised that wellintentioned wellregarded men might be damaged by your inquiries wellintentioned wellregarded masons the word was never used but the person who gave you the advice was someone who had given me good advice on many occasions lets not forget that archdeacon neale it was felt that you were going too far into areas that werent essential to what you were being asked to do what you mean gods work it dunmore gritted his teeth you always go too bloody deep merrily anybody else it would be in and out a quick blessing a requiem you had to ask questions even getting jane to what ask questions at school how would you merrily thought about it the history teacher robbie williams richard williams on the square bernie sighed knight templar perhaps hes a medieval historian merrily bloody hell bernie this is worse than cctv do you know sycharth gwilym not personally i know hes become a prime mover in this city fingers in pies but mervyn neale knows him presumably yes knight templar yes yes yes have you come across lord stourport no lapsed i believe look merrily it doesnt mean theyre all corrupt its done a lot of good straightened out men whose whole lives might have been selfish and pointless well not for me to judge but just to put you in the picture bernie over thirty years ago stourport and gwilym were both involved in pseudotemplar rites at the master house in which women were abused one of them has never been seen again she was the mother of fuchsia mary linden found dead on the railway after her friend was murdered oh and it seems likely that stourport or gwilym was the father god or possibly a third man who called himself mat phobe who stourport says is dead ive just been to talk to sycharth gwilym who id say is suffering from a severe case of censoredmemory syndrome what would you expect theres also been another incident someone very nearly killed who you wouldnt know her and if one of them knew another had committed a murder would he keep quiet i bernie merrily looked at bernie dunmore hard through the dense sacred dimness of the chantry i cant believe this youre sweating dont dont ask me to explain because i cant i cannot rationally explain it im going to retire next year and i shall leave herefordshire he had his hands clasped on his knees he stared down at them the call i made to you yesterday morning forget it it never happened do what you have to i dont know what im going to do i couldnt prove anything i dont know the half of it not yet anyway if its a matter for the police go to the police cant not yet bernie how important say to the masonic knights templar would it be to uncover some longhidden secret at garway connected to the original templars big kudos there thats not a question i can answer probably be up to the individual im told some masons have got quite obsessed over the years about garway some men it rather takes them over yes especially now the day after tomorrow being the seven hundredth anniversary of the suppression of the templars saturday the thirteenth friday it was friday when it happened friday the thirteenth which i meant at garway the service at garways tomorrow is it been quite a problem for us merrily for me the c of e is obviously in two minds about the templars we have their churches but we werent the ones who persecuted them we probably wouldve done though if wed existed at the time you know the vaticans being asked to apologize for the suppression no i didnt some of the modern knights templar societies are calling for it doesnt affect us one way or another but holding memorial services is a bit iffy politically churches as you know have two different roles places of worship and historic buildings open for tourism so we show the tourists the templar coffin lids and the remains of the circular nave but as for including the templars baphomet and all in a religious service dicey very dicey and officially i should have said no teddy murray doesnt seem too enthusiastic either the bishop smiled through the dull sheen of sweat you really dont know the half of it do you mrs morningwood was feeling her throat through the silk scarf her throat where the marks were jane said you look like mum looked when she came out of that house roscoe looked up at mrs morningwood whimpering she clasped his head to her lower thigh im going to make some tea jane said or can i get you a brandy what house well the master house jane filled the kettle you remember no you dont youd gone youd left us to it you said roscoe wouldnt go in you said you always trusted the dog i do mrs morningwood looked down at roscoe he was panting it was like they were tuned to the same wavelength the woman and the dog picking up messages that nobody else could hear jane will you tell me about this im sorry i thought mum mustve told you maybe i should keep quiet up to you jane jane walked to the window looking out at the orchard at the last red apples near the tops of the highest trees she looked like death like shed just seen i dunno lol in a porno video or something jane turned to face mrs morningwood she always insists shes not psychic maybe because she doesnt like to believe anyone else is did she tell you what happened oh yeah it was when she found the green man which is actually baphomet but its the same thing baphomet pan the green man the male thing in nature this is in the church no no in the house thats what i thought you meant its in the fireplace behind the inglenook someones put a green man or baphomet on the wall inside the inglenook where nobody would normally see it you didnt know about it is it old probably not could be something to do with whatever stuff was going on there back in the s but then it might be old might be original templar mightve been brought from somewhere else at some stage dunno really and your mother found it disturbing you ask her now shell probably deny it are you all right mrs morningwood no mrs morningwood sat down no i dont think i am you want me to call the doc or something dont be silly she looked up do you think merrily would mind if i borrowed her car id bring it back tonight id have to ask you might not be insured in that case you can drive cant you jane sure you see i came in your mothers car mines at home your mothers gone with lol in his truck would it be possible to take me home just for a few minutes so i can collect some medication herbs wont take me long darling i know what im looking for i suppose i could phone for a taxi herbs no way no jane said no its ok ill get the keys good i can pick up my jeep oh this would mean shed have to drive back on her own on her provisional licence ok jane said shed need to get the lplates off before mrs morningwood spotted them because whatever this was about it was not about herbs damage ten cover it jimmy hayter said lol stared at him it had started to rain again big spots on hayters buttermilk armani i could go to twelve robinson cash by tonight leave it in an envelope for you at the desk in there twelve what twelve k perhaps you could explain what youre talking about jimmy i heard you had a guitar irreparably damaged wow lol said its amazing how quickly word gets out ive always liked to help underprivileged musicians so ive noticed twelve and you and your priest leave me alone and you dont lean on my fucking jag lol didnt move jimmy you are i think what our friends over the ocean would call a piece of work all right hayter said you tell me what you want ill be reasonable about it four grand in an envelope and a bit of honesty i could hayters face might have darkened or it could have been the sky i dont think i need to spell out what damage i could do to your what you laughably call a career well lol shook his head sighing i mean thats just the point isnt it i dont call it a career and you already have spelled it out or your employee with whatever destructive implement he carries around with him and the thing is whoever did that might have gone further than instructed hayter said thing is im really not anywhere near significant enough to be damaged by somebody with your level of connections i mean what are you going to do like sabotage the renewal of my sixalbum contract with the sony corporation maybe he concentrated on the wrong guitar hayter turned away shoulders hunched against the rain which had drained the colour out of the city below them making the cathedral spectral then he turned back we havent done anything wrong who me and hayter jerked a thumb over his shoulder towards the centurion him mr gwilym who you havent seen in thirty years actually i hadnt hayter said not until today so what i mean why the reunion cant be the anniversary of the ritual abuse of mary roberts surely lol the wet soaking through to his chest suddenly felt this kind of transcendent exhilaration somehow he had the bastard it wasnt like that hayter said so tell me what it was like you want to come inside jimmy do i look stupid im getting wet rains healthy start with mat phobe move the letters around and it becomes baphomet thats this head thing the templars are supposed to have worshipped and also what crowley called himself when he was doing sex magic with the oto yeah we did our share of that mat had this obscure book with the rituals of the oto you needed women or men would do in some cases but we never went there like i said unlike some of the templars apparently what happened to mary ive told you no you havent i told you i went to london to meet my old man hayters eyes were halfscreened by his heavy hair and gwilym went home to his old mans farm and when we got back shed gone gone where i dont know so when you and gwilym had left the premises who was left mickey whatshisname and mat phobe no hayter wiped the air with both hands thats absolutely as far as i go robinson you havent even explained why youre here yet fuck off what about the four grand i could after all lol started to laugh hair dripping leaning back over the bonnet of hayters jag seriously damage you itll be on the desk by tonight hey im not going in there especially at night hayter started to walk away then turned hsbc the bank centre of town with your name on it one hour youll need some id hayter walked back to the centurion quickly through the rain the confines of the triangle merrily spotted the animal a serious presence in the broad street traffic and ran out across the cathedral green as lol pulled in on the yellow lines holding on to his left arm as she climbed in from the running board god youre soaked wheres huw left ages ago merrily hauled the passenger door shut you ok checking him out peering into his face as he waited for a gap in the traffic you saw him hayter yes and im not sure he admits it was him not exactly but wherere we going somewhere we can talk merrily said im trying to come to terms with something that i dont quite know what it means but its disturbing hayters worried hes floundering so he bloody should be he offered me ten thousand for the damage to the boswell what just now he implied that the guy who did it overreacted it mustve happened very quickly he was still thinking i was trying to blackmail him told his guy to follow me guy rings him from tanworth after ive left the truck to go into the churchyard hayter some kind of kneejerk thing tells him what to do to show me what im taking on how did he find out youre on the level im thinking two possibilities lol turned left into bridge street traffic congealing around them maybe he called prof back in a rage and prof explained the situation or he talked to gwilym on the phone and gwilym did some checks what did you do about the money told him to make it four grand and give me some honest answers we reached the same point where mary disappears then he clammed up he says the money will be at hsbc in an hour unless he already has some arrangement with them i dont know how hes going to do that so maybe he was just lying to get rid of me but he and gwilym are together for the first time he insists since garway what does that suggest i may just be able to tell you in a few minutes lol drove down to the car park near the swimming pool by the time hed found a space big enough for the animal merrily had the mobile out was consulting its index of numbers i just want to try something see what reaction i get she put the call through the rain had stopped again but the sky was smoky over the hills good afternoon beverley murray said professionally this is the ridge beverley its merrily watkins sorry to bother you dont suppose teddys around oh merrily havent you seen him he was supposed to be calling at your place with the bags you left behind oh well actually im not at home perhaps hes left them somewhere unlikely that mrs morningwood would have answered the door especially to someone from garway it was very kind of him but there was really no need ill be back there probably tomorrow in fact she told beverley shed only just found out that the special service for the templar anniversary was tomorrow the twelfth rather than saturday the thirteenth oh yes thats there has been a change of plan i think only i know teddy was feeling a bit apprehensive about it and i was thinking there was nothing i could do because ive got this wedding on saturday but of course fridays not a problem oh well i think and obviously ive learned a lot about the templars in the past few days so you know id be happy to take it off his hands merrily i so do you know what time it is thats all i wanted to know really ill come up and meet him an hour or so before and well work it out a silence merrily watched rain clouds tangling in the rustcoloured sky over dinedor hill beverley said can i call you back about this merrily sure merrily clicked off sank down in the seat i wasnt getting the right messages from beverley this is the wife of the guy whos standing in as vicar at garway mmm theyre waiting for a new team minister beverley was telling me how stressed out teddy was and how it would be bad for him to get involved in any exorcism and that he didnt really want to do a service to commemorate the seven hundredth anniversary of the suppression of the templars which of course led to all kinds of torture and burnings at the stake for which the roman catholic church is now being asked to issue a formal apology by whom some neotemplar groups the vatican wont authorize an apology of course because the templars are still very iffy the accusations may at least in part be true no religious organization is totally clean certainly not one consisting largely of trained killers there is that you really want to do this service no way i was just seeing what reaction i got the situation is that the c of e didnt want to be involved but teddy said a lot of people had been pushing for something at garway what he didnt say is that this was going to be a masonic service oh reluctantly approved possibly under pressure by bernie and conducted something else teddy didnt say by a mason merrily watched a transeuro container lorry coming off greyfriars bridge inside a grey haze thinking maybe she knew this city no better than its driver teddy murray it seems has been on the square for many many years which opens up so many scary possibilities that i dont know where to start suggests a special relatonship with gwilym mmm and it means hes been extremely parsimonious with the truth in his various conversations with me the guys always so vague and farback butter wouldnt melt she said hed actually been to the vicarage this afternoon your vicarage ostensibly to bring my bags back unlikely it suggests he wants to talk about something ill see if merrily rang home no answer jane must be back by now so she left a message saying she could be late was reachable on the mobile if jane could see her way to calling what do we do now lol said pick up the money for the boswell its not going to be there merrily be interesting to see stourport clearly very much wants you off his back they parked at tesco walked round the corner by all saints church and lol went into the bank on his own came back with a thick yellow envelope lets not get too excited it might be a letter bomb or something insisting on her getting into the truck while he opened it on his own in the car park up against a perimeter wall he slid back into the truck ive never had a fiftypound note before let alone eighty of them well well and theres also this he laid a plastic cd case on the dash merrily grimaced i do hope its not death metal i seriously dont like to put it on lol took out the cd held it up to the light doesnt look like its been tampered with oh for heavens sake now lol switched on the engine loaded the cd turned up the volume a background hum was relayed through six speakers a lot of rustling movement of objects a female voice is this what you wanted yeah yeah over there male voice near the mirror and dont talk again all right just keep quiet whatever happens you keep quiet this is important after about a minute of nearsilence the girl said ooh kinky and the man hissed king shut it that could be hayter lol said but merrily said the girl did that sound like a brummie accent to you maybe christ the atmosphere a suggestion of burning a hissing was issuing like steam from speakers on either side filling the cab after some minutes another male voice came in upanddown liturgical i conjure thee by the name under which thou knowest thy god and by the name of the prince and king who rules over thee i conjure thee to come at once and to fulfil my desires by the powerful name of him who is obeyed by all by the name tetragrammaton jehovah the names which overcome everything whether of this world or any other come speak to me clearly without duplicity come in the name of adonai sabaoth come linger not adonai shadai the king of all kings commands thee background noise with swishing movements an exclamation of distaste sulphur jeez a nervous giggle after a while another voice told you it was boll sorry then the whole incantation repeated twice nearsilence this time a thump as if the tape had been unsubtly edited then two voices one going oh my cut off by the second louder triumphant welcome thou wert invoked in the name of him who has created heaven and earth and hell i hereby bind thee so that thou shalt remain here within the confines of the triangle while i still require thee and leave not without the licence to depart and then not without answering the questions i shall put to thee that which was brought here on the instructions of the grand master and grand preceptor of all england jacques de molay to be hidden from those who would purloin it if it be still here i command you to inform me of its true location and if it be not here i command that you so inform me more invocation of the secret names of god the question repeated no clues as to what hidden item they were hoping to locate it went on for another ten minutes with edit bumps until whatever had been welcomed was formally dismissed and the recording ended the problem with ceremonial magic merrily said is that it can be incredibly tedious the language they use stilted pompous mock liturgy very defined though lol said very exact focused on what they want and closing up all other avenues i dont know what to make of it all smoke and mirrors or what actually it involves both smoke and mirrors this excatholic priest eliphas levi huge admirer of the templars once claimed to have conjured up a spirit for a friend of bulwerlytton the writer admitting that he couldnt really be sure what hed got but claiming to see the figure of a man and he asks it the designated questions and gets the answers in his head no big sonorous voice echoing around the temple inside your head merrily said is usually as good as it gets apparently so who were they trying to invoke here dunno you go through the key of solomon and all these magical texts you get a selection of spirits funny names biblicalsounding roots which perform certain functions to order finding hidden treasure thats a big favourite its been quite heavily edited because this stuff takes for ever merrily said but yeah it also covers up essential facts like we dont find out exactly what theyre after or who theyre trying to talk to or what they get out of it if anything its just rich kids messing around trying to scare themselves like hey weve done all the drugs had all the weird sex lets do other spheres of existence point is why did hayter want us to hear it sign of good faith he said that if he found any of the tapes hed let me know i thought that was just to get my phone number which of course he put to good use a short time later but why is he telling us anything went to a lot of trouble here he mustve either shot straight round to the bank with it or hed taken it earlier making provision for collection by someone else he didnt have to offer you any money there was no way you could pin the boswell on him lol ejected the cd slid it back into the plastic case well he doesnt want us to drop it does he hes just trying to steer us away from him more or less editing himself out like something did happen but it wasnt down to me the girl could that be mary perhaps ill play it to mrs morningwood and of course sycharths not in there at all wheres his big welshlanguage scene yet hayter told me about gwilym without mentioning his name but that presumably was before he spoke to him again merrily said now its like theyre on the same side both pointing at the guy who conducted the ritual saying this is the bad guy mat phobe and hes dead end of story merrilys mobile chimed i dont know it might be somebody they cant hello i think i should like to talk to you merrily beverley murray said monty and jane so where did it happen jane asked the volvo roared and surged because shed put it back into second gear instead of up into fourth shit was it at your home jane said is that what this is all about mrs morningwood glanced at her it wasnt far from home its an established fact that most car accidents take place on roads that are well known to the victim familiarity breeding carelessness yes jane said very good she wasnt totally stupid she was driving slowly but trying not to make it suspiciously slowly shed left a message on the table for mum telling her the truth that she was driving mrs morningwood home to collect some stuff but not the entire truth that shed be driving back almost certainly in the dark unaccompanied by a qualified driver she could do this country roads all the way a wide arc around hereford so what was it like growing up in garway under the shadow of the templars good question mrs morningwood said obviously any question unrelated to her having been viciously assaulted was going to be a good one like the first time i went up there jane said i was noticing things but maybe if you grow up in a place you take it all for granted in this case jane i think not even people who profess no interest at all in the templars are i think affected in some way its one of those areas that seems to i dont know condition the way people think and behave it somehow imposes its own rules and strictures you noticed yourself the names of the pubs ive never worked out how far they go back but i dont think it matters they might simply be echoes from memory the people are the memory cells of the hill cool my mother for instance i dont think she once mentioned the templars to me as a child but she knew about the nine witches i can name them she used to say every one so who were the other eight i never asked she never told me of course when i was a child a witch meant an old woman in a pointed hat stirring a cauldron they were probably all around me and not all of them women are there nine now probably its not a coven or anything jane it simply suggests that there are always going to be nine people who whether they know it or not have been entrusted with the guardianship of the hill and its ways whenever an issue arises which might damage us certain people will project a certain point of view i cant explain it any better than that people with garway in their blood nothing so prosaic as blood jane its in their very being i really do believe that it conditions how one does what one does like your herbalism healing or dowsing waterdivining or painting sculpture gardening furnituremaking everything somehow relating to the place and its relationship with the heavens and infused with a special energy sometimes as above so below paracelsus im not aware that paracelsus was ever in garway or even if someone so loud and demonstrative would have been welcome here were very lowkey which is why ive always felt that owain glyndwr as depicted by shakespeare would have been unlikely to have fitted in either archetypal welsh windbag jane figured she had a good working knowledge of shakespeare the big ones anyway i can call spirits from the vasty deep anyone who goes around telling people he can call spirits is usually buggerall use at it mrs morningwood said do you mind if i smoke or are you like most kids indoctrinated by the fascists in westminster are you kidding in our house thank you ill open the window you see thats why i suspect glyndwr was not such a windbag although the wind does appear to have been important to him in other ways huh vast amount of mystery and superstition attached to the man the wizard who could manipulate the elements alter the weather leaving opposing armies drowning in welsh mist a very templar thing to do i cant believe that coming here a mere century or so after the dissolution he wasnt exposed to the full blast of residual templarism some of them would still have been here undercover now sitting on their secrets but he only came here towards the end of his life didnt he who says that was the first time i think not besides the templars may have favoured welsh independence just as they supported the scots at bannockburn ive even heard it said that they included among their number llewelyn ap gruffudd the last official prince of wales in the thirteenth century his dates certainly fit really the templars seemed to like governments being fragmented jane made it easier to sustain their own international powerbase right jane slowed at the singlelane brobury bridge over the wye waiting for every possible oncoming car to come across before chancing her arm dorstone hill narrow winding and wooded wasnt going to be easy when she and eirion had come last summer hed had to keep reversing to find somewhere to pull in to let other cars get past and she was well crap at reversing shed stopped talking to concentrate but mrs morningwood seemed to want to talk as if she was afraid of where her own thoughts might lead her ok jane said so like is garway the way it is because of the templars or did the templars only come here because garway was already you know this really chargedup landscape maybe back into celtic times mixture of the two whatever was here they certainly enhanced it its an unstable area too has a major geological fault line climatic anomalies are often noted we used to talk about gusts of wind from the white rocks which are supposed to be a celtic burial ground and then of course theres m r james we must janes hands tightened on the wheel have offended someone or something at garway my god jane for a child youre remarkably well informed thanks anyone under fortys a child to me now its the wind again you see why did james have this chap discover a whistle that could arouse the wind on the site of a templar preceptory its never explained in the story but you think the templars and owain glyndwr and farmers in this area at one time john aubrey refers to the winnowers of herefordshire who believed they could arouse a wind to blow the chaff from the wheat by whistling whistling up the wind thats undoubtedly where monty james got the idea from you reckon its the only possible connection but m r james didnt even come here until years after hed written that story he didnt come until this gwen mcbryde came to live here with her daughter erm jane well we dont know for certain that he hadnt been here before that but as an antiquarian its most unlikely that he hadnt heard of garway i keep thinking of jane macbryde jane said how old would she have been when they came to garway about thirteen you know her father was the artist who illustrated some of the early stories and jane also drew things jane had a macabre imagination clawlike hands emerging from tombs do you know what she looked like im afraid i dont nobody ever described her to me at the turning to dorstone hill jane snatched a quick look sideways mrs morningwood had her old barbour on and the sunglasses her cigarette arm on the open window a small smile on her stillswollen lips roscoes head next to hers his grey fur flattened in the slipstream do you want to know the story jane mcbryde had known in advance about the visit to garway church although it wasnt more than a few miles from their home and shed probably been before visiting somewhere with uncle monty was always a joy he was kind and he was funny and full of good stories well everybody knew that now and jane mcbryde had read them all uncle monty of course could spend all day poking around old churches and garway church with all its templar relics was a special treat one of his most famous stories jane found it deliciously terrifying had been about a templar preceptory and what a solitary sort of professor had found there and came to wish he hadnt or at least had left it well alone monty didnt really notice he was probably safely in the tower or the vestry or somewhere bent over something his glasses on his nose when jane slipped out of the church and started looking round the outside walls feeling along them with her hands what you after the girl was a few years younger than jane maybe eight or nine she had blonde hair and a wild look the year was jane mcbryde said quite open about it im looking for a hole in the wall i want to play a trick on my uncle how do you know all this jane said i mean youre not making it up or anything i am telling it mrs morningwood said just as my mother told it to me so the blonde girl norah my mother was quite a forward child not many of the local kids would dare approach a stranger my mother knowing every stone in the tower below her own height was able to show her one quite close to the ground perhaps in the area where the circular nave would be excavated just a few years later which could with the aid of a stick or a small knife be eased out of the wall mrs morningwood began to smile for real shaking her head imagine the scene an hour or so later when monty and his ward are strolling around the tower perhaps planning to take in the famous dovecote and jane says whys that stone sticking out uncle monty and monty gets down on his hands and knees the stone pops out and so does a very old and grimy whistle oh cool nothing engraved on it of course but you can imagine the look on montys face perhaps after the initial shock he has an inkling that hes been set up but hes very fond of jane realizes all the trouble the girls taken over this and goes along with it did he blow it my mother watching from behind a gravestone reported it as follows better not blow it monty says who knows what might happen and young janes hopping up and down oh do blow it uncle monty do but monty pockets the whistle saying perhaps ill blow it later lets continue with our exploration and did he well my mother despite having no idea what any of this was about never having read the story was fascinated to find out and so she followed them through the churchyard along the footpaths and all the time jane mcbrydes pulling montys arm and saying when are you going to blow it please blow it now my mother remembers monty stopping at the top of a rise which is very well known to me and he takes out the whistle should i gives it a good wipe with his handkerchief puts it in his mouth puffs out his cheeks nothing happens takes it out of his mouth bangs it on a stone to get the dried mud out of the hole at the end back in the mouth young jane jumping up and down nothing happens at first and then peeeeep youre like not making this up are you jane said changing smoothly down through the gears im telling it to you exactly as it was told to me by my late mother monty blows the whistle once pops it back in his pocket couple of minutes later a gust of wind comes in probably from the white rocks and down comes the rain youre kidding my personal theory is that monty knew there was a good chance of a change in the weather and wanted to wait until it was imminent to blow the whistle to turn the tables on jane however it rains harder and harder and they run to some trees but with the wind the trees are offering precious little in the way of shelter and janes dress is getting soaked and montys rather concerned now that shell catch cold her poor father of course having died very young possibly the last of his drawings being in fact the whistle ghost with its intensely horrible face of crumpled linen jane stayed in second gear for the descent the road like a tunnel through the trees it wasnt raining but it was dark enough to put on the headlights dipped montys perhaps very concerned now that his own joke is going to backfire and jane will catch pneumonia usually fatal remember in those days before antibiotics and then through the trees he spots a house grabs jane by the hand and they go dashing down montys banging on the front door shouting hullo hullo but no answer my mother follows them to the edge of the yard she sees monty turn the handle and the door opens my mothers hand goes to her mouth because well because she knows whats in there what the force of the wind slams the door wide exposing a dim room with the curtains drawn across the small high window monty calls out the rain thrashing down behind them no answer a small lamp is burning he sees a long trestle table with a sheet covering something just as a sudden gust of wind from outside blows the sheet away and there awaiting its coffin lies the corpse of naomi newton above which the white sheet is dancing in the wind before collapsing to the floor in a twitching sort of heap oh my god jane said newton the master house so caught up in the story that shed driven up one side of the treacherous dorstone hill and down the other round a seriously nasty lefthand band and into the broad sweep of the golden valley where the oddly graceful fibreglass steeple of peterchurch church was embossed on the low cloud mass like some downmarket salisbury cathedral a year later mrs morningwood was saying m r james returned alone to garway and got into conversation with my grandmother who had her own reasons to be fearful of the master house he was a touch embarrassed as if my own imagination was punishing me he said perhaps im haunted by my own ghastly creations right wow jane drove on in silence still not sure whether or not mrs morningwood had made the whole thing up but remembering something before theyd left taking the spare car keys from the rack in the key cupboard at the end of the hall shed noticed something missing the outsize key to the master house had been hung on the rack by mum who was probably fed up with the weight of it and the memories it evoked every time she opened the bag the fact that the key was no longer there could mean one of two things that mum had put it back into her bag in case she had to go there at short notice or bevvie what was most unexpected was the aggression oh lets not waste time beverley said all that false bonhomie all this lets help old teddy out of his fix youre not a bonhomie sort of person are you merrily under the halogen lights in the stainless steel kitchen beverleys hair down around her shoulders a chardonnay bottle half full on the chopping board with two glasses beverley rapidly draining one a different woman one who wanted to talk had maybe wanted to talk for a long time to somebody building up to this flushed and brimming now oh god how you could miss the signs as if you didnt know merrily exactly why you couldnt do that service the dusk was dropping like a roller blind merrily had gone into the ridge on her own leaving lol in the truck with her phone in case jane or somebody rang well i think she said that he couldve told me about it told you about it he doesnt even tell me about it lodge nights out comes the black case off to the boys club bevvie dont wait up like an oldtime gangster with a violin case never yet seen the inside of that little black case that seems to be the way it goes merrily said except on ladies evenings of course never been to one im going to sit there with a bunch of old biddies dripping jewellery smiling fondly at my husband and listening to endless selfcongratulatory speeches all rise for the provincial grand almighty whatever yes that could be very trying my first husband played golf a golf bore golf club social events merrily is it something about me safe practical reliable and above all blatantly incurious merrily said nothing beverley poured more wine merrily left hers alone wondering how best to play this remembering something these guests the ones coming tomorrow germans have you ever met german masons last year it was americans sold to me as a hiking group but they never seem to hike further than the church with their video cameras and their calculators and their set squares why was it changed from saturday i think they were afraid that on the actual day it might be too crowded with you know normal visitors that ordinary people might actually want to go to the service whereas friday as a working day theyll be left to get on with it especially at the time its being held when straddling midnight so that come the dawn on saturday the time of the original raids in france in the church draped with templar banners theyre all rolled up in the tower its going to be the highlight of his his life probably sad no its not sad quite frightening actually do you want to sit down where is teddy now hereford little boys club wont be back much this side of midnight dont you like this stuff shall i open a bottle of red or something id rather you made it coffee merrily said lol had never used this phone before and the first time the call came in he accidentally killed it he was fiddling around for some way of recovering it when the churchbell noise it made started up again merrily shes not around at the moment lol said can i take a lol robinson lol froze for a second he thought it was hayters man again frannie bliss laurence where is she talking to somebody not far away there a problem yeh there is i expected to have heard from her by now when last we spoke she seemed i dont like it when shes quiet ill get her to call you whys she quiet laurence maybe she likes to think things out lol looked down from the parking area across to the darkening hills of east wales no lights anywhere i thought it was a wrap from your point of view all sorted somebody saying it isnt you know i dont mix in those circles francis well it isnt you tell merrily it isnt tell her youre norra blabber are you laurence no and still a vested interest in keeping her intact more vested all the time lol said weve had pm results on barlow and fuchsia im not going into details but the extent of barlows injuries the level of force the level of trauma that doesnt look like a woman not often a womans method either what blunt instrument a bluntie you see generally speaking they dont requires a level of controlled rage and sustained rage and wheres the motive here where at the end of the day is the damn motive so why did she kill herself lol said yeh well did she see another thing the effects of a railway engine running over a head are highly effective at concealing whether there might have been an earlier injury rendering the victim incapable enough or dead enough to be taken there and laid on the line carried there already dead most likely theres a lorra shite talked about the accuracy of timeofdeath assessment largely as a result of tv pathologists who say oh the victim passed away between ten fifteen and ten fortyfive in real life they can just about tell you what day it was youre saying there could still be somebody out there im planting the thought you can add it to the list of reasons why she needs to call me on the mobile naturally lol sat there looking out over unlit wales wondering how many other crucial calls merrily might have missed when we first came here i thought we might walk the hills together walk to the pub gentle strolls home by moonlight maybe get a dog he didnt want a dog he didnt do that kind of walking his kind of walking youre out at dawn proper hiking boots and you arent back till dark and the worse the weather is the better him and the landscape walking his way into it throwing himself into it as if he didnt have much time to learn all there was to learn gods own weekend retreat merrily said they were sitting at the window table in the former dairy beverley tossed back her head the vacant vicar the silly vicar more tea vicar he plays that role so well gods own weekend bloody retreat balm for the soul all the clichés beverley breathed out slowly jesus merrily i havent really talked to anybody like this in years its like a big stone being rolled off your chest does it bother you that i dont believe in god evangelisms never been my thing people come to it in their own way or not on impulse merrily had left off the dog collar this morning pectoral cross over a black sweater some people were put off this one definitely you often heard clergy wives talking like this their scepticism deepened by living daytoday with a socalled man of god all his doubts all his weaknesses and failings teddy know you dont believe in god weve never talked about it he doesnt care one way or the other i was a good source of money when he needed some big house to sell silly me when i think back i thought i was playing him like a fish on a hook beverley drank some coffee he was playing me i didnt see it he can be so charming and needy in this selfless stoical noble way i bet you saw through it right away i bet youve been mauled by the best no merrily said actually no he didnt make a move on you merrily looked into mrs murrays flushed face maybe this was paranoia after all silly of me of course he wouldnt with you he wants you out of here done and dusted quick as possible when you left the other morning he laughed women in deliverance he said that was never going to work he said that i watch you know ive been watching for some time thinking why are we here on this bleak bloody hillside why do we stay here we have no real friends no roots at least i dont he has hes found something its like he owns the place now comes in from his walk its like hes had sex actually short bleak laugh im sure he has sometimes beverley sometimes we get lone women staying here of a certain age divorced bereaved here to come to terms with something and hell take them out for a walk talk to them in his vicarly fashion balm for the soul theyll go out for walks together balm for the soul balm for the body he ministers to them you really think that where would he take them in the grass in the woods i dont know where he takes them its therapy isnt it so when when you talked about going with him if he ever went to get treatment from mrs morningwood very sexy woman isnt she for her age not like me beverley youre goes through periods when he hardly looks at me hardly seems to know im there we even have separate bedrooms when there are no guests oh certainly if it helps you get a better nights sleep bevvie beverley looked away out of the window almost dark now other times phases he becomes almost frighteningly demanding rough animal well i was quite flattered at first this gentle diffident clergyman as if it was me bringing something out ive never been very you know men found me passably attractive but not a wind was rising leaves blown against the glass and then you see at some point beverley swallowed too much coffee choked slapped her chest hard dont know how it took me so long to notice me with my genteel suburban at some point after wed been here a while it became obvious that at at those times it wasnt anything to do with me wasnt me at all sometimes id see his eyes above me in the moonlight his wild enchanting blue eyes wide open and somewhere else merrily looked into beverleys eyes and saw loneliness thinking back to beverley begging her not to involve teddy in whatever she was planning for the master house not taking it in as well as she might have selfpity taking over instead shed been ill that night and desperately tired missing the whole point it wasnt teddy who was overstressed vulnerable his workload was becoming ridiculous poor man four large parishes in gloucestershire and the phone never seemed to stop ringing didnt tally with the man shed first met in the shadow of garway church whod said hed never been a particularly pastoral sort of chap you could get away with a lot in the church ignore things especially if you were a man men were seldom doormats beverley when you said he was playing you like a fish seems all too clear to me now although i dont want to believe it the implications of it are more disturbing than i can bear to think about for long i lie in my bedroom and i stare at the ceiling and i think youre wrong you have to be wrong its all too elaborate machiavellian the final straw a wave of absolutely awful vandalism desecration gravestones pushed over defaced strange symbols chiselled into them and one night someone broke in and actually defecated in the church which was horrible horrible horrible merrily had begun warming her hands on her coffee cup the implications forming like a numbness on her skin the turning half a mile or so out of garway village jane slowed right down roadside cottage lights up ahead a row of them curtained by a tingly kind of mist this place was called the turning mrs morningwood said she was winding down her window annoyed rather thought it would still be fully light when we arrived but youre a more careful driver than i expected jane a lot of people have accidents in their first year on the road jane held the volvo on the footbrake at the turning flattening the clutch you still want me to go down here or what dont think i said anything about going down here did i well seeing you nicked the key to the master house from the rack at home i just thought jane turned to her like was it something i said about the green man or the baphomet behind the inglenook you have an idea what thats about i would have liked to see it mrs morningwood admitted im not too sure about going now though would you go if i wasnt with you possibly however look jane dont hang around theres a vehicle behind you keep going right ok jane thought sod it turned left into the downhill lane that led to the church mrs morningwood sighing down her nose and mumbling something about thanking god shed never had a child you want me to pull in by the church so we can can follow the footpaths like we did on no that would take for ever theres a track a few hundred yards further on that leads to within a stones throw of the place broken white gateposts bit rough but you should be all right if you go carefully you have a torch anywhere its behind the seat at the back ah jane for a rabbit had appeared up ahead in the dipped headlights jane slamming the brakes on roscoe falling into the well between the seats and there was a tortured scream not roscoe not the rabbit this was somebodys brakes right behind them the volvo stalled oh no it had to happen didnt it this was where the guy in whatever vehicle had nearly rearended them would come leaping down total roadrage situation bawling her out its all right mrs morningwood looking over a shoulder he hasnt hit us and he isnt getting out just carry on jane turned the key and the engine coughed and oh sh died try again mrs morningwood still looking over her shoulder and her voice was lower and toneless like with tension like she was controlling something whats wrong no sound from the vehicle behind looked like a land rover no blasts on the horn just its headlights on full beam so you couldnt look in the rearview mirror and keep your sight try again the engine fired jane went carefully into first gear let out the clutch crawled away looking for the entrance to the track keep driving jane i thought you said go keep on ill direct you but the track forget the bloody track ok whatever jane speeded up put the headlights on full beam the hedge springing up all white like a mesh of tangled bones ok whats the matter carry on to the bottom mrs morningwood said then go right is there something wrong when they reached the bottom of the road there were no headlights in the mirror was that somebody you know well go to my house mrs morningwood said it was like there was a ritual maze all around garway hill marked out in lanes worn into the landscape over centuries the rule was high hedges low ground low hedges or barbed wire meant that you were climbing but it was impossible to tell one way or the other at nightfall in the mist how many years did you have to live here before you knew where the hell you were left mrs morningwood said here this jane is where i live we just did a complete circuit i thought wed be halfway to monmouth by now stop here anywhere the mist had thinned quite a bit jane saw a row of low houses without lights they looked unnatural all the windows black when they got out of the volvo mrs morningwood put up a hand and laughed wind from the white rocks how can you tell blown a tunnel through the mist that made sense mrs morningwood went to the front door but didnt open it just shook the handle now well go round the back they followed roscoe along the path at the side of the house you could see the hulks of chicken sheds to the side and a fence where do you grow the herbs mrs morningwood garden at the back where the chickens cant get in pick quite a lot from the wild keep your voice down they came to a glassedin porch and mrs morningwood squeezed past jane and went inside picking up a torch the beam showed that the back door inside the porch was already open roscoe surging through the gap as jane said something stupid do you like usually keep it open hes been in the doors been forced spare key in one of the chicken houses mrs morningwood said nobody would know that unless theyd been watching me for quite some time hes telling me he could come back any time whenever he likes she went in briskly but breathing hard flicking switches rooms springing out at jane as the lights came on she looked at mrs morningwood her cracked barbour and her cracked face and knew that for her this wasnt like coming home any more this is where you were attacked isnt it this is where it happened thats why mum brought you yes jane was it someone you know didnt then jane looked down at roscoe who was prowling sniffing in corners his tail well down and hes been back mrs morningwood said bastards been back wants me to know they were in the kitchen there were some jars on a dresser they had screw tops the tops had been taken off and laid next to the jars mrs morningwood stood and looked at the jars but didnt touch them jane felt a stirring of fear hes not hes not here now dog would know besides i thought you had people looking after the house dawn and dusk see to the chickens what what are you going to do going to get all the rest of the herbs in the house all the preparations put them all in a bag take them away and get rid of them bottles everything you think theyve been tampered with mrs morningwood turned took jane by both arms looked into her eyes go home jane now shouldntve done this big mistake get in your car go home give your mother my apologies drive carefully what about you got my jeep but i cant go mrs morningwood whats going on here be careful at the entrance to the track visibilitys not good at the best of times youre coming back though to ledwardine mrs morningwood didnt reply following jane along the path to the volvo wet mist shivering in the lights from the house and jane knew she ought to ask her to give back the key to the master house tell you what mrs morningwood said take the dog she opened one of the rear side doors pointing roscoe looked at her and growled in mrs morningwood said you too jane jane got in and started the engine watching mrs morningwood walk back to the house not turning around stumbling once jane thought that roscoe had whimpered realizing a moment later that the small noise of distress had been in her own throat she took in a deep breath started the car drove to the entrance of the track just out of sight of the house and stopped keeping the engine running up ahead the mist had closed in again pale and shiny in the headlights like the doors of a big fridge jane got out the mobile to call mum because there really was no alternative now to a confession but there was no signal excellent in fields beverley went to answer the door and merrily stared into the dregs in the coffee cup and there was no question of disbelief for a proportion of priests being a good and altruistic person was always going to be the price you had to pay to maintain the buzz merrily remembering as usual the first time shed felt it period of personal crisis stumbling into a tiny unexpected celtic church watching the light on the walls the blue and the gold and the lamplit path a safety in stone but also transcendence the path opening up from there but there were different paths and different kinds of light staring into the brown dregs thinking about the roman catholic priest alphonse louis constant who had made friends with a teenage girl and become eliphas levi conjurer of spirits fan of baphomet while still if she was remembering this correctly stressing the importance of god in magic and the magic in god and the spark of it that some of them fed and nurtured within themselves gnostic fire the growing of the god inside she felt teddy murray at her shoulder under the gaze of garway church i suppose seen from above it does look rather as though its neck has been broken like a chickens when beverley came back into the dairy lol was with her looking worried saying to beverley whom hed never met before the turning what would she mean by the turning where merrily said spinning where is she now looking wildly in different directions from the rim of the parking area where the tarmac crumbled into dirt and weeds and signs indicated two separate footpaths she doesnt know exactly lol said dont panic she had to drive up the hill to find a signal down by the church mobiles dont work none of them apparently merrily remembered putting into the screen entering mrs morningwoods house after the attack it wouldnt have worked they might both have been dead but she thinks she can find her way back to the turning lol said on her own apart from the dog apparently well wait for her there lol bleeped open the truck merrily jumped in that bloody woman they parked in the church entrance the truck taking up most of it and walked to the top of the lane where it met the slightly wider country lane which served as garways main highway merrily had suggested that maybe lol could drive up and down looking for jane but he wouldnt leave her he told her what bliss had said about felixs killer no great shock not really whats bliss doing about this probably nothing lol said they have a result likely to stand up at an inquest the cops are overstretched cleanup rate target figures what counts theres no evidence anyway no more than a feeling backed up by blisss professional experience of what kind of murders women do and dont do why did he call then he wants you to be aware of it just in case you stir something up in my fumbling way merrily stepped into the roadway where the hell is she lol driving very very slowly just have to hope the traffic cops are too overstretched to be patrolling garway please god merrily stood there in the middle of the road the mist torn into rags by a wet breeze the tarmac shining work it out freemasonry sycharth and stourport who couldnt finger a fellow mason but said this is his voice wished shed heard him in church praying and preaching mens voices changed actors the church is a faded but still fabulous costume drama mick hunter had said that her first ambitious duplicitous womanizing bishop teddy murray wasnt like hunter not a flamboyant stage presence teddy was an actor in a longrunning drama playing a man who liked a quiet life the countryside calms and strengthens one of the functions of a parish priest is to remain centred and essentially placid which beverley had translated as passive wrong wrong wrong what did you learn in there lol said im just trying to put it all together just give me a minute and ill tell you fuchsia he had of course met fuchsia when she came running into his church after whatever happened to her in the master house fuchsia looking so like her mother disturbingly like her mother disturbing for some strong guy strong enough to carry a body across a field in the dark to the railway oh yeah he could do that he was good in fields he was excellent in fields there you go lol said he drew merrily back out of the road as headlights streaked a cottage wall with an expulsion of relief she slumped against him watching the volvo crawling round the corner and pulling in at the turning a dog barking inside almost like a real family all the angst all the tension merrily drove lol beside her jane in the back arms around the dog voice swollenup mum there was nothing i could recriminations later merrily swung into the track that led to ty gwyn and all the empty holiday homes how long since you left mrs morningwood i dont know twenty minutes half an hour when did i get through to you lol at least half an hour merrily pulled up in front of ty gwyn and they got out all of them no lights in the house the chicken houses shut down took a couple of minutes to find the house was all locked up including the back door lol shone the torch at the carport no jeep roscoe sniffed around the porch showing no great desire to go in merrily stepped back shes not here jane im not getting this what did she say she was going to do throw out the herbs and mixtures and stuff like theyd been contaminated that doesnt sound convincing does it well you can see that it might be from her point of view but no need for urgency was there merrily looked back towards the volvo look jane said if i had to take a guess go on the master house id told her i told her what happened to you in the inglenook when before we left im sorry i thought youd probably told her yourself and how did she react she was interested in the inglenook the baphomet it was like it had helped her put something together but she was in a bit of a state anyway this was after that guy you stayed with called in with your bags and roscoe you saw him you saw teddy murray well he came to the door didnt he he said youd left the bags behind and he was just passing so he it was kind of embarrassing because roscoe just like went for him went for him how shot through the doorway snarling teeth bared mum im just thinking if shes gone to the master house she wouldnt take the jeep shed walk no i dont think she would tell me about roscoe what happened me trying to drag him back didnt actually get to him i dont think the guy wanted to hang around after that though what did he say he was like oh i see youve got a guard dog two women on their own that kind of thing trying to make light of it but i think he was shaken as you would be hes not exactly a jack russell roscoe is he did he see mrs morningwood didnt leave the kitchen right merrily turned away from the house we should go we need to find her dont we teddy how much circumstantial evidence did you need ok lol said this murray the feeling im getting this is all my fault isnt it jane said you think i shouldntve brought her only the way she merrily said jane there are no circumstances i can at this moment imagine under which it wouldve been ok to bring muriel morningwood back to garway lets leave it at that for now lol backed off into the darkness shaking his head jane said im sorry am i i mean when am i going to be allowed to know what happened to her yeah well that was my mistake flower i shouldve told you mrs morningwood was raped and shes deeply traumatized either more than she knows or more than her pride will let anyone else know and that is the main reason we have to find her it was too dark to see janes face you should look for two white gateposts one broken in half straight in this time no oblique approach there was still a lot of track well overgrown the volvo whingeing and grinding in second gear feeling a wheel slip merrily pulled the car back from the rim of a ditch as the central chimney stack of the master house rose up palely in the headlights the wind rising now the last flurries of mist passing like the slipstreams of barn owls she dipped the lights stopping the car against a wedge of impacted red mud about fifty yards short of the hollow where the farmhouse lay looking big and whole and intact and solid by night like it might have looked a century ago in transit between gwilym and newton merrily switched off the engine put out all the lights and the house vanished except for a mustardy glow behind a window oh god jane said i told you lol said i dont see the jeep a landscape full of trees and hollows ground mist no moon merrily told him there could be half a dozen cars parked here and you wouldnt see them shed worked out that the light was upstairs probably the bedroom over the room with the inglenook and obviously we cant all go in i think we can lol said evenly not if we want to learn anything shes already told jane to go home and she doesnt yet know what a sensitive and discreet person you are lol so yes ill go no look youre just out here what twenty yards from the house you can watch my back yeah i can give you covering fire merrily this is the best and most direct way to expedite a difficult situation you dont know its her who else could it be lol turned his head towards jane and back at merrily hes in hereford merrily said at a lodge meeting the service tomorrow night seems to need planning its not as if we can have phone contact down here you checked yes lol snapped the phone shut nothing if you can bear to keep the windows down youll be able to hear everything for miles not the way the winds getting up you can always hear a scream merrily said trust me i can do a scream youll hear joy you at the front door under the overhanging skullshaped broken lamp merrily waited and looked back and questioned the sense of what she was doing inevitably what kept coming back was the last time shed sat in that car in a rising wind having planned to go and check out the master house thinking of how shed been shafted and then sod this im going home no guarantee that if shed come here then it would in any way have altered her opinion that fuchsia had made the whole thing up but it might have and in any case that didnt matter what mattered was giving in to the resentment after bliss told her about the special branch stomping out into the rain to walk it off and then going home anyway to moan on the phone to sophie lessons learned she pushed at the door and it yielded enough to be shouldered open the dampearth smell wafting out at her as if she was going outside not in it was colder too a kind of airless stagnant cold the floor felt hard and ridged where the decayed linoleum had been ground into it time slowed she saw a thin light falling on the cage of the iron firebasket in the inglenook a light somehow from up the chimney and as she watched it went away merrily stood for a moment listening to her own breathing her own heart and the footsteps on the stone spiral steps and there was no time for a prayer before he was standing at the foot of the stairs the wire of a hurricane lamp hanging from his fingers its low sallow flame bringing up the red stains on his surplice great minds eh teddy said he put the hurricane lamp on the floor its wick turned down low god merrily laid a palm flat on her chest feeling the ridge of the pectoral cross bloody hell teddy scared the life out of me he didnt say anything just stood there with the lamp at his feet fanning pale fronds of light over the scarred and lumpy walls he looked avuncular with his easy whitebearded smile his large teeth bright eyes forehead like the top of a brown egg walking boots just been up to the merrily put on a rueful smile called at the ridge to pick up my stuff oh merrily i dropped off the bags at your home a few hours ago yeah i know sods law teddy didnt your daughter tell you no beverley told me i mean just now havent seen jane since breakfast ive been in hereford damn thank you but i mean you shouldntve bothered anyway not a problem i was going past more or less anyway now since i was here i thought we ought to have a word clear up a few things but beverley said she didnt know where youd gone so i thought id just thought youd drop in here instead and get things ready for your requiem well yes always helps doesnt it always things on the day that youd wished youd thought of earlier like an altar its amazing how often you turn up to do a eucharist and theres nothing to use as an altar so ive got this folding talking too fast anyway you know all that stuff yes teddy said and i think its terribly brave of you to come to somewhere like this on your own after dark its just that i thought you or rather the bishop had called it all off bugger well merrily stared into the lamp i thought it was time to stand up for what i believed for a change instead of bowing to politics so i went to see him today persuaded him to let me go ahead i thought it was important i mean to do something get rid of all the years of bad feeling and rumour let this place go into a new era clean good for you merrily teddy said of course i thought id have a bit more time to make the arrangements because it wasnt going to be until saturday but then beverley said your memorial service was being held tomorrow and i obviously wanted to tie in with that that whole templar thing so well you know i didnt want it to become a circus merrily no i can understand that all these odd people who seem to turn up at anything to do with templars yes in fact i did want to its why im here teddy said sorry someone in the village was telling me that some people had been seen around the church and the master house with metal detectors treasure hunters you know we get them all the time and theyve been known to cause quite a lot of damage but well nothing on this scale before in in here if you come upstairs i can show you hell of a mess oh why im wearing this teddy plucked at the surplice its an old one i keep in the land rover to use as a kind of overall cover up my clothes oh yeah i was wondering about that what merrily could see now was that the red marks on the surplice were not blood but stone dust surprising how many clergy did that recycled old vestments he beamed at her and gestured at the stairs with one hand interesting really theres a well id heard about it of course but it was blocked up over fifty years ago by the newtons it was apparently pretty inaccessible not much use as a storage area reduced the floor space upstairs and so they bricked it up priests hole merrily oh quite a lot of papists here after the reformation an independence of spirit remaining from the time when the templars owed no money or allegiance to anyone but the pope himself quite a bit of persecution yes actually i was going to anyway what happened i saw these two guys coming up from here towards the church just before dark shouted to them and of course they took off came down here to investigate door was hanging open dust everywhere theyd ripped up the floorboards upstairs prised away the bricks exposed the cavity its in the wall back of the fireplace come and look teddy stood back from the stairs a test merrily remembered the room upstairs the smell of decay probably dead mice and rats the skeletal remains of two beds how shed thought of m r james and the room at the globe inn and if she didnt go up with him now shed be revealing fear fear of a colleague in the clergy if she did go up what problem was it rang true this story more than hers did anyway the light falling into the inglenook had been an indication of something being knocked through perhaps the wrong stones being taken out she said why would they i mean what did they expect to find what had teddy expected to find or was he going to put something in brick it up again i dont know he said ive not been able to see if you were to hold the lamp for me perhaps we might well maybe not now teddy if you dont mind best clothes oh its not too bad now the dust has settled they mustve left in quite a hurry left this behind he bent down came up holding a crowbar a long one heavyduty held it in both hands well wellprepared then merrily said templar treasure that what they were looking for do you think templar treasure he looked at her head on one side lamplight glazing his eyes what a joke is it if there was treasure it wasnt their kind of treasure gold and jewels no perhaps something much more abstract than that the essence of an ethos she was starting to feel very cold cold and scared enough to shiver mrs morningwood where was she had she been in here tonight and if she had it was crazy no rape victim would deliberately expose herself again to the rapist but how could you think that of easygoing teddy placid teddy how could anyone i keep hearing stuff about jacques de molay being here merrily said some extemplars confession jacques de molay forcing him to deny jesus christ or be put into a sack or something there was a sack in the inglenook an animalfeed sack of thick plastic maybe two ah teddy said that old tale you dont believe it confessions could be extracted without too much difficulty in those days not so easy now no to get someone to confess merrily said not so easy wondering how quickly she could get out of here if necessary how fast she could run wearing a skirt but then all she had to do was open the door and scream for lol and hed be down here in seconds ready to face teddy and his crowbar and jane merrily flinched at an image of janes soft face raked across by the sharp end of a crowbar wielded like a weapon of war like a templars she straightened up patted some red dust off her best dark blue woollen jacket you know what teddy she said i think youve been misleading us all this is so weird jane and lol had got out of the car the night wind was blowing janes hair back she faced into it i cant believe she did that lol cant believe how much shes changed even this past year or you come to that never used to notice people changing no scary really yes she didnt think hed taken his eyes off the front of that farmhouse once since mum had gone in he was like roscoe sitting upright on the grass between them jane resting a hand on the dogs neck feeling a quiver there when we came here i mean to ledwardine i had no respect for mum i despised her for being a priest for making me watch her pray and stuff how could she you know how could she put me through that thats normal lol said oh god jane i forgot eirion rang irene it was out before she could stop it he um he said you hadnt been returning his calls did he she looked at lols shape in the darkness tense he used to look very boyish in a wispy kind of way even just a couple of years ago there was grey in his hair now and he had an air of faint regret maybe the wasted years and there was still anxiety not so much about his career as a fear of losing mum and how to handle a priest he said he mustve rung about twenty times lol said he sounded pretty upset he thinks um he thinks youre having an affair with a married man coops that would be the guy yes its over jane said what hes given me what i need lol took his stare off the house for nearly a second the best places to apply for courses in archaeology jane i was thinking well if i hate the idea of the future so much like the way the worlds going why not just like immerse myself in the way it used to be you told your mum about this no why not because i wasnt certain coops took me on a field walk you just like walk a line through a field and pick things up bits of stone bits of pottery and its like youre peeling away the layers it was amazing unexpectedly amazing the feeling of i dunno contact thats fantastic jane youve found it at last yeah maybe id have to get accepted somewhere first how did he sound who eirion seriously pissedoff oh god sometimes i cant believe what a total bitch i am jane looked down at the long stone house what do you think theyre talking about in there i dont know i dont like the feel of this jane you think mrs morningwood is i mean we know nothing about her really what are we going to do about mum i dont know im not her boss yeah but you love her trouble is jane said she thinks the boss does too which oh shes inclined to trust the bugger too much if you ask me faith doesnt always win through look at all the good people he good people who get shafted destroyed happens all the time she had to stay with this nobody else was going to find out she sank her hands into her jacket pockets for warmth misleading everybody not really teddy could have been standing up in various pulpits for thirty years and preaching from the gnostic gospels and nobody would notice faith was flaccid people no longer heard congregations didnt listen i meant the templars thats all merrily keeping her voice light you like to pretend you have only a cursory knowledge but the first time we met you said you were a historian by inclination and its just not possible for a historian to live in a place like this without getting obsessed totally immersed i was going to say i bet you were so excited when you found the ridge like your like your whole life had been moving towards garway teddy looked up first in surprise and then maybe in suspicion his eyes sullen in the lamplight yes i suppose so i applied several times for this parish always went to someone else i suppose the time wasnt right and as a team minister with the other parishes i wouldnt have had the space i have now this has been a happy coincidence a time to be seized you knew a lot about them before you came the templars yes i suppose i studied quite a bit a good bit before theological college yes theology was an interesting tangent i grew up at a time when you could follow your stars merrily found a smile as it were i was born in hertfordshire theres always been a lot of templar activity around hertford itself hertfordshire to herefordshire interesting one letter and almost the whole width of a country away in hertford itself thereve always been rumours of tunnels under the town connected to the knights templar the holy grail theres still an organization there an order of templars it didnt go away secret to an extent but enough on the surface for them to call on the vatican to apologize for the inquisition of you think the vatican should apologize teddy it would just be a token gesture the templars never needed tokenism they dug out their own heritage literally from the site of solomons temple or is that a metaphor its both like garway this place is as important as solomons temple now more important because it hasnt altered apart from the odd radio mast much the same now as it was in the thirteenth century and even the mast is symbolic like the hill itself it communicates information that not everyone can receive as above so below he shrugged you get periods of great activity and illumination he said periods of urgency and this is one the only one well know in our lifetime we have to do the right thing exactly the right thing just to survive we the templars thats a state of mind is it its a state of being seven centuries ago they were the greatest combination of spiritual and physical power the western world has ever known its probably hard for a woman to understand probably yes a mocking tone merrily hell no i believe it i believe if you immerse yourself in something it creates within you enough of an illusion of power to to be power its likely to be a destructive power of course but thats what the templars did isnt it they destroyed violent guys killed the infidel and were sanctioned to do so by st bernard of clairvaux as a result of whose influence they were also granted independence of all other ecclesiastical powers except the pope himself the templar is a fearless knight st bernard said who as the body is covered with iron so the soul is the defence of the faith without doubt fortified by both arms he fears neither man nor demon teddy folded his arms over his reddened surplice smiling defence of the faith merrily said to defend faith the templar needed knowledge only knowledge cancels doubt and whos the demon baphomet hes just a symbol you know that an aspect of the green man ubiquitous the lifeforce in nature also merrily thought the sexforce in nature thinking of the night before the rape at dinner at the ridge nut roast and gossip had it occurred to teddy then over that meal that if mrs morningwood was the victim of a sex crime the list of possible suspects from her client book would direct police attention from the start far away from the master house he must have known about her all his walks his coffee stops at farms along the way or had he simply fallen in lust with the idea just like old times watching muriel from the hill fantasizing about how hed do it mild cheerful teddy murray lacing his hiking books pocketing his condoms already out there probably when merrily was taking that dispiriting early call from the bishop circling ty gwyn like a hawk in complete command of his landscape baphomet mat phobe and now at last in the unsteady glow she could see him with long hair reddish tangled around his face an eager midtwenties face bumfluff on the jawline enthusiastic full of a raging fire blown up by the bellows of testosterone and whatever other chemicals jimmy hayter had obtained that week so whos the infidel now teddy today merrily im very much afraid that term would have to include most people she didnt know if there were any antiislamic implications here didnt want to he came further into the room pushing the lantern with the toe of a walking boot propping the crowbar against the side of the inglenook are you getting what you wanted to make your historic connections more or less i admire you merrily youve taken on something that is transparently not for women and youre sticking in there thats really rather courageous thanks look if you want to get off ill carry on here for a while clear up some more of the mess he dug into a trouser pocket pulled out something white balledup snapping it apart got to take precautions all these dead rodents sure you dont want to see the priests hole in fact surgical gloves putting them on as he stepped into the inglenook dragged a yellow feed sack thick plastic out into the room and then a second one cant say they didnt come prepared obviously collecting some of the rubble in these to clear it out of the way give themselves more space if you step under here merrily and look up the chimney you can actually see into the priests oh teddy glanced back in mild annoyance to where one of the feed sacks had fallen on to its side and some of the contents spilled out over the edge of the hearth the contents included what looked like a clavicle part of a ribcage finally the top half of a skull no lower jaw with rubbery fragments of skin and black hair rolling gently with a clink into the lamp merrily screaming the scream as teddy murray casually stepped out choked off with heartinmouth shock the scream wasnt much of a scream at all in the end and by then teddy had her by the hair with one hand the other halfclawed in her face twisting his mouth up close whispering some words but the only ones she heard as he was forcing her to her knees in the dirt were joy you crumpled linen the image had formed in a hollow of powdery yellow light while lol was fighting for consciousness but with consciousness had come this unendurable pain and his senses had let go for a moment storing the one frozen tableau a man piling bones into a sack he must have passed out a third time if only momentarily because the next thing the yellow scene had gone and so had all the light lol didnt move working out where he was what had happened the blackness resolving at one stage into the velvety coffin of the broken boswell guitar confusion panic need to get up he planted a hand on the floor his shoulder screamed his head pulsed his memory rewound one blow was all he could remember and the whistling of the air before it came below the shoulder hed already damaged getting in the oak door had jammed and hed thought someone had locked it from inside and hed taken a wild run at it gone crashing through to meet the steel bar swinging out of neardarkness sending him spinning around his head ramming the door ah old oak the hardest lol cried out into the darkess in his head hands cool on his face now the soft voice from the meditation in the candlelit church black jeans and sweatshirt hair tied back can you speak oh god please the night air made it real up on the rise the wolfhound was going crazy in the volvo as if someone had gone past someone he wanted to kill and jane hearing him was going wheres mrs morningwood and wouldnt stop until theyd all gone back into the earthsmelling house where lol couldnt do the stairs jane had kept asking him if his shoulder was broken and he didnt know how were you supposed to tell he waited at the bottom of the halfspiral tense and sweating almost sick with the headache and the pain in his upper arm until they came back the mother and the daughter having found nothing up there nobody at some stage he realized that jane was doing all the talking when they were outside again he got close to merrily was able to say he touch you kind of she said once after i screamed its all right didnt hear it lol said horrified i didnt hear the scream walls are two feet thick we never thought it came back to him how they couldnt stand it any longer he and jane not either of them making a joint decision that lol should go in look he said to merrily never never do that again no you knew it might be him didnt you never again she said and clung to his good arm all the slow way back to the car hospital she said wheres the nearest abergavenny call bliss drive till we find a signal and call bliss ambulance first please lol cant let him get away have to find the bones moving sluggishly through the rutted field merrily at the wheel lol recalled his dreamlike memory of the bones and the yellow sack the scene for ever vivid with shock bones sack two sacks merrily said a whole body a skeleton in pieces he took it away in the sacks must have got out the back way jane and me upstairs just now we saw the priests hole it must have been in there all these years where anybody could have found it lol said no somebody i think it was roxanne gray told me about the priests hole which the family had blocked up many years before fifty years maybe the commune people had rediscovered it and blocked it up again with something inside someone mary lol said mary roberts mary linden need to get bliss dont move merrily said please dont move more than need to find him before the bastard dumps the bones in the river or something or hell walk away from it he saw merrily clench the wheel enjoy you she said going to enjoy you that was what he said she looked at him and he felt the scream that was going on inside her jane said hes got to be insane not just psychotic i dont think hes insane at all merrily said thats the trouble just driven towards something we cant really understand the only hope we have is that if they find that body maybe they can match the dna against fuchsia he is insane jane said leaning over from the back seat because if he thought he could putting her arms around merrily from behind and her arms were quivering if he thought he could just kill you and leave you he was wearing surgical gloves merrily turned to jane and he wouldnt have just left me when we were upstairs just now and we looked down into the priests hole struck me then that it was vacant it had a vacancy as they reached the top road at the turning she started to laugh dangerously close to hysteria and then she said not even sounding surprised hes there lol saw a flash out in the road lit up in headlights the surplice billowing lit up in headlights but not from the volvo merrily braked hard and the volvo stalled as was its habit an engine roar and he flew up like a swan this great white flapping thing merrily was out of the car before teddy murray hit the tarmac she saw a wheel of the jeep rolling easily over his head and she heard one of those sounds you knew you were never going to forget for the rest of your life the crunching of his shiny skull like an egg in the road long minutes then of people continuously fading in and out of cottages and unseen farms like a video rewinding atmosphere of nearmute horror merrily trying several times to talk to mrs morningwood and failing only getting close when the emergency services arrived and mrs morningwood was leaning against a wall head in her hands rocking backwards and forwards like a child on a fairground ride blood and tears oozing between her fingers the back of the ambulance yawning and the most senior paramedic telling mrs morningwood that she had to come with them and getting reminded that while it might be a police state it wasnt yet an nhs state look at you the woman paramedic said calmly look at your face your neck look at your eyes please my dear these are serious injuries at least let us check you out in the its what i do its what i do you idiot whats she talking about the paramedic said does anybody know shes a herbalist merrily said oh well thats a big help then isnt it if shes got a fractured skull that is blood in her hair you know i do think youd better go with them one of the police said we can take your statement later you can take my statement now mrs morningwood peeling herself from the wall merrily saw a cop carrying road closed signs from a blue van the wind was dying and the mist was coming back swirling down from the hill mrs morningwood limped into the road towards the jeep and a policewoman held her back and she started to weep again cant you get him out dont look madam thats my advice do you think im some sort of innocent you think i dont know what ive done ive killed the poor fucking vicar a policeman said to merrily is that your car madam the volvo and she nodded and the copper said did you see what happened and lol came over and merrily thought this was going to be the best time to get him into the ambulance i saw it lol said quietly you couldnt miss him all in white he just ran out into the road wasnt even walking he was running i dont think theres anything she couldve done merrily stared at him he looked past her well need to take a proper statement sir the policeman said what happened to your arm lol explained that his friend had had to brake hard to avoid running into the jeep and he mustnt have had his seat belt on properly went into the windscreen with his head the arm he wasnt sure right if you give your name to my colleague and then lets get you into the ambulance itll be ok honestly im sorry sir but all injuries at the scene of an accident no problem lol tried to put both hands up managed one anything i can do he looked over at mrs morningwood shes going to be traumatized for life he just just came out its true jane said from behind merrily theres no way she couldve avoided him merrily glanced back at jane it sent a pain into her neck from when teddys hand had slammed into her face twisting her head round different person like the templars sometimes pastoral peacefully monastic then the sword out red to the hilt merrily stared at jane and jane stared back defiant she didnt have a chance jane said another cop was asking mrs morningwood where shed been going at the time of the accident and mrs morningwood was saying i was looking for my dog my dogs escaped you havent seen a dog anywhere have you merrily looked at teddys body no need to cover it because the surplice was up over his face moulded to it by the blood and tissue and brain matter crumpled linen cleansing saturday evening merrilys alb an appeal for purity and simplicity now had dirtstains on both arms and across one shoulder as if emblematic of the kind of soiled priest who concealed rape murder or was just a doormat pray for doormat on the back door she drew a cross in holy water and asked that by the holy and cleansing power of god this entrance might be blessed muriel morningwood took off her dark glasses her eyes were black and red and still glaring with tears a lot of tears these past two days hows his wife taken it i wouldnt like to say merrily looked around i think we need to do every room her alb had a cord at the waist like the templars used to wear under the cross youve seen her though i assume her son was coming over today to pick her up unsurprisingly shell be putting the place on the market beverley murray face of scrubbed stone looking at merrily as if convinced she or god or both were in some way behind this merrily had told her nothing beverley had said shed have left teddy eventually but merrily didnt think she would have they tended not to clergy wives or not for a long time you think he beat her mrs morningwood asked i think he was oblivious of her much of the time focused on his own perceived role in some kind of alternative history and she just got on with it one roof two lives in the washhouse or utility room or whatever well there were still pegs on the wall where coats would have hung merrily put down the flask of holy water a sense of everything moving past her out of control a sense of blur all the rushing spirits waves of panic please god calm she straightened up at some stage you might stop looking at me like that mrs morningwood said maybe or not despair soaked in again merrily picked up the flask of holy water hugged it to her bosom you never knew anybody quite well enough never sure who to trust and yet you did have to trust its a slippery slope merrily siân callaghanclarke had said letting trust slip away and support support for the insupportable what have we done muriel we mrs morningwood put her glasses back on youve done nothing at all darling except perhaps step over the edge of other peoples madness even though she knew he wouldnt be back muriel would have new locks put on the doors life she said was a series of kneejerks stable doors banging in the night shed refused to come back to ledwardine had gone alone to the house at the end of the holiday cottages to sleep downstairs on the chaise longue with the dog well to lie there no herbs would have produced restful sleep that night or the next it had all finally come down on mrs morningwood shed brought it down one big kneejerk connecting a foot with an accelerator pedal eccentric deranged beverley murray had said the way she drives around in that big jeep taking corners too fast who is muriel morningwood frannie bliss had asked yesterday having looked at the report from traffic a heavilyloaded question and merrily had given him the need to know waiting for him to mention the discovery of bones but he never had it would come this morning with arrangements for the requiem finalized shed driven over to ty gwyn finding it clean as a pharmacy sterile something sucked out unexpectedly mrs morningwood had asked her to bless the house and the greenhouse and the garden where herbs were grown and chickens pecked around jane said hed been inside again meddling with the herbs unscrewing jars sniffing i expect why dont know theyve all gone now but youll get more i expect so i need the money that wasnt all hed been through the drawers found marys letter took that and some photos would he have known you had that letter no way he could unless fuchsia you showed it to fuchsia mrs morningwood had nodded i dont know about this do i merrily said i dont know the half of it with the afternoon seeping damply away lord stourport stood at the edge of a copse wet leaves around his shoes they werent even there then these trees im pretty sure and im good at land its like looking back at a different lifetime meaning we were different people but that was the easy way out lol thought hayter said whats she doing in there your woman trying to make the place feel a bit calmer before the requiem and that draws a line under it does it the requiem just starts the process i think i do not like this jimmy hayter said i shouldnt be here hed arrived over an hour early while merrily was still setting out the folding altar in front of the inglenook mrs morningwood had walked over to join her and jane had taken roscoe for a walk it was an hour or so from sunset lols head still aching if he moved too fast or turned his back to the wind you could still go to the cops hayter said and i dont yet believe you wont it was why hed come and why gwilym would come too nervous and with every reason not out of the woods yet maybe never would be no cops so far lol said apart from traffic cops apparently theres um in garway theres a long tradition of independence they walked up to the top of the rise and now you could see the skewed sandy tower of garway church ok jimmy hayter said ill tell you we did know him before murray we were at cambridge together there was a magic society like you got at a lot of universities recreated the rituals of the golden dawn then the heavier stuff i was in it for a while so was pierre most of us a bit of fun murray it took over his life to the extent he shuffled off with a disappointing second me saying idve thought hed be able to magic up a better fucking degree than that he didnt care this was his lifes path so he wasnt doing theology or nah he was doing women and drugs all kinds all this carlos castaneda stuff was fashionable then mescaline jimson weed the way of the warrior my guess is thats what got him into the templars european spiritual warriors monks in armour the templars did drugs maybe he thought so apparently they introduced a lot of herbs into europe from north africa hed try anything for a new experience and women like i say he was good at women urbane diffident most of the time then hed just turn it on focus you know like a laser hed focus on a woman and hed make it happen and then when she was crazy for him hed lose interest go cold on her the making it happen was all how did he wind up here with you then we had money he didnt scholarship boy from a family of modest means unlike my merchantbanker friend pierre who was into the backtonature bit funny that isnt it one bad experience of nature red in tooth and fucking claw and pierres been in the city ever since so who actually found this place teddy or mat as we were instructed to call him mat phobe we never worked that out you know doing drugs it can take you months to master word games like woodstock f u c k whats that spell fuck knows hayter cackled and stood on a green mound looking down at the master house he was well into the templar stuff by then and we knew nothing very excited when he found out that the place we were actually living in had connections he had us doing excavations digging up the floors taking stones out of the walls we kept moving furniture around to cover up the current hole in case the owners came in like the pows at colditz he always thought there was a tunnel to the church find anything nah mat also had this idea that when jacques de molay came he brought something with him to hide at garway because it was so remote he was thinking the mappa mundi or a prototype nobody really knows where that came from or how it wound up in hereford but it was evidently made around the end of the thirteenth century which fits he kept going into hereford to look at it in the cathedral dragging us along or one of the girls never seemed much to me not exactly great art not much of a map so what its a very templar creation shows jerusalem as the centre of the world no ive got it wrong actually he didnt think there was a prototype of the mappa mundi at garway he thought the mappa mundi was the prototype all those symbols and strange creatures around it but theyre quite roughly drawn he was convinced there was a finished version hidden somewhere a perfect magical map connecting the world to the universe a total concept he thought theyd created it as a kind of magical control thing and that that was gonna be teddy murrays holy grail and he thought it was still hidden at garway lol looked around and saw an intimate enclosed landscape small mellow fields encrusted with autumn woodland dipping to the sandstone church warmth shelter despite last night he liked it here maybe a cave under the hill or even under the master house hayter said he was ingesting a lot of stuff and it got crazy he thought hed find out by asking spirits and demons walking the hill tripping out wed do these invocations and hed get messages we wouldnt just him and gwilym once the glyndwr link mat said glyndwr was a magician a templar and a prince and he would have learned the whereabouts of this secret chamber temple whatever a magical link had to be made between gwilym and his ancestor this took weeks making the poor bastard fast and bathe daily in the monnow and wash his balls or whatever in the holy well all kinds of mystical shit and that about gwilym speaking welsh did that actually happen couldnt tell you cocker none of us could understand a bleeding word its a mugs game you dont get anything you can see or touch or put in the bank nothing except the feeling of something out there playing with you end of the day you just come out with your health ruined your humanity eroded and fuckall else and yet he wanted to come back well i say fuck all i think he did find something something he didnt want to share how do you know about it then lol sat down under a hawthorn tree resting his left arm on his knee at nevill hall hospital outside abergavenny theyd found a very deep bruise but no fracture still hurt quite a bit though right across the shoulder and it was scary because he couldnt hold a guitar and something hurt when he formed chords his best guitar smashed his chord arm was he being told something this was in the last days hayter said he wanted us out of the way he wanted to be alone there i told you how i had to go to london see my old man seemed very convenient lol said also he wasnt quite alone was he the girl mary yeah this mary turns up again and says shes had a baby and she wants it to grow up with a father which of you would that be dunno dunno to this day anyway she didnt mean she wanted a father she meant she wanted money a packet for starters well id spent up on the lease on this place and a surfeit of substances to abuse and my old man wasnt exactly flush and gwilym he had a triumph spitfire to support and a dad with no need of a spare granddaughter that was when mat said take a weekend away ill deal with it just like that look it was cowardly and irresponsible but we were cowards and we were irresponsible and we were young and we came back mary was gone and a day or so later we were raided by the police and that was an end of it and i was very glad to get away only i didnt and neither did gwilym hed got us where he wanted us you didnt even have proof she had a baby she had photos we kept staring at them see which one of us she looked like kid looked like all of us with darker skin mary said she was living in this place where there were a lot of hard guys whod come and get heavy with us end of the day it was blackmail extortion and blackmailers get what they deserve robinson look we didnt think hed killed her what did you think hed done he had no money i dont gritted teeth know we werent there we didnt care lol said nothing thinking of the magical chemical hell of the girls last days hayter leaned against the treetrunk few years later when im getting into some good money through musicpromo hes back in touch somewhat reluctantly we have a meeting him and me and sycharth on neutral ground in evesham i think it was he looks different short hair suit he tells us that mary died in the course of a ritual i cant believe this jimmy yeah well if youd been there you would have mat tells us hes been to theological college and hes a curate now that was the bit we couldnt believe reckons its going to be a breeze not great money but a free house couple of days a week mouthing simplistic platitudes at old people and the rest of the time you can do what you like and you never get fired lol thought of merrily shook his head slowly shed told him what murray may have done to his last church in gloucestershire to build a case for stress early retirement he says its therefore in his interests that elements of his past should never be revealed hayter said and hes sure its the same for us too well it was certainly the same for sycharth me less so but the thought of being implicated in a bad death that whole michael barrymore scene only worse because the body was still there nightmare yeah he said it was quite safe unlikely to be found he thought that did you even know where hed put it wouldnt tell us that if he was the only one that knew wed go on needing him he said one day he was going back there like it was his destiny great things to be discovered maybe he was still talking about the map maybe something else i dont know but he knew gwilym wanted the place back in his family because of the glyndwr thing and when it happened he said hed dispose of the body theres incentive lol said meanwhile we needed to stick together mat had a proposition that he said would formally bind us together in secrecy oh lol almost smiled like brothers for the record i had no particular wish to become a freemason standing there stripped to the waist some old fart prodding you with a sword you feel like a dick you have to be invited to join dont you yeah well he fixed all that he was already in hed wanted to get in for the masonic secrets wherein great templar secrets were preserved i didnt get it then and i dont get it now but some guys this search for secret knowledge theyll do anything and masonry it frees you up in other areas of your life find you dont have to worry about money or support so you did it yeah i did it and they were pleased to have me a young businessman with a title in the pipeline course its heavier than you think its gonna be and no you dont go back on the oath trust me not even if you know a brothers done a murder hayter ignored that the extraordinary thing mat said next time we meet youll both be on the pathway to a material success youd never dreamt of and that was true are there masonic contacts lol asked him in the music business not many but i have been successful in unexpected ways saved the old homestead the way the old man never managed and sycharth hes gone more masonic than i ever did and hes into big contacts and big money you look at the prime new developments around hereford youll keep coming across the name gwilym in the small print struggling farmer to master of the fucking universe he wasnt hugely successful though was he mat got what he wanted made it back into garway to pursue his dream of inheriting the great templar legacy de molay glyndwr murray when a suitable property came available he got the signal from sycharth and sycharth greased the wheels mat buys the ridge having found a woman with the readies he could always find a woman whatever kind he needed at any particular time this case one with money to spare poor bitch so hes camped up here walking the hills and waiting for gwilym to buy back the house gwilym told me murray said the time was coming it would happen around the anniversary of the inquisition hed seen the signs all this shit points out the significance of people by the name of gray you know about that ok well then this guy gray develops ms he wasnt claiming hayter shrugged bad prayers robinson the power of bad prayers this gets sicker jimmy in the bedroom next to the chimney the light was the purple of bruises the smell of decay was worse and the two bedframes looked merrily thought like medieval appliances for obtaining confessions the holy water glittered mauve merrily said heavenly father who never sleeps bless this room and guard with your continued watchfulness all who take rest within within these walls muriel morningwood picked a cobweb from merrilys alb with hindsight the alb had not been a good idea in a corner of the room the floorboards had been removed stones and cement hacked out revealing the priests hole from an oblique angle you could see down into the hearth where murray had removed more stones so that the bones could be tipped directly down into the waiting sacks merrily lowered herself into the space it seized her like a trap rubble dirt a stench she didnt want to breathe her throat felt raw and constricted and she remembered the lesions on muriels neck it wouldnt have taken much you wouldnt know me muriel theres nothing of me no more i am so thin and my head feels like a rotten egg sometimes and what can you do with a rotten egg oh god bless this space where mary lay croaking out the words sprinkling out the water hadnt lain here at all had probably been arranged squatting strangled stripped of any residual dignity may her spirit rest in peace and may the light of christ rest upon her and in this place when she finished mrs morningwood had turned away never said she was a saint probably trying to get money out of them needed to make a life for the child didnt want to be in a tepee for ever which i suppose brings us to fuchsia merrily said where all this began for both of us i suspect glasses in her hand mrs morningwood stood at the top of the halfspiral lit by a diagonal shaft from a cracked skylight merrily three steps below on the curve i havent been one hundred per cent truthful about fuchsia no kidding when she first came to see me with barlow and you recognized her i obviously had to see her again on her own whispered it to her as they were leaving and she was back the same afternoon sat her down on the chaise longue and made some herbal tea for relaxation of the mind mrs morningwood backed away along the landing agitated i asked her how shed got her name fuchsia and she said she didnt know she said people had told her that fuchsia was a character from mervyn peake and shed read titus and said how much she liked that kind of book and then i asked her if she liked m r james because hed been here and it turned out shed read a few of his stories and i told her the story id told jane that id got from my mother why told her several local stories she loved them she was eager for more me i was simply putting off the moment wanting her to trust me eventually we went for a walk on the hill where mary and i had walked all those years ago that was when i told her mrs morningwood shook her head in some sadness she was wearing a cream cotton dress and a grey woollen cardigan and looked almost demure merrily said and and everything changed i thought she was putting me on thought it was joke you know but i can see her now backing away into the sun arms out warding me off didnt want to know didnt want to know about her mother had her own amorphous fantasy princess rather than prostitute theres this kind of tribal mysticism in tepee city felix had said and she had a period of building fires in a clearing in the wood and looking for mary in the smoke what did you tell her had happened to mary disappeared tried to downplay the seedy side but the damage was done didnt want to hear any more at all next thing barlow the builder comes banging on the door asking me what sort of rubbish ive been feeding her because fuchsia cant work in that house any more so she passed on to felix what youd told her because if he knew that when i saw him he certainly wasnt letting on no she came out with the m r james story the dustsheets the face of linen shed read that story and shed played it well hadnt she in the church of st cosmas and st damien who is this who is coming and still merrilys feeling was that the desire for a blessing had been real that fuchsia had felt menaced by the house by her mothers ghost then just as mary had felt an estrangement not exactly unknown in the annals of motherdaughter psychology from the infant fuchsia the baby cries whenever shes with me thats not how it should be and because of felixs feelings for mary shed wanted him out of there too as if she thought mary would come between them the coincidence of him bringing fuchsia here that terrified her muriel morningwood said maybe she thought hed been here too that he was her father and you wondered that as well although now i think mary simply used him soon as shed learned felix had some money in the background pulling that stunt with the cord saying he mustve been chosen by the baby as its godfather or guardian or what you will making provision for the child ah a light coming on and you thought fuchsia mightve killed him because of what youd told her so not only had you failed to save the mother youd driven the daughter over the edge you could have told me this the other night muriel told you enough that night was feeling pretty shellshocked generally merrily stared at the wall had there been some kind of psychic experience perhaps while actually working in a room concealing the skeleton of her mother if ever there was a situation crying out for the paranormal anything else youre not telling me muriel not intentionally no well muriel raised her eyes towards the skylight sycharth until you told me i didnt know for certain hed been here in the seventies but i suppose i wanted him to have been involved i said hed made a play for me truth is id made a play for him a year or so earlier no taste at that age and he did have a triumph spitfire bastard had me then sneered called me a whore oh that certainly explained the hostility well hes a worried man now muriel merrily went back to the stairwell brushing red stonedust from the alb look before we go down to that room id like to try and get the sequence right did fuchsia go rushing into the church finding teddy there before she first came to see you my feeling now is she saw him at least twice if he was as shocked as me the first time hed surely be a bloody sight more shocked he mightve been looking at his daughter and more than that looking into the face of someone hed murdered murray had said when the girl turned up here asking for protection sanctuary i confess i was completely thrown yes merrily said hed have to know wouldnt he hed want to see her again what about last saturday she almost certainly came back here last saturday on her own because i spoke to felix on the phone and he was very uptight convinced shed been back taken the van key to the master house missing why would she do that though maybe deciding shed have to deal with it or it was going to torment her for ever i dont know were unlikely ever to know but is it possible she saw teddy murray then and is it possible she told teddy murray what youd told her about mother and perhaps he followed her home mrs morningwood said just as he followed jane and me yesterday what back here from your vicarage he obviously recognized the dog he wouldve waited on the square in his land rover he had patience that man yes and then if hed followed fuchsia home returned to monkland the following evening the lonely caravan a blunt instrument like a crowbar and an element of surprise there was no way of knowing which of them hed killed first or how hed gone about it whether felix had been a target or collateral damage or as fuchsias body had been loaded into the land rover part of a murdersuicide scenario had he enjoyed it all of it the way the knights templar had evidently delighted in killing for their cause the two sides of the templars pastoral and monastic and then the gleeful savagery the ecstasy of blood a mercedes x drew up in front of the master house nobody got out sycharth jimmy hayter said hell wait till the last minute before he goes in this is gonna be hard for him especially with gray here lol said your meeting with him yesterday robinson watch my lips hayters lips were a flat line murray wanted you both back for his service though lol said didnt he the memorial service which would have been held yesterday and wasnt several men in suits whom word hadnt reached in time had arrived to find a blackedged card on the door informing wouldbe worshippers that owing to the tragic and sudden death of the rev edward murray all services should be considered cancelled until further notice some consternation apparently maybe the original plan was to do something here lol said continue some process murray had started thirtyodd years ago yeah maybe hed been studying all that time been through degrees of masonry i didnt know existed but then despite grays illness gwilym didnt manage to get the house back and it was sold very symbolically to the duchy of cornwall so you had to arrange it at the church no it was always going to be the church hayter said the church is alltemplar he was going to bring something to the church that would reconnect the wires as he put it what we werent privileged to know youre lying again jimmy robinson you hayter dug his fingers into the grooves of the hawthorn gwilym and me we met to decide what to do about him wed had enough what like you broke the boswell thats how i wanted to play it yes frankly and knew the right people like he claimed to have made mr gray ill think how that backfired jimmy look robinson we didnt do anything gwilym said let me talk to him and he did and the agreement was after the seven hundredth anniversary that would be it murrays side of it was to remove the body if it turned up during restoration wed be well in the shit not murray because nobody ever suspects the vicar do they unless its choirboys or kiddieporn and what was your side of the deal hayters mouth flatlined you know he took the bones away dont you lol said what he took them away in a couple of plastic feedsacks how do you know that only theyve disappeared they could be anywhere now hayter sprang off the tree and you could almost see the sweat rising like sap before they stepped inside the inglenook merrily did st patricks breastplate mrs morningwood repeating every line whether she believed any of this was anybodys guess but she went along with it in the torchlight baphomet mrs morningwood felt around the coarse sardonic sandstone contours of his ageless face you know its actually quite old id thought it would be some sort of replica the kind of thing you get from garden centres why did you think that because when jane told me about it i assumed it had been put here by stourports rabble i thought that was what you were picking up in here i do accept these things i may be cynical but that doesnt make me a sceptic yeah well im supposed to be sceptical and analytical about this stuff but i was affected and i cant explain it and i still dont know why it made you encourage a learner driver to bring you over here oh lord i didnt know that darling apologies the reason i wanted to see it and as things turned out it was damned prescient was that jane pointed out quite rightly that it was inside the inglenook and facing the back wall facing the priests hole in fact which id heard about years ago from roxannes mother as it happens you wanted to come here and look if the hole had at some stage been unblocked it made sense i did think mary was dead i did think theyd killed her and having the face of baphomet gazing at the tomb that seemed to me the disgusting kind of conceit that theyd have gone in for i was half right and half wrong this is old could be as old as the one in the church and yet its not quite like the one in the church as i remember it merrily said it has been removed though darling look thats modern cement isnt it some of its already been chipped away this is part of what murray came for you have a chisel crowbar be ok splendid hed left it in the hearth if this wasnt the instrument of felixs death it could have been fuchsia too whatever it had been held by the same hands merrily held it across both of hers didnt move faced mrs morningwood over the iron firebasket did you kill him deliberately muriel muriel turned slowly from the stone lifted her head exposing her throat the bloodied dents of thumbnails around the windpipe yes merrily said i know hed learned from fuchsia that i knew whose child she was he knew that after fuchsias death i wasnt going to leave it alone he knew obviously from sycharth about my family history he knew that i was talking to you because you told him no reason not to or so i thought and he knew that people in my line of work sometimes get raped and murdered and he enjoyed it without remorse he was never a christian did you intend to kill him muriel i need to know had you been waiting being patient and watchful the way he was you dont want to be an accessory darling or your lovely boyfriend or your extraordinary daughter so dont ask me stupid questions because ive gone through a kind of purgatory and id go through it again now give me the bloody crowbar thank you mrs morningwood prised away a lump of cement as i thought what happened to the bones merrily said back off or youll get dust in your eyes is it conceivable you saw where murray put the bones how would that be possible let me take you through it theres a narrow public footpath just along from the turning goes between two cottages down to the church then links to the path leading here if somebody happened to be parked nearby watching teddy murray dragging two sacks up the field this person might notice where hed put them temporarily before using that footpath to make his way back to the road and the turning giving the watcher time to get back to his or her car switch on the engine and wait for him to appear on the road with metaphoricallyspeaking a big red cross in the centre of his surplice i suppose a vivid imagination is sometimes quite useful in your job we looked everywhere lol and jane and me most of the morning he wasnt carrying them when he walked sorry ran into the road we thought he must have hidden them somewhere but evidently theyd been picked up by then youre wasting your time and mine not that youd be the first person anyone would suspect what with all the injuries you received in the accident the eyes the lip the neck the head dont think the terrible poetry of all this has been entirely lost on me shine the torch up here would you why did you get me to bless your garden this morning muriel do you want to know whats here or not they could connect marys dna with fuchsia find out the truth truth both hands inside the stone muriel began to ease something slowly towards what passed for light under here truth is not whats settled in courts or reported in the papers truth simply exists muriel this makes no sense darling it makes garway sense hold out your hands requiem the first of them to come in was adam eastgate hooded eyes military scrutiny looking around at the drabness and the pitted plaster the floor that was halfflags and halflinoleum shrivelled and longembedded like mummified skin and he sighed we dont often make mistakes maybe it was one of his sayings well merrily said if youre thinking of selling it on id urge you to vet any potential purchaser extremely carefully but i expect you do that anyway i dont recall mentioning selling it eastgate said that would be a bit defeatist adam sorry this is mrs morningwood aye i know he said which was unexpected shed been thinking that if muriel hadnt been here now might have been the best time to ask adam eastgate again about those threatening communications the duchy had received the ones possibly containing welsh phrases perhaps suggesting that the prince of waless purchase of templar properties on the welsh border had been noted probably with disfavour letters which if you were looking for an author might point towards a welshman fanatically proud of his familys links with the greatest national hero of all time or less obviously but more likely in merrilys view to someone who had no cause to love this welshman and a personal need which could no longer be suppressed to let light into dark places some of us do know our welsh pronunciations but cant resist taking the piss merrily eastgate said you look if you dont mind me saying so like youve been doing a spot of cleaning yes well she pushed hair back from her face women in the clergy not afraid to get our hands dirty and erm everything else he smiled he still looked less than comfortable so thisll be for felix will it and the woman going to be a bit nonspecific adam straightforward eucharist quite short relating to a number of people who had connections with this place and if i could just say this what happened to felix that may not be quite what you think its quite important we dont blame fuchsia im telling everyone this she watched mrs morningwood approaching eastgate gripping his arm ah i know who you are now recognise the geordie accent youre the chap who left a message on my machine the other day been away you see just a query mrs mornington wood aye sorry i was just given your number only i gather youre quite well known as a herbalist and a healer kind of thing and not the only one in this area quite a few in the general area involved in different disciplines eight nine perhaps merrily shot her a look eastgate said so if this place and im talking off the record and in a very tentative way were to become assuming it could be done without damaging the character a centre for alternative health do you think that would have local support mrs morningwood wrinkled her nose theres a good possibility bloody hell merrily remembered jane raising the idea not entirely seriously this is a bit sudden adam not really it wouldve come down from the place things come down from eastgate said as jane herself came in holding the door open for roxanne gray pushing paul in his wheelchair to within a few feet of the relic that mrs morningwood had found in the inglenook john a text often used during funeral services with or without the requiem eucharist she read it to the gathering on the first day of the week mary magdalene came to the tomb early except for paul gray in his wheelchair the congregration was standing adam eastgate at one end sycharth gwilym at the other tightfaced uneasy no sense of a man whod come home in the middle roxanne and mrs morningwood lord stourport on his own by the door hands in pockets breathing down his nose next to him lol and jane and at their feet lying down nose between his front paws the dog that mrs morningwood had said would refuse to come in here it was the biggest congregation youd get in garway this particular weekend it added up to nine people peter then came out with the other disciple and they went toward the tomb they both ran but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first and stooping to look in he saw the linen cloths lying there on the portable altar a simple white cloth wine and actual bread to celebrate the eucharist a requiem then for some people she could name one she couldnt and one she was she was still agonizing about and would do right up to the moment in front of the altar on a trestle theyd found in the barn where a coffin might be at a funeral was the sandstone urn size of a small chalice recovered from a recess half the size of a breadoven behind the face of the baphomet theyd managed to remove the top she and mrs morningwood some powder in the bottom had to be ashes lol had told her what stourport had said about teddy murrays intention to bring something into the church for his gnostic masonic service shed asked his advice and lol had said do it if anybody needed it merrily let the ritual unwind at its own pace still unsure listening there was no name on the sandstone urn no words at all for all she knew there could be dozens of these all over europe there wouldve been a lot of ashes no clues when it had been walled up or who had first brought it here but it made sense merrily took a breath picked up the urn kept her voice fairly low she commended to god the souls of fuchsia mary linden and felix barlow and in her head in a second of silence mary roberts linden sleeping in the herb garden she cleared her throat the marks on her alb were like smuts on a spectator backing away from the flames into the shadow of the cathedral of notre dame or maybe the smears on a doormat do this we also commend to gods keeping the soul of jacques de molay she looked up briefly and saw janes eyes widening didnt look at other eyes knowing he died in pain and persecution we pray to god to forgive him and bring him eternal light and peace may the peace of god which passes all understanding be with him now and in this place at some point the door blew open the dog stirred and whimpered and the wind came in from the white rocks closing credits the mysteries
