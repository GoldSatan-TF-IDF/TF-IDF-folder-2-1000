and then on other days it just rains indeed do many things come to pass lord omar khayaam ravenhurst ksc the book of predications the honest book of truth it was the year when they finally immanentized the eschaton on april the worlds great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before all because of an obscure island named fernando poo by the time international affairs returned to their normal coldwar level some wits were calling it the most tasteless april fools joke in history i happen to know all the details about what happened but i have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make sense to most readers for instance i am not even sure who i am and my embarrassment on that matter makes me wonder if you will believe anything i reveal worse yet i am at the moment very conscious of a squirrelin central park just off sixtyeighth street in new york citythat is leaping from one tree to another and i think that happens on the night of april or is it the morning of april but fitting the squirrel together with fernando poo is for the present beyond my powers i beg your tolerance there is nothing i can do to make things any easier for any of us and you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice just as i accept the compulsion to speak out even though i am painfully aware that i am talking to an invisible perhaps nonexistent audience wise men have regarded the earth as a tragedy a farce even an illusionists trick but all if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play roles most of us being very poorly coached and totally unrehearsed before the curtain rises is it too much if i ask tentatively that we agree to look upon it as a circus a touring carnival wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years and producing new monsters and miracles hoaxes and bloody mishaps wonders and blunders but never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving one by one and returning to their homes for a long and bored winters sleep under the dust then say for a while at least that i have found an identity as ringmaster but that crown sits uneasily on my head if i have a head and i must warn you that the troupe is small for a universe this size and many of us have to double or triple our stints so you can expect me back in many other guises indeed do many things come to pass for instance right now i am not at all whimsical or humorous i am angry i am in nairobi kenya and my name is if you will pardon me nkrumah fubar my skin is black does that disturb you it doesnt me and i am like most of you midway between tribalism and technology to be more blunt as a kikuyu shaman moderately adjusted to city life i still believe in witchcrafti havent yet the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses it is april and fernando poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running so i hope you will forgive me when i admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying and is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of america russia and china you guessed it i am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a month if they wont let me sleep i wont let them sleep that is justice in a sense in fact the president of the united states had several severe migraines during the following weeks but the atheistic rulers of moscow and peking were less susceptible to magic they never reported a twinge but wait here is another performer in our circus and one of the most intelligent and decent in the lothis name is unpronounceable but you can call him howard and he happens to have been born a dolphin hes swimming through the ruins of atlantis and its april alreadytime is moving im not sure what howard sees but it bothers him and he decides to tell hagbard celine all about it not that i know at this point who hagbard celine is never mind watch the waves roll and be glad there isnt much pollution out here yet look at the way the golden sun lights each wave with a glint that curiously sparkles into a silver sheen and watch watch the waves as they roll so that it is easy to cross five hours of time in one second and find ourselves amid trees and earth with even a few falling leaves for a touch of poetry before the horror where are we five hours away i told youfive hours due west to be precise so at the same instant that howard turns a somersault in atlantis sasparilla godzilla a tourist from simcoe ontario she had the misfortune to be born a human being turns a neat nosedive right here and lands unconscious on the ground this is the outdoor extension of the museum of anthropology in chapultepec park mexico df and the other tourists are rather upset about the poor ladys collapse she later said it was the heat much less sophisticated in important matters than nkrumah fubar she didnt care to tell anybody or even to remind herself what had really knocked her over back in simcoe the folks always said harry godzilla got a sensible woman when he married sasparilla and it is sensible in canada or the united states to hide certain truths no at this point i had better not call them truths let it stand that she either saw or imagined she saw a certain sinister kind of tight grin or grimace cross the face of the gigantic statue of tlaloc the rain god nobody from simcoe had ever seen anything like that before indeed do many things come to pass and if you think the poor lady was an unusual case you should examine the records of psychiatrists both institutional and private for the rest of the month reports of unusual anxieties and religious manias among schizophrenics in mental hospitals skyrocketed and ordinary men and women walked in off the street to complain about eyes watching them hooded beings passing through locked rooms crowned figures giving unintelligible commands voices that claimed to be god or the devil a real witchs brew for sure but the sane verdict was to attribute all this to the aftermath of the fernando poo tragedy the phone rang at am the morning of april numbly dumbly mopingly gropingly out of the dark i find and identify a body a self a task goodman i say into the receiver propped up on one arm still coming a long way back bombing and homicide he electrically eunuchoid voice in the transmitter tells me i sleep naked sorry about that and im putting on my drawers and trousers as i copy the address east sixtyeighth street near the council on foreign relations moving i say hanging up what is rebecca mumbles from the bed shes naked too and that recalls very pleasant memories of a few hours earlier i suppose some of you will be shocked when i tell you im past sixty and shes only twentyfive it doesnt make it any better that were married i know this isnt a bad body for its age and seeing rebecca most of the sheets thrown aside reminds me just how good it is in fact at this point i dont even remember having been the ringmaster or what echo i retain is confused with sleep and dream i kiss her neck unselfconsciously for she is my wife and i am her husband and even if i am an inspector on the homicide squadhomicide north to be exactany notions about being a stranger in this body have vanished with my dreams into air into thin air what rebecca repeats still more asleep than awake damned fool radicals again i say pulling on my shirt knowing any answer is as good as another in her halfconscious state um she says satisfied and turns over into deep sleep again i washed my face somewhat tired old man watching me from the mirror and ran a brush through my hair just time enough to think that retirement was only a few years away and to remember a certain hypodermic needle and a day in the catskills with my first wife sandra back when they at least had clean air up there socks shoes tie fedora and you never stop mourning as much as i loved rebecca i never stopped mourning sandra bombing and homicide what a meshuganah world do you remember when you could at least drive in new york at three in the morning without traffic jams those days were gone the trucks that were banned in the daytime were all making their deliveries now everybody was supposed to pretend the pollution went away before dawn papa used to say saul saul they did it to the indians and now theyre doing it to themselves goyische narrs he left russia to escape the pogrom of but i guess he saw a lot before he got out he seemed like a cynical old man to me then and i seem like a cynical old man to others now is there any pattern or sense in any of it the scene of the blast was one of those old office buildings with gothicandgingerbread styling all over the lobby floor in the dim light of the hour it reminded me of the shadowy atmosphere of charlie chan in the wax museum and a smell hit my nostrils as soon as i walked in a patrolman lounging inside the door snapped to attention when he recognized me took out the seventeenth floor and part of the eighteenth he said also a pet shop here on the ground level some freak of dynamics nothing else is damaged down here but every fish tank went thats the smell barney muldoon an old friend with the look and mannerisms of a hollywood cop appeared out of the shadows a tough man and nowhere as dumb as he liked to pretend which was why he was head of the bomb squad your baby barney i asked casually looks that way nobody killed the call went out to you because a clothiers dummy was burned on the eighteenth floor and the first car here thought it was a human body wait george dorn is screaming sauls face showed no reaction to the answerbut poker players at the fraternal order of police had long ago given up trying to read that inscrutable talmudic countenance as barney muldoon i knew how i would feel if i had the chance to drop this case on another department and hurry home to a beautiful bride like rebecca goodman i smiled down at saulhis height would keep him from appointment to the force now but the rules were different when he was youngand i added quietly there might be something in it for you though the fedora ducked as saul took out his pipe and started to fill it all he said was oh right now i went on were just notifying missing persons but if what im afraid of is right itll end up on your desk after all he struck a match and started puffing somebody missing at this hour might be found among the living in the morning he said between drags the match went out and shadows moved where nobody stirred and he might not in this case muldoon said hes been gone three days now an irishman your size cant be any more subtle than an elephant saul said wearily stop tantalizing me what have you got the office that was hit muldoon explained obviously happy to share the misery was a magazine called confrontation its kind of leftofcenter so this was probably a rightwing job and not a leftwing one but the interesting thing is that we couldnt reach the editor joseph malik at his home and when we called one of the associate editors what do you think he told us malik disappeared three days ago his landlord confirms it hes been trying to get hold of malik himself because theres a nopets rule there and the other tenants are complaining about his dogs so if a man drops out of sight and then his office gets bombed i kind of think the matter might come to the attention of the homicide department eventually dont you saul grunted might and might not he said im going home ill check with missing persons in the morning to see what theyve got the patrolman spoke up you know what bothers me most about this the egyptian mouthbreeders the what saul asked that pet shop the patrolman explained pointing to the other end of the lobby i looked over the damage and they had one of the best collections of rare tropical fish in new york city even egyptian mouthbreeders he noticed the expressions on the faces of the two detectives and added lamely if you dont collect fish you wouldnt understand but believe me an egyptian mouthbreeder is pretty hard to get these days and theyre all dead in there mouthbreeder muldoon asked incredulously yes you see they keep their young in their mouths for a couple days after birth and they never never swallow them thats one of the great things about collecting fish you get to appreciate the wonders of nature muldoon and saul looked at each other its inspiring muldoon said finally to have so many college graduates on the force these days the elevator door opened and dan pricefixer a redheaded young detective on muldoons staff emerged carrying a metal box i think this is important barney he began immediately with just a nod to saul damned important i found it in the rubble and it had been blown partly open so i looked inside and muldoon prompted its the freakiest bunch of interoffice memos i ever set eyes on weird as tits on a bishop this is going to be a long night saul thought suddenly with a sinking feeling a long night and a heavy case want to peek muldoon asked him maliciously you better find a place to sit down pricefixer volunteered itll take you awhile to go through them lets use the cafeteria saul suggested you just have no idea the patrolman repeated the value of an egyptian mouthbreeder its rough for all nationalities man or fish muldoon said in one of his rare attempts to emulate sauls mode of speech he and saul turned to the cafeteria leaving the patrolman looking vaguely distressed his name is james patrick hennessy and hes been on the force three years he doesnt come back into this story at all he had a fiveyearold retarded son whom he loved helplessly you see a thousand faces like his on the street every day and never guess how well they are carrying their tragedies and george dorn who once wanted to shoot him is still screaming but barney and saul are in the cafeteria look around the transition from the gothic lobby to this room of laminated functional and glittering plastic colors is one might say trippy never mind the smell were closer to the pet shop here saul removed his hat and ran a hand through his gray hair pensively as muldoon read the first two memos in one quick scan when they were passed over he put on his glasses and read more slowly in his own methodical and thoughtful way hold onto your hats this is what they said illuminati project memo jm the first reference ive found is in violence by jacques ellul seabury press new york he says pages that the illuminated ones were founded by joachim of floris in the llth century and originally taught a primitive christian doctrine of poverty and equality but later under the leadership of fra dolcino in the th century they became violent plundered the rich and announced the imminent reign of the spirit in he concludes they were vanquished by the forces of orderthat is an army commanded by the bishop of vercueil he makes no mention of any illuminati movement in earlier centuries or in more recent times ill have more later today pat ps i found a little more about joachim of floris in the back files of the national review william buckley and his cronies think joachim is responsible for modern liberalism socialism and communism theyve condemned him in fine theological language he committed the heresy they say of immanentizing the christian eschaton do you want me to look that up in a technical treatise on thomism i think it means bringing the end of the world closer sort of illuminati project memo jm my second source was more helpful akron daraul a history of secret societies citadel press new york daraul traces the illuminati back to the th century also but not to joachim of floris he sees the origin in the ishmaelian sect of islam also known as the order of assassins they were vanquished in the th century but later made a comeback with a new lessviolent philosophy and eventually became the ishmaelian sect of today led by the aga khan however in the th century in afghanistan the illuminated ones roshinaya picked up the original tactics of the order of assassins they were wiped out by an alliance of the moguls and persians pages but the beginning of the seventeenth century saw the foundation of the illuminated ones of spain the allumbrados condemned by an edict of the grand inquisition in in the illuminated guerinets came into public notice in france and finallythe part youre most interested in the bavarian iiluminati was founded on may day in ingolstadt bavaria by adam weishaupt a former jesuit documents still extant show several points of resemblance between the german and central asian illuminists points that are hard to account for on grounds of pure coincidence page weishaupts illuminati were suppressed by the bavarian government in daraul also mentions the illuminati of paris in the s but suggests it was simply a passing fad he does not accept the notion that the illuminati still exist today this is beginning to look big why are we keeping the details from george pat saul and muldoon exchanged glances lets see the next one saul said he and muldoon read together illuminati project memo jm the encyclopedia britannica has little to say on the subject edition volume halicar to impala page illuminati a shortlived movement of republican free thought founded on may day by adam weishaupt professor of canon law at ingolstadt and a former jesuit from onward they began to make contact with various masonic lodges where under the impulse of a knigge qv one of their chief converts they often managed to gain a commanding position the scheme itself had its attractions for literary men like goethe and herder and even for the reigning dukes of gotha and weimar the movement suffered from internal dissention and was ultimately banned by an edict of the bavarian government in pat saul paused ill make you a bet barney he said quietly the joseph malik who vanished is the jm these memos were written for sure muldoon replied scornfully these illuminati characters are still around and they got him honest to god saul he added i appreciate the way your mind usually polevaults ahead of the facts but you can ride a hunch just so far when youre starting from nothing were not starting from nothing saul said softly heres what weve got to start with oneheheld up a fingera building is bombed twoanother finger an important executive disappeared three days before the bombing already theres an inference or two inferences something got him or else he knew something was coming for him and he ducked out now look at the memos point threehe held up another fingera standard reference work the encyclopedia britannica seems to be wrong about when the illuminati came into existence they say eighteenthcentury germany but the other memos trace it back tolets seespain in the seventeenth century france in the seventeenth century then in the eleventh century back to italy and halfway across the world to afghanistan so weve got a second inference if the britannica is wrong about when the thing started they may be wrong about when it ended now put these three points and two inferences together and the illuminati got the editor and blew up his office nutz i still say youre going too fast maybe im not going fast enough saul said an organization that has existed for a couple of centuries minimum and kept its secrets pretty well hidden most of that time might be pretty strong by now he trailed off into silence and closed his eyes to concentrate after a moment he looked at the younger man with a searching glance muldoon had been thinking too ive seen men land on the moon he said ive seen students break into administration offices and shit in the deans waste basket ive even seen nuns in miniskirts but this international conspiracy existing in secret for eight hundred years its like opening a door in your own house and finding james bond and the president of the united states personally shooting it out with fu manchu and the five original marx brothers youre trying to convince yourself not me barney it sticks out so far that you could break it into three pieces and each one would be long enough to goose somebody up in the bronx there is a secret society that keeps screwing up international politics every intelligent person has suspected that at one time or another nobody wants war any more but wars keep happeningwhy face it barneythis is the heavy case weve always had nightmares about its cast iron if it were a corpse all six pallbearers would get double hernias at the funeral well saul prompted well were either going to have to do something or get off the pot as my sainted mother used to say it was the year when they finally immanentized the eschaton on april the worlds great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before all because of an obscure island named fernando poo but while all other eyes turned to the un building in apprehension and desperate hope there lived in las vegas a unique person known as carmel his house was on date street and had a magnificent view of the desert which he appreciated he liked to spend long hours looking at the wild cactus wasteland although he did not know why if you told him that he was symbolically turning his back upon mankind he would not have understood you nor would he have been insulted the remark would be merely irrelevant to him if you added that he himself was a desert creature like the gila monster and the rattlesnake he would have grown bored and classified you as a fool to carmel most of the world were fools who asked meaningless questions and worried about pointless issues only a few like himself had discovered what was really importantmoney and pursued it without distractions scruples or irrelevancies his favorite moments were those like this night of april when he sat and tallied his take for the month and looked out his picture window occasionally at the flat sandy landscape dimly lit by the lights of the city behind him in this physical and emotional desert he experienced happiness or something as close to happiness as he could ever find his girls had earned during march of which he took after paying percent to the brotherhood for permission to operate without molestation by banananose maldonados soldiers this left a tidy profit of all of it tax free little carmel who stood five feet two and had the face of a mournful weasel beamed as he completed his calculations his emotion was as inexpressible in normal terms as that of a necrophile who had just broken into the town morgue he had tried every possible sexual combination with his girls none gave him the frisson of looking at a figure like that at the end of a month he did not know that he would have another million and incidentally become the most important human being on earth before may if you tried to explain it to him he would have brushed everything else aside and asked merely the five millionhow many throats do i hafta cut to get my hands in it but wait get out the atlas and look up africa run your eyes down the map of the western coast of that continent until you come to equatorial guinea stop at the bend where part of the atlantic ocean curves inward and becomes the bight of biafra you will note a chain of small islands you will further observe that one of these is fernando poo there in the capital city of santa isobel during the early s captain ernesto tequilla y mota carefully read and reread edward luttwaks coup detat a practical handbook and placidly went about following luttwaks formula for a perfect coup detat in santa isobel he set up a timetable made his first converts among other officers formed a clique and began the slow process of arranging things so that officers likely to be loyal to equatorial guinea would be on assignment at least fortyeight hours away from the capital city when the coup occurred he drafted the first proclamation to be issued by his new government it took the best slogans of the most powerful leftwing and rightwing groups on the island and embedded them firmly in a tapiocalike context of bland liberalconservatism it fit luttwaks prescription excellently giving everybody on the island some small hope that his own interests and beliefs would be advanced by the new regime and after three years of planning he struck the key officials of the old regime were quickly bloodlessly placed under house arrest troops under the command of officers in the cabal occupied the power stations and newspaper offices the inoffensively fascistconservativeliberalcommunist proclamation of the new peoples republic of fernando poo went forth to the world over the radio station in santa isobel ernesto tequilla y mota had achieved his ambitionpromotion from captain to generalissimo in one step now at last he began wondering about how one went about governing a country he would probably have to read a new book and he hoped there was one as good as luttwaks treatise on seizing a country that was on march on march the very name of fernando poo was unknown to every member of the house of representatives every senator every officer of the cabinet and all but one of the joint chiefs of staff in fact the presidents first reaction when the cia report landed on his desk that afternoon was to ask his secretary where the hell is fernando poo saul took off his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief conscious of his age and suddenly more tired than ever i outrank you barney he began muldoon grinned i know whats coming methodically saul went on who on your staff do you think is a double agent for the cia robinson im sure of and lehrman i suspect both of them go we take no chances ill have them transferred to the vice squad in the morning how about your own staff three of them i think and they go too vice squadll love the increase in manpower saul relit his pipe one more thing we might be hearing from the fbi we might indeed they get nothing youre really taking me way out on this one saul sometimes you have to follow your hunches this is going to be a heavy case agreed a heavy case muldoon nodded then we do it my way lets look at the fourth memo muldoon said tonelessly they read illuminati project memo jm heres a letter that appeared in playboy a few years ago the playboy advisor playboy april pages i recently heard an old man of rightwing viewsa friend of my grandparentsassert that the current wave of assassinations in america is the work of a secret society called the illuminati he said that the illuminati have existed throughout history own the international banking cartels have all been nddegree masons and were known to lan fleming who portrayed them as spectre in his james bond booksfor which the illuminati did away with mr fleming at first all this seemed like a paranoid delusion to me then i read in the new yorker that allan chapman one of jim garrisons investigators in the new orleans probe of the john kennedy assassination believes that the illuminati really exist playboy of course puts down the whole idea as ridiculous and gives the standard encyclopedia britannica story that the illuminati went out of business in pat pricefixer stuck his head in the cafeteria door minute he asked what is it muldoon replied peter jackson is out here hes the associate editor i spoke to on the phone he just told me something about his last meeting with joseph malik the editor before malik disappeared bring him in muldoon said peter jackson was a black mantruly black not brown or tan he was wearing a vest in spite of the spring weather he was also very obviously wary of policemen saul noted this at once and began thinking about how to overcome itand at the same time he observed an increased blandness in muldoons features indicating that he too had noted it and was prepared to take umbrage have a seat saul said cordially and tell us what you just told the other officer with the nervous ones it was sound policy to drop the policeman role at first and try to sound like somebody elsesomebody who quite naturally asks a lot of questions saul began slipping into the personality of his own family physician which he usually used at such times he made himself feel a stethoscope hanging about his neck well jackson began in a harvard accent this is probably not important it may be just a coincidence most of what we hear is just unimportant coincidence saul said gently but its our job to listen everybody but the lunatic fringe has given up on this by now jackson said it really surprised me when joe told me what he was getting the magazine into he paused and studied the two impassive faces of the detectives finding little there he went on reluctantly it was last friday joe told me he had a lead that interested him and he was putting a staff writer on it he wanted to reopen the investigation of the assassinations of martin luther king and the kennedy brothers saul carefully didnt look at muldoon and just as carefully moved his hat to cover the memos on the table excuse me a moment he said politely and left the cafeteria he found a phone booth in the lobby and dialed his home rebecca answered after the third ring she obviously had not gotten back to sleep after he left saul she asked guessing who would be calling at this hour its going to be a long night saul said oh hell i know baby but this case is a sonofabitch rebecca sighed im glad we had a little ball earlier this evening otherwise id be furious saul thought suddenly of how this conversation would sound to an outsider a sixtyyearold man and a twentyfiveyearold wife and if they knew she was a whore and a heroin addict when i first met her do you know what im going to do rebecca lowered her voice im going to take off my nightgown and throw the covers to the foot of the bed and lie here naked thinking about you and waiting saul grinned a man my age shouldnt be able to respond to that after doing what i did earlier but you did respond didnt you her voice was confident and sensual i sure did i wont be able to leave the phone booth for a couple of minutes she chuckled softly and said ill be waiting i love you he said surprised as always at the simple truth of it in a man his age i wont be able to leave the phone booth at all if this keeps up he thought listen he added hurriedly lets change the subject before i start resorting to the vices of a high school boy what do you know about the illuminati rebecca had been an anthropology major with a minor in psychology before the drug scene had captured her and she fell into the abyss from which he had rescued her her erudition often astonished him its a hoax she said a what a hoax a bunch of students at berkeley started it back around sixtysix or sixtyseven no thats not what im asking the original illuminati in italy and spain and germany in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries you know oh thats the basis of the hoax some rightwing historians think the illuminati still exist you see so these students opened an illuminati chapter on the campus at berkeley and started sending out press releases on all sorts of weird subjects so people who want to believe in conspiracies would have some evidence to point to thats all there is to it sophomore humor i hope so saul thought how about the ishmaelian sect of islam it has twentythree divisions but the aga khan is the leader of all of them it was founded aroundoh ad i think and was originally persecuted but now its part of the orthodox moslem religion it has some pretty weird doctrines the founder hassan i sabbah taught that nothing is true and everything is permissible he lived up to that ideathe word assassin is a corruption of his name anything else yes now that i think of it sabbah introduced marijuana to the western world from india the word hashish also comes from his name this is a heavy case saul said and now that i can walk out of the phone booth without shocking the patrol man in the hall ill get back to work on it dont say anything thatll get me aroused again please i wont ill just lie here naked and goodbye goodbye she said laughing saul hung up frowning goodmans intuition the other detectives call it its not intuition its a way of thinking beyond and between the facts a way of sensing wholes of seeing that there must be a relationship between fact number one and fact number two even if no such relationship is visible yet and i know there is an illuminati whether or not those kids at berkeley are kidding he came out of his concentration and realized where he was for the first time he noticed a sticker on the door this phone booth reserved for clark kent he grinned an intellectuals kind of joke probably somebody on the magazine he walked back to the cafeteria reflecting nothing is true everything is permissible with a doctrine like that people were capable of he shuddered images of buchenwald and belsen of jews who might have been him peter jackson looked up as he reentered the cafeteria an intelligent curious black face muldoon was as impassive as the faces on mount rushmore mad dog texas was the town where malik thought these assassins had their headquarters muldoon said thats where the staff writer was sent what was the staff writers name saul asked george dorn muldoon said hes a young kid who used to be in sds and he was once rather close to the weatherman faction hagbard celines gigantic computer fuckupfirst universal cybernetickineticultramicroprogrammer was basically a rather sophisticated form of the standard selfprogramming algorithmic logic machine of the time the name was one of his whimsies fuckups real claim to uniqueness was a programmed stochastic process whereby it could throw an i ching hexagram reading a random open circuit as a broken yin line and a random closed circuit as a full yang line until six such lines were round consulting its memory banks where the whole tradition of ching interpretation was stored and then crosschecking its current scannings of that days political economic meteorological astrological astronomical and technological eccentricities it would provide a reading of the hexagram which to hagbards mind combined the best of the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends on march the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated hexagram breaking apart fuckup then interpreted this traditionally unlucky sign was cast by atlantean scientistpriests shortly before the destruction of their continent and is generally connected with death by water other vibrations link it to earthquakes tornadoes and similar disasters and to sickness decay and morbidity as well the first correlation is with the unbalance between technological acceleration and political retrogression which has proceeded earthwide at ever widening danger levels since and especially since the breaking apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic mental fugue of lawyerpoliticians attempting to administrate a worldwide technology whose mechanisms they lack the education to comprehend and whose gestalt trend they frustrate by breaking apart into obsolete renaissance nationstates world war iii is probably imminent and considering the advances in chemical biological warfare in conjunction with the sickness vibrations of hexagram the unleashing of plague or nerve gas or both is as probable as thermonuclear overkill general prognosis many megadeaths there is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with prompt action of correct nature probability of such avoidance is no blame my ass no blame hagbard raged and rapidly reprogrammed fuckup to read off to him its condensed psychobiographies of the key figures in world politics and the key scientists in chemobiological warfare the first dream came to dr charles oceangoing on february more than a month before fuckup picked up the vibrations he was as usual with him aware that he was dreaming and the vision of a gigantic pyramid which seemed to walk or lumber about meant nothing and quickly vanished now he seemed to be looking at an enlargement of the dna double helix it was so detailed that he began searching it for the bonding irregularities at every rd angstrom to his surprise they were missing instead there were other irregularities at each th angstrom what the devil he askedand the pyramid returned seeming to speak and saying yes the devil he jolted awake with a new concept anthraxleprosymu coming into consciousness and began jotting in his bedside pad what the hell is this desert door project the president had asked once scrutinizing the budget germ warfare an aide explained helpfully they started with something called anthrax delta and now theyve worked their way up to something called anthrax mu and his voice was drowned out by the rumble of paper shredders in the next room the president recognized the characteristic sound of the cesspool cleaners hard at work never mind he said those things make me nervous he scribbled a quick ok next to the item and went on to deprived children which made him feel better here he said this is something we can cut he forgot everything about desert door until the fernando poo crises suppose just suppose he asked the joint chiefs on march i go on the tube and threaten allout thermonuclear heck and the other side doesnt blink have we got something thatll scare them even more the jcs exchanged glances one of them spoke tentatively out near las vegas he said we have this desert door project that seems to be way ahead of the comrades in bb and bc thats biologicalbacteriological and biologicalchemical the president explained to the vicepresident who was frowning it has nothing to do with bb guns turning his attention back to the military men he asked what have we got specifically that will curdle ivans blood well theres anthraxleprosymu its worse than any form of anthrax more deadly than bubonic and anthrax and leprosy all in one lump as a matter of fact the general who was speaking smiled grimly at the thought our evaluation suggests that with death being so quick the psychological demoralization of the survivorsif there are any survivorswill be even worse than in thermonuclear exchange with maximum dirty fallout by golly the president said by golly we wont use that out in the open my speechll just talk bomb but well leak it to the boys in the kremlin that weve got this anthrax gimmick in cold storage too by gosh you just wait and see them back down he stood up decisive firm the image he always projected on television im going to see my speech writers right now meanwhile arrange that the brain responsible for this anthraxpi gets a raise whats his name he asked over his shoulder going out the door mocenigo dr charles mocenigo a raise for dr charles mocenigo the president called from the hallway mocenigo the vicepresident asked thoughtfully is he a wop dont say wop the president shouted back how many times do i have to tell you dont say wop or kike or any of those words anymore he spoke with some asperity since he lived daily with the dread that someday the secret tapes he kept of all oval room transactions would be released to the public he had long ago vowed that if that day ever came the tapes would not be full of expletive deleted or characterization deleted he was harassed but still he spoke with authority he was in fact characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time he was fiftyfive years old tough shrewd unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals and had long ago decided that the world was a mean sonofabitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can survive he was also as kind as was possible for one holding that ultradarwinian philosophy and he genuinely loved children and dogs unless they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the national interest he still retained some sense of humor despite the burdens of his almost godly office and although he had been impotent with his wife for nearly ten years now he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled prostitute within minutes he took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on his grueling twentyhour day with the result that his vision of the world was somewhat skewed in a paranoid direction and he took tranquilizers to keep from worrying too much with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on the schizophrenic but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail grip on reality in short he was much like the rulers of russia and china in central park the squirrel woke again as a car honked loudly in passing muttering angrily he leaped to another tree and immediately went back to sleep at the allnight bickfords restaurant on seventysecond street a young man named august personage left a phone booth after making an obscene call to a woman in brooklyn he left behind one of his this phone booth reserved for clark kent stickers in chicago one hour earlier on the clock but the same instant the phone booth closed a rock group called clark kent and his supermen began a revival of rock around the clock their leader a tall black man with a masters degree in anthropology had been known as el hajj starkerlee mohammed during a militant phase a few years earlier and his birth certificate said robert pearson on it he was observing his audience and noted that bearded young white cat simon was with a black woman as usuala fetish pearsonmohammedkent could understand by reverse psychology since he preferred white chicks himself simon for once was not entranced by the music instead he was deep in conversation with the girl and drawing a diagram of a pyramid on the table to explain what he meant crown point pearson heard him say over the music and listening to rock around the clock ten years earlier george dorn had decided to let his hair grow long smoke dope and become a musician he had succeeded in two of those ambitions the statue of tlaloc in the museum of anthropology mexico df stared inscrutably upward toward the stars and the same stars glittered above the carribean where the porpoise named howard sported in the waves the motorcade passes the texas school book depository and moves slowly toward the triple underpass at the sixthfloor window lee harvey oswald sights carefully through the carcanomannlicher his mouth is dry desert dry but his heartbeat is normal and no sweat stands out on his forehead this is the moment he is thinking the one moment transcending time and hazard heredity and environment the final test and proof of free will and of my right to call myself a man in this moment now as i tighten the trigger the tyrant dies and with him all the lies of a cruel mendacious epoch it is a supreme exaltation this moment and this knowledge and yet his mouth is dry dustdry dry as death as if his salivary glands alone rebelled against the murder which his intellect pronounced necessary and just now he recalls the military formula bass breathe aim slack squeeze he breathes he aims he slacks he starts to squeeze as a dog barks suddenly and his mouth falls open in astonishment as three shots ring out obviously from the direction of the grassy knoll and triple underpass sonofabitch he said softly as a prayer and he began to grin a rictus not of omnipotence such as he had expected but of something different and unexpected and therefore betteromniscience that smirk appeared in all the photos during the next day and a half before his own death a sneering smile that said so clearly that none dared to read it i know something you dont know that grimace only faded sunday morning when jack ruby pumped two bullets into lees frail fanatic body and its secret went with him to the grave but another part of the secret had already left dallas on friday afternoons twa whisperjet to los angeles traveling behind the business suit gray hair and only moderately sardonic eyes of a little old man who was listed on the flight manifest as frank sullivan this is serious peter jackson was thinking joe malik wasnt on a paranoid trip at all the noncommittal expressions of muldoon and goodman did not deceive him at allhe had long ago learned the black art of surviving in a white world which is the art of reading not what is on a face but what is behind the face the cops were worried and excited like any hunters on the track of something both large and dangerous joe was right about the assassination plot and his disappearance and the bombing were part of it and that meant george dorn was in danger too and peter liked george even if he was a snotty kid in some ways and an annoying asskisser about the race thing like most young white radicals mad dog texas peter thought that sure sounds like a bad place to be in trouble almost fifty years before a habitual bank robber named harry pierpont approached a young convict in michigan city prison and asked him do you think there might be a true religion but why is george dorn screaming while saul goodman is reading the memos hold on for another jump and this one is a shocker saul is no longer human hes a pig all cops are pigs everything youve ever believed is probably a lie the world is a dark sinister mysterious and totally frightening place can you digest all that quickly then walk into the mind of george dorn for the second time five hours before the explosion at confrontation four hours before on the clock and suck on the joint suck hard and hold it down one oclock two oclock three oclock rock you are sprawled on a crummy bed in a rundown hotel and a neon light outside is flashing pink and blue patterns into your room exhale slowly feel the hit of the weed and see if the wallpaper looks any brighter yet any less unintentional low camp its hot texasdry hot and you push your long hair back from your forehead and haul out your diary george dorn because reading over what you wrote last sometimes helps you to learn what youre really getting into as the neon splotches the page with pink and blue read this april how do we know whether the universe is getting bigger or the objects in it are getting smaller you cant say that the universe is getting bigger in relation to anything outside it because there isnt any outside for it to relate to there isnt any outside but if the universe doesnt have an outside then it goes on forever yeah but its inside doesnt go on forever how do you know it doesnt shithead youre just playing with words man no im not the universe is the inside without an outside the sound made by one there was a knock at the door the fear came over george whenever he was high the least little detail wrong in his world would bring the fear irresistible uncontrollable he held his breath not to contain the smoke in his lungs but because terror had paralyzed the muscles in his chest he dropped the little notebook in which he wrote his thoughts daily and clutched at his penis a habitual gesture in moments of panic the hand holding the roach drifted automatically over the hollowedout copy of sinclair lewiss it cant happen here which lay beside him on the bed and he dropped the halfinch twist of paper and marijuana on top of the plastic baggie full of green grains instantly a brown smoldering dimesized hole opened up on the bag and the pot near the coal started to smoke stupid said george as his thumb stabbed the smoking coal to crush it and he drew back his lips in a grimace of pain a short fat man walked into the room law officer written in every mean line of his crafty little face george shrank back and started to close itcant happen here like lightning three stiff concretehard fingers drove into his forearm he screamed and the book jumped out of his hand spilling pot all over the bedspread dont touch that said the fat man an officer will be in to gather it up for evidence i went easy with that karate punch otherwise youd be nursing a compound fracture of the left arm in mad dog county jail tonight and no rightthinking doctor likely to have a mind to come out and treat you you got a warrant george tried to sound defiant oh you think you have cojones the fat mans breath stank of bourbon and cheap cigars rabbit cojones i have terrified you unto death boy and you know it and i know it yet you find it in your heart to speak of warrants next youll want to see the american civil liberties union he pulled aside the jacket of an iridescent gray summer suit that might have been new when heartbreak hotel was the top of the hit parade a silver fivepointed star decorated his pink shirt pocket and a automatic stuck in his pantstop dented the fat of his belly that is all the law i need when dealing with your type in mad dog walk careful with me son or you wont have nothing to grab onto next time one of us pigs as you choose to call us in your little articles busts in on you which is not likely to happen in the next forty years while you rot and grow old in our state prison he seemed immensely pleased with his own oratorical style like one of faulkners characters george thought it is forbidden to dream again we maim our joys or hide them horses are made of chromium steel and little fat men shall ride them he said you cant hit me with forty years for possession and grass is legal in most other states this law is archaic and absurd shit and onions boy you got too much of the killer weed there to call it mere possession i call it possession with intent to sell and the laws of this state are stern and they are just and they are our laws we know what that weed can do we remember the alamo and santa annas troops losing all fear because they were high on rosa maria as they called it in those days get on your feet and dont ask to talk to a lawyer neither can i ask who you are i am sheriff jim cartwright nemesis of all evil in mad dog and mad dog county and im tiny tim said george immediately saying to himself shut the fuck up youre too goddamn high and he went right on and said maybe your side would have won if davy crockett and jim bowie got stoned too and by the way sheriff how did you know you could catch me with pot usually an underground journalist would make it a point to be clean when he comes into this godforsaken part of the country it wasnt telepathy that told you i had pot on me sheriff cartwright slapped his thigh oh but it was it was telepathy now just what made you think it wasnt telepathy brung me here he laughed seized georges arm in a grip of iron and pushed him toward the hotelroom door george felt a bottomless terror as if the pit of hell were opening beneath his feet and sheriff jim cartwright were about to pitchfork him into the bubbling sulfur and i must admit that was more or less the case there are periods of history when the visions of madmen and dope fiends are a better guide to reality than the commonsense interpretation of data available to the socalled normal mind this is one such period if you havent noticed already keep on hanging out with those wild boys from passaic and youll end up in jail georges mother said you mark my words george and another time at columbia after a very late meeting mark rudd said soberly a lot of us are going to spend some time in the mans jails before this shitstorm is over and george together with the others nodded glumly but bravely the marijuana he had been smoking was raised in cuernavaca by a farmer named arturo jesus maria ybarra y mendez who had sold it in bulk to a young yanqui named jim riley the son of a dayton ohio police officer who in turn smuggled it through mad dog after paying a suitable bribe to sheriff jim cartwright after that it was resold to a times square dealer called rosetta the stoned and a miss walsh from confrontations research department bought ten ounces from her later reselling five ounces to george who then carried it back to mad dog without any suspicion that he was virtually completing a cycle the original seed was part of that strain recommended by general george washington in the famous letter to sir john sinclair in which he writes i find that for all purposes the indian hemp is in every way superior to the new zealand variety previously cultivated here in new york rebecca goodman deciding that saul will not be home tonight slips out of bed dons a robe and begins to browse through her library finally she selects a book on babylonian mythology and begins to read before all of the gods was mummu the spirit of pure chaos in chicago simon and mary lou servix sit naked on her bed legs intertwined in the yabyum lotus position no simon is saying you dont move baby you wait for u to move you clark kent and his supermen swing into a reprise were gonna rock around the clock tonight were gonna rock rock rock till broad day light georges cell mate in mad dog county jail had a skulllike face with large protruding front teeth he was about six and a half feet tall and lay curled up on his cell bunk like a coiled python have you asked for treatment george asked him treatment for what well if you think youre an assassin i dont think baby brother ive killed four white men and two niggers one in california the rest down here got paid for every one of them is that what youre in for my god they dont stick murderers in the same cell with potheads do they im in for vagrancy said the man scornfully actually im just here for safekeeping till they give me my orders then its goodbye to whoeverpresident civil rights leader enemy of the people someday ill be famous im gonna write a book about myself someday ace course im no good at writing look maybe we can do a deal ill have sheriff jim bring you some writing paper if youll write about my life they gonna keep you here forever you know ill come and visit you between assassinations and youll write the book and sheriff jim keep it safe till i retire then you have the book published and youll make a lot of money and be real comfortable in jail or maybe you can even hire a lawyer to get you out where will you be said george he was still scared but he was feeling sleepy too and he was deciding that this was all bullshit which had a calming effect on his nerves but hed better not go to sleep in the cell while this guy was awake he didnt really believe this assassin talk but it was safe to assume that anybody you met in prison was homosexual as if reading his mind his cell mate said howd you like to let a famous assassin shove it up to you how would that be huh ace please said george thats not my bag you know i really couldnt do it shit piss and corruption said the assassin he suddenly uncoiled and slid off the bunk i been wasting my time with you now bend the hell over and drop your pants you are getting it and there aint no further way about it he stepped toward george fists clenched guard guard george yelled he grabbed the cell door in both hands and began rattling it frantically the man caught george a cuff across the face another blow to the jaw knocked george against the wall guard he screamed his head spinning with pot and panic a man in a blue uniform came through the door at the end of the corridor he seemed miles away and vastly disinterested like a god who had grown bored with his creations now what the hell is all this yelling about in here he asked his hand en the butt of his revolver his voice still miles away george opened his mouth but his cell mate spoke first this little longhaired communist freak wont drop his pants when i tell him aint you supposed to make sure im happy in here the voice shifted to a whine make him do what i say youve got to protect me said george youve got to get me out of this cell the godguard laughed well now you might say this is a very enlightened prison we have here you come down from new york and you probably think were pretty backward but we aint we got no police brutality now if i interfered between you and harry coin here i might have to use force to keep him away from your young ass i know you people believe all cops ought to be abolished well in this here situation i hereby abolish myself furthermore i know you people believe in sexual freedom and i do too so harry coin gonna have his sexual freedom without any interference or brutality from me his voice was still distant and disinterested almost dreamy no said george the guard drew his pistol now sonny you take down your pants and bend over you are gonna get it up the ass from harry coin here and no two ways about it and i am gonna watch and see that you let him do it right otherwise you get no forty years you get killed right now i put a bullet in you and i say you are resisting arrest now make up your mind what its gonna be i really will kill you if you dont do like he tells you to i really will you are totally expendable and he aint hes a very important man and its my job to keep him happy and ill fuck you either way dead or alive the demented coin laughed like an evil spirit so theres no way you can escape it ace the door at the end of the corridor clanged and sheriff jim cartwright and two blueuniformed policemen strode down to the cell whats going on here said the sheriff i caught this queer punk george dorn here trying to commit homosexual rape on harry said the guard had to draw my pistol to stop him george shook his head you guys are unbelievable if youre acting out this little game for my benefit you can quit now because youre certainly not fooling each other and youre not fooling me dorn said the sheriff youve been attempting unnatural acts in my jail acts forbidden by the holy bible and the laws of this state i dont like that i dont like it one little bit come on out here i wanna have a little talk with you we goin to the main interrogation room for some speakin together he unlocked the cell door and motioned george to precede him he turned to the two policemen who had accompanied him stay behind and take care of that other little matter the last words were strangely emphasized george and the sheriff walked through a series of corridors and locked doors until at last they came to a room whose walls were made of embossed sheet tin painted bottlegreen the sheriff told george to sit on one chair while he straddled the back of the chair facing him youre a bad influence on my prisoners he said i got a good mind to see that some kind of accident happens to you i dont want to see you corrupting prisoners in my jailmine or anyonesfor forty years sheriff said george what do you want from me you got me on a pot charge what more do you want why did you stick me in that cell with that guy whats all this scare stuff and threats and questioning for i wanna know some things said the sheriff i want to find out everything you can tell me about certain matters so from this moment be prepared to tell me only the truth if you do maybe things will go easier on you after yes sheriff said george cartwright squinted at him he really does look like a pig thought george most do why do so many of them get so fat and have such little eyes well then said the sheriff what was your purpose in coming down here from new york im simply on an assignment from confrontation the magazine i know it it is a smutty magazine and a communist magazine i have read it youre using loaded words its a leftwing libertarian magazine to be exact my pistol is loaded too boy so talk straight all right tell me what you came down here to write about sure you ought to be as interested in this as i am if youre really interested in law and order there have been rumors circulating throughout the country for more than a decade now that all the major political assassinations in americamalcolm x the kennedy brothers medgar evers king nixon maybe even george lincoln rockwellare the work of a single conspiratorial violenceoriented rightwing organization and that this organization has its base right here in mad dog i came down to see what i could find out about this group thats what i figured said the sheriff you poor sad little turd you come down here with your long hair and you expect to get as you put it a line on a rightwing organization why its lucky for you you didnt meet any of our real rightwingers like gods lightning for instance the ones around here would have tortured you to death by this tune boy you really are dumb ok im not gonna waste any more of my time with you come on ill take you back to your cell you might as well get used to looking at the moon through bars they walked back the same way they had come at the entrance to the corridor where georges cell was the sheriff opened the door and yelled come and get him charley georges guard his face pale and his mouth set in a lipless line took george by the arm the corridor door clanged shut behind the sheriff charley took george to his cell and pushed him in wordlessly but at least he was threedimensional now and less like a marijuana phantom harry coin wasnt there the cell was empty george became aware of a shadow in the corner of his vision something in the cell next to him he turned his heart stopped there was a man hanging from a pipe on the ceiling george went over and stared through the bars the body was swaying slightly it was attached to the pipe by a leather belt which was buckled around the neck the face with the staring eyes was that of harry coin georges glance went lower something was coming out of harry coins midsection and was dangling down to the floor it wasnt suicide they had disemboweled harry coin and someone had thoughtfully moved a shitcan under him for his bloody intestines to dangle into george screamed there was no one around to answer him the guard had vanished like hermes but in cherry knolls mental hospital in sunderland england where it was already eleven the following morning a schizophrenic patient who hadnt spoken in ten years abruptly began exhorting a ward attendant theyre all coming backhitler goering streicher the whole lot of them and behind them the powers and persons from the other spheres who control them but simon moon in chicago still calmly and placidly retains the lotus position and instructs mary lou sitting in his lap just hold it hold it with your vaginal wall like youd hold it with your hand gently and feel its warmth but dont think about orgasm dont think about the future not even a minute ahead think about the now the only now the only now the only now that well ever have just my penis in your vagina now and the simple pleasure of it not a greater pleasure to work toward my back hurts mary lou said were gonna rock rock rock around the clock to night there are swedish and norwegian kids danes italian and french kids greeks even americans george and hagbard move through the crowd trying to estimate its number peace symbols dangling about every neck nudes with body paint nudes without body paint long and dangling hair on boys and girls alike and over all of it the hypnotic and unending beat woodstock europa hagbard says dryly the last and final walpurgisnacht and adam weishaupts erotion finally realized were gonna rock rock rock till broad daylight its a league of nations george says a young peoples league of nations hagbard isnt listening up there he points to the northwest is the rhine where die lorelei was supposed to sit and sing her deadly songs there will be deadlier music on the danube tonight were gonna rock around the clock tonight but that was still seven days in the future and now george lies unconscious in mad dog county jail and it beganthat phase of the operation as hagbard called itover thirty years before when a swiss chemist named hoffman climbed on his bicycle and pedaled down a country road into new dimensions and will they all come back george asked all of them hagbard answered tightly when the beat reaches the proper intensity unless we can stop it now im getting it mary lou cried its not what i expected its different from sex and better simon smiled benignly it is sex baby he said what youve had before wasnt sex now we can start moving but slowly the gentle way the way of tao theyre all coming back they never diedthe lunatic raved at the startled attendantyou wait guvnor you just wait youll see it the amplifiers squealed suddenly there was too much feedback and the sound went off into a pitch beyond endurance george winced and saw others hold their ears rock rock rock around the clock the key missed the lock turned and cut muldoons hand nerves he said to saul i always feel like a burglar when i do this saul grunted forget burglary he said we might be hanged for treason before this is over if we dont become national heroes a fanfuckingtastic case muldoon grinned he tried another way they were in an old brownstone on riverside drive trying to break into the apartment of joseph malik and they were not merely looking for evidence both tacitly admittedthey were hiding from the fbi the call had come from headquarters just as they were finishing the questioning of associate editor peter jackson muldoon had gone out to his car to take it while saul finished getting a full physical description of both malik and george dorn jackson had just left and saul was picking up the fifth memo when muldoon returned looking as if his doctor had just told him his wasserman was positive two special agents from the fbi are coming over to help us he said woodenly still ready to play a hunch saul asked calmly pushing all the memos back in the metal box muldoon merely called pricefixer back into the cafeteria and told him two feds will be here in a few minutes tell them we went back to headquarters answer any question they ask but dont tell them about this box pricefixer looked at the two older officers carefully and then said to muldoon youre the boss hes either awfully dumb and trusting saul had thought or hes so damned smart hes going to be dangerous someday now he asked muldoon nervously is that the last key no ive got five more beauties here and one of them willhere it is the door opened smoothly sauls hand drifted toward his revolver as he stepped into the apartment and felt for a light switch nobody was revealed when the light came on and saul relaxed you look around for the dogs he said i want to sit down and go over the rest of these memos the room was used for work as well as living and was untidy enough to leave no room for doubt that malik had been a bachelor saul pushed the typewriter back on the writing desk set down the memo box and then noticed something odd the whole wall on this side of the room was covered with pictures of george washington standing to examine them more closely he saw that each had a labelhalf of them saying gw and the others aw oddbut the whole case had overtones that smelled as fishy as those dead egyptian mouthbreeders saul sat down and took a memo from the box muldoon came back into the living room and said no dogs not a goddam dog anywhere in the whole apartment thats interesting saul remarked thoughtfully you say the landlord had complaints from several other tenants about the dogs he said everybody in the building was complaining the rule is no pets and he enforced it people wanted to know why they had to get rid of their kittens when malik could have a whole pack of dogs up here they said there must have been ten or twelve from the noise they made he sure must love those animals if he took them all with him when he went into hiding saul mused the pole vaulter in his unconscious was jumping again lets look in the kitchen he suggested mildly barney followed as saul methodically ransacked the refrigerator and cupboards finishing up with a careful examination of the garbage no dog food saul said finally i noticed and no dog dishes either and no empty dogfood tins in the garbage what wild notion are you following now i dont know saul said thoughtfully he doesnt mind the neighbors hearing the dogsprobably hes the land of leftwing individualist who likes nothing better than quarreling with his landlord and the other tenants about some issue like the nopets rule so he wasnt hiding anything until he ducked out and then he not only took the dogs but hid all evidence that theyd ever been here even though he must have known that the neighbors would all talk about them maybe he was feeding them human flesh muldoon suggested ghoulishly lord i dont know you look around for anything of interest im going to read those illuminati memos saul returned to the living room and began illuminati project memo jm sometimes you find things in the damnedest places the following is from a girls magazine the conspiracy by sandra glass teenset march pages simon proceeded to tell me about the bavarian illuminati the nightmarish story begins in ad in the middle east when hassan i sabbah founded the ismaelian sect or hashishism so called because of their use of hashish a deadly drug derived from the hemp plant which is better known as the killer weed marijuana the cult terrorized the moslem world until genghis khans mongols brought law and order to the area cornered in their mountain hideaway the hashishism dope fiends proved no match for the cleanliving mongol warriors their fortress was destroyed and their dancing girls shipped to mongolia for rehabilitation the heads of the cult fled westward the illuminati surfaced next in bavaria in simon told me adam weishaupt a student of the occult studied the teachings of hassan i sabbah and grew hemp in his backyard on february weishaupt achieved illumination weishaupt officially founded the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria on may st their slogan was ewige blumenkraft they attracted many illustrious members such as goethe and beethoven beethoven tacked up an ewige blumenkraft poster on the top of the piano on which he composed all nine of his symphonies the last paragraph of the article is however the most interesting of all recently i saw a documentary film on the democratic convention of and i was struck by the scene in which senator abraham ribicoff made a critical remark provoking the anger of the mayor of chicago in the ensuing tumult it was impossible to hear the mayors shouted retort and there has been much speculation about what he actually said to me it seemed his lips were forming the words that by this time become frighteningly familiar ewige blumenkraft the further i dig the wilder the whole picture looks when are we going to tell george about it pat illuminati project memo jm the john birch society has looked into the subject and they have a theory of their own the first source ive found on this is a pamphlet cfr conspiracy to rule the world by gary alien associate editor of the birchers magazine american opinion aliens thesis is that cecil rhodes created a secret society to establish english domination of the world in this society acts through oxford university the rhodes scholarships andhold your breaththe council on foreign relations a nonprofit foundation for the study of international affairs headquartered right here on sixtyeighth street in new york seven out of nine of our last secretaries of state were recruited from the cfr alien points out and dozens of other leading politicians as wellincluding richard nixon it is also implied but not directly stated that william buckley jr an old enemy of the birchers is another tool of the cfr and the morgan and rothschild banking interests are supposed to be financing the whole thing how does this tie in with the illuminati mr alien merely drops hints linking rhodes to john ruskin and ruskin to earlier internationalists and finally stating that the originator on the profane level of this type of secret society was adam weishaupt whom he calls the monster who founded the order of the illuminati on may pat illuminati project memo jm this is from a small leftwing newspaper in chicago the rogerspark chicago july vol no daley linked with illuminati no authors name given no historian knows what happened to adam weishaupt after he was exiled from bavaria in and entries in washington s diary after that date frequently refer to the hemp crop at mount vernon the possibility that adam weishaupt killed george washington and took his place serving as our first president for two terms is now confirmed the two main colors of the american flag are excluding a small patch of blue in one corner red and white these are also the official colors of the hashishism the flag and the illuminati pyramid both have thirteen horizontal divisions thirteen is of course the traditional code for marijuana and is still used in that sense by hells angels among others now washington formed the federalist party the other major party in those days the democratic republicans was formed by thomas jefferson and there are grounds for accepting the testimony of the reverend jedediah morse of charleston who accused jefferson of being an illuminati agent thus even at the dawn of our government both parties were iiluminati fronts this story later repeats the teenset report that mayor daley used the phrase ewige blumenkraft during his incoherent diatribe against abe ribicoff pat illuminati project memo jm more on the washingtonweishaupt theory in spite of the fact that his face appears on billions of stamps and dollar bills and his portrait hangs in every public building in the country no one is quite sure what washington looks like a project script meet george washington will be seen tonight at on channel fill in by local stations the program offers contemporary portraits of the first president some of which do not even seem to be the same man this is a press release sent out by nec on april some of the portraits can be found in encyclopedia britannica and the resemblance to portraits of weishaupt is undeniable incidentally barbara called my attention to this the letter in playboy asking about the illuminati was signed rs kansas city missouri according to the kansas city newspapers a robert stanton of that city was found dead on march about a week after the april playboy appeared on the newsstands with his throat torn as if by the talons of some enormous beast no animal was reported missing from any of the local zoos pat saul looked up at the pictures of washington on the wall for the first time he noticed the strange halfsmile on the most famous of them all the one by gilbert stuart that appears on onedollar bills as if by the talons of some enormous beast he quoted to himself thinking again of maliks disappearing dogs what the hell are you grinning about he asked sourly congressman koch he remembered suddenly in a speech years and years ago when marijuana was illegal everywhere said something about washington s hemp crop what was it yes it was about the entries in the generals diarythey showed that he separated the female hemp plants from the males before fertilization that was botanically unnecessary if he was growing the crop for rope but it was standard practice in cultivating hemp for marijuana koch pointed out and illumination was one of the words hippies were always using to describe the experience one obtains from the highest grade of grass even the more common term turning on had the same meaning as illumination when you stopped to think about wasnt that what the crown of light around jesus head in catholic art was supposed to mean and goetheif he was really part of thismight have been referring to the experience in his last words as he lay dying more light i should have become a rabbi like my father wanted saul thought bemusedly police work is getting to be too much for me in a few minutes ill be suspecting thomas edison rock rock rock till broad daylight slowly mary lou servix swam back to consciousness like a shipwreck victim reaching a raft good lord she breathed softly simon kissed her neck now you know he whispered good lord she repeated how many times did i come simon smiled im not an analcompulsive typei wasnt counting ten or twelve something like that i guess good lord and the hallucinations was that what you were doing to my nervous system or was it the grass just tell me about what you saw well you got a halo around you sort of a big blue halo and then i saw that it was around me too and that it had all sorts of little blue dots dancing in sort of whorls inside it and then there wasnt even that anymore just light pure white light suppose i told you i have a friend whos a dolphin and he exists in that kind of limitless light all the time oh dont start jiving me youve been so nice until now im not jiving you his name is howard i might arrange for you to meet him a fish no baby a dolphin is a mammal just like you and me you are either the worlds greatest brain or the worlds craziest motherfucker mr simon moon i mean it but that light my god i will never forget that light and what happened to your body simon asked casually you know i didnt know where it was even in the middle of my orgasms i didnt know where my body was everything was just the light rock rock rock around the clock tonight and leaving dallas that muchdiscussed november afternoon in the man using the name frank sullivan brushes past mccord and barker at the airport but no foreshadowing of watergate darkens his mind back at the grassy knoll howard hunts picture is being snapped and will later turn up in the files of new orleans da jim the jolly green giant garrison not that garrison ever came within light years of the real truth here kittykittykittyhagbard calls but now we are going back again to april and las vegas sherri brandi nee sharon ofarrell arriving home finds carmel in her living room at four in the morning it doesnt surprise her he often made these unexpected visits he seems to enjoy invading other peoples territory like some kinda creepy virus darling i cried rushing to kiss him as he expected iwish the creep would drop dead i thought as our mouths met an allnight john he asked casually yeah one of those scientists who works at that place out in the desert were all supposed to pretend we dont know about a freak he wanted something special carmel asked quickly you charged him extra at times i thought i could really see dollar signs in his eyes no i said he just wanted a lay but afterward he wouldnt let me go just kept jawing i yawned looking around at the nice furniture and the nice paintings i had managed to get everything in shades of pink and lavender really beautiful if that creep hadnt been sitting there on the couch looking like a hungry dead rat i always wanted pretty things and i think i could have been some kind of artist or designer if all my luck wasnt always lousy christ who ever told carmel a blue turtleneck would go with a brown suit if it wasnt for women in my honesttopete opinion men would all go around looking like that thats what i think insensitive a bunch of cavemen or meander thralls or whatever you call them this john had a lot on his mind i said before old candybar could start cross examining me about something else hes against fluorides in drinking water and the catholic church and faggots and he thinks the new birthcontrol pill is as bad as the old one and i should use a diaphragm instead christ hes got the inside dope on everything under the sun he thinks and i hadda listen to it all that kind of john carmel nodded scientists are schmucks he said i pulled the dress over my head and hung it in the closet it was the nice green one with the spangles and the new style where my nipples stick out through little holes which is a pain in the ass because theyre always rubbing against something and getting raw but it really turns on the johns and like i always say thats the name of the game in this sonofabitching town with all the lousy luck the only way to heavy scratch is go out there girl and sell your snatch and then i grabbed my robe quick before old blowjob bobo decided it was time for his weekly frenching hes got a nice house though i said to distract the creep he doesnt have to live out there on the base hes too important for rules and regularities nice to look at i mean redwood walls and burnt orange decor you know pretty he hates it though acts as if he thinks its haunted by count frankenstein or somebody keeps jumping up and walking around like hes looking for something something thatll bite his head off in one gulp if he finds it i decided to let the top of the robe hang open a little carmel was either horny or he wanted something else and something else with him generally means he thinks youve been holding back some cash him and his damned belt of course sometimes with that i go queer all over for a flash and i guess thats like the come that men have the orgasm but it aint worth the pain believe me i wonder if its true some women get it in intercourse really get it i dont think so ive never known anybody in the business who gets it from a man only from rosy palm and her five sisters sometimes and if none of us do how could some straight niceynicey get it bugs carmel said looking shrewd and clever off on his usual shtick of proving he was more hip to everything than anybody else on gods green earth i didnt know what the hell he was talking about what do you mean bugs i asked it was better than talking about money the john he said with a knowitall grin hes important you said so his house has bugs he probably keeps taking them out and the fbi keeps coming back and putting in new ones i bet he was very quiet when he was making it with you right i nodded remembering see he couldnt stand the thought of those feds eavesdropping on the other end of the wire just like mal like a guy i know in the syndicate hes so afraid of bugs he wont hold a business talk anywhere but the bathroom in his hotel suite with all four faucets going full blast and both of us whispering running water screws up a bug more than playing loud music on the radio for some scientific reason bugs i said suddenly thats it the other kind of bugs i was remembering charley raving about fluoridation and were all classified as mental cases because a few rightwing nuts fifteen or twenty years ago who said fluoridation was a communist plot to poison us now anybody who criticizes fluoridation is supposed to be just as bananas as gods lightning good lord if anybody wants to do us in without firing a shot i could and he caught himself hid something that almost showed on his face and ended like his brain was walking on one foot i could point to a dozen things in any chemistry book more effective than fluoride but he wasnt thinking of chemicals he was thinking of those little bugs microbes is the word and thats what he was working on i could feel that flash i always get when i read something in a john like if he had more money than he let on or hed caught his wife spreading for the milkman and was doing it to get even or he was really a faggola and was just proving to himself that he wasnt completely a faggola my god i said carmel i read about those microbe bugs in the enquirer if they have an accident out there this whole town goes and the state with it and god knows how many other states jesus no wonder he keeps washing his hands germ warfare carmel said thinking fast god ill bet this town is crawling with russian spies trying to find out whats going on out there and ive got a direct lead for them but how the hell do you meet a russian spy or a chinese spy for that matter you cant just advertise in a newspaper hell maybe if i went down to the university and talked to some of those freaking commie students i was shocked carmel you cant sell your own country like that the hell i cant the statue of liberty is just another broad and ill take what i can get for her dont be a fool he reached in his jacket pocket and took out a caramel candy like he always did when he was excited ill bet somebody in the mob will know they know everything jesus there has to be some way of cashing in on this the presidents actual television broadcast was transmitted to the world at pm est march the russians and chinese were given twentyfour hours to get out of fernando poo or the skies over santa isobel would begin raining nuclear missiles this is darn serious the chief executive said and america will not shirk its responsibility to the freedomloving people of fernando poo the broadcast concluded at pm est and within two minutes people attempting to get reservations on trains planes busses or car pools to canada had virtually every telephone wire in the country overloaded in moscow where it was ten the next morning the premier called a conference and said crisply that character in washington is a mental lunatic and he means it get our men out of fernando poo right away then find out who authorized sending them in there in the first place and transfer him to be supervisor of a hydroelectric works in outer mongolia we dont have any men in fernando poo a commissar said mournfully the americans are imagining things again well how the hell can we withdraw men if we dont have them there in the first place the premier demanded i dont know weve got twentyfour hours to figure that out or the commissar quoted an old russian proverb which means roughly that when the polar bear excrement interferes with the fan belts the machinery overheats suppose we just announce that our troops are coming out another commissar suggested they cant say were lying if they dont find any of our troops there afterward no they never believe anything we say they want to be shown the premier said thoughtfully well have to infiltrate some troops surreptitiously and then withdraw them with a lot of fanfare and publicity that should do it im afraid it wont end the problem another pommissar said funereally our intelligence indicates that there are chinese troops there unless peking backs down were going to be caught in the middle when the bombs start flying and he quoted a proverb about the man in the intersection when two manure trucks collide damn the premier said what the blue blazes do the chinese want with fernando poo he was harassed but still he spoke with authority he was in fact characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time he was fiftyfive years old tough shrewd unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals and had long ago decided that the world was a mean sonofabitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can survive he was also as kind as was possible for one holding that ultradarwinian philosophy and he genuinely loved children and dogs unless they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the national interest he still retained some sense of humor despite the burdens of his almost godly office and although he had been impotent with his wife for nearly ten years now he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled prostitute within minutes he took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on his grueling twentyhour day with the result that his vision of the world was somewhat skewed in a paranoid direction and he took tranquilizers to keep from worrying too much with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on schizophrenia but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail grip on reality in short he was much like the rulers of america and china and banishing thomas edison and his light bulbs from mind saul goodman looks back over the first eight memos briefly using the conservative and logical side of his personality rigidly holding back the intuitive functions it was a habitual exercise with him and he called it expansionandcontraction leaping in the dark for the connection that must exist between fact one and fact two then going back slowly to check on himself the names and phrases flow past in review fra dolcinoroshinayahassan i sabbahweishauptassassinationsjohn kennedy bobby kennedy martin luther kingmayor daleycecil rhodes george washington choices it is all true exactly as the memos suggest it is partly true and partly false it is all false and there is no secret society that has endured from ad to the present well it isnt all true mayor daley never said ewige blumenkraft to senator ribicoff saul had read in the washington post a lipreaders translation of daleys diatribe and there was no german in it although there was obscenity and antisemitism the weishauptwashington impersonation theory also had some flawsin those days before plastic surgery such an undetected assumption of the identity of a wellknown figure was especially hard to credit despite the circumstantial evidence quoted in the memostwo strong arguments against choice one the memos are not all true how about choice three the illuminati might not be a straight unbroken line from the first recruit gathered by old hassan i sabbah to the person who bombed confrontationit might have died and lain dormant for a term like the ku klux klan between and and it might have gone through such breakups and resurrections more than once in eight centuriesbut linkages of some sort however tenuous reached from the eleventh century to the twentieth from the near east to europe and from europe to america sauls dissatisfaction with official explanations of recent assassinations the impossibility of making any rational sense out of current american foreign policy and the fact that even historians who vehemently distrusted all conspiracy theories acknowledged the pivotal role of secret masonic lodges in the french revolution all these added weight to the rejection of choice besides the masons were the first group according to at least two of the memos infiltrated by weishaupt choice is definitely out then and choice almost certainly equally invalid choice therefore is most probably correct the theory in the memos is partly true and partly false but what in essence is the theoryand which part of it is true which part false saul lit his pipe closed his eyes and concentrated the theory in essence was that the illuminati recruited people through various fronts turned them on to some sort of illuminizing experience through marijuana or some special extract of marijuana and converted them into fanatics willing to use any means necessary to illuminize the rest of the world their aim obviously is nothing less than the total transformation of humanity itself along the lines suggested by the film or by nietzsches concept of the superman in the course of this conspiracy the illuminati according to maliks hints to jackson were systematically assassinating every popular political figure who might interfere with their program saul thought suddenly of charlie manson and of the glorification of manson by the weatherman and morituri bombers he thought of the popularity of pot smoking and of the slogan by any means necessary with contemporary radical youth even outside weatherman and he thought of neitzsches slogans be hard whatever is done for love is beyond good and evil above the ape is man and above man the superman forget not thy whip in spite of his own logic which had proved that maliks theory was only partly true saul goodman a lifelong liberal suddenly felt a pang of typically rightwing terror toward modern youth he reminded himself that malik seemed to think the conspiracy emanated chiefly from mad dogand that was gods lightning country down there gods lightning had no fondness for marijuana or for youth or for the definitely antichristian overtones of the illuminati philosophy besides maliks sources were only partly trustworthy and there were other possibilities the shriners for instance were part of the masonic movement were generally rightwing had their own hidden rites and secrets and used arabic trappings that might well derive from hassan i sabbah or the roshinaya of afghanistan who could say what secret plots were hatched at shriner conventions no that was the intuitive pole vaulter in the right lobe at work again and right now saul was concerned with the plodding logician in the left lobe the key to the mystery was in getting a clearer definition of the purpose of the illuminati identify the change they were trying to accomplishin man and in his societyand then you would be able to guess at least approximately who they were their aim was english domination of the world and they were rhodes scholarsaccording to the birchers that idea obviously belonged with sauls own whimsey about a worldwide shriner conspiracy what then the italian llluminati under fra dolcino wanted to redistribute the wealthbut the international bankers mentioned in the playboy letter presumably wanted to hold onto their wealth weishaupt was a freethinker according to the britannica and so were washington and jefferson but sabbah and joachim of florence were evidently heretical mystics of the islamic and catholic traditions respectively saul picked up the ninth memo deciding to get more facts or pretended facts before analyzing furtherand then it hit him whatever the illuminati were aiming at had not been accomplished proof if it had they would not still be conspiring in secret since almost everything has been tried in the course of human history find out what hasnt been tried at least not on a large scaleand that will be the condition to which the illuminati are trying to move the rest of mankind capitalism had been tried communism has been tried even henry georges single tax has been tried in australia fascism feudalism and mysticism have been tried anarchism has never been tried anarchism was frequently associated with assassinations it had an appeal for freethinkers such as kropotkin and bakunin but also for religious idealists like tolstoy and dorothy day of the catholic worker movement most anarchists hoped joachimlike to redistribute the wealth but rebecca had once told him about a classic of anarchist literature max stirners the ego and his own which had been called the billionaires bible because it stressed the advantages the rugged individualist would gain in a stateless societyand cecil rhodes was an adventurer before he was a banker the illuminati were anarchists it all fit the pieces of the puzzle slipped together smoothly saul was convinced he was also wrong well just get our troops out of fernando poo the chairman of the chinese communist party said on april a place that size isnt worth world war but we dont have any troops there an aide told him its the russians who do oh the chairman quoted a proverb to the effect that there was urine in the rosewater i wonder what the hell the russians want with fernando poo he added thoughtfully he was harassed but still he spoke with authority he was in fact characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time he was fiftyfive years old tough shrewd unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals and had long ago decided that the world was a mean sonofabitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can survive he was also as kind as was possible for one holding that ultradarwinian philosophy and he genuinely loved children and

sometimes bordered on the schizophrenic but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail grip on reality in short he was much like the rulers of america and russia and its not only a sin against god mr mocenigo shouts but it gives you germs too it is early spring on mulberry street and young charlie mocenigo raises terrified eyes look look mr mocenigo goes on angrily dont believe your own father see what the dictionary says look look at the page here see masturbation selfpollution do you know what selfpollution means do you know how long those germs last and in another spring charles mocenigo a pale skinny introverted genius registers for his first semester at mit and coming to the square on the form that says religion writes in careful block capitals atheist he has read kinsey and hirschfeld and almost all the biologically oriented sexological treatises by this timestudiously ignoring psychoanalysts and such unscientific typesand the only visible remnant of that early adolescent terror is a habit of washing his hands frequently when under tension which earns him the nickname soapy general talbot looks at mocenigo pityingly and raises his pistol to the scientists head on august the world produced its usual crop of new humans all programmed to act more or less alike all containing minor variations of the same basic dna blueprint of these approximately were female and were male and two of the males born at the same second were to play a large role in our story and to pursue somewhat similar and anabatic careers the first born over a cheap livery stable in the bronx new york was named arthur flegenheimer and at the other end of his life spoke very movingly about his mother as well as about bears and sidewalks and french canadian bean soup the second born in one of the finest old homes on beacon hill in boston was named robert putney drake and at the other end of his life thought rather harshly of his mother but when the paths of mr flegenheimer and mr drake crossed in one of the links was formed which led to the fernando poo incident and in present time more or less was summoned to meet w in the headquarters of a certain branch of british intelligence the date was march but being english neither nor w gave a thought to blessed saint patrick instead they spoke of fernando poo the yanks w said crisply are developing evidence that the russians or the chinese or both of them are behind this tequilla y moto swine of course even if that were true it wouldnt matter a damn to her majestys government what do we care if a speck of an island that size turns red but you know the yanks theyre ready to go to war over it although they havent announced that publicly yet my mission asked the fault lines of cruelty about his mouth turning into a most engaging smile is to hop down to fernando poo and find out the real politics of this tequilla y mota bloke and if he is red overthrow him before the yanks blow up the world thats the assignment we cant have a bloody nuclear war just when the balance of payments is almost straightened out and the common market is finally starting to work so hop to it straightaway naturally if youre captured her majestys government will have to disavow any knowledge of your actions it always seems to work out that way said ironically i wish for once youd give me a mission where her majestys bleeding government would stand behind me in a tight spot but of course was merely being witty as a loyal subject he would follow orders under any circumstances even if it required the death of every soul on fernando poo and himself as well he rose in his characteristic debonair fashion and headed for his own office where he began his preparations for the fernando poo mission his first step was to check his personal worldwide travel notebook seeking the bar in santa isobel which came closest to serving a suitable martini and the restaurant most likely to prepare an endurable lobster newburg to his horror there was no such bar and no such restaurant santa isobel was bereft of social graces i say muttered this is going to be a bit thick but he cheered up quickly for he knew that fernando poo would be equipped at least with a bevy of tawnyskinned or coffeecolored females and such women were the holy grail to him besides he had already formed his own theory about fernando poo he was convinced that buggerblowhards unreformed gangsters goons and espionage renegades an international conspiracy of criminals and double agents led by the infamous and mysterious eric the red blowhardwas behind it all had never heard of the illuminati in fact despite his dark hair combed straight back his piercing eyes his cruel and handsome face his trim athletes body and his capacity to penetrate any number of females and defenestrate any number of males in the course of duty was not really an ideal intelligence agent he had grown up reading ian fleming novels and one day at the age of twentyone looked in the mirror decided he was everything a fleming hero should be and started a campaign to get into the spy game after fourteen years in bureaucratic burrowing he finally arrived in one of the intelligence services but it was much more the kind of squalid and bumbling organization in which harry palmer had toiled his cynical days away than it was a berth of bondage nevertheless did his best to refurbish and glamorize the scene and perhaps because god looks after fools he hadnt managed to get himself killed in any of the increasingly bizarre missions to which he was assigned the missions were all weird at first because nobody took them seriouslythey were all based on wild rumors that had to be checked out just in case there be some truth in thembut later it was realized that s peculiar schizophrenia was well suited to certain real problems just as the schizoid of the more withdrawn type is ideal for a sleeper agent since he could easily forget what was conventionally considered his real self of course nobody at any time ever took bugger seriously and behind his back s obsession with this organization was a subject of much interdepartmental humor wonderful as it was mary lou said some of it was scary why simon asked all those hallucinations i thought i might be losing my mind simon lit another joint and passed it over to her what makes you think even now that it was just hallucinations he asked rock rock rock till broad daylight if that was real mary lou said firmly everything else in my life has been a hallucination simon grinned now he said calmly youre getting the point the second trip or chokmah hopalong horus rides again hang on for some metaphysics the aneristic principle is that of order the eristic principle is that of disorder on the surface the universe seems to the ignorant to be ordered this is the aneristic illusion actually what order is there is imposed on primal chaos in the same sense that a persons name is draped over his actual self it is the job of the scientist for example to implement this principle in a practical manner and some are quite brilliant at it but on closer examination order dissolves into disorder which is the eristic illusion malaclypse the younger ksc principia discordia and spaceship earth that glorious and bloody circus continued its fourbillionyearlong spiral orbit about the

those on the light side moved about the tasks appointed for them by their rulers or idled waiting for the next order from above in las vegas dr charles mocenigo woke from another nightmare and went to the toilet to wash his hands he thought of his date the next night with sherri brandi and quite mercifully had no inkling that it would be his last contact with a woman still seeking calm he went to the window and looked at the starsbeing a specialist with no interest beyond his own field he imagined he was looking up rather than out at them in new delhi aboard the afternoon twa flight for hong kong honolulu and los angeles r buckminster fuller one of the few people to be aware that he lived on a spaceship glanced at his three watches showing local time pm time at honolulu his point of destination am the next morning and present time in his home at carbondale illinois am the previous morning in paris the noon crowds were jostled by hordes of young people distributing leaflets glowingly describing the worlds greatest rock festival and cosmic love feast to be celebrated on the shores of lake totenkopf near ingolstadt at the end of the month at sunderland england a young psychiatrist left his lunch to rush to the chronic ward and listen to weird babble proceeding from a patient who had been decadesilent on walpurgasnacht its coming thats when his power is strongest thats when youll see him right at the very stroke of midnight in the middle of the atlantic howard the porpoise swimming with friends in the midmorning sun encountered some sharks and had a nasty fight saul goodman rubbed tired eyes in new york city as dawn crept over the windowsill and read a memo about charlemagne and the courts of the illuminated rebecca goodman meanwhile read how the jealous priests of belmarduk betrayed babylon to the invading army of cyrus because their young king belshazzar had embraced the lovecult of the goddess ishtar in chicago simon moon was listening to the birds begin to sing and waiting for the first cinnamon rays of dawn as mary lou servix slept beside him his mind was active thinking about pyramids and raingods and sexual yoga and fifthdimensional geometries but thinking mostly about the ingolstadt rock festival and wondering if it would all happen as hagbard celine had predicted two blocks north in space and over forty years back in time simons mother heard pistol shots as she left wobbly hallsimon was a secondgeneration anarchistand followed the crowd to gather in front of the biograph theatre where a man lay bleeding to death in the alley and the next morningjuly billie freschette in her cell at cook county jail got the news from a matron in this white mans country i am the lowliest of the lowly subjugated because i am not white and subjugated again because i am not male i am the embodiment of all that is rejected and scornedthe female the colored the tribe the earthall that has no place in this world of white male technology i am the tree that is cut down to make room for the factory that poisons the air i am the river filled with sewage i am the body that the mind despises i am the lowliest of the lowly the mud beneath your feet and yet of all the world john dillinger picked me to be his bride he plunged within me into the very depths of me i was his bride not as your wise men and churches and governments know marriage but we were truly wed as the tree is wed to the earth the mountain to the sky the sun to the moon i held his head to my breast and tousled his hair as if it were sweet as fresh grass and i called him johnnie he was more than a man he was mad but not mad not as a man may go mad when he leaves his tribe and lives among hostile strangers and is mistreated and scorned he was not mad as all other white men are mad because they have never known a tribe he was mad as a god might be mad and now they tell me he is dead well the matron asked finally arent you going to say anything arent you indians human she had a real evil shine in her eye like the eye of the rattlesnake she wants to see me cry she stands there and waits watching me through the bars dont you have any feelings at all are you some kind of animal i say nothing i keep my face immobile no white shall ever see the tears of a menominee at the biograph theatre molly moon turns away in disgust as souvenir hunters dip their handkerchiefs in the blood i turn away from the matron and look up out the barred window to the stars and the spaces between them seem bigger than ever bigger and emptier inside me there is a space like that now big and empty and it will never be filled again when the tree is torn out by its roots the earth must feel that way the earth must scream silently as i screamed silently but she understood the sacramental meaning of the handkerchiefs dipped in blood as simon understands it simon in fact had what can only be called a funky education i mean man when your parents are both anarchists the chicago public school system is going to do your head absolutely no good at all feature me in a classroom with eisenhowers moby dick face on one wall and nixons captain ahab glare on the other and in between standing in front of the inevitable american rag miss doris day or her older sister telling the class to take home a leaflet explaining to their parents why its important for them to vote my parents dont vote i say well this leaflet will explain to them why they should she tells me with the real authentic doris day sunshine and kansas cornball smile its early in the term and she hasnt heard about me from the lastsemester teacher i really dont think so i say politely they dont think it makes any difference whether eisenhower or stevenson is in the white house they say the orders will still come from wall street its like a thundercloud all the sunshine goes away they never prepared her for this in the school where they turn out all these doris day replicas the wisdom of the fathers is being questioned she opens her mouth and closes it and opens and closes it and finally takes such a deep breath that every boy in the room were all on the cusp of puberty gets a hardon from watching her breasts heave up and slide down again i mean theyre all praying except me im an atheist of course that they wont get called on to stand up if it wouldnt attract attention theyd be clubbing their dicks down with their geography books thats the wonderful thing about this country she finally gets out even people with opinions like that can say what they want without going to jail you must be nuts i say my dads been in and out of jail so many times they should put in a special revolving door just for him my mom too you oughta go out with subversive leaflets in this town and see what happens then of course after school a gang of patriots with the odds around seventoone beat the shit out of me and make me kiss their redwhiteandblue totem its no better at home moms an anarchopacifist tolstoy and all that and she wants me to say i didnt fight back dads a wobbly and wants to be sure that i hurt some of them at least as bad as they hurt me after they yell at me for a half hour they yell at each other for two bakunin said this and kropotkin said that and gandhi said the other and martin luther king is the savior of america and martin luther king is a bloody fool whos selling his people an opium utopia and all that jive go down to wobbly hall or solidarity bookstore and youll still hear the same debate doubled redoubled in spades and vulnerable so naturally i start hanging out on wall street and smoking dope and pretty soon im the youngest living member of what they called the beat generation which does not improve my relations with school authorities but at least its a relief from all that patriotism and anarchism by the time im seventeen and they shot kennedy and the country starts coming apart at the seams were not beatniks anymore were hippies and the thing to do is go to mississippi did you ever go to mississippi you know what dr johnson said about scotland the best thing you can say for it is that god created it for some purpose but the same is true of hell blot mississippi its not part of this story anyway the next stop was antioch in dear old yellow springs where i majored in mathematics for reasons you will soon guess the pot there grows wild in acres and acres of beautiful nature preserve kept up by the college you can go out there at night pick your own grass for the week from the female of the hemp species and sleep under the stars with a female of your own species then wake up in the morning with birds and rabbits and the whole lost thomas wolfe america scene a stone a leaf and unfound door and all of it then make it to class really feeling good and ready for an education once i woke up with a spider running across my face and i thought so a spider is running across my face and brushed him off gently its his world too in the city i would have killed him what i mean is antioch is a stone groove but that life is no preparation for coming back to chicago and chemical warfare not that i ever got maced before but i could read the signs dont let anybody tell you its pollution brothers and sisters its chemical warfare theyll kill us all to make a buck i got stoned one night and went home to see what it would be like relating to mom and dad in that condition it was the same but different tolstoy coming out of her mouth bakunin out of his and it was suddenly all weird and superfreaky like goddard shooting a kafka scene two dead russians debating with each other long after they were dead and buried out of the mouths of a pair of chicago irish radicals the young frontallobetype anarchists in the city were in their first surrealist revival just then and i had been reading some of their stuff and it clicked youre both wrong i said freedom wont come through love and it wont come through force it will come through the imagination i put in all the capital letters and i was so stoned that they got contacthigh and heard them too their mouths dropped open and i felt like william blake telling tom paine where it was really at a knight of magic waving my wand and dispersing the shadows of maya dad was the first to recover imagination he said his big red face crinkling in that grin that always drove the cops crazy when they were arresting him thats what comes of sending good workingclass boys to rich peoples colleges words and books get all mixed up with reality in their heads when you were in that jail in mississippi you imagined yourself through the walls didnt you how many times an hour did you imagine yourself through the walls i can guess the first time i was arrested during the ge strike of thirtythree i walked through those walls a million times but every time i opened my eyes the walls and the bars were still there what got me out finally what got you out of biloxi finally organization if you want big words to talk to intellectuals with thats a fine big word son just as many syllables as imagination and it has a lot more realism in it thats what i remember best about him that one speech and the strange clear blue of his eyes he died that year and i found out that there was more to the imagination than i had known for he didnt die at all hes still around in the back of my skull somewhere arguing with me and thats the truth its also the truth that hes dead really dead and part of me was buried with him its uncool to love your father these days so i didnt even know that i loved him until they closed the coffin and i heard myself sobbing and it comes back again that same emptiness whenever i hear joe hill the copper bosses lulled you joe i never died said he both lines are true and mourning never ends they didnt shoot dad the clean way like joe hill but they ground him down year after year burning out his wob fires and he was aries a real fire sign with their cops their courts their jails and their taxes their corporations their cages for the spirit and cemeteries for the soul their plastic liberalism and murderous marxism and even as i say that i have to pay a debt to lenin for he gave me the words to express how i felt when dad was gone revolutionaries he said are dead men on furlough the democratic convention of was coming and i knew that my own furlough might be much shorter than dads because i was ready to fight them in the streets all spring mom was busy at the women for peace center and i was busy conspiring with surrealists and yippies then i met mao tsuhsi it was april walpurgasnacht pause for thunder on the soundtrack and i was rapping with some of the crowd at the friendly stranger hp lovecraft the rock group not the writer was conducting services in the back room pounding away at the door to acid land in the gallant effort new and striking that year to break in on waves of sound without any chemical skeleton key at all and i am in no position to evaluate their success objectively since i was as is often the case with me and ths percent stoned out of my gourd before they began operations i kept catching this uniquely pensive oriental face at the next table but my own gang including the weird faggotpriest we nicknamed padre pederastia had most of my attention i was laying it on them heavy it was my donatien alphonse francois de sade period the headtrip anarchists are as constipated as the marxists i was giving forth you recognize the style by now who speaks for the thalamus the glands the cells of the organism who sees the organism we cover it with clothes to hide its apehood we wont have liberated ourselves from servitude until people throw all their clothes in the closet in spring and dont take them out again until winter we wont be human beings the way apes are apes and dogs are dogs until we fuck where and when we want to like any other mammal fucking in the streets isnt just a tactic to blow minds its recapturing our own bodies anything less and were still robots possessing the wisdom of the straight line but not the understanding of the organic curve and so on and so forth i think i found a few good arguments for rape and murder while i was at it the next step beyond anarchy somebody said cynically real chaos why not i demanded who works at a straight job here none of them did of course i deal dope myself will you work at a straight job for something that calls itself an anarchist syndicate will you run an engine lathe eight unfucking hours a day because the syndicate tells you the people need what the lathe produces if you will the people just becomes a new tyrant to hell with machines kevin mccool the poet said enthusiastically back to the caves he was as stoned as me the oriental face leaned over she was wearing a strange headband with a golden apple inside a pentagon her black eyes somehow reminded me of my fathers blue eyes what you want is an organization of the imagination she asked politely i flipped it was too much hearing those words just then a man at the vedanta society told me that john dillinger walked through the walls when he made his escape from crown point jail miss mao went on in a level tone do you think that is possible you know how dark coffee houses are the friendly stranger was murkier than most i had to get out blake talked to the archangel gabriel every morning at breakfast but i wasnt that heavy yet hey where you going simon somebody called miss mao didnt say anything and i didnt look back at that polite and pensive faceit would have been much easier if she looked sinister and inscrutable but when i hit lincoln and started toward fullerton i heard steps behind me i turned and padre pederastia touched my arm gently i asked her to come and listen to you he said she was to give a signal if she thought you were ready the signal was more dramatic than i expected it seems a conversation out of your past that had some heavy emotional meaning to you shes a medium i asked numbly you can name it that i looked at him in the light from the biograph marquee and i remembered moms story about the people dipping their handkerchiefs in dillingers blood and i heard the old hymn start in my head are you washed are you washed are you washed in the blood of the lamb and i remembered how we all thought he hung out with us freaks in the hope of leading us back to the church holy roman catholic and apostolic as dad called it when he was drunk and bitter it was obvious that whatever the padre was recruiting for had little to do with that particular theological trade union what is this i asked and who is that woman shes the daughter of fu manchu he said suddenly he threw his head back and laughed like a rooster crowing just as suddenly he stopped and looked at me just looked at me somehow i said slowly ive qualified for a small demonstration of whatever you and she are selling but i dont qualify for any more until i make the right move he gave the faintest hint of a nod and went on watching me well i was young and ignorant of everything outside ten million books id gobbled and guiltyunsure about my imaginative flights away from my fathers realism and of course stoned of course but i finally understood why he was watching me that way it was this part of it pure zen there was nothing i could do consciously or by volition that would satisfy him and i had to do exactly that which i could not not do namely be simon moon which led to deciding then and there without any time to mull it over and rationalize it just what the hell being simon moon or more precisely simonmooning consisted of and it seemed to be a matter of wandering through room after room of my brain looking for the owner and not finding him anywhere sweat broke out on my forehead it was becoming desperate because i was running out of rooms and the padre was still watching me nobody home i said finally sure that the answer wasnt good enough thats odd he said whos conducting the search and i walked through the walls and into the fire which was the beginning of the larger and funkier part of my simons education and where we cannot as yet follow him he sleeps now a teacher rather than a learner while mary lou servix awakes beside him and tries to decide whether it was just the pot or if something really spooky happened last night howard sports in the atlantic buckminster fuller flying above the pacific crosses the international date line and slips back into april again it is dawn in las vegas and mocenigo the nightmares and anxieties of night forgotten looks forward cheerfully to the production of the first live cultures of anthraxleprosypi which will make this a memorable day in more ways than he expects and george dorn somewhere outside this time system is writing in his journal each word however seems magically to appear by itself as if no volition on his part were necessary to its production he read the words his pencil scrawled but they appeared the communications of another intelligence yet they picked up where he had left off in his hotel room and they spoke with his private idiom the universe is the inside without any outside the sound made by one eye opening in fact i dont even know that there is a universe more likely there are many multiverses each with its own dimensions times spaces laws and eccentricities we wander between and among these multiverses trying to convince others and ourselves that we all walk together in a single public universe that we can share for to deny that axiom leads to what is called schizophrenia yeah thats it every mans skin is his own private multiverse just like every mans home is supposed to be his castle but all the multiverses are trying to merge to create a true universe such as we have only imagined previously maybe it will be spiritual like zen or telepathy or maybe it will be physical one great big gangfuck but it has to happen the creation of a universe and the one great eye opening to see itself at last aum shiva oh man youre stoned out of your gourd youre writing gibberish no im writing with absolute clarity for the first time in my life yeah well what was that business about the universe being the sound of one eye opening never mind that who the hell are you and how did you get into my head your turn now george sheriff cartwright stood in the door a monk in a strange red and white robe beside him holding some kind of wand the deep color of a fire engine nono george started to stammer but he knew of course you know the sheriff said kindlyas if he were suddenly sorry about it all you knew before you left new york and came down here they were at the foot of the gallows each with its own times spaces laws and eccentricities george was thinking wildly yes if the universe is one big eye looking at itself then telepathy is no miracle for anyone who opens his own eyes fully can then look through all other eyes for a moment george looks through the eyes of john ehrlichman as dick nixon urges lewdly you can say i dont remember you can say i cant recall i cant give any answer to that that i can recall icant give any answer to that that i can recall all flesh will see it in one instant who wrote that gonna miss you boy the sheriff said offering an embarrassed handshake numbly george clasped the mans hot reptilian palm the monk walked beside him up the gallows steps thirteen george was thinking there are always thirteen steps on a gallows and you always cream in your jeans when your neck breaks it has something to do with the pressure on the spinal cord being transmitted through the prostate gland the orgasmdeath gimmick burroughs calls it at the fifth step the monk said suddenly hail eris george stared at the man dumbfounded who was eris somebody in greek mythology but somebody very important it all depends on whether the fool has wisdom enough to repeat it quiet idiothe can hear us i got some bad pot george decided and im still back on the hotel bed hallucinating all this but he repeated uncertainly hail eris immediately just like his one and only acid trip dimension began to alter the steps grew larger steeperascending them seemed as perilous as climbing mount everest the air was suddenly lit with reddish flame definitely george thought some weird and freaky pot and then for some reason he looked upward each step was now higher than an ordinary building he was near the bottom of a pyramidal skyscraper of thirteen colossal levels and at the top and at the top and at the top one enormous eyea ruby and demonic orb of cold fire without mercy or pity or contempt looked at him and into him and through him the hand reaches down turns on both bathtub faucets fullpower then reaches upward to do the same to the sink faucets banananose maldonado leans forward and whispers to carmel now you can talk the old man using the name frank sullivan was met at los angeles international airport november by mao tsuhsi who drove him to his bungalow on fountain avenue he gave his report in terse unemotional sentences my god she said when he finished what do you make of it he thought carefully and grunted it beats the hell out of me the guy on the triple underpass was definitely harry coin i recognized him through my binoculars the guy in the window at the book depository very likely was this galoot oswald that theyve arrested the guy on the grassy knoll was bernard barker from the cia bay of pigs gang but i didnt get a good look at the gink on the county records building one thing im sure of we cant keep all this to ourselves at the very least we pass the word on to elf it might alter their plans for om youve heard of om she nodded saying operation mindfuck its their big project for the next decade or so this is a bigger mindfuck than anything they had planned red china maldonado whispers incredulously you musta been reading the readers digest we get all our horse from friendly governments like laos the cia would have our ass otherwise straining to be heard over the running water carmel asks despondently then you dont know how i could meet a communist spy maldonado stares at him levelly communism doesnt have a good image right now he says icily it is april two days after the fernando poo incident bernard barker former servant of both batista and castro dons his gloves outside the watergate in a flash of memory he sees the grassy knoll oswald harry coin and further back castro negotiating with banananose maldonado but this present year on march generalissimo tequilla y mota finally found the book he was looking for the one that was as precise and pragmatic about running a country as luttwaks coup detat had been about seizing one it was called the prince and its author was a subtle italian named machiavelli it told the generalissimo everything he wanted to knowexcept how to handle american hydrogen bombs which unfortunately machiavelli had lived too soon to foresee it is our duty our sacred duty to defend fernando poo atlanta hope was telling a cheering crowd in cincinnati that very day are we to wait until the godless reds are right here in cincinnati the crowd started to scream their unwillingness to wait that longthey had been expecting the godless reds to arrive in cincinnati since about and were by now convinced that the dirty cowards were never going to come and would have to be met on their own turfbut a group of dirty longhaired freakylooking students from antioch college began to chant i dont want to die for fernandoo poo the crowd turned in fury at last some real reds to fight seven ambulances and thirty police cars were soon racing to scene but only five years earlier atlanta had a different message when gods lightning was first founded as a splinter off womens liberation it had as its slogan no more sexism and its original targets were adult bookstores sexeducation programs mens magazines and foreign movies it was only after meeting smiling jim trepomena of knights of christianity united in faith that atlanta discovered that both male supremacy and orgasms were part of the international communist conspiracy it was at that point really that gods lightning and orthodox womens lib totally parted company for the orthodox faction just then were teaching that male supremacy and orgasms were part of the international kapitalist conspiracy fernando poo the president of the united states told reporters even as atlanta was calling for allout war will not become another laos or another costa rica when are we going to get our troops out of laos a reporter from the new york times asked quickly but a man from the washington post asked just as rapidly and when are we going to get our troops out of costa rica our present plans for withdrawal are going forward according to an orderly schedule the president began but in santa isabel itself as tequilla y mota underlined a passage in machiavelli concluded a shortwave broadcast to a british submarine lying miles off the coast of the island the yanks have gone absolutely bonkers im afraid ive been here nine days now and i am absolutely convinced there is not one russian or chinese agent in any way involved with generalissimo tequilla y mota nor are there any troops of either of those governments hiding anywhere in the jungles however bugger is definitely running a heroin smuggling ring here and i would like permission to investigate that the permission was to be denied old w back at intelligence hq in london knew that was a bit bonkers about bugger himself and imagined that it was involved in every mission he undertook at the same time in a different hotel tobias knight on special loan from the fbi to the cia concluded his nightly shortwave broadcast to an american submarine miles off the coast the russian troops are definitely engaged in building what can only be a rocketlaunching site and the slants are constructing what seems to be a nuclear installation and hagbard celine lying miles out in the bight of biafra in the lief erickson intercepted both messages and smiled cynically and wired p in new york activate malik and prepare dorn while the most obscure seemingly trivial part of the whole puzzle appeared in a department store in houston it was a sign that said no smoking no spitting the mgt this replaced an earlier sign that had hung on the main showroom wall for many years saying only no smoking the mgt the change although small had subtle repercussions the store catered only to the very wealthy and this clientele did not object to being told that they could not smoke the fire hazard after all was obvious on the other hand that bit about spitting was somehow a touch offensive they most certainly were not the sort of people who would spit on somebodys flooror at least none of them had done such a thing at any time since about one month or at most one year after they became wealthy yes the sign was definitely bad diplomacy resentment festered sales fell off and membership in the houston branch of gods lightning increased wealthy powerful membership the odd thing was that the management had nothing at all to do with the sign george dorn awoke screaming he lay on the floor of his cell in mad dog county jail his first frantic involuntary glance told him that harry coin had vanished completely from the adjoining cell the shitpot was back in its corner and he knew without being able to check that there would be no human intestines in it terror tactics he thought they were out to break hima task which was beginning to look easybut they were covering up the evidence as they went along there was no light through the cell window it was therefore still night he hadnt slept but merely fainted like a girl like a longhaired commie faggot oh shit and prune juice he told himself sourly cut it out youve known for years that youre no hero dont take that particular sore out and rub sandpaper on it now youre not a hero but youre a goddam stubborn pigheaded and determined coward thats why youve stayed alive on assignments like this before show these redneck mammyjammers just how stubborn pigheaded and determined you can be george started with an old gimmick a piece torn off the tail of his shirt gave him a writingtablet the point of his shoelace became a temporary pen his own saliva spat onto the polish of the shoes themselves created a substitute ink laboriously after a half hour be had his message written whoever finds this to call joe malik new york city and tell him george dorn held without lawyer mad dog county jail the message shouldnt land too close to the jail so george began looking for a weighted object in five minutes he decided on a spring from the bunk mattress it took him seventeen minutes more to pry it loose after the missile was hurled out toe windowprobably george knew to be found by somebody who would immediately turn it over to sheriff jim cartwrighthe began thinking of alternate plans he found however that instead of devising schemes for escape or deliverance his mind insisted on going off in an entirely different direction the face of the monk from his dream pursued him he had seen that face somewhere before he knew but where somehow the question was important he began trying in earnest to recreate the face and identify itjames joyce h p lovecraft and a monk in a painting by fra angelico all came to mind it was none of them but it looked somehow a little like each of them suddenly tired and discouraged george slouched back on the bunk and let his hand lightly clutch his penis through his trousers heroes of fiction dont jack off when the going gets rough he reminded himself well hell he wasnt a hero and this wasnt fiction besides i wasnt going to jackoff after all they might be watching through a peephole ready to use this natural jailhouse weakness to humiliate me further and break my ego no i definitely wasnt going to jackoff i was just going to hold it lightly through my trousers until i felt some lifeforce surging back into my body and displacing fear exhaustion and despair meanwhile i thought about pat back in new york she was wearing nothing but her cute black lace bra and panties and her nipples are standing up pointy and hard make it sophia loren and take the bra off so i can see the nipples directly ah yes and now try it the other way she sophia no make it pat again is wearing the bra but the panties are off showing the pubic bush let her play with it get her fingers in there and the other hand on a nipple ah yes and now she patno sophia is kneeling to unzipper my fly my penis grew harder and her mouth opened in expectation i reached down and cupped her breast with one hand taking the nipple she had been caressing feeling it harden more did james bond ever do this in doctor nos dungeon sophias tongue not my hand not my hand is busy and hot sending pulsations through my entire body take it you cunt take it o god a flash of the passaic and the gun at my forehead and you cant call them cunts nowadays ah you cunt you cunt take it and it is pat its that night at her pad when we were both zonked on hashish and i never never never had a blowjob like that before or since my hands were in her hair gripping her shoulders take it suck me off get out of my head mother and her mouth is wet and rhythmic and my cock is just as sensitive as that night zonked on the hash and i pulled the trigger and then the explosion came just as i did pardon the diction and i was on the floor coughing and bouncing my eyes watering the second blast lifted me again and threw me with a crunch against the wall then the machinegun fire started jesus h particular christ on a crutch i thought frantically whatever it is thats happening theyre going to find me with come on the front of my trousers and every bone in my body broken i think the machine gun suddenly stopped stuttering and i thought i heard a voice cry earwicker bloom and craftive still got joyce on my mind i decided then the third explosion came and i covered my head as parts of the ceiling began falling on me a key suddenly clanked against his cell door looking up i saw a young woman in a trench coat carrying a tommy gun and desperately trying one key after another in the lock from somewhere else in the building there came a fourth explosion the woman grinned tensely at the sound commie motherfuckers she muttered still trying keys who the hell are you i finally asked hoarsely never mind that now she snapped weve come to rescue youisnt that enough before i could think of a reply the door swung open quick she said this way i limped after her down the hall suddenly she stopped studied the wall a moment and pressed against a brick the wall slid smoothly aside and we entered what appeared to be a chapel of some sort good weeping jesus and his brother irving i thought im still still dreaming for the chapel was not anything that a sane man would expect to find in mad dog county jail decorated entirely in red and whitethe colors of hassan i sabbah and the assassins of alamout i remembered incredulouslyit was adorned with strange arabic symbols and slogans in german heute die welt m or gens das sonnensystem ewige blumenkraft und ewige schlangekraft gestern hanf heute hanf immer hanf and the altar was a pyramid with thirteen ledgeswith a rubyred eye at the top this symbol i now recalled with mounting confusion was the great seal of the united states this way the woman said motioning with her tommy gun we passed through another sliding wall and found ourselves in an alley behind the jail a black cadillac awaited us everybodys out the driver shouted he was an old man more than sixty but hard and shrewdlooking good the woman said heres george i was pushed into the back seatwhich was already full of grimlooking men and grimmerlooking munitions of various sortsand the car started at once one for good measure the woman in the trench coat shouted and threw another plastic bomb back at the jail right the driver said it fits toothat makes ft five the law of fives another passenger chuckled bitterly serves the commie bastards right a taste of their own medicine i could restrain myself no longer what the hell is going on i demanded who are you people what makes you think sheriff cartwright and his police are communists and where are you taking me shut up said the woman who had unlocked my cell nudging me none too affectionately with her machine gun well talk when were ready meanwhile wipe the come off your pants the car sped into the night in a bentley limousine fedrico banana nose maldonado drew on his cigar and relaxed as his chauffeur drove him toward robert putney drakes mansion in blue point long island in back of his eyes almost forgotten charlie the bug workman mendy weiss and jimmy the shrew listen soberly on october as banana nose tells them dont give the dutchman a chance cowboy the son of a bitch the three guns nod stolidly cowboying somebody is messy but it pays well in an ordinary hit you can be precise even artistic because after all the only thing that matters is that the person so honored should be definitely dead afterwards cowboying in the language of the profession leaves no room for personal taste or delicacy the important thing is that there should be a lot of lead in the air and the victim should leave a spectacularly gory corpse for the tabloids as notification that the brotherhood is both edgy and shorttempered and everybody better watch his ass although it wasnt obligatory it was considered a sign of true enthusiasm on a cowboy job if the guest of honor took along a few innocent bystanders so everybody would understand exactly how edgy the brotherhood was feeling the dutchman took two such bystanders and in a different world that is still this world albert the teacher stern opens his morning paper on july and reads fbi shoots dillinger thinking wistfully if icould kill somebody that important my name would never be forgotten further back back further february vincent mad dog coll looks through the phonebooth door and sees a familiar face crossing the drugstore and a tommygun in the mans hand the goddamned pigheaded dutchman he howled but nobody heard him because the thompson gun was already systematically spraying the phonebooth up and down right and left left and right and up and down again for good measure but tilt the picture another way andthis emerges on november the worlds greatest newspaper the chicago tribune announced the election to the presidency of the united states of america of thomas dewey a man who not only was not elected but would not even have been alive if banana nose maldonado had not given such specific instructions concerning the dutchman to charlie the bug mendy weiss and jimmy the shrew who shot you the police stenographer asked mother is the best bet oh mama mama mama i want harmony dont want harmony is the delirious answer who shot you the question is repeated the dutchman still replies oh mama mama mama french canadian bean soup we drove till dawn the car stopped on a road by a beach of white sand tall skinny palm trees stood black against a turquoise sky this must be the gulf of mexico i thought they could now load me with chains and drop me in the gulf hundreds of miles from mad dog without involving sheriff jim no they had raided sheriff jims jail or was that a hallucination i was going to have to keep more of an eye on reality this was a new day and i was going to know facts hard and sharpedged in the sunlight and keep them straight i was stiff and sore and tired from a night of driving the only rest id gotten was fitful dozing in which cyclopean ruby eyes looked at me till i awoke in terror mavis the woman with the tommy gun had put her arms around me several times when i screamed she would murmur soothingly to me and once her lips smooth cool and soft had brushed my ear at the beach mavis motioned me out of the car the sun was as hot as the bishops jock strap when he finished his sermon on the evils of pornography she stepped out behind me and slammed the door we wait here she said the others go back what are we waiting for i asked just then the driver of the car gunned the motor the car swung round in a wide uturn in a minute its rear end had disappeared beyond a bend in the gulf highway we were alone with the rising sun and the sandstrewn asphalt mavis motioned me to walk down the beach with her a little ways ahead far back from the water was a small whitepainted frame cabana a woodpecker landed wearily on its roof like he had flown more missions than yossarian and never intended to go up again whats the plan mavis a private execution on a lonely beach in another state so sheriff jim cant get blamed dont be a dummy george we blew up that commie bastards jail why do you keep calling sheriff cartwright a commie if ever a man had kkk written all over his forehead it was that reactionary redneck prick dont you know your trotsky worse is better slobs like cartwright are trying to discredit america to make it ripe for a leftwing takeover im a leftwinger if youre against commies youve got to be against me i didnt care to tell her about my other friends in weatherman and morituri youre just a liberal dupe im not a liberal im a militant radical a radical is nothing but a liberal with a big mouth and a militant radical is nothing but a bigmouthed liberal with a che costume balls were the real radicals george we do things like last night except for weatherman and morituri all the militant radicals in your crowd ever do is take out the molotov cocktail diagram that they carefully clipped from the new york review of books hang it on the bathroom door and jackoff in connection with it no offense meant the woodpecker turned his head and watched us suspiciously like a paranoid old man and what are your politics if youre such a radical i asked i believe that government governs best of all that governs least of all preferably not at all and i believe in the laissez faire capitalist economic system then you must hate my politics why did you rescue me youre wanted she said by whom hagbard celine and who is hagbard celine we had reached the cabana and were standing beside it facing each other glaring at each other the woodpecker turned his head and looked at us with the other eye what is john guilt mavis said i might have guessed i thought a hope fiend she went on it took a whole book to answer that one as for hagbard youll learn by seeing enough for now that you know that hes the man who requested that we rescue you but you personally dont like me and would not have gone out of your way to help me i dont know about not liking you that splotch of come on your trousers has had me horny ever since mad dog also the excitement of the raid ive got some tension to burn off id prefer to save myself for a man who completely meets the criteria of my value system but i could get awfully horny waiting for him no regrets no guilt though youre all right youll do what are you talking about im talking about your fucking me george i never knew a girli mean womanwho believed in the capitalist system who was any kind of a good fuck what has your pathetic circle of acquaintances got to do with the price of gold i doubt you ever met a woman who believed in the real laissez faire capitalist system such a woman is not likely to be caught traveling in your leftliberal circles she took me by the hand and led me into the cabana she shrugged out of her trench coat and spread it carefully on the floor she was wearing a black sweater and a pair of blue jeans both tightfitting she pulled the sweater off over her head she was wearing no bra and her breasts were applesized cherrytipped cones there was some sort of dark red birthmark between them your kind of capitalist woman was a nixonette in and she believes in that halfass corporate socialist bastard fascist mixed economy frank roosevelt blessed these united states with she unbuckled her wide black belt and unzipped her jeans she tugged them down over her hips i felt my hardon swelling up inside my pants libertarian women are good fucks because they know what they want and what they want they like a lot she stepped out of her jeans to reveal of all things panties made of some strange metalliclooking synthetic material that was gold in color how can i know facts hard and sharpedged in the sunlight and keep them straight when this happens you really want me to fuck you right now on this public beach in broad daylight the woodpecker went to work above us just then banging away like a rock drummer i suddenly remembered from high school the woodpecker pecked on the outhouse door he pecked and he pecked till his pecker was sore george youre too serious dont you know how to play did you ever think that life is maybe a game there is no difference between life and a game you know when you play for instance playing with a toy there is no winning or losing life is a toy george im a toy think of me as a doll instead of sticking pins in me you can stick your thing in me fm a magic doll like a voodoo doll a doll is a work of art art is magic you make an image of the thing you want to possess or cope with so you can cope with it you make a model so you have it under control dig dont you want to possess me you can but just for a moment i shook my head i cant believe you the way youre talkingits not real i always talk like this when im horny it happens that at such times im more open to the vibrations from outer space george are unicorns real who made unicorns is a thought about unicorns a real thought how is it different from the mental picture of my pussywhich youve never seenthat youve got in your head at this minute does the fact that you can think of fucking me and i can think of fucking with you mean we are going to fuck or is the universe going to surprise us wisdom is wearying folly is fun what does a horse with a single long horn sticking straight out of its head mean to you my eyes went from the pubic bulge under her gold panties where theyd strayed when she said pussy to the mark between her breasts it wasnt a birthmark i felt like a bucket of ice water hit my groin i pointed what does a red eye inside a redandwhite triangle mean to you her open hand slammed against my jaw motherfucker never speak to me about that then she bowed her head im sorry george i had no right to do that hit me back if you want i dont want but im afraid youve turned me off sexually nonsense youre a healthy man but now i want to give you something without taking anything from you she knelt before me on her trench coat her knees parted unzipped my fly reached in with quick tickling fingers and pulled my penis out she slipped her mouth around it it was my jail fantasy coming true what are you doing she took her lips away from my penis and i looked down and saw that the head was shiny with saliva and swelling visibly in rapid throbs her breastsmy glance avoided the masonic tattoowere somewhat fuller and the nipples stuck out erect she smiled dont whistle while youre pissing george and dont ask questions when youre getting blowed shut up and get hard this is just quid pro quo when i came i didnt feel much juice jetting out through my penis id used a lot up whacking off in jail i noted with pleasure that what there was of it she didnt spit out she smiled and swallowed it the sun was higher and hotter in the sky and the woodpecker celebrated by drumming faster and harder the gulf sparkled like mrs asters best diamonds i peered out at the water just below the horizon there was a flash of gold among the diamonds mavis suddenly struck her legs out in front of her and dropped onto her back george i cant give without taking please quick while its still hard get down here and slip it to me i looked down her lips were trembling she was tugging the gold panties away from her blackescutcheoned crotch my wet cock was already beginning to droop i looked down at her and grinned no i said i dont like girls who slap you one minute and get the hots for you the next minute they dont meet the criteria of my value system i think theyre nuts carefully and deliberately i stuffed my pecker back into my trousers and stepped away from her it was sore anyway like in the rhyme youre not such a schmuck after all you bastard she said through gritted teeth her hand was moving rapidly between her legs in a moment she arched her back eyes clenched tight and emitted a little scream like a baby seagull out on its first flight a strangely virginal sound she lay relaxed for a moment then picked herself up off the cabana floor and started to dress she glanced out at the water and i followed her eyes she pointed at the distant glint of gold hagbards here a buzzing sound floated across the water after a moment i spotted a small black motorboat coming toward us we watched in silence as the boat grounded its bow on the white beach mavis motioned at me and i followed her down the sand to the waters edge there was a man in a black turtleneck sweater sitting in the stern of the boat mavis climbed in the bow and turned to me with a questioning look the woodpecker felt bad vibes and took off with a flapping and cawing like the omen of doom what the hell am i getting into and why am i so crazy as to go along i tried to see what it was out there that the motorboat had come from but the sun on the gold metal was flashing blindingly and i couldnt make out a shape i looked back at the black motorboat and saw that there was a circular gold object painted on the bow and there was a little black flag flying at the stern with the same gold object in its center i pointed at the emblem on the bow whats that an apple said mavis people who chose a golden apple as their symbol couldnt be all bad i jumped into the boat and its pilot used an oar to push off we buzzed over the smooth water of the gulf toward the golden object on the horizon it was still blinding from reflected sunlight but i was now able to make out a long low silhouette with a small tower in the center like a matchbox on top of a broomstick then i realized that i had my judgment of distances wrong the ship or whatever it was was much more distant than id first realized it was a submarinea golden submarineand it appeared to be the equivalent of five city blocks long as big as the biggest ocean liner i had ever heard of the conning tower was about three stories high as we drew up beside it i saw a man on the tower waving to us mavis waved back i waved halfheartedly supposing somehow that it was the thing to do i was still thinking about that masonic tattoo a hatch opened in the submarines side and the little motorboat floated right in the hatch closed the water drained out and the boat settled into a cradle mavis pointed to a door that looked like an entrance to an elevator you go that way she said ill see you later maybe she pressed a button and the door opened revealing a carpeted gilt cage i stepped in and was whisked up three stories the door opened and i stepped out into a small room where a man was waiting standing with a grace that reminded me of a hindu or an american indian i thought at once of metternichs remark about talleyrand if somebody kicked him in the backside not a muscle would move in his face until he decided what to do he bore a striking resemblance to anthony quinn he had thick black eyebrows olive skin and a strong nose and jaw he was big and burly powerful muscles bulging under his blackandgreen striped nautical sweater he held out his hand good george you made it im hagbard celine we shook hands he had a grip like king kong welcome aboard the lief erickson named after the first european to reach america from the atlantic side may my italian ancestors forgive me fortunately i have viking ancestors as well my mother is norwegian however blond hair blue eyes and fair skin are all recessive my sicilian father creamed my mother in the genes where the hell did you get this ship i wouldnt have believed a submarine like this could exist without the whole world knowing about it the subs my creation built in accordance with my design in a norwegian fjord this is what the liberated mind can do i am the twentiethcentury leonardo except that im not gay ive tried it of course but women interest me more the world has never heard of hagbard celine that is because the world is stupid and celine is very smart the submarine is radar and sonar transparent it is superior to the best either the american or russian government even has on the drawing board it can go to any depth in any ocean weve sounded the atlantic trench the mindinao deep and a few holes in the floor of the sea that no ones ever heard of or named lief erickson is capable of meeting the biggest most ferocious and smartest monsters of the deep of which weve found gods plenty id even risk her in battle with leviathan himself though im just as pleased that weve only seen him from afar hitherto you mean whales i mean leviathan man that fishif fish it bethat is to your whale what your whale is

weve seen in lief erickson the sunken ruins of atlantis and lemuriaor mu as its known to keepers of the sacred chao what the fuck are you talking about i asked wondering if i was in some crazy surrealist movie wandering from telepathic sheriffs to homosexual assassins to nympho lady masons to psychotic pirates according to a script written in advance by two acidheads and a martian humorist im talking about adventure george im talking about seeing things and being with people that will really liberate your mindnot just replacing liberalism with marxism so you can shock your parents im talking about getting altogether off the grubby plane you live on and taking a trip with hagbard to a transcendental universe did you know that on sunken atlantis there is a pyramidal structure built by ancient priests and faced with a ceramic substance that has withstood thirty thousand years of ocean burial so that the pyramid is clean and white as polished ivoryexcept for the giant red mosaic of an eye at its top i find it hard to believe that atlantis ever existed i said in facti shook my head angrilyyoure conning me into qualifying that the fact is i simply dont believe atlantis ever existed this is pure bullshit atlantis is where were going next friend do you trust the evidence of your senses i hope so because youll see atlantis and the pyramid just as i said those bastards the illuminati are trying to get gold to further their conspiracies by looting an atlantean temple and hagbard is going to foil them by robbing it first because i fight the illuminati every chance i get and because im an amateur archeologist will you join us youre free to leave right now if you wish ill put you ashore and even supply you with money to get back to new york i shook my head im a writer i write magazine articles for a living and even if ninety percent of what you say is bullshit moonshine and the most elaborate puton since richard nixon this is the best story ive ever come across a nut with a gigantic golden submarine whose followers include beautiful guerrilla women who blow up southern jails and take out the prisoners no im not leaving youre too big a fish to let get away hagbard celine slapped me on the shoulder good man youve got courage and initiative you trust only the evidence of your eyes and believe what no man tells you i was right about you come on down to my stateroom he pressed a button and we entered the golden elevator and sank rapidly till we came to an eightfoothigh archway barred by a silver gate celine pressed a button and the elevator door and the gate outside both slid back we stepped out into a carpeted room with a lovely black woman sitting at one end under an elaborate emblem concocted of anchors seashells viking figureheads lions ropes octopi lightning bolts and occupying the central position a golden apple kallisti said celine saluting the girl all hail discordia she answered aum shiva i contributed trying to enter the spirit of the game celine led me down a long corridor saying youll find this submarine is opulently furnished i have no need to live in monklike surroundings like those masochists who become naval officers no spartan simplicity for me this is more like an ocean liner or a grand european hotel of the edwardian era wait till you see my suite youll like your stateroom too to please myself i built this thing on the grand scale no finicky naval architects or parsimonious accountants in my business i believe youve got to spend money to make money and spend the money you make to enjoy money besides i have to live in the damned thing and what precisely is your business mr celine i asked or should i call you captain celine you should certainly not no bullshit authority titles for me im freeman hagbard celine but the conventional mister is good enough id prefer you called me by my first name hell call me anything you want to if i dont like it ill punch you in the nose if there were more bloody noses thered be fewer wars im in smuggling mostly with a spot of piracy just to keep ourselves on our toes but that only against the illuminati and their communist dupes we aim to prove that no state has the right to regulate commerce in any way nor can it when it is up against free men my crew are all volunteers we have among us liberated sailors who were indentured to the navies of america russia and china excellent fellows the governments of the world will never catch us because free men are always cleverer than slaves and any man who works for a government is a slave then youre a gang of objectivists basically ive got to warn you i come from a long line of labor agitators and reds youll never convert me to a rightwing position celine reared back as if i had waved offal under his nose objectivists he pronounced the word as if i had accused him of being a childmolester were anarchists and outlaws goddam it didnt you understand that much weve got nothing to do with rightwing leftwing or any other halfassed political category if you work within the system you come to one of the eitheror choices that were implicit in the system from the beginning youre talking like a medieval serf asking the first agnostic whether he worships god or the devil were outside the systems categories youll never get the hang of our game if you keep thinking in flatearth imagery of right and left good and evil up and down if you need a group label for us were political noneuclideans but even thats not true sink me nobody of this tub agrees with anybody else about anything except maybe what the fellow with the horns told the old man in the clouds non serviam i dont know latin i said overwhelmed by his outburst i will not serve he translated and heres your room he threw open an oaken door and i entered a living room furnished in handsome teak and rosewood scandinavian upholstered in bright solid colors he hadnt been exaggerating about the scale you could have parked a greyhound bus in the middle of the carpet and the room would still seem uncluttered above an orange couch hung a huge oil painting in an elaborate gilt frame easily a foot deep on all sides the painting was essentially a cartoon it showed a man in robes with long flowing white hair and beard standing on a mountaintop staring in astonishment at a wall of black rock above his head a fiery hand traced flaming letters with its index finger on the rock the words it wrote were think for yourself schmuck as i started to laugh i felt through the soles of my feet an enormous engine beginning to throb and in mad dog jim cartwright said into a phone with a scrambler device to evade taps we let celines crowd take dorn according to plan and harry coin is ah no longer with us good said atlanta hope the four are heading for ingolstadt everything is go she hung up and dialed again at once reaching western union i want a flat rate telegram same words twentythree different addresses she said crisply the message is insert the advertisement in tomorrows newspapers signature atlanta hope she then read off the twentythree addresses each located in a large city in the united states each a regional headquarters of gods lightning the following day april the newspapers in those cities ran an obscure ad in the personals columns it said in thanks to saint jude for favors granted aw the plot accordingly thickened and then i sat back and thought about harry coin once i imagined i could make it with him there was something so repulsive so cruel so wild and psychopathic there but of course it hadnt worked the same as every other man nothing hit me i screamed bite me hurt me do something he did everything the most agreeable sadist in the world but it was the same as if be had been the gentlest most poetic english instructor at antioch nothing nothing nothing nothing the closest miss was that strange banker drake from boston what a scene id gotten into his office on wall street seeking a contribution for gods lightning old whitehaired buzzard between sixty and seventy typical of our wealthier members i thought i started the usual spiel communism sexism smut and all the time his eyes were bright and hard as a snakes it finally hit me that he didnt believe a word of it so i started to cut it off and then he pulled out his checkbook and wrote and held it up so i could see it twenty thousand dollars i didnt know what to say and i started something about how all true americans would appreciate this great gesture and so on and he said rubbish youre not rich but youre famous i want to add you to my collection deal the coldest bastard i ever met even harry coin was human by comparison yet his eyes were such a clear blue i couldnt believe they could be so frightening a real madman in a perfectly sane way not even a psychopath but something they dont have a name for and it clicked the humiliation of whoredom and the predatory viciousness in his face plus the twenty grand i nodded he took me into a private suite off of his business office and he touched one button the lights dimmed another button down came a movie screen a third button and i was watching a pornographic movie he didnt approach me just watched and i tried to get excited wondering if the actress was really making it or just faking it and then a second film began four of them this time in permutations and combinations he led me to the couch every time i opened my eyes i could still see the film over his shoulder and it was the same the same as soon as he got his thing inside me nothing nothing nothing i kept looking at the actors trying to feel something and then as he came be whispered in my ear heute die welt morgans das sonnensystem that was the only time i almost made it sheer terror that this maniac knew later i tried to find out about him but nobody above me in the order would say a word and those below me didnt know anything but i finally found out he was very big in the syndicate maybe the top and thats how i figured out that the old rumor was true the syndicate was run by the order too just like everything else but that cold sinister old man never said another word about it i kept waiting while we dressed when he gave me the check when he escorted me to the door and even his expression seemed to deny that he had said it or knew what it meant when he opened the door for me he put an arm on my shoulder and spoke so his secretary could hear it may your work hasten the day when america returns to purity even his eyes werent mocking and his voice sounded completely sincere and yet he had read me to the core knew i was faking and guessed that terror alone could unlock my reflexes maybe he even knew that i had already tried physical sadism and it hadnt worked out on wall street in the crowd i saw a man with a gas mask they were still rare that year and i felt the whole world was moving faster than i could understand and that the order wasnt telling me nearly as much as i needed to know brother beghard who is actually a politician in chicago under his real name once explained the law of fives to me in relation to the pyramidofpower principle intellectually i understand its the only way we can work each group a separate vector so that the most any infiltrator can learn is a small part of the design emotionally though it does get frightening at times do the five at the top really have the whole picture i dont know and i dont see how they can predict a man like drake or guess what hes planning next theres a paradox here i know i joined the order seeking power and now i am more a tool an object than ever before if a man like drake ever thought that he might tear the whole show apart unless the five really do have the powers they claim but im not gullible enough to believe that bull some of its hypnotism and some is plain old stage magic but none of it is really supernatural nobody has sold me on a fairy tale since my uncle got into me when i was twelve with his routine about stopping the bleeding if my parents had only told me the truth about menstruation in advance enough of that there was work to be done i hit the buzzer on my desk and my secretary mr mortimer came in as id guessed it was past nine oclock and hed been out there in the reception area straightening up and worrying about my mood for god knows how long while i was daydreaming i studied my memo pad while he waited apprehensively finally i noticed him and said be seated he sank into the dictation chair putting his head right under the point of the lightning bolt on the wall an effect i always enjoyed and opened his pad call zev hirsch in new york i said watching his pencil fly to keep up with my words the foot fetishist liberation front is having a demonstration tell bun to cream them i wont be satisfied unless a dozen of the perverts are put in the hospital and i dont care how many of our people get arrested doing it the bail fund is available if they need it if zev has any objections ill talk to him but otherwise you handle it then make up the standard numbertwo press release where i deny any knowledge of illegal activitiesby that chapter and promise we will investigate and expel anybody guilty of mob action have that ready for release this afternoon then get me the latest sales figures on telemachus sneezed another busy day at the national headquarters of gods lightning was started and hagbard celine feeding maviss report on georges sexual and other behavior into fuckup came out with a coding of cba which caused him to laugh immoderately whats so damned funny mavis asked from out of the west come the thundering hooves of the great horse onan hagbard grinned the lonely stranger rides again what the hell does all that mean weve got sixtyfour thousand possible personality types hagbard explained and ive only seen that reading once before guess who it was not me mavis said quickly beginning to color no not you hagbard laughed again it was atlanta hope mavis was startled thats impossible shes frigid for one thing there are many kinds of frigidity hagbard said it fits believe me she joined womens liberation at the same age george joined weatherman and they both split after a few months and youd be surprised how similar their mothers were or how the successful careers of their older brothers annoy them but george is a nice guy underneath it all hagbard celine knocked an ash off his long italian cigar everybody is a nice guy underneath it all he said what we become when the world is through messing us over is something else at chateau thierry in robert putney drake looked around at the dead bodies knew he was the last man alive in the platoon and heard the germans start to advance he felt the cold wetness on his thighs before he realized he was urinating in his pants a shell exploded nearby and he sobbed o god please jesus dont let them kill me im afraid to die please jesus jesus jesus mary lou and simon are eating breakfast in bed still naked as adam and eve mary lou spread jam on toast and asked no seriously which part was hallucination and which part was real simon sipped at his coffee everything in life is a hallucination he said simply everything in death too he added the universe is just putting us on handing us a line the third trip or binah the purple sage cursed and waxed sorely pissed and cried out in a loud voice a pox upon the accursed illuminati of bavaria may their seed take no root may their hands tremble their eyes dim and their spines curl up yea verily like unto the backs of snails and may the vaginal orifices of their women be clogged with brillo pads for they have sinned against god and nature they have made of life a prison and they have stolen the green from the grass and the blue from the sky and so saying and grimacing and groaning the purple sage left the world of men and women and retired to the desert in despair and heavy grumpiness but the high chapperal laughed and said to the erisian faithful our brother torments himself with no cause for even the malign illuminati are unconscious pawns of the divine plane of our lady mordecai malignatus kns the book of contradictions liber october was the thirtyfifth anniversary of the murder of arthur flegenheimer alias the dutchman alias dutch schultz but this dreary lot has no intention of commemorating that occasion they are the knights of christianity united in faith the group in atlantis were called mauls of lhuvkerapht united for the truth see what i mean and their president james j smiling jim treponema has noted a bearded and therefore suspicious young man among the delegates such types were not likely to be kcuf members and might even be dope fiends smiling jim told the andy frain ushers to keep a watchful eye on the young man so no funny business could occur and then went to the podium to begin his talk on sex education communist trojan horse in our schools in atlantis it was numbers nothingarian squidtrap in our schools the same drivel eternally the bearded young man who happened to be simon moon adviser to teenset magazine on iiluminati affairs and instructor in sexual yoga to numerous black young ladies observed that he was being observed which made him think of heisenberg and settled back in his chair to doodle pentagons on his note pad three rows ahead a crewcut middleaged man who looked like a suburban connecticut doctor also settled back comfortably awaiting his opportunity the funny business that he and simon had in mind would be he hoped very funny indeed we shall not we shall not be moved there is a road going due east from dayton ohio toward new lebanon and brookville and on a small farm off that road lives an excellent man named james v riley who is a sergeant on the dayton police force although he grieves the death of his wife two years back in and worries about his son who seems to be in some shady business involving frequent travel between new york city and cuernavaca the sergeant is basically a cheerful man but on june he was a bit out of sorts and generally not up to snuff because of his arthritis and the seemingly endless series of pointless and peculiar questions being asked by the reporter from new york it didnt make sense who would want to publish a book about john dillinger at this late date and why would such a book deal with dillingers dental history youre the same james riley who was on the mooresville indiana force when dillinger was first arrested in the reporter had begun yes and a smartalecky young punk he was i dont hold with some of these people whove written books about him and said the long sentence he got back then is what made him bitter and turned him bad he got the long sentence because he was so snotty to the judge not a sign of repentence or remorse just wisecracks and a knowitall grin spread all over his face a bad apple from the start and always hellbentforleather in a hurry to get god knows where sometimes folks used to joke that there were two of him hed go through town so fast rushing to his own funeral young punks like that never get long enough sentences if you want my opinion might slow them down a bit the reporter what was his name again james mallison hadnt he saidwas impatient yes yes im sure we need stricter laws and harsher penalties but what i want to know was where was dillingers missing tooth on the right side or the left side of his face saints in heaven you expect me to remember that after all these years the reporter dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief very nervous he seemed to be look sergeant some psychologists say we never forget anything really its all stored somewhere inside our brain now just try to picture john dillinger as you remember him with that knowitall grin as you called it can you get the picture into focus which side is the missing tooth on listen im due to go on duty in a few minutes and i cant be mallisons faced changed as if in desperation which he was trying to conceal well let me ask you a different question are you a mason a mason bejesus noive been a catholic all my life ill have you know well did you know any masons in mooresville i mean to talk to why would i be talking to the likes of them with the terrible things theyre always saying about the church the reporter plunged on all the books on dillinger say that the intended victim of that first robbery the grocer b f morgan summoned help by giving the masonic signal of distress do you know what that is youd have to ask a mason and im sure they wouldnt be telling the way they keep their secrets by the saints im sure even the fbi couldnt find out the reporter finally left but sergeant riley a methodical man filed his name in memory james mallison or had he said joseph mallison a strange book he claimed to be writing about dillingers teeth and the bloody atheistic freemasons there was more to this than met the eye obviously like a tree thats planted by the water we shall not be moved miskatonic university in arkham massachusetts is not a wellknown campus by any means and the few scholarly visitors who come there are an odd lot drawn usually by the strange collection of occult books given to the miskatonic library by the late dr henry armitage miss doris horus the librarian had never seen quite such a strange visitor though as this professor j d mallison who claimed to come from dayton ohio but spoke with an unmistakable new york accent considering his furtiveness she found it no surprise that he spent the whole day june pouring over the rare copy of dr john dees translation of the necronomicon of abdul alhazred that was the book most of the queer ones went for that or the book of sacred magic of abramelin the mage doris didnt like the necronomicon although she considered herself an emancipated and freethinking young woman there was something sinister or to be downright honest about it perverted about that book and not in a nice exciting way but in a sick and frightening way all those strange illustrations always with fivesided borders just like the pentagon in washington but with those people inside doing all those freaky sex acts with those other creatures who werent people at all it was frankly doris s opinion that old abdul alhazred had been smoking some pretty bad grass when he dreamed up those things or maybe it was something stronger than grass she remembered one sentence from the text onlie those who have eaten a certain alkaloid herb whose name it were wise not to disclose to the unilluminated maye in the fleshe see a shoggothe i wonder what a shoggothe is doris thought idly probably one of those disgusting creatures that the people in the illustrations are doing those horny things with yech she was glad when j d mallison finally left and she could return the necronomicon to its position on the closed shelves she remembered the brief biography of crazy old abdul alhazred that dr armitage had written and also given to the library spent seven years in the desert and claimed to have visited irem the city forbidden in the koran which alhazred asserted was of prehuman origin silly who was around to build cities before there were people those shoggothes an indifferent moslem he worshipped beings whom he called yogsothoth and cthulhu and that insidious line according to contemporary historians alhazreds death was both tragic and bizarre since it was asserted that he was eaten alive by an invisible monster in the middle of the marketplace dr armitage had been such a nice old man doris remembered even if his talk about cabalistic numbers and masonic symbols was a little peculiar at times why would he collect such icky books by creepy people the internal revenue service knows this much about robert putney drake during the last fiscal year he earned on stocks and bonds in various defense corporations from the three banks he controlled and from various realestate holdings they did not know that he also banked in switzerland over from prostitution an equal amount from heroin and gambling and from pornography on the other hand they didnt know either about certain legitimate business expenses which he had not cared to claim including more than in bribes to various legislators judges and police officials in all states in order to maintain the laws which made mens vices so profitable to him and to knights of christianity united in faith as a lastditch effort to stave off total legalization of pornography and the collapse of that part of his empire what the deuce do you make of this barney muldoon asked he was holding an amulet in his hand found it in the bedroom he explained holding it for saul to examine the strange design part of it is chinese saul said thoughtfully the basic design two interlocking commas one pointing up and the other down it means that opposites are equal and what does that mean muldoon asked sarcastically opposites are opposite not equal youd have to be a chinaman to think otherwise saul ignored the comment but the pentagon isnt in the chinese design and neither is the apple with the k in it suddenly he grinned wait ill bet i know what that is its from greek mythology there was a banquet on olympus and eris wasnt invited because she was the goddess of discord and always made trouble so to get even she made more trouble she created a beautiful golden apple and wrote on it kallisti that means for the prettiest one in greek its what the k stands for obviously then she rolled it into the banquet hall and naturally all the goddesses there immediately claimed it each one saying that she was the prettiest one finally old man zeus himself to settle the squabble allowed paris to decide which goddess was the prettiest and should get the apple he chose aphrodite and as a reward she gave him an opportunity to kidnap helen which led to the trojan war very interesting muldoon said and does that tell us what joseph malik knew about the assassinations of the kennedys and this illuminati bunch and why his office was blown up or where hes disappeared to well no saul said but its nice to find something in this case that i can recognize i just wish i knew what the pentagon means too lets look at the rest of the memos muldoon suggested the next memo however stopped them cold illuminati project memo jm the following chart appeared in the east village other june with the label current structure of the bavarian illuminati conspiracy and the law of fives the chart hangs at the top of the page the rest of which is empty space as if the editors originally intended to publish an article explaining it but decided or were persuaded to suppress all but the diagram itself pat this one has to be some damned hippie or yippie hoax muldoon said after a long pause but he sounded uncertain part of it is saul said thoughtfully keeping certain thoughts to himself typical hippie psychology mixing truth and fantasy to blow the fuses of the establishment the elders of zion section is just a parody of nazi ideology if there really was a jewish conspiracy to run the world my rabbi would have let me in on it by now i contribute enough to the schule my brothers a jesuit muldoon added pointing at the society of jesus square and he never invited me into any worldwide conspiracy but this part is almost plausible saul said pointing to the sphere of aftermath aga khan is the head of the ishmaelian sect of islam and that sect was founded by hassan i sabbah the old man of the mountains who led the hashishism in the eleventh century adam weishaupt is supposed to have originated the bavarian illuminati after studying sabbah according to the third memo so this part fits together and hassan i sabbah is supposed to be the first one to introduce marijuana and hashish to the western world from india that ties in with weishaupts growing hemp and washingtons having a big hemp crop at mount vernon wait a minute look at how the whole design revolves around the pentagon everything else sort of grows out of it so you think the defense department is the international hub of the illuminati conspiracy lets just read the rest of the memos muldoon suggested the indian agent at the menominee reservation in wisconsin knows this from the time billie freschette returned there until her death in she received mysterious monthly checks from switzerland he thinks he knows the explanation despite all stories to the contrary billie did help to betray dillinger and this is the payoff he is convinced of this he is also quite wrong children seven and eight years old smiling jim trepomena is telling the kcuf audience are talking about penises and vaginasand using those very words now is this an accident let me quote you lenins own words simon yawns banananose maldonado evidently had his own brand of sentimentality or superstition and in he ordered his son a priest to say one hundred masses for the salvation of the dutchmans soul even years afterward he would defend the dutchman in conversation he was ok dutch was if you didnt cross him if you did forget it you were finished he was almost a siciliano about that otherwise he was a good businessman and the first one with a real cpa mind in the whole organization if he hadnt gotten that crazyhead idea about gunning down tom dewey hed still be a big man i told him myself you kill dewey i said and the shit hits the fan everywhere the boys wont take the risk lucky and the butcher want to cowboy you right now but he wouldnt listen nobody fucks with me he said i dont care if his name is dewey looey or phooey he dies a real stubborn german jew you couldnt talk to him i even told him how capone helped set up dillinger for the feds just because of the heat those bankheists were bringing down you know what he said he said you tell al that dillinger was a lone wolf i have my own pack too bad too bad too bad ill light another candle for him at church sunday hand in hand together we shall not be moved rebecca goodman closes her book wearily and stares into space thinking about babylon her eyes focus suddenly on the statue saul had bought her for her last birthday the mermaid of copenhagen how many danes she wonders know that this is one form of representation of the babylonian sex goddess ishtar in central park perri the squirrel is beginning to hunt for the days food a french poodle held on a leash by a minkcoated lady barks at him and he runs three times around a tree george dorn looks at the face of a corpse it is his own face in wyoming after one sexeducation class in a high school the teacher was raped by seventeen boys she said later she would never teach sex in school again making sure he is alone in the meditation room of the un building the man calling himself frank sullivan quickly moves the black plinth aside and descends the hidden stairs into the tunnel he is thinking whimsically that hardly anybody realizes that the shape of the room is the same as the truncated pyramid on the dollar bill or guesses what that means in wilmette illinois an yearold boy came home from a sensitivity training class and tried to have intercourse with his yearold sister simon gave up on his pentagons and began doodling pyramids instead above beyond joe maliks window saul goodman gave up on the line of thought which had led him to surmise that the illuminati were a front for the international psychoanalytical society conspiring to drive everyone paranoid and turned back to the desk and the memos barney muldoon came in from the bedroom carrying a strange amulet and asked what do you make of this saul looked at a design of an apple and a pentagon and several years earlier simon moon looked at the same medallion they call it the sacred chao padre pederastia said they sat alone at a table pulled off to the corner the friendly stranger was the same as ever except that a new group the american medical association consisting naturally of four kids from germany had replaced h p lovecraft in the back room nobody knew that the ama was going to become the worlds most popular rock group within a year but simon already thought they were superheavy padre pederastia was as on the night simon met miss mao very serious and hardly camping at all sacred cow simon asked its pronounced that way but you spell it chao a chao is a single unit of chaos they figure the padre smiled too much theyre nuttier than the sss simon objected never underestimate absurdity it is one door to the imagination do i have to remind you of that we have an alliance with them simon asked the jams cant do it alone yes we have an alliance as long as it profits both parties john mr sullivan himself authorized this ok what do they call themselves the ldd the padre permitted himself a smile new members are told the initials stand for legion of dynamic discord later on quite often the leader a most fetching scoundrel and madman named celine sometimes tells them it really stands for little deluded dupes thats the pans asinorum or an early pans asinorum in celines system he judges them by how they react to that celines system simon asked warily it leads to the same destination as ours more or less by a somewhat wilder and woollier path righthand or lefthand path righthand the priest said all absurdist systems are righthand well almost all they dont invoke youknowwho under any circumstances they rely on discordia do you remember your roman myths enough to know that discordia is just the latin equivalent of eris theyre part of the erisian liberation front then simon was beginning to wish he were stoned these conspiratorial conversations always made more sense when he was slightly high he wondered how people like the president of the us or the chairman of the board of gm were able to plot such intricate games without being on a trip at the time or did they take enough tranquilizers to produce a similar effect no the priest said flatly dont ever make that mistake elf is a much more um esoteric outfit than the ldd celine is on the activist side like us some of his capers make morituri or gods lightning look like trappists by comparison no elf will never get on mr celines trip hes got an absurdist yoga and an activist ethic simon reflected the two dont mix celine is a walking contradiction look at his symbol again ive been looking at it and that pentagon worries me are you sure hes on our side the american medical association came to some kind of erotic or musical climax and the priests answer was drowned out what simon asked after the applause died down i said padre pederastia whispered that were never sure anybody is on our side uncertainty is the name of the game illuminati project memo jm on the origin of the pyramidandeye symbol test your credulity on the following yarn from flying saucers in the bible by virginia brasington saucerian books page the continental congress had asked benjamin franklin thomas jefferson and john adams to arrange for a seal for the united states of america none of the designs they created or which were submitted to them were suitable fairly late at night after working on the project all day jefferson walked out into the cool night air of the garden to clear his mind in a few minutes he rushed back into the room crying jubilantly i have it i have it indeed he did have some plans in his hands they were the plans showing the great seal as we know it today asked how he got the plans jefferson told a strange story a man approached him wearing a black cloak that practically covered him face and all and told him that he the stranger knew they were trying to devise a seal and that he had a design which was appropriate and meaningful after the excitement died down the three went into the garden to find the stranger but he was gone thus neither these founding fathers nor anybody else ever knew who really designed the great seal of the united states pat illuminati project memo jm the latest ive found on the eyeandpyramid is in a san francisco underground paper planet san francisco july vol i no suggesting it as a symbol for timothy learys political party when he was running for governor of california instead of just running the emblem is a tentative design for the partys campaign button one wag suggests that everyone cut out the circle from the back of a dollar bill and send the wholly dollar to governor leary so he can wallpaper his office with them then paste the emblem on your front door to signify your membership in the party translations the year of the beginning new secular order both translations are wrong of course annuit coeptis means he blesses our beginning and novus ordo se clorem means a new order of the ages oh well scholarship was never the hippies strong point but tim leary an illuminatus and pasting the eye on the door i cant help but think of the hebrews marking their doorways with the blood of a lamb so that the angel of death would pass by their houses pat illuminati project memo jm ive finally found the basic book on the illuminati proofs of a conspiracy by john robison christian book club of america hawthorn california originally published in robison was an english mason who discovered through personal experience that the french masonic lodges such as the grand orient were illuminati fronts and were the main instigators of the french revolution his whole book is very explicit about how weishaupt worked every infiltrated masonic group would have several levels like an ordinary masonic lodge but as candidates advanced through the various degrees they would be told more about the real purposes of the movement those at the bottom simply thought they were masons in the middle levels they knew they were engaged in a great project to change the world but the exact nature of the change was explained to them according to what the leaders thought they were prepared to know only those at the top knew the secret which according to robison is this the illuminati aims to overthrow all government and religion setting up an anarchocommunist freelove world and because the end justifies the means a principle weishaupt acquired from his jesuit youth they didnt care how many people they killed to accomplish that noble purpose robison knows nothing of earlier illuminati movements but does say specifically that the bavarian illuminati was not destroyed by the governments crackdown in but was in fact still active both in england and france and possibly elsewhere when he wrote in on page robison lists their existing lodges as follows germany lodges england lodges scotland warsaw switzerland many rome naples ancona florence france holland dresden united states of america several on page he mentions that there are ranks in the order this may account for the steps on their symbolic pyramid page gives the code name of weishaupt which was spartacus his secondincommand freiherr knigge had the code name philo page this is revealed in papers seized by the bavarian government in a raid on the home of a lawyer named zwack who had the code name cato babeuf the french revolutionary evidently took the name gracchus in imitation of the classical style of these titles robisons conclusion page is worth quoting nothing is as dangerous as a mystic association the object remaining a secret in the hands of the managers the rest simply put a ring in their own noses by which they may be led about at pleasure and still panting after the secret they are the more pleased the less they see pat at the bottom of the page was a note in pencil scrawled with a decisive masculine hand it said in the beginning was the word and it was written by a baboon illuminati project memo jm the survival of the bavarian illuminati throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth is the subject of world revolution by nesta webster constable and company london mrs webster follows robison fairly closely on the early days of the movement up to the french revolution but then veers off and says that the illuminati never intended to create their utopian anarchocommunist society that was just another of their masks their real purpose was dictatorship over the world and so they soon formed a secret alliance with the prussian government all subsequent socialist anarchist and communist movements are mere decoys she argues behind which the german general staff and the illuminati are plotting to overthrow other governments so germany can conquer them she wrote right after england fought germany in the first world war i see no way of reconciling this with the birchers thesis that the illuminati has become a front for the rhodes scholars to take over the world for english domination obviously as robison states the illuminati say different things to different people to get them into the conspiracy as for the links with modern communism here are some passages from her pages but now that the first internationale was dead it became necessary for the secret societies to reorganize and it is at this crisis that we find that formidable sect springing to life againthe original llluminati of weishaupt what we do know definitely is that the society was refounded in dresden in that it was consciously modelled on its eighteenth century predecessor is clear from the fact that its chief one leopold engel was the author of a lengthy panegyric on weishaupt and his order entitled geschichte des illuminaten ordens published in in london a lodge called by the same name carried on the rite of memphis founded it is said by cagliostro on egyptian models and initiated adepts into illuminized freemasonry was it a mere coincidence that in july an international socialist congress decided that may which was the day on which weishaupt founded the illuminati should be chosen for an annual international labour demonstration pat illuminati project memo jm and heres still another version of the origin of the illuminati from the cabalist eliphas levi the history of magic by eliphas levi borden publishing company los angeles page he says there were two zoroasters a true one who taught white right hand magic and a false one who taught black left hand magic he goes on to the false zoroaster must be referred the cultus of material fire and that impious doctrine of divine dualism which produced at a later period the monstrous gnosis of manes and the false principles of spurious masonry the zoroaster in question was the father of that materialized magic which led to the massacre of the magi and brought their true doctrine at first into proscription and then oblivion ever inspired by the spirit of truth the church was forced to condemn under the names of magic manicheanism illuminism and masonry all that was in kinship remote or approximate with the primitive profanation of the mysteries one signal example is the history of the knights templar which has been misunderstood to this day levi does not elucidate that last sentence it is interesting however that nesta webster see memo also traced the illuminati to the knights templar whereas daraul and most other sources track them eastward to the hashishim is all this making me paranoid im beginning to get the impression that the evidence has not only been hidden in obscure books but also made confusing and contradictory to discourage the researcher pat scrawled on the bottom of this memo was a series of jottings in the same masculine hand maliks saul guessed that had jotted the baboon reference on memo the jottings said check on order of demolay elevenfold demolay cross eleven intersections therefore lines the atus of tahuti why not taro tora troa ator rota abdul alhazred aa oh christ barney groaned oh mary and joseph oh shit well end up either become mystics or going crazy before this case is over if theres any difference the order of demolay is a masonic society for boys saul commented helpfully i dont know what the atus of tahuti are but that sounds egyptian taro usually spelled tarot is the deck of cards gypsy fortune tellers use and the word gypsy means egyptian tora is the law in hebrew we keep coming back to something that has roots in both jewish mysticism and egyptian magic the knights templar were kicked out of the church barney said for trying to combine christian and moslem ideas last year my brother the jesuit gave a lecture about how modern ideas are just old heresies from the middle ages warmed over i had to go for politeness sake i remember something else he said about the templars they were engaged in what he called unnatural sex acts in other words they were faggots do you get the impression that all these groups related to the illuminati are all male maybe the big secret theyre hiding so fanatically is that theyre all some vast worldwide homosexual plot ive heard showbiz people complain about what they call the homintern a homo organization that tries to keep all the best jobs for other fruits how does that sound it sounds plausible saul said ironically but it also sounds plausible to say the illuminati is a jewish conspiracy a catholic conspiracy a masonic conspiracy a communist conspiracy a bankers conspiracy and i suppose well eventually find evidence to suggest its an interplanetary scheme masterminded from mars or venus dont you see barney whatever theyre really up to they keep creating masks so all sorts of scapegoat groups will get the blame for being the real illuminati he shook his head dismally theyre smart enough to know they cant operate indefinitely without a few people eventually realizing somethings there so theyve taken that into account and arranged for an inquisitive outsider to get all sorts of wrong ideas about who they are theyre dogs muldoon said intelligent talking dogs from the dog star sirius they came here and ate malik just like they ate that guy in kansas city except that time they didnt get to finish the job he turned back and read from memo with his throat torn as if by the talons of some enormous beast no animal was reported missing from any of the local zoos he grinned lord god im almost ready to believe it theyre werewolves saul answered grinning also the pentagon is the symbol of the werewolf look at the late late show some tune thats the pentagram not the pentagon barney lit a cigarette adding this is really getting on our nerves isnt it saul looked up wearily and glanced around the apartment almost as if he were looking for its absent owner joseph malik he said aloud what can of worms have you opened and how far back does it go we shall not we shall not be moved in fact for joseph malik the beginning was several years earlier in a medley of teargas hymn singing billy clubs and obscenity all of which were provoked by the imminent nomination for president of a man named hubert horatio humphrey it began in lincoln park on the night of august while joe was waiting to be teargassed he did not know then that anything was beginning he was only conscious in an acid gutsour way of what was ending his own faith in the democratic party he was sitting with the concerned clergymen under the cross they had erected he was thinking bitterly that they should have erected a tombstone instead it should have said here lies the new deal here lies the belief that all evil is on the other side among the reactionaries and ku kluxers here lies twenty years of the hopes and dreams and sweat and blood of joseph wendall malik here lies american liberalism clubbed to death by chicagos heroic peace officers theyre coming a voice near him said suddenly the concerned clergymen immediately began singing we shall not be moved well be moved all right a dry sardonic wc fields voice said quietly when the teargas hits well be moved joe recognized the speaker it was novelist william burroughs with his usual poker face utterly without anger or contempt or indignation or hope or faith or any emotion joe could understand but he sat there making his own protest against hubert horatio humphrey by placing his body in front of chicagos police for reasons joe could not understand how joe wondered can a man have courage without faith without belief burroughs believed in nothing and yet there he sat stubborn as luther joe had always had faith in somethingroman catholicism long ago then trotskyism at college then for nearly two decades mainstream liberalism arthur schlesinger jrs vital center and now with that dead he was trying desperately to summon up faith in the motley crowd of dopeandastrologyobsessed yippies black maoists oldline hardcore pacifists and arrogantly dogmatic sds kids who had come to chicago to protest a rigged convention and were being beaten and brutalized unspeakably for it alien ginsberg sitting amid a huddle of yippies off to the right began chanting again as he had all evening hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare ginsberg believed he believed in everything in democracy in socialism in communism in anarchism in ezra pounds idealistic variety of fascist economics in buckminster fullers technological utopia in d h lawrences return to preindustrial pastoralism and in hinduism buddhism judaism christianity voodoo astrology magic but above all in the natural goodness of man the natural goodness of man joe hadnt fully believed in that since buchenwald was revealed to the world in when he was seventeen kill kill kill came the chant of the policeexactly like the night before the same neolithic scream of rage that signaled the beginning of the first massacre they were coming clubs in hand spraying the teargas before them kill kill kill auschwitz usa joe thought sickened if they had been issued zyklon b along with the teargas and mace they would be using it just as happily slowly the concerned clergymen came to their feet holding dampened handkerchiefs to their faces unarmed and helpless they prepared to hold their ground as long as possible before the inevitable retreat a moral victory joe thought bitterly all we ever achieve are moral victories the immoral brutes win the real victories all hail discordia said a voice among the clergymen a bearded young man named simon who had been arguing in favor of anarchism against some sds maoists earlier in the day and that was the last sentence joe malik remembered clearly for it was gas and clubs and screams and blood from then on he had no way of guessing at the time that hearing that sentence was the most important thing that happened to him in lincoln park harry coin curls his long body into a knot of tension resting on his elbows and sighting the remington rifle carefully as the motorcade passes the book depository and heads toward his perch on the triple underpass he could see bernard barker from the cia down on the grassy knoll if he carried this off right they promised him more jobs it would be the end of petty crime for him the beginning of bigtime money in a way he was sorry kennedy seemed like a nice enough young fellowharry would like to make it with both him and that hotlooking wife of his at the same tune but money talks and sentiment is only for fools he released the bolt action ignoring the sudden barking of a dog and took aim just as the three shots resounded from the grassy knoll jesus motherfuckin christ he said and then he caught the glint of the rifle in the book depository window great god almighty how the fuck many of us are there here he cried out scampering to his feet and starting to run it was almost a year after being clubbedjune that joe returned to chicago to witness another rigged convention to suffer further disillusionment to meet simon once more and to hear the mysterious phrase all hail discordia again the convention this time was the last ever held by the students for a democratic society and from the first hour after it opened joe realized that the progressive labor faction had stacked all the cards in advance it was the democratic party all over again and it would have been equally bloody if the pl boys had their own police force to deal with the dissenters known then as rymi and rymii lacking that factor the smoldering violence remained purely verbal but when it was all over another part of joe malik was dead and his faith in the natural goodness of man was eroded still further and so he found himself aimlessly searching for something that was not totally corrupt attending the anarchist caucus at the old wobbly hall on north halsted street joe knew nothing about anarchism except that several famous anarchistsparsons and spies of chicagos haymarket riot in sacco and vanzetti in massachusetts and the wobblys own poetlaureate joe hill had been executed for murders which they apparently hadnt really committed beyond that anarchists wanted to abolish government a proposition so evidently absurd that joe had never bothered to read any of their theoretical or polemical works now however eating the maggoty meat of his growing disillusionment with every conventional approach to politics he began to listen to the wobblies and other anarchists with acute curiosity after all the words of his favorite fictional hero when you have eliminated all other possibilities whatever remains however improbable must be true the anarchists joe found were not going to quit sdswell stay in and do some righteous asskicking one of them said to the applause and cheers of the others beyond that however they seemed to be in a welter of ideological disagreement gradually he began to identify the conflicting positions expressed the individualistanarchists who sounded like rightwing republicans except that they wanted to get rid of all functions of government the anarchosyndicalists and wobblies who sounded like marxists except that they wanted to get rid of all functions of government the anarchopacifists who sounded like gandhi and martin luther king except that they wanted to get rid of all functions of government and a group who were dubbed rather affectionately the crazieswhose position was utterly unintelligible simon was among the crazies in a speech that joe followed only with difficulty simon declared that cultural revolution was more important than political revolution that bugs bunny should be adopted as the symbol of anarchists everywhere that hoffmans discovery of lsd in was a manifestation of direct intervention by god in human affairs that the nomination of the boar hog pigasus for president of the united states by the yippies had been the most transcendentally lucid political act of the twentieth century and that mass orgies of potsmoking and fucking on every streetcorner was the most practical next step in liberating the world from tyranny he also urged deep study of the tarot to fight the real enemy with their own weapons whatever that meant he was launching into a peroration about the mystic significance of the number pointing out that plus equals the pentad within which the devil can be invoked as for example in a pentacle or at the pentagon building in washington while divided by equals the number of the beast according to that freakedout revelation of saint john the mushroomhead that itself was present esoterically because of its conspicuous exoteric absence in the number series represented by the wobbly hall address which was north halsted and that the dates of the assassinations of john f kennedy and lee harvey oswald november and also had a conspicuous absent in between them when he finally was shouted down the conversation returned to a more mundane level half in whimsy and half in despair joe decided to perform one of his chronic acts of faith and convince himself at least for a while that there was some kind of meaning in simons ramblings his equally chronic skepticism he knew would soon enough reassert itself what the world calls sanity has led us to the present planetary crises simon had said and insanity is the only viable alternative that was a paradox worth some kind of consideration about that joe said approaching simon tentatively after the meeting broke up its everywhere was the instant reply i just started to scratch the surface all the great anarchists died on the rd day of some month or othersacco and vanzetti on august bonnie parker and clyde barrow on may dutch on october and vince coll was years old when he was shot on rd streetand even though john dillinger died on the nd of july if you look it up like i did in tolands book the dillinger days youll find he couldnt get away from the principle because other people died that night in chicago too all from heat prostration nova heat moving in dig and the world began on october in bc according to bishop usher and the hungarian revolution started on october too and harpo marx was born on november and there was more of it much more and joe patiently listened to all of it determined to continue his experiment in applied schizophrenia at least for this one evening they retired to a nearby restaurant the seminary on fullerton street and simon rambled on over beers proceeding to the mystic significance of the letter wrd in the alphabet and its presence in the words woman and womb as well as in the shape of the feminine breasts and spreadeagle legs of the copulating female he even found some mystic meaning in the w in washington but was strangely evasive about explicating this so you see simon was explaining when the restaurant was starting to close the whole key to liberation is magic anarchism remains tied to politics and remains a form of death like all other politics until it breaks free from the defined reality of capitalist society and creates its own reality a pig for president acid in the water supply fucking in the streets making the totally impossible become the eternally possible reality is thermoplastic not thermosetting you know i mean you can reprogram it much more than people realize the hex hoax original sin logical positivism those restriction and constriction myths all thats based on a thermosetting reality christ man there are limits of course nobody is nutty enough to deny thatbut the limits are nowhere near as rigid as weve been taught to believe its much closer to the truth to say there are no practical limits at all and reality is whatever people decide to make it but weve been on one restriction kick after another for a couple thousand years now the worlds longest headtrip and it takes real negative entropy to shake up the foundations this isnt shit ive got a degree in mathematics man i studied engineering myself a long time ago joe said i realize that part of what you say is true its all true the land belongs to the landlords right now because of magic people worship the deeds in the government offices and they wont dare move onto a square of ground if one of the deeds says somebody else owns it its a headtrip a kind of magic and you need the opposite magic to lift the curse you need shock elements to break up and disorganize the chains of command in the brain the mindforgd manacles that blake wrote about thats the unpredictable elements dads the erratic the erotic the eristic tim leary said it people have to go out of their minds before they can come to their senses they cant feel and touch and smell the real earth man as long as the manacles in the cortex tell them it belongs to somebody else if you dont want to call it magic call it counterconditioning but the principle is the same breaking up the trip society laid on us and starting our own trip bringing back old realities that are supposed to be dead creating new realities astrology demons lifting poetry off of the written page into the acts of your daily life surrealism dig antonin artaud and andre breton put it in a nutshell in the first surrealist manifesto total transformation of mind and all that resembles it they knew all about the illuminated lodge founded in munich in and that it controlled wall street and hitler and stalin through witchcraft we gotta get into witchcraft ourselves to undo the hex theyve cast on everybodys mind all hail discordia do you read me when they finally parted and joe headed back for his hotel the spell ended ive been listening to a spacedout acidhead all night joe thought in his cab headed south toward the loop and almost managing to believe him if i keep on with this little experiment i will believe him and thats how insanity always begins you find reality unbearable and start manufacturing a fantasy alternative with an effort of will he forced himself back into his usual framework no matter how cruel reality was joe malik would face it and would not follow the yippies and crazies in the joy ride to cloud cuckoo land but when he arrived at his hotel door and noticed for the first time that he had room he had to fight the impulse to call simon on the phone and tell him about the latest invasion of surrealism into the real world and he lay awake in his bed for hours remembering s that had occurred in his own life and wondering about the origin of that mysterious bit of slang skidoo after being lost for an hour in hitlers old neighborhood clark kent and his supermen finally found ludwigstrasse and got out of munich about forty miles and well be in ingolstadt kentmohammedpearson said at last one of the supermen groaned just then a tiny volkswagen inched past their vw bus like an infant running ahead of its mother and kent looked bemused did you check out that cat at the wheel i saw him once before and never forgot it because he was acting so weird it was in mexico city funny seeing him again halfway around the world and umpteen years later go catch him another superman commented with the ama and the trashers and other heavy groups were going to get buried alive lets make sure that at least he knows we were in ingolstadt for this gig just like a tree thats standing by the waaaaaaater the morning after the wobbly meeting simon telephoned joe listen he asked do you have to fly back to new york today can you possibly stay over a night ive got something id like you to see its time we started reaching people in your generation and really showing you instead of just telling you are you game and joe malikextrotskyist exengineering student exliberal excatholicheard himself saying yes and heard a louder voice unspeaking uttering a more profound yes deep inside himself he was game for astrology for iching for lsd for demons for whatever simon had to offer as an alternative to the world of sane and rational men who were sanely and rationally plotting their course toward what could only be the annihilation of the planet we shall not be moved god is dead the priest chanted god is dead the congregation repeated in chorus god is dead we are all absolutely free the priest intoned more rhythmically god is dead the congregation picked up the almost hypnotic beat we are all absolutely free joe shifted nervously in his chair the blasphemy was exhilarating but also strangely disturbing he wondered how much fear of hell still lingered in the back corridors of his skull left over from his catholic boyhood they were in an elegant apartment high above lake shore drivewe always meet here simon had explained because of the acrostic significance of the street nameand the sounds of the automobile traffic far below mingled strangely with the preparations for what joe already guessed was a black mass do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law the priest chanted do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law joe repeated with the rest of the congregation the priest who was the only one who had not removed his clothes before the beginning of the ceremony was a slightly redfaced middleaged man in a roman collar and part of joes discomfort derived from the fact that he looked so much like every catholic priest he had known in his childhood it had not helped matters that he had given his name when simon introduced joe to him as padre pederastiawhich he pronounced with a very campy inflection looking flirtatiously directly in joes eyes the congregation divided in joes mind into two easily distinguishable groups poor fulltime hippies from the old town area and rich parttime hippies from lake shore drive itself and no doubt also from the local advertising agencies on michigan avenue there were only eleven of them however including joe and padre pederastia made twelve where was the traditional thirteenth prepare the pentad padre pederastia commanded simon and a rather goodlooking young female both quite unselfconscious in their nakedness arose and left the group walking toward the door which joe had assumed led to the bedroom area they stopped to take some chalk from a table on which hashish and sandalwood incense were burning in a goatshead taper then squatted to draw a large pentagon on the bloodred rug a triangle was then added to each side of the pentagon forming a star the special kind of star joe knew which was known as pentagram symbol of werewolves and also of demons he found himself remembering the corny old poem from the lon chancy jr movies but it suddenly didnt sound like kitsch anymore even a man who is pure of heart and says his prayers by night can turn to a wolf when the wolf bane blooms and the autumn moon is bright io the priest chanted raptly io the chorus came io eo evoe the chant rose weirdly io eo evoe the rhythmic reply came in cadence joe felt a strange ashy acrid taste gathering in his mouth and a coldness creeping into his toes and fingers the air too seemed suddenly greasy and unpleasantly mucidly moist io eo evoe he the priest screamed in fear or in ecstasy io eo evoe her joe heard himself joining the others was it imagination or were all their voices subtly changing in a bestial and pongoid fashion ol sonuf vaoresaji the priest said more softly ol sonuf vaoresaji they chorused it is accomplished the priest said we may pass the guardian the congregation arose and moved toward the door each person joe noticed was careful to step into the pentagram and pause there a moment gathering strength before actually approaching the door when it was his turn he discovered why the carving on the door which had seemed merely obscene and ghoulish from across the room was more disturbing when you were closer to it it was not easy to convince yourself that those eyes were just a trick of trompe ioeil the mind insisted on feeling that they very definitely looked at you not affectionately as you passed thisthingwas the guardian which had to be pacified before they could enter the next room joes fingers and toes were definitely freezing and autosuggestion didnt seem a very plausible explanation he seriously wondered about the possibility of frostbite but then he stepped into the pentagram and the cold suddenly decreased the eyes of the guardian were less menacing and a feeling of renewed energy flowed through his body such as he had experienced in a sensitivitytraining session after he had been cajoled by the leader into unleashing a great deal of pentup anxiety and rage by kicking screaming weeping and cursing he passed the guardian easily and entered the room where the real action would occur it was as if he had left the twentieth century the furnishings and the very architecture were hebraic arabic and medieval european all mixed together in a most disorienting way and entirely unrelieved by any trace of the modern or functional a blackdraped altar stood in the center and upon it lay the thirteenth member of the coven she was a woman with red hair and green eyes the traits which satan supposedly relished most in mortal females there had been a time joe remembered when any woman having those features was automatically suspected of witchcraft she was of course naked and her body would be the medium through which this strange sacrament would be attempted what am i doing here joe thought frantically why dont leave these lunatics and get back to the world i know the world where all the horrors are after all merely human but he knew the answer he could not literally could not attempt to pass the guardian until all those present gave their consent padre pederastia was speaking this part of the ceremony he said camping outrageously is very distasteful to me as you all know if only our father below would allow us to substitute a boy on the altar when im officiating but alas he is as we all know very rigid about such things as usual therefore i will ask the newest member to take my place for this rite joe knew from the malleus malificarum and other grimoires what the rite was and he was both excited and frightened he approached the altar nervously noting the others forming a pentagon around the nude woman and himself she had a lovely body with large breasts and fine nipples but he was still too nervous to become aroused physically padre pederastia handed him the host i stole this from the church myself he whispered you can be sure it is fully consecrated and completely potent you know what to do joe nodded unable to meet the priests lascivious eyes he took the host and spat upon it quickly the greasiness and electrically charged quality of the air seemed to increase sharply the light seemed harsher like the glint of a sword just as schizophrenics often described light as a hostile or destructive force he stepped forward and placed the host upon the thighs of the bride of satan immediately she moaned softly as if the simple touch were more erotic than one momentary contact could possibly be her legs spread voluptuously and the middle of the host crumpled as it sunk slightly into her red pubic hair the effect was at once powerful her whole body shuddered and the host was drawn farther into her obviously moist cunt using his ringer joe pushed it the rest of the way in and she began breathing in a hoarse staccato rhythm joe malik knelt to complete the rite he felt like a fool and a pervert he had never performed oral sex or any kind of sex in front of an audience before he wasnt even turned on erotically he went ahead just to find out if there was any real magic in this revolting lunacy as soon as his tongue entered her she began heaving and he knew her first orgasm would arrive rapidly his penis finally began swelling he began licking the host caressingly inside his temple a drum seemed to be beating hollowly he hardly noticed it when she came his senses spun and he licked more aware only that she flowed more heavily and thickly than any woman he had known he put his thumb in her anus and his middle finger in her vagina keeping his tongue in the clitoral area doing it up right this was the technique occultists call the rite of shiva irreverently he remembered that swingers call it the oneman band he felt an unusual electrical quality in her pubic hair and was aware of a heaviness and tension in his penis more powerful than he had ever known in his life but all else was drowned out by the drumming in his head the cunttaste cuntsmell cuntwarmth she was ishtar aphrodite venus the experience was so intense he began to feel a real religious dimension to it hadnt some nineteenth century anthropologist argued that cuntworship was the earliest religion he didnt even know this woman and yet he had an emotion beyond love true reverence trippy as simon would say how many times she came he never knew he came himself without once touching his penis when the host was finally dissolved he staggered back dizzily and the air now seemed as resistant to motion as brackish water yogge sothothe neblod zin the priest began chanting by ashtoreth by pan pangenitor by the yellow sign by the gifts i have made and the powers i have purchased by he who is not to be named by rabban and by azathoth by sammael by amon and ra vente vente lucifer lux fiat joe never saw it he felt it and it was like chemical mace blinding and numbing him at once come not in that form the priest screamed by jesu elohim and the powers that you fear i command thee come not in that form yod he vah hecome not in that form one of the women began weeping in fear quiet you fool simon shouted at her dont give it more power your tongue is bound until i release it the priest said to her but the distraction of his attention had its cost joe felt it growing in potency again and so did the others judging from their sudden involuntary gasps come not in that form the priest shouted by the cross of gold and by the rose of ruby and by marys son i command and demand it of thee come not in that form by thy master chronzon by pangenitor and panphage come not in that form there was a hiss like air pouring into a vacuum and the atmosphere began to clear but it also dropped abruptly in temperature master call no more upon those names i meant not to alarm thee the voice was the most shocking experience of the night for joe it was oily flattering obscenely humble but there was still within it a secret strength that revealed all too well that the priests power over it however obtained was temporary that both of them knew it and that the price of that power was something it longed to collect come not in that form either said the priest more stern and more confident ye know full well that such tones and manners are also intended to frighten and i like not such jokes come in this form which thou habitually wearest in thy current earthly activities or i shall banish thee back to that realm of which you like not to imagine i command i command i command there was nothing campy about the padre now it was just a room again an odd medieval mideastern room but just a room the figure that stood among them could not have looked less like a demon ok it said in a pleasant american voice we dont

before this professor mallory arrived and he was feeling benevolent and forgiving after all the road chief once said at a very sacred midsummer peyote festival that the line about forgiving those who trespass against us had a special meaning for indians only when we all forgave the whites he had said would our hearts be totally pure and when our hearts were pure the curse would be lifted the white men would cease to trespass go home to europe and vex one another instead of persecuting us james tried to forgive the professor for being white and found as usual that peyote made forgiveness easier billie freschette he said hell she died back in sixtyeight i know that the professor said what im looking for is any photographs she may have left sure james knew what kind of photographs you mean ones that had dillinger in them yes she was his mistress virtually his commonlaw wife for a long time and no soap youre years too late reporters bought up everything she had that showed even the back of dillingers head way back long before she came here to the reservation to die well did you know her sure james was careful not be spiteful and didnt add all menominee indians know one another in a way you whites cant understand knowing did she ever converse about dillinger of course old women always talk about their dead men always say the same thing too never was another man as good as him except when they say there never was another man as bad as him they only say that when theyre drunk though the paleface kept turning colors the way people do when youre on peyote now he looked almost like an indian that made it easier to talk to him did she ever say anything about johns attitude toward the masons why shouldnt people turn colors all the trouble in world came from the fact that they usually stayed the same color james nodded profoundly as usual peyote had brought him a big truth if whites and blacks and indians were turning colors all the time there wouldnt be any hate in the world because nobody would know which people to hate i said did she ever mention johns attitude toward the masons oh oh yes funny you should ask that the man had a halo around his head now and james wondered what that meant every time he took peyote alone things like that would happen and hed end up wishing there were a road chief or some other priest around to explain these signs properly but what about the masons oh yes billie said the masons were the only people john dillinger really hated he said they railroaded him to prison the first time and they owned all the banks so he was getting even by robbing them the professors mouth dropped open in surprise and delight and james thought it was kind of funny to see that especially with the halo turning from pink to blue to pink to blue to pink again at the same time a big mouth a tiny brainhe only thinks of blood and pain howard sang notes found by a twa stewardess in a seat vacated by a mr john mason after a madison wisconsin to mexico city flight june one week after the last sds convention of all time we only robbed from the banks what the banks robbed from the peopledillinger crown point jail could have come from any anarchist text lucifer bringer of light weishaupts illumination amp voltaires enlightenment from the latin lux meaning light christianity all in s trinity etc buddhism in s illuminism in s a progression hopi teaching all men have souls now but in future will have souls find an anthropologist for more data on this who decided the pentagon building should have that particular shape kick out the jams crosscheck adam the first man weis to know haupt chief or leader the first man to be a leader of those who know assumed name from the beginning loksotot in pnakotic manuscripts cd be yogsothoth deathdont ever antagonize the horn does pynchon know must get simon to explain the yellow sign and the aklo chants might need protection c says the h neophobe type outnumbers us tol if so all this is hopeless what gets me is how much has been out in the open for so long not just in lovecraft joyce melville etc or in the bugs bunny cartoons but in scholarly works that pretend to explain anybody who wants to go to the trouble can find out for instance that the secret of the eleusinian mysteries was the words whispered to the novice after he got the magic mushroom osiris is a black god five words of course but no historian archeologist anthropologist folklorist etc has understood or those who did understand didnt care to admit it can i trust c for that matter can i trust simon this matter of tlaloc should convince me one way or the other he only thinks of blood and slaughterthe shark should live on land not water to hell with the shark and all his kinand fight like hell when you see his fin when joe malik got off the plane at los angeles international airport simon was waiting for him well talk in your car joe said briefly the car being simons was naturally a psychedelic volkswagen well he asked as they drove out of the airport onto central avenue it all checks out joe said with an odd calm it did rain blue cats when they dug up tlaloc mexico city has had unusual and unseasonable rains ever since the missing tooth was on the right and the corpse at the biograph theatre had a missing tooth on the left billy graham couldnt have gotten to chicago by any normal means so that was either the best damned makeup job in the history of show business and plastic surgery or i witnessed a genuine miracle and all the rest of it the law of fives and all im sold i no longer claim membership in the liberal intellectual guild you behold in me a horrible example of creeping mysticism ready to try acid yes joe said im ready to try acid i only regret that i have but one mind to lose for my shivadarshana right on first though youll meet him ill drive right to his bungalow its not far from here simon began humming as he drove joe recognized the tune as the fugs rameses ii is dead my love they drove for a while in silence and joe finally asked how old is our little group exactly since simon said thats when rhodes horned in and they kicked out the jams like i told you in chicago after the sabbath and karl marx a schmuck a dupe a nebbish from the word go simon made an abrupt turn here we are at his house the greatest headache they had since harry houdini knocked out their spiritualist fronts he grinned how do you think youll feel talking to a dead man weird joe said but ive felt weird for the last week and a half simon parked the car and held the door open just think he said hoover sitting there every day with the deathmask on his desk and halfsuspecting deep down in his bones how we suckered him they crossed the yard of the small modest bungalow what a front eh simon chuckled he knocked a little old man he was five foot seven exactly joe remembered from the fbi files opened the door heres our new recruit simon said simply come in john dillinger said and tell me how an asshole egghead like you can help us beat the shit out of those motherfucking illuminati cocksuckers they fill their books with obscene words claiming that this is realism smiling jim shouted to the kcuf assembly its not my idea of realism i dont know anybody who talks in that gutter language they call realism and they describe every possible perversion acts against nature that are so outrageous i wouldnt sully this audiences ears by even mentioning their medical names some of them even glorify the criminal and the anarchist id like to see one of these hacks come up to me and look me in the eye and say i didnt do it for money i was honestly trying to tell a good honest story that would teach people something of value they couldnt say that the lie would stick in their throats who can doubt where they get their orders from what person in this audience needs to be told what group is behind this overflowing sewer of smut and filth may storms and rains and typhoons beat them howard sang on may great cthulhu rise and eat them i got into the jams in michigan city prison dillinger much relaxed and less arrogant was saying as he simon and joe sat in his living room drinking black russians and hoover knew from the beginning joe asked of course i wanted the bastard to know him and every other highranking mason and rosicrucian and illuminati frontman in the country the old man laughed harshly except for his unmistakable eyes which still held the strange blend of irony and intensity that joe had noted in the s photos he was indistinguishable from any other elderly fellow who had come to california to enjoy his last years in the sun the first bank job i pulled off in daleville indiana i used the line that i always repeated lie down on the floor and keep calm hoover couldnt miss it thats been the motto of the jams ever since diogenes the cynic he knew no ordinary bank robber would be quoting an obscure greek philosopher the reason i repeated it on every heist was just to rub it in and let him know i was taunting him but going back to michigan city prison joe prompted sipping his drink pierpont was the one who initiated me hed been with the jams for years by then i was just a kid you know in my early twenties rand i had only pulled one job a real botch i couldnt understand why i got such a stiff sentence after the da promised me clemency if id plead guilty and i was kind of bitter but old harry pierpont saw my potential at first i thought he was just another bighouse faggot when he started tracking me around and asking me all sorts of personal questions but he was what i wanted to become a successful bankrobber so i played along to tell you the truth i was so horny it wouldnt have mattered if he was a faggot you have no idea how horny a man gets in prison thats why babyface nelson and a lot of other guys preferred to die rather than go back to the big house again hell if you havent been there you cant understand you just dont know what being horny is well anyway after a lot of bull about jesus and jehovah and the bible and all that harry just asked me pointblank one day in the prison yard do you think its possible there might be a true religion i was about to say bullshit like there might be an honest cop but something stopped me i realized he was dead serious and a lot might depend on my answer so i was cautious i said if there is i havent heard about it and he just came back real quiet most people havent it was a couple of days afterward that he brought the subject up again then he went right on with it showed me the sacred chao and everything it took my breath away the old mans voice trailed off as he sank into silent memories and it really does go back to babylon joe prompted im not much of an intellectual dillinger replied action is my arena let simon tell you that part simon was eager to leap into the breach the basic book to confirm our tradition he said is the seven tablets of creation which is dated at about bc the time of sargon it describes how tiamat and apsu the first gods were coexisting in mummu the primordial chaos von junzt in his unausprechlichen kulten tells how the justified ancients of mummu originated just about the time the seven tablets were inscribed you see under sargon the chief deity was marduk i mean that was what the high priests gave out to the public in private of course they worshipped loksotot who became the yogsothoth of the necronomicon but maybe im going too fast getting back to the official religion of marduk it was based on usury the priests monopolized the medium of exchange and were able to extract interest for lending it they also monopolized the land and extracted tribute for renting it it was the beginning of what we laughingly call civilization which has always rested on rent and interest the old babylonian con the official story was that mummu was dead killed in the war between the gods when the first anarchist group arose they called themselves justified ancients of mummu like laotse and the taoists in china they wanted to get rid of usury and monopoly and all the other pigshit of civilization and go back to a natural way of life so grok they took the supposedly dead god mummu and claimed he was still alive and was actually stronger than all the other gods they had a good argument look around theyd say what do you see most of chaos right therefore the god of chaos is the strongest god and is still alive of course we got our ass whipped good we were just no match for the illuminati in those days didnt have a clue about how they performed their miracles for instance so we got our asses whipped again in greece when the jams got started again as part of the cynic movement by the tune the whole thing was happening again in rome usury and monopoly and the whole bag of tricks the truce took place the justified ancients became part of the illuminati a special group still keeping our own name but taking orders from the five we thought wed humanize them like the anarchists who stayed in sds after last year and so it went until then cecil rhodes started the circle of initiates and the big schism occurred every meeting would have a faction of rhodes boys carrying signs that said kick out the jams it was the parting of the ways they just didnt trust us or maybe they were afraid of being humanized but we had learned a lot by our long participation in the illuminati conspiracy and now we know how to fight them with their own weapons fuck their weapons dillinger interrupted i like to fight them with my weapons you are behind the big unsolved bank robberies of the last few years sure just in the planning though im too old to vault over tellers cages and carry on like i did back in the thirties john is also fighting on another front simon interjected dillinger laughed yes he said im the president of laughing buddha jesus phallus inc youve seen them if its not an lbjp its not an lp laughing buddha jesus phallus joe exclaimed my god you put out the best rock in the country the only rock a man my age can listen to without wincing thanks dillinger said modestly actually the illuminati own the companies that put out most of the rock we started laughing buddha jesus phallus to counterattack we were ignoring that front until they got the mc to cut a disc called kick out the jams just to taunt us with old bitter memories so we came back with our own releases and the next thing i knew i was making bales of money from it weve also fed information through third parties to christian crusade in tulsa oklahoma so they could expose some of what the illuminati are doing in the rock field youve seen the christian crusade publicationsrhythm riots and revolution and communism hypnotism and the beatles and so forth yes joe said absently i thought it was nut literature its so hard he added to grasp the whole picture youll get used to it simon smiled it just takes awhile to sink in who really did shoot john kennedy joe asked im sorry dillinger said youre only a private in our army right now not cleared for that kind of information yet ill just tell you this much his initials are hcso dont trust anybody with those initials no matter where or how you meet him hes being fair simon told joe youll appreciate it later and advancement is rapid dillinger added and the rewards are beyond your present understanding give him a hint john simon suggested with an anticipatory grin tell him how you got out of crown point jail ive read two versions of that joe said most of the sources claim you carved a fake gun out of balsa wood and dyed it black with your shoe polish tolands book says that you made that story up and leaked it out to protect the man who really managed the break for you a federal judge that you bribed to smuggle in a real gun which was it neither dillinger said crown point was known as the escapeproof jail before i crashed out of it and believe me it deserved the name do you want to know how i did it i walked through the walls listen hare krishna hare hare the sun beat down on the town of daleville on july like a rain of fire motoring down the main street john dillinger felt the perspiration on his neck although he had been paroled three weeks earlier he was still pale from his nine years in prison and the sunlight was cruel on his almost albinotinted skin im going to have to walk through that door all by myself he thought all alone and fighting every kind of fear and guilt that has been beaten into me from childhood on the spirit of mummu is stronger than the illuminatis technology pierpont had said remember that weve got the second law of thermodynamics on our side chaos steadily increases all over the universe all law and order is a kind of temporary accident but ive got to walk through that door all alone the secret of the five depends on it this time its my turn to be the goat pierpont and van meter and the others were still back in michigan city prison it was all in his handsbeing the first one paroled he had to raise the money to finance the jailbreak that would get the others out then having proved himself he would be taught the jam miracles the bank suddenly loomed before him too suddenly his heart skipped a beat then calmly he drove his chevrolet coupe over to the curb and parked i should have prepared better this car should be soupedup like the ones clyde barrow uses well ill know that the next time he left his hands on the steering wheel and squeezed hard he took a deep breath and repeated the formula skidoo it helped a little but he still wanted to get the hell out of there he wanted to drive straight back to his fathers farm in mooresville and find a job and learn all the straight things again how to kiss a bosss ass and how to look the parole officer straight in the eye and be like everybody else but everybody else was an illuminati puppet and didnt know it he did know it and was going to liberate himself hell thats what a younger john dillinger thought back in except that he hadnt known about the illuminati or the jams then but he was trying to liberate himself in his own way when he held up that grocer and what did it lead to nine years of misery and monotony and almost going mad with horniness in a stinking cell itll be nine years more if i fuck up today the spirit of mummu is stronger than the illuminatis technology he got out of the car and forced his feet and legs to move and he walked straight for the bank door fuck it he said skidoo he walked through the do orand then he did the thing the bank tellers remembered after and told the police he reached up and adjusted his straw hat to the most dapper and debonair angle and he grinned all right this is a stickup he said clearly taking out his pistol everybody lie down on the floor and keep calm none of you will get hurt oh god a female teller gasped dont shoot please dont shoot dont worry honey john dillinger said easily i dont want to hurt anybody just open the vault like a tree thats planted bv the water that afternoon the old man said i met calvin coolidge in the woods near my fathers farm at mooresville i gave him the haul twenty thousand dollars and it went into the jam treasury he gave me twenty tons of hempscript calvin coolidge joe malik exclaimed well of course i knew it wasnt really calvin coolidge but that was the form he chose to appear in who or what he really is i havent learned yet you met him in chicago simon added gleefully he appeared as billy graham that time you mean the dev satan simon said simply is just another of the innumerable masks he wears behind the mask is a man and behind the man is another mask its all a matter of merging multiverses remember dont look for an ultimate reality there isnt any then this person this being joe protested really is supernatural supernatural schmupernatural simon grimaced youre still like the people in that mathematical parable about flatland you can only think in categories of right and left and im talking about up and down so you say supernatural there is no supernatural there are just more dimensions than you are accustomed to thats all if you were living in flatland and i stepped out of your plane into a plane at a different angle it would look to you as if i vanished into thin air somebody looking down from our threedimensional viewpoint would see me going off at a tangent from you and would wonder why you were acting so distressed and surprised about it but the flash of light its an energy transformation simon explained patiently look the reason you can only think threedimensionally is because there are only three directions in cubical space thats why the illuminati and some of the kids theyve allowed to become partially illuminized lately refer to ordinary science as square the basic energyvector coordinates of universe are fivedimensional of course and can best be visualized in terms of the five sides of the illuminati pyramid of egypt five sides joe objected it only has four youre ignoring the bottom oh go on energy is always triangular not cubical bucky fuller has a line on this by the way hes the first one outside the illuminati to discover it independently the basic energy transformation were concerned with is the one fuller hasnt discovered yet although hes said hes looking for it the one that ties mind into the matterenergy continuum the pyramid is the key you take a man in the lotus position and draw lines from his pineal gland the third eye as the buddhists call it to his two knees and from each knee to the other and this is what you get simon sketched rapidly in his notepad and passed it over to joe when the pineal eye opens after fear is conquered that is after your first bad trip you can control the energy field entirely simon went on an irish illuminatus of the ninth century scotus ergina put it very simply in five words of course when he said omnia quia sunt lumina sunt all things that are are lights einstein also put it into five symbols when he wrote e mc the actual transformation doesnt require atomic reactors and all that jazz once you learn how to control the mind vectors but it always lets off one hell of a flash of light as john can tell you damn near blinded me and knocked me on my ass that first time in the woods dillinger agreed but i was sure glad to know the trick i was never afraid of being arrested after that cause i could always walk out of any jail they put me in thats why the feds decided to kill me you know it was embarrassing to always find me wandering around loose again a few days after they locked me up you know the background to the biograph theatre scam they killed three guys in chicago without giving them a chance to surrender because they thought i was one of them well those three were all wanted in new york for armed robbery so nobody criticized the cops much for that caper but then up in lake geneva wisconsin they shot three very respectable businessmen and one of them went and died and hoovers heroes caught all sorts of crap from the newspapers so i knew where it was at i could never again surrender and walk away a few days later we had to produce a body for them the old man looked suddenly sad there was one possibility that we hated to think about but luckily it didnt come to that the gimmick we finally worked out was perfect and everything really follows the fives law joe asked more than you guess dillinger remarked blandly even when youre dealing with social fields simon added weve run studies of cultures where the illuminati were not in control and they still follow weishaupts fivestage pattern verwirrung zweitracht unordnung beamtenherrschaft and grummet that is chaos discord confusion bureaucracy and aftermath america right now is between the fourth and fifth stages or you might say that the older generation is mostly in beamtenherrschaft and the younger generation is moving into grummet rapidly joe took another stiff drink and shook his head but why do they leave so much of it out in the open i mean not merely the really shocking things you told me about the bugs bunny cartoons but putting the pyramid on the dollar bill where everybody sees it almost every day hell simon said look what beethoven did when weishaupt illuminated him went right home and wrote the fifth symphony you know how it begins dadadadum morse code for vthe roman numeral for five right out in the open as you say it amuses the devil out of them to confirm their low opinion of the rest of humanity by putting things up front like that and watching how almost everybody misses it of course if somebody doesnt miss something they recruit him right away look at genesis lux fiat right on the first page they do it all the time the pentagon building skidoo the lyrics of rock songs like lucy in the sky with diamonds how obvious can you get melville was one of the most outrageous of the bunch the very first sentence of moby dick tells you hes a disciple of hassan i sabbah but you cant find a single melville scholar who has followed up that lead in spite of ahab being a truncated anagram of sabbah he even tells you again and again directly and indirectly that moby dick and leviathan are the same creature and that moby dick is often seen at the same time in two different parts of the world but not one reader in a million groks what hes hinting at theres a whole chapter on whiteness and why white is really more terrifying than black all the critics miss the point osiris is a black god joe quoted right on youre going to advance fast simon said enthusiastically in fact j think its time for you to get off the verbal level and really confront your own lucy in the sky with diamonds your own lady isis yes dillinger said the leif erikson is laying offshore near california right now hagbard is running some hashish to the students at berkeley hes got a new black chick in his crew who plays the lucy role extremely well well have him send her ashore for the rite i suggest that you two drive up to the norton lodge in frisco and ill arrange for her to meet you there i dont like dealing with hagbard simon said hes a rightwing nut and so is his whole gang hes one of the best allies we have against the illuminati dillinger said besides i want to exchange some hempscript for some of his flaxscript right now the mad dog bunch wont accept anything but flaxscript they think nixon is really going to knock the bottom out of the hemp market and you know what they do with federal reserve notes every time they get one they burn it instant demurrage they call it puerile simon pronounced it will take decades to undermine the fed that way well dillinger said those are the kinds of people we have to deal with the jams cant do it all alone you know sure simon shrugged but it bugs me he stood up and put his drink on the table lets go he said to joe youre going to be illuminized dillinger accompanied them to the door then leaned close to joe and said a word of advice about the rite yes dillinger lowered his voice lie down on the floor and keep calm he said and his old impudent grin flashed wickedly joe stood there looking at the mocking bandit and it seemed to him a freeze and a frieze in time a moment that would linger as another stage of illumination forever in his mind sister cecilia back in resurrection school spoke out of the abyss of memory stand in the corner joseph malik and he remembered too the chalk that he crumbled slowly between his fingers the feeling of needing to urinate the long wait and then father volpe entering the classroom his voice like thunder where is he where is the boy who dared to disagree with the good sister that god sent to instruct him and the other children led out of the classroom and across the street to the church to pray for his soul while the priest harangued him do you know how hot hell is do you know how hot the worst part of hell is thats where they send people who have the good fortune to be born into the church and then rebel against it misled by pride of intellect and five years later those two faces came back the priest angry and dogmatic demanding obedience and the bandit sardonic encouraging cynicism and joe understood that he might someday have to kill hagbard celine but more years had to pass and the fernando poo incident had to pass and joe had to plan the bombing of his own magazine with tobias knight before he knew that he would in fact kill celine without compunction if it were necessary but on march in that year of fruition for all the illuminatis plans while the president of the united states went on the air to threaten allout thermonuclear heck a young lady named concepcion galore lay nude on a bed in the hotel durrutti in santa isobel and said its a lloigor whats a lloigor asked her companion an englishman named fission chips who had been born on hiroshima day and named by a father who cared more for physics than for the humanities the room was in the luxury suite of the hotel durrutti which meant that it was decorated in abominable spanishmoorish decor the sheets were changed daily to a less luxurious suite the cockroaches were minimal and the plumbing sometimes worked concepcion contemplated the bullfight mural on the opposite wall manolete turning an elegant veronica on an unconvincingly drawn bull and said thoughtfully oh a lloigor is a god of the black people the natives a very bad god chips glanced at the statue again and said more to himself than to the peasant girl looks vaguely like tlaloc in mexico city crossed with one of those polynesian cthulhu tikis the starry wisdom people are very interested in these statues concepcion said just to be making conversation since it was obvious that chips wasnt going to be ready to prong her again for at least another half hour indeed chips said equally bored who are the starry wisdom people a church down on tequilla y mota street what used to be lumumba street and was franco street when i was a girl funny church the girl frowned thinking about them when i worked in the telegraph office i was always seeing their telegrams all in code and never to another church always to banks all over europe and north and south america you dont say drawled chips no longer bored but trying to sound casual his code number in british intelligence was of course why are they interested in these statues he was thinking that statues properly hollowed out could transport heroin he was already sure that starry wisdom was a front for bugger in at harvard professor tochus told his psychology class now the child feels frightened and inferior according to adler because he is in fact physically smaller and weaker than the adult thus he knows he has no chance of successful rebellion but nevertheless he dreams about it this is the origin of the oedipus complex in adlers system not sex but the will to power itself the class will readily see the influence of neitzsche robert putney drake glancing around the room was quite sure that most of the students would not readily see anything and tochus himself didnt really see either the child drake had decidedit was the cornerstone of his own system of psychology was not brainwashed by sentimentality religion ethics and other bullshit the child saw clearly that in every relationship there is a dominant party and a submissive party and the child in its quite correct egotism determined to become the dominant party it was that simple except of course that the brainwashing takes effect eventually in most cases and by about this time the college years most of them were ready to become robots and accept the submissive role professor tochus droned on and drake serene in his lack of superego continued to dream of how he would seize the dominant role in new york arthur flegenheimer drakes psychic twin stood before seventeen robed figures one wearing a goatshead mask and repeated i will forever hele always conceal never reveal any art or arts part or parts you look like a robot joe malik says in a warped room in a skewered time in san francisco i mean you move and walk like a robot hold onto that mr wabbit says a bearded young man with a saturnine smile some trippers see themselves as robots others see the guide as a robot hold that perspective is it a hallucination or is a recognition of something we usually black out wait joe says part of you is like a robot but part of you is alive like a growing thing a tree or a plant the young man continues to smile his face drifting above his body toward the mandala painted on the ceiling well he asks do you think that might be a good poetic shorthand that part of me is mechanical like a robot and part of me is organic like a rosebush and whats the difference between the mechanical and the organic isnt a rosebush a kind of machine used by the dna code to produce more rosebushes no joe says everything is mechanical but people are different a cat has a grace that weve lost or partly lost how do you think weve lost it and joe sees the face of father volpe and hears the voice screaming about submission the sac bases await the presidential order to take off for fernando poo atlanta hope addresses a rally in atlanta georgia protesting the gutless appeasement of the comsymp administration in not threatening to bomb moscow and peking the same time as santa isobel the premier of russia rereads his speech nervously as the tv cameras are set up in his office and in socialist solidarity with the freedomloving people of fernando poo the chairman of the chinese communist party having found the thought of chairman mao of little avail throws the iching sticks and looks dismally at hexagram and percent of the peoples of the world wait for their leaders to tell them what to do but in santa isobel itself three locked doors across the suite from the nowsleeping concepcion fission chips says angrily into his shortwave repeat none not one russian or chinese anywhere on the bloody island i dont care what washington says im telling you what i have seen now about the bugger heroin ring here sign off the submarine tells him hq is not interested in bugger or heroin right now damn and blast chips stares at the shortwave set that bloody well tore it he would just have to proceed on his own and show those armchair agents back in london especially that smug w how little they actually knew about the real problem in fernando poo and the world storming he charged back to the bedroom ill just get dressed he thought furiously including my smoke bombs and luger and laser ray and toddle over to this starry wisdom church and see what i can nose out but when he tore open the bedroom door he stopped momentarily stunned concepcion still lay in the bed but she was no longer sleeping her throat was neatly cut and a curious dagger with a flame design on it stuck into the pillow beside her damn blast and thunder cried now that absolutely does tear it every time i find a good piece of ass those fuckers from bugger come along and shaft her ten minutes later the go signal came from the white house a fleet of sac bombers headed for santa isobel with hydrogen bombs and fission chips fully dressed toddled over to the starry wisdom church where he encountered not bugger but something on an entirely different plane book two zweitracht it must have a natural cause it must have a supernatural cause let these two asses be set to grind corn frater perdurabo oto chinese music the book of lies the fourth trip or chesed jesus christ on a bicycle mister order he runs at a very good pace but old mother chaos is winning the race lord omar khayaam ravenhurst ksc the book of advice the honest book of truth among those who knew that the true faith of mohammed was contained in the ishmaelian teachings most were sent out into the world to seek positions in the governments of the near east and europe since it pleased allah to decree this task for them they obeyed willingly many served thus for their whole lives some however after five or ten or even twenty years of such fealty to a given shah or caliph or king would receive through surreptitious channels a parchment bearing the symbol that night the servant would strike and disappear like smoke and the master would be found in the morning throat cut with the emblematic flame dagger of the ishmaelians lying beside him others were chosen to serve in a different manner maintaining the palace of hassan i sabbah himself at alamout these were especially fortunate for it was their privilege to visit more often than others the garden of delights in which the lord hassan himself would through his command of magic chemicals transfer them into heaven while they still lived in the body one day in the year known to the uncircumcised christian dogs as ad another proof of the lord hassans powers was given to them for they were all summoned to the throne room and there sat the lord hassan in all his glory while before him on the floor lay a plate bearing the head of the disciple ibn azif this deluded one the lord hassan declared has disobeyed a command the one crime that cannot be forgiven in our sacred order i show you his head to remind you of the fate of traitors in this world more i will instruct you on the fate of such dogs in the next world so saying the good and wise lord hassan rose from his throne walking with his characteristic lurching gait and approached the head i command thee he said speak the mouth opened and the head emitted a scream such that all the faithful covered their ears and turned their eyes away many of them muttering prayers speak dog the wise lord hassan repeated your whine is of no interest to us speak the flames the head cried the terrible flames allah the flames it babbled on as a soul will in extreme agony forgiveness it begged forgiveness o mighty lord there is no forgiveness for traitors said the allwise hassan return to hell and the head immediately silenced all bowed down and prayed to hassan and allah alike of the many miracles they had seen this was certainly the greatest and most terrible the lord hassan then dismissed everyone saying forget not this lesson let it stay in your hearts longer than the names of your fathers we want to recruit you hagbard said odd years later because you are so gullible that is gullible in the right way jesus christ went by on a bicycle that was my first warning that i shouldnt have taken acid before coming down to balbo and michigan to see the action but it really seemed right on another level acid was the only way to relate to that whole kafkaonabummer example of quote democratic process in action unquote i found hagbard in grant park cool as usual with a bucket of water and a pile of handkerchiefs for the teargas victims he was near the general logan statue watching the more violent confrontations across the street at the hilton sucking one of his italian cigars and looking like ahab finally finding the whale hagbard in fact was remembering professor tochus at harvard damn it celine you cant major in naval engineering and law both youre not leonardo da vinci after all but i am he had replied pokerfaced i recall all my past incarnations in detail and leonardo was one of them tochus almost exploded be a wiseass then when you start flunking half your subjects perhaps youll come back to reality the old man had been terribly disappointed to see the long row of as across the street the demonstrators advanced toward the hilton and the police charged again clubbing them back hagbard wondered if tochus had ever realized that a professor is a policeman of the intellect then he saw the padres new disciple moon approaching you havent been clubbed yet i said thinking that in a sense jarrys old presurrealist classic the crucifixion of christ considered as an uphill bike race was really the best metaphor for the circus daley was running neither have you im glad to see hagbard replied judging from your eyes though you got teargassed in lincoln park last night i nodded remembering that i had been thinking of him and his weird discordian yoga when it happened malik the dumb socialdemocraticliberal that john wanted to recruit soon was only a few feet away and burroughs and ginsberg were near me on the other side i could see suddenly that we were all chessmen but who was the chessmaster moving us and how big was the board across the street a rhinoceros moved ponderously turning into a jeep with a barbedwire crowdsticker on the front of it my heads leaking i said do you have any idea whos picking it up hagbard asked he was remembering a house lease in professor orlocks class what it amounts to in english hagbard had said is that the tenant has no rights that can be successfully defended in court and the landlord has no duties on which he cannot quite safely default orlock looked pained and several students were shocked as if hagbard had suddenly jumped up and exposed his penis in front of the class thats putting it too baldly orlock said finally itmight be somebody years in the future i said or the past i wondered if jarry was picking it up in paris half a century before that would account for the resemblance abbie hoffman went by just then talking to apollonius of tyana were we all in jarrys mind or joyces we even have a sheriff wood riding herd on us and rubins horde of jerry men fullers car is a stunt a showpiece professor caligari fumed and anyway it has nothing to do with naval architecture hagbard looked at him levelly and said it has everything to do with naval architecture as in law school the other students were disturbed hagbard began to understand they are not here to learn they are here to acquire a piece of paper that would make them eligible for certain jobs there are only a few more memos saul said to muldoon lets skim them and then call headquarters to see if danny found this paf who wrote them illuminati project memo jm heres the weirdest version of the illuminati history that ive found so far its from a publication written edited and published by somebody named philip campbell argylestuart who holds that the conflicts in the world are due to an ageold war between semitic khazar peoples and nordic faustian peoples this is the essence of his thinking my theory is that an extremely devilish imposed overcrust was added to the khazar population consisting of humanoids who arrived by flying saucer from the planet vulcan which i assume to be not in intramercurial orbit around the sun but rather in the earths orbit behind the sun forever out of sight to earthlings always six months behind or ahead of the earth in orbital travel likewise for the gothic faustian western culture the previously comparatively inert and purposeless migrating population streams known as franks goths angles saxons danes swabians alemani lombards vandals and vikings suddenly had an overcrust added consisting of normanmartianvarangians arriving from saturn by way of mars in flying saucers after it the khazarvulcanian conspiracy used the illuminati and grand orient masons after it used the financial machinations of the house of rothschild and after the communist movement and after the zionist movement one more thing needs to be mentioned mrs helena petrovna blavatski nee hahn in germany founder of theosophy was both hypocritical and devilish a true witch of great evil power allied with illuminati grand orient masons russian anarchists british israel theorists protozionists arabian assassins and thuggi from india source the high iq bulletin vol iv no january published by philip campbell argylestuart colorado springs colorado i pat what was that word private celine asked eagerly snafu private pearson told him you mean to say you never heard it before he sat up in his bunk and stared im a naturalized citizen hagbard said i was born in norway he pulled his shirt away from his back again the fort benning summer was much too hot for the nordic half of his genes situation normal all fucked up he repeated that really sums it up that really says it waitll youve been in this mans army a little longer the black man told him vehemently then youll really appreciate the application of that word dads oh man will you appreciate it its not just the army hagbard said thoughtfully its the whole world actually after they immanentized the eschaton i found out where my head was leaking that night and a few other nights too into poor george dorn the leak almost gave him water on the brain he kept wondering where all that joyce and surrealism was coming from im seven years older than he is that were on the same valence because of similar grammar school experiences and revolutionary fathers thats why hagbard never really understood either of us fully he had private tutors until he hit college and by that stage official education is beginning to make some partial concessions to reality so the victims have at least a chance of surviving on the outside but i didnt know any of that in grant park that night or how the army helped hagbard understand college because i was working out this new notion of the total valence of the set remaining constant it would mean that i would have to leave when george came on or say marilyn monroe and jayne mansfield had to do the pill or autowreck shticks before there was room for racquel welchs vibes illuminati project memo jm i think ive found the clue as to how zoroaster flying saucers and all that lunaticfringe stuff fits into the illuminati puzzle dig this bossman the nazi party was founded as the political appendage of the thule society an extremist fringe of the illuminated lodge of berlin this lodge in turn was made up of rosicrucians high freemasons and its preoccupation was mourning the death of the feudal system masons of this time were like the federalist party in postrevolutionary america working diligently to prevent anarchy and preserve the old values by bringing about christian socialism indeed the aaron burr conspiracy which professor hofstadter notes was allegedly masonic in origin was an american prototype of german intrigues of a century later to their external scientific socialism these masons added mystic concepts which were thought to be gnostic in origin one of these was the concept of gnosticism itself called illumination which held that heavenly beings directly or indirectly gave humanity its great ideas and would come back to earth after mankind had achieved sufficient progress illumination was a brand of pentecostalism which was persecuted by orthodox christianity for centuries and had become lodged in freemasonry through a complex historical process which is impossible to explain without a major digression it is sufficient to say that the nazis being illuminated felt themselves to be divinely inspired and therefore felt justified in rewriting the rules of good and evil to suit their own purposes according to nazi theory the heavenly beings before the present moon was captured had lived on the highest ground in peru mexico condor ethiopia himalaya atlantis and mu forming the uranian confederation this was taken quite seriously and british intelligence actually combated it with the tolkien fantasy called the silmarillion basis for the famous hobbit books both j edgar hoover and congressman otto passman are highranking masons and both significantly reflect this philosophy and its manichean attitude the chief danger in masonic thinking aside from the divine right of government is of course manicheanism the belief that your opponent is opposing gods will and is therefore an agent of satan this is the extreme application and mr hoover usually reserves it for godless communism but it is almost always present to some degree source the nazi religion views on religious statism in germany and america by j f c moore libertarian american vol iii no august pat they were using mace now and i saw one photographer snapping a picture of a cop while the cop was still macing him heisenberg rides again from out of the west come the thundering hooves of the great hearse joint phenomenon except that i was on acid if id been on weed then it would really royally be a joint phenomenon and i heard later that the photographer got an award for that shot right then he didnt look like he was getting an award he looked like they had just taken off his skin and touched each raw nerve with a dentists drill christ i said to hagbard look at that poor bastard i hope i come out of this with just another teargassing or two i dont want any of that mace but acid is placid you know and a minute later i was on joyces juices again and thinking of a drama called their mace and my gripes i made the first line fruity in honor of padre pederastia what a botch of a pair to plumb this hours gripes bismallah hagbard said our karma is made by our deeds not by our prayers youre on the set so you take the action as it comes oh cut out that holy man craperoo and stop reading my mind i protested you dont have to go on impressing me but i was off on another tangent which went something like this if this set is mayor daleys circus then mayor daley is the ringmaster if the things below are the things above as hermes hermetically hinted then this set is the bigger set mr microcosm meet mr macrocosm hi mike hi mac conclusion mayor daley in a small way is what krishna is in a large way qed just then some sds kids whod been teargassed across the street came running our way and hagbard got busy handing out wet handkerchiefs they needed them they were halfblind like joyce splitting his adam into wise hopes and i wasnt much help because i was tod busy crying myself hagbard i gasped in ecstasy mayor daley is krishna worse luck for him he said curtly distributing the handkerchiefs he doesnt suspect it i thought suddenly hubert the hump has coughed and hawked and spat on the streets that lincoln walked the water turned to blood hagbard was a joking jolting jesus you expected wine maybe and i remembered my mothers story about dillinger at the biograph we all sit there like him in the biograph theatre dreaming the drama of our lives then walk outside to the grandmotherly kindness of the lead kisses that wake us back to our slipping beatitude except that he found a way to come back what was it charley mordecai said first as tragedy then as farce marxismlennonism ed sanders of the fugs the night before talking about fucking in the streets as if he had read my mind or had i read his and lennons why dont we do it in the road was recorded a year in the future the marx and our groupies the bloody handkerchiefs dipped into water or wine and the mass rite went on the mass went right on the mace they rowed capone set it up for the feds but john was fed up and left the set so an extra named frank sullivan got the bullets the autobiograph theatre a drama house and a trauma yes i maybe should have taken only half a tab instead of the full mikes because at that point the sds kids all of them siding with rymi at the split next year looked like they had altarboy robes on and i thought hagbard was distributing communion wafers not handkerchiefs he looked at me suddenly with that hawkfaced egyptian glare and i observed that he had observed hopalong horus heisenberg just where i was at you dont have to be a waterman i thought to know which way my mind is blowing there was a sound from the crowd like a subway opening all its doors with a suck of air and i saw the police coming crossing the street to clear the park here we go again i said all hail discordia snafu ueber alles hagbard grinned starting to trot beside me we headed north figuring that the ones who retreated eastward would get trapped against the wall and creamed democracy in action i said panting along there thou mightst behold the very image of authority he quoted shifting his water bucket to keep it in balance i caught the shakespearean reference and looked back my mind had already each policeman indeed looked like shakespeares dog i remembered the frantic semantics at the lbj antibirthday party when burroughs insisted chicago cops were more like dogs than pigs in contradiction to the sds rhetoric terry southern taking his usual maniacal middle course claimed they were more akin to the purpleassed mandrill most surly of the baboon family but most of them hadnt discovered writing yet authority i asked realizing id lost something along the way we were slowing to a walk the action was behind us a is not a hagbard explained with that tiresome patience of his once you accept a is a youre hooked literally hooked addicted to the system i caught the references to aristotle the old man of the tribe with his unfortunate epistemological paresis and also to that feisty little lady i always imagine is really the lost anastasia but i still didnt grok what do you mean i asked grabbing a wet handkerchief as some of the teargas started to drift to our end of the park chairman mao didnt say half of it hagbard replied holding a handkerchief to his own face his words came through muffled it isnt only political power that grows out of the barrel of a gun so does a whole definition of reality a set and the action that has to happen on that particular set and on none other dont be so bloody patronizing i objected looking around a corner in time and realizing this was the night i would be maced thats just marx the ideology of the ruling class becomes the ideology of the whole society not the ideology the reality he lowered his handkerchief this was a public park until they changed the definition now the guns have changed the reality it isnt a public park theres more than one kind of magic just like the enclosure acts i said hollowly one day the land belonged to the people the next day it belonged to the landlords and like the narcotics acts he added a hundred thousand harmless junkies became criminals overnight by act of congress in nineteen twentyseven ten years later in thirtyseven all the potheads in the country became criminals overnight by act of congress and they really were criminals when the papers were signed the guns prove it walk away from those guns waving a joint and refuse to halt when they tell you their imagination will become your reality in a second and i had my answer to dad finally just as a cop jumped out of the darkness screaming something about freaking motherfucking fag commies and maced me as was certain to happen i knew it as i crumbled in pain on that set illuminati project memo jm heres some more info on how blavatsky theosophy and the motto under the great pyramid on the us seal fit into the illuminati picture or dont fit into the picture its getting more confusing the further i dig into it this is an article defending madame blavatsky after truman capote had repeated the john birch societys charge that sirhan sirhan was inspired to murder robert kennedy by reading blavatskys works sirhan blavatsky capote by ted zatlyn los angeles free press july birchers that attack madame blavatsky though smaller in number and as crazy as ever find a new home in an atmosphere of suspicion and violence truman capote takes them seriously does mr capote know that the illuminati according to sacred birch doctrine began in the garden of eden when eve made it with the snake and gave birth to cain that all the descendants of snakeman cain belong to a supersecret group known as the illuminati dedicated to absolutely nothing but the meanest low down evil imagined in the satanic mind of man antiilluminati john steinbacher writes in his unpublished book novus ordo seclorum the new order of the ages today in america many otherwise talented people are flirting with disaster by associating with those same evil forces madame blavatskys doctrine was strikingly similar to that of weishaupt the author also gives his version of the birchers version of what the illuminati are actually trying to accomplish their evil goal is to transcend materiality and to bring about one world denying the sovereignty of nations and the sanctity of private property i dont think i can believe or even understand this but at least it explains how both the nazis and the communists can be pawns of the illuminati or does it pat property is theft hagbard said passing the peace pipe if the bia helps those real estate developers take our land uncle john feather said that will be theft but if we keep the land that is certainly not theft night was falling in the mohawk reservation but hagbard saw sam three arrows nod vigorously in the gloom of the small cabin he felt again that american indians were the hardest people in the world to understand his tutors had given him a cosmopolitan education in every sense of the word and he usually found no blocks in relating to people of any culture but the indians did puzzle him at times after five years of specializing in handling the legal battles of various tribes against the bureau of indian affairs and the land pirates it served he was still conscious that these peoples heads were someplace he couldnt yet reach either they were the simplest or the most sophisticated society on the planet maybe he thought they were both and the ultimate simplicity and the ultimate sophistication are identical property is liberty hagbard said i am quoting the same man who said property is theft he also said property is impossible i speak from the heart i wish you to understand why i take this case i wish you to understand in fullness sam three arrows drew on the pipe then raised his dark eyes to hagbards you mean that justice is not known like a dog who barks in the night that it is more like the unexpected sound in the woods that must be identified cautiously after hard thinking there it was again hagbard had heard the same concreteness of imagery in the speech of the shoshone at the opposite end of the continent he wondered idly if ezra pounds poetry might have been influenced by habits of speech his father acquired from the indianshomer pound had been the first white man born in idaho it certainly went beyond the chinese and it came not from books on rhetoric but from listening to the heart the indian metaphor he had himself used a minute ago he took his time about answering he was beginning to acquire the indian habit of thinking a long while before speaking property and justice are water he said finally no man can hold them long i have spent many years in courtrooms and i have seen property and justice change when a man speaks change as the caterpillar changes to the butterfly do you understand me i thought i had victory in my hands and then the judge spoke and it went away like water running through the fingers uncle john feather nodded i understand you mean we will lose again we are accustomed to losing since george washington promised us these lands as long as the mountain stands and the grass is green and then broke his promise and stole part of them back in ten years in ten years my friend we have lost always lost we have one acre left of each hundred promised to us then we may not lose hagbard said i promise you the bia will at least know they have been in a fight this time i learn more tricks and get nastier each time i go into a courtroom i am very tricky and very nasty by now but i am less sure of myself than i was when i took my first case i no longer understand what i am fighting i have a word for it the snafu principle i call it but i do not understand what it is there was another pause hagbard heard the lid on the garbage can in back of the cabin rattling that was the raccoon that uncle john feather called old grandfather come to steal his evening dinner property was theft certainly in old grandfathers world hagbard thought i am also puzzled sam three arrows said finally i worked long ago in new york city in construction like many young men of the mohawk nation i found that whites were often like us and i could not hate them one at a time but they do not know the earth or love it they do not speak from the heart usually they do not act from the heart they are more like the actors on the movie screen they play roles and their leaders are not like our leaders they are not chosen for virtue but for their skill at playing roles whites have told me this in plain words they do not trust their leaders and yet they follow them when we do not trust a leader he is finished then also the leaders of the whites have too much power it is bad for a man to be obeyed too often but the worst thing is what i have said about the heart their leaders have lost it and they have lost mercy they speak from somewhere else they act from somewhere else but from where like you i do not know it is i think a kind of insanity he looked at hagbard and added politely some are different it was a long speech for him and it stirred something in uncle john feather i was in the army he said we went to fight a bad white man or so the whites told us we had meetings that were called orientation and education there were films it was to show us how this bad white man was doing terrible things in his country everybody was angry after the films and eager to fight except me i was only there because the army paid more than an indian can earn anywhere else so i was not angry but puzzled there was nothing that this white leader did that the white leaders in this country do not also do they told us about a place named lidice it was much like wounded knee they told us of families moved thousands of miles to be destroyed it was much like the trail of tears they told us of how this man ruled his nation so that none dared disobey him it was much like the way white men work in corporations in new york city as sam has described it to me i asked another soldier about this a black white man he was easier to talk to than the regular white man i asked him what he thought of the orientation and education he said it was shit and he spoke from the heart i thought about it a long time and i knew he was right the orientation and education was shit when the men from the bia come here to talk it is the same shit but let me tell you this the mohawk nation is losing its soul soul is not like breath or blood or bone and it can be taken in ways no man understands my grandfather had more soul than i have and the young men have less than me but i have enough soul to talk to old grandfather who is a raccoon now he thinks as a raccoon and he is worried about the raccoon nation more than i am worried about the mohawk nation he thinks the raccoon nation will die soon and all the nations of the free and wild animals that is a terrible thing and it frightens me when the nations of the animals die the earth will also die that is an old teaching and i cannot doubt it i see it happening already if they steal more of our land to build that dam more of our soul will die and more of the souls of the animals will die the earth will die and the stars will no longer shine the great mother herself may die the old man was crying unashamedly and it will be because men do not speak words but speak shit hagbard had turned pale beneath his olive skin youre coming into court he said slowly and youre going to tell the judge that in exactly those words illuminati project memo jm you may remember that the east village others chart of the illuminati conspiracy memo listed the holy vehm as an illuminati front i have finally found out what the holy vehm is or rather was my source is eliphas levys history of magic op cit pages they were a kind of secret police having the right of life and death the mystery which surrounded their judgments the swiftness of their executions helped to impress the imagination of people still in barbarism the holy vehm assumed gigantic proportions men shuddered in describing apparitions of masked persons of summonses nailed to the doors of nobles in the very midst of their watchguards and their orgies of brigand chiefs found dead with the terrible cruciform dagger in their breasts and on the scroll attached thereto an extract from the sentence of the holy vehm the tribunal affected most fantastic forms of procedure the guilty person cited to appear at some discredited crossroad was taken to the assembly by a man clothed in black who bandaged his eyes and led him forward in silence this occurred invariably at some unseemly hour of the night for judgment was never pronounced except at midnight the criminal was carried into a vast underground vault where he was questioned by one voice the hoodwink was removed the vault was illuminated in all its depth and height and the free judges sat masked and wearing black vestures the code of the vehmic court was found in the ancient archives of westphalia and has been printed in the reichstheater of muller under the following title code and statutes of the holy secret tribunal of free courts and free judges of westphalia established in the year by the emperor charlemagne and revised in by king robert who made those alterations and additions requisite for the administration of justice in the tribunals of the illuminated after investing them with his own authority a note on the first page forbade any profane person to glance at the book under penalty of death the word illuminated here given to the associates of the secret tribunal unfolds their entire mission they had to track down in the shadows those who worshipped the darkness they counterchecked mysteriously those who conspired against society in favour of mystery but they were themselves the secret soldiers of light who cast the light of day on criminal plottings and it is this which was signified by a sudden splendour illuminating the tribunal when it pronounced sentence so now we have to add charlemagne to the list of the illuminated along with zoroaster joachim of floris jefferson washington aaron burr hitler marx and madame blavatsky could this all be a hoax illuminati project memo jm my last memo may have been too hasty in using the past tense in speaking about the holy vehm i find that darual thinks they may still exist history of secret societies op cit p these terrible courts were never formally abolished they were reformed by various monarchs but even in the nineteenth century it was said that they still existed though very much underground the nazi werewolves and resistance organizations fighting the communist occupation of east germany claimed that they were carrying on the tradition of the chivalrous and holy vehm perhaps they still are pat federal court for the th district of new york state plaintiffs john feather samuel arrows et al defendants bureau of indian affairs department of the interior and president of the united states for plaintiffs hagbard celine for the defendants george kharis john alucard thomas moriarity james moran presiding justice quasimodo immhotep mr feather concluding and it will be because men do not speak words but speak shit mr kharis your honor i move that the last speech be stricken from the record as irrelevant and immaterial we are dealing here with a practical question the need of the people of new york for this dam and mr feathers superstitions are totally beside the point mr celine your honor the people of new york have survived a long time without a dam in that particular place they can survive longer without it can anything survive anything worth having if our words become as mr feather says excrement can anything we can reasonably call american justice survive if the words of our first president if the sacred honor of george washington is destroyed if his promise that the mohawk could keep these lands as long as the mountain stands and the grass is green if all that becomes nothing but excrement mr kharis counsel is not arguing counsel is making speeches mr celine i am speaking from the heart are you or are you speaking excrement that you are ordered to speak by your superiors mr alucard more speeches mr celine more excrement justice immhotep control yourself mr celine mr celine i am controlling myself otherwise i would speak as frankly as my client and say that most of the speeches here are plain old shit why do i say excrement at all if it isnt tike you people to disguise a little what we are all doing its shit plain shit justice immhotep mr celine you are coming very close to contempt of court i warn you mr celine your honor we speak the tongue of shakespeare of milton of melville must we go on murdering it must we tear it away from its last umbilical connection with reality what is going on in this room actually defendants the us government and its agents want to steal some land from my clients how long do we have to argue that they have no justice no right no honor in their cause why cant we say highway robbery is highway robbery instead of calling it eminent domain why cant we say shit is shit instead of calling it excrement why do we never use language to convey meaning why must we always use it conceal meaning why do we never speak from the heart why do we always speak words programmed into us like robots justice immhotep mr celine i warn you again mr feather and i warn you the world will die the stars will go out if men and women cannot trust the words spoken the earth will crack like a rotten pumpkin mr kharis i call for a recess plaintiff and their counsel are both in no emotional state to continue at this time mr celine you even have guns you have men with guns and clubs who are called marshals and they will beat me if i dont shut up how do you differ from any other gang of bandits then except in using language that conceals what you are doing the only difference is that the bandits are more honest thats the only difference the only difference justice immhotep mr marshal restrain the counsel mr celine youre stealing what isnt yours why cant you talk turkey for just one moment why justice immhotep just hold him marshal dont use unnecessary force mr celine i am tempted to forgive you considering that you are obviously much involved with your clients emotionally however such mercy on my part would encourage other lawyers to believe they could follow your example i have no choice i find you guilty of contempt of court sentencing will take place when court reconvenes after a fifteenminute recess you may speak at that time but only on any mitigating grounds that should lighten the degree of your sentence i will not hear the united states government called bandits again that is all mr celine you steal land and you will not hear yourselves called bandits you order men with guns and clubs to hold us down and you will not hear yourselves called thugs you dont act from the heart where the hell do you act from what in gods name does motivate you justice immhotep restrain him marshal mr celine indistinguishable justice immhotep fifteenminute recess bailiff all rise illuminati project memo jm i wish you would explain to me how your interest in the numbers and fit in with this illuminati project this is all ive been able to unearth so far on the number mystery and i hope you find it enlightening its from a book of mathematical and logical paradoxes how to torture your mind edited by ralph l woods funk and wagnalls new york page and are even and odd and are therefore is both even and odd the damned book by the way provides no solutions to the paradoxes i could sense the fallacy in that one right away but it took me hours and a headache before i could state it in precise words hope this helps you anyway for me it was a relief from the really frightening stuff ive been tracking down lately pat there were two further memos in the box on different stationeries and by different typewriters the first was brief april research department i am seriously concerned about pats absence from the office and the fact that she doesnt answer the phone when we call her would you send somebody to her apartment to talk to the landlord and try to find out what has happened to her joe malik editor the last memo was the oldest in the lot and already yellowing at the edges it said dear mr mallory the information and books you requested are enclosed at length in case you are rushed here is a quick summary billy graham was in australia making public appearances all through last week there is no way he could have gotten to chicago satanism and witchcraft both still exist in the modern world the two are often confused by orthodox christian writers but objective observers agree that there is a difference satanism is a christian heresy the ultimate heresy one might say but witchcraft is prechristian in origin and has nothing to do with the christian god or the christian devil the witches worship a goddess called dana or tana who goes back to the stone age probably the john dillinger died for you society has its headquarters in mad dog texas but was founded in austin texas several years ago its some kind of pokerfaced joke and is affiliated with the bavarian illuminati another bizarre bunch at the berkeley campus of the university of california the illuminati pretend to be a cabal of conspirators who run the whole world behind the scenes if you suspect either of these groups of being involved in something sinister you have probably just fallen for one of their putons wh so this thing was already linked to mad dog several years ago saul said thoughtfully and malik was already assuming an alternative identity since the letter is obviously addressed to him and also as ive begun to suspect as we read this stuff the illuminati have their own brand of humor deduce me one more deduction barney said who the hell is this wh people have been asking that for three hundred years saul said absently huh im being whimsical shakespeares sonnets are dedicated to a mr wh but i dont think we have to worry that this is the same one this case is as nutty as asquirrels dinner but i dont really think its that nutty he added we can be grateful for one thing at least the illuminati doesnt really run the world theyre just trying barney frowned perplexed how did you make that one simple same way i know theyre a rightwing organization not leftwing were not all geniuses barney said take it a step at a time will you how many contradictions did you spot in these memos i counted thirteen this researcher pat saw it too the evidence is deliberately warped and twisted all of it not just that east village other chart is a mixture of fact and fiction saul lit his pipe and settled back in his chair in reading arthur conan doyle he first began playing these scenes in imagination in the first place either the illuminati want publicity or they dont if they control everything and want publicity theyd be on billboards more often than cocacola and on tv more often than lucille ball on the other hand if they control everything and dont want publicity none of these magazines and books would have survived they would have disappeared from libraries book stores and publishers warehouses this researcher pat never would have found them in the second place if you want to recruit people into a conspiracy besides idealism and whatever other noble motives you might exploit in them you would always exploit hope you would exaggerate the size and power of the conspiracy because most people want to join the winning side therefore all assertions about the actual strength of the illuminati should be regarded a fortiori as suspect like the voters polls released by candidates before elections finally it always pays to frighten the opposition therefore a conspiracy will exhibit the same behavior that ethnologists have observed in animals under attack it will puff itself up and try to look bigger in short potential or actual recruits and potential and actual enemies will both be given the same false impression that the illuminati is twice or ten times or a hundred times its actual size this is logical but my first point was empirical the memos do exist and therefore logic and empiricism confirm each other the illuminati are not able to control everything what then theyve been around a long time and they are as tireless as the russian mathematician who worked out pi to the onethousandth place the probability then is that they control some things and influence a hell of a lot more this probability increases as you think back over the memos the two chief arabic branches the hashishim and the roshinaya were both wiped out the italian illuminati were crushed in weishaupts order was suppressed by the bavarian government in and so forth if they were behind the french revolution they influenced rather than controlled because napoleon undid everything the jacobins started that they had a hand in both soviet communism and german fascism is plausible considering the many similarities between the two but if they controlled both why did the two take opposite sides in the second world war and if they ran both the federalist party through washington and the democratic republicans through jefferson what was the purpose of the aaron burr counterrevolution which they are also supposed to be behind the picture i get is not a grand puppet master moving everybody on invisible strings but some sort of millionarmed octopus a millepus lets call it constantly reaching out tentacles and often drawing back nothing but a bloody stump crying foiled again but the millepus is very busy and quite resourceful if it controlled the planet it could choose either operating in the open or retaining secrecy but since it doesnt have that omnipotence yet it must choose to be as anonymous as possible therefore many of its tentacles will be probing around in the areas of publication and communications it wants to know when somebody is investigating it or getting ready to publicize an investigation he has already completed finding such a person it then has two choices kill him or neutralize him killing may be resorted to in certain emergencies but will be avoided when possible you never know when a person of that sort has stashed extra copies of his documents in various unexpected places to be released in the event of his death neutralization is best almost always saul paused to relight his pipe and muldoon thought the most unrealistic aspect of doyles stories is watsons admiration at these moments im just irritated because he makes me feel like a chump for not seeing it myself go ahead he said gruffly saving his own deductions until saul was finished the best form of neutralization is recruitment of course but any crude and hurried effort at recruitment is known as taking your pants down in the espionage business because it makes you more vulnerable the safest approach is gradual recruitment disguised as something else the best disguise of course is the pretense of helping the subject in his investigation this also opens the second and preferable option which is leading him on a wild goose chase sending him looking for illuminati in organizations which they have never really infiltrated feeding him balderdash like that stuff about the illuminati coming from the planet vulcan or being descended from eve and the serpent best of all though is telling him the purpose of the conspiracy is something other than it actually is especially if the story you sell him is in keeping with his own ideals since this can then shade over into recruitment now the sources this pat unearthed mostly seem to come to one of two conclusions the illuminati doesnt exist anymore or the illuminati is virtually identical with russian communism the first i reject because malik and pat have both disappeared and two buildings one here in new york and one way down in mad dog have been bombed in a series palpably linked with an investigation of the illuminati youve already accepted that but the next step is just as obvious if the illuminati tries to distort whatever publicity cannot be avoided then we should look at the idea that the illuminati is communistoriented as skeptically as we look at the idea that they dont even exist so lets look at the opposite hypothesis could the illuminati be a farright or fascist group well if maliks information was in any way accurate they seem to have some kind of special headquarters or central office in mad dog and thats ku klux and gods lightning territory also whatever their history before adam weishaupt they seem to have gone through some reformation and revitalization under his leadership he was a german and an excatholic just like hitler one of his illuminated lodges survived long enough to recruit hitler in according to a memo that might be the most accurate one in the lot for all we know considering the proclivities of the german character weishaupt could likely be an antisemite most historians ive read on nazi germany agree to at least the possibility that there was a secret doctrine which only the top nazis shared among themselves and didnt tell the rest of the party that doctrine might be pure illuminism take up the many links between illuminism and freemasonry and the known anticatholicism of the masonic movement add in the fact that excatholics are frequently bitter against the church and both weishaupt and hitler were excatholicsand we get a hypothetical antijewish anticatholic semimystical doctrine that would sell equally well in germany and in parts of america finally while some leftextremists might want to kill the kennedys and reverend king all three were more likely targets for rightwingers and the kennedys would be especially abhorrent to anticatholic rightists a last point saul said consider the leftwing orientation of confrontation the editor malik would probably not give much credence to most of the sources quoted in the memos since the majority are from rightist publications and most of them allege that the illuminati is a leftist plot his most probable reaction would be to dismiss this as another rightwing paranoia unless he had other sources besides his own research department notice how cagey he is he doesnt tell his associate editor peter jackson anything about the illuminati itself just that he wants a new investigation of the last decades assassinations the bottom memo is so old and yellow it suggests he got his first clue several years ago but didnt act pat asks him why hes hiding all this from the reporter george dorn finally he disappears he was getting information from some place else and it revealed a plot he could believe in and really fear that would probably be a fascist plot anticatholic antijewish and antinegro muldoon grinned for once i dont have to play watson he thought brilliant he said you never cease to amaze me saul would you glance at this though and tell me how it fits in he handed over a piece of paper i found it in a book on maliks bedside table the paper was a brief scrawl in the same handwriting as the occasional jottings on the bottoms of pats memos pres garfield killed by charles guiteau a roman catholic pres mckinley ditto by leon czolgosz a roman catholic pres theodore roosevelt attempted assassination by john shrank a roman catholic pres franklin roosevelt attempted assassination by giuseppe zangara a roman catholic pres harry truman attempted assassination by griselio torresola and oscar collazo two roman catholics pres woodrow wilson somewhat mysterious death while tended by a roman catholic nurse pres warren harding another mysterious death one rumor it was suicide also attended by a catholic nurse pres john kennedy assassination inadequately explained head of cia then was john mccone a roman catholic who helped write the inconclusive and contradictory warren report house of representatives march five congressmen wounded by lebronmirandacoderorodriguez assassination squad all roman catholics when saul looked up barney said pleasantly i found it in a book like i said the book was romes responsibility for the assassination of abraham lincoln by general thomas m harris harris points out that john wilkes booth the suratt family and all the other conspirators were catholics and argues they are acting under orders from the jesuits barney paused to enjoy sauls expression and went on it occurs to me that using your principle that most of the memos are full of false leads we might question the idea that the illuminati uses the masons as a front to gather recruits they would probably need some similar organization though one that exists all over the world has mysterious rites and secrets inner orders to which a select few are recruited and a pyramidal authoritarian structure compelling everybody to take commands from above whether they understand them or not one such organization is the roman catholic church saul picked up his pipe from the floor he didnt seem to remember having dropped it my turn to say brilliant he murmured finally are you going to stop going to mass on sunday do you really believe it muldoon laughed after twenty years he said i finally did it i got one jump ahead of you saul you were standing facetoface with the truth eyeballtoeyeball nosetonose mouthtomouth but you were so close that your eyes crossed and you saw it backward no its not the catholic church you made a good guess in saying it was anticatholic as well as antijewish and antinegro but its inside the catholic church and always has been in fact the churchs efforts to root it out have given holy mother rome a very unfortunate reputation for paranoia and hysteria its agents make a special effort to enter the priesthood in order to obtain holy objects for use in their own bizarre rites they also try to rise as high in the church as they can to destroy it from within many times they have recruited and corrupted whole parishes whole orders of clergy even whole provinces they probably got to weishaupt when he was still a jesuit theyve infiltrated that order several times in history and the dominicans even more if caught in criminal acts they make sure that their cover catholicism and not their true faith is publicized just like this list of assassins their god is called the lightbearer and thats probably where the word illumination comes from and malik asked about them a long time ago and was told by this wh quite correctly that they still exist im talking about the satanists of course of course saul repeated softly of course that pentagon that keeps popping up its the middle of the pentacle for summoning the devil fascism is only their political facet basically theyre a theology or an antitheology i guess but what in hell literally in hell is their ultimate objective then dont ask me barney shrugged i can follow my brother when he talks about the history of satanism but not when he tries to explain its motivations he uses technical theological terms about immanentizing the eschaton but all i can understand is that it has something to do with bringing on the end of the world saul turned ashen barney he cried my god fernando poo but that was settled thats just it their usual technique of the false front the real threat is coming from somewhere else and they mean to do it this time muldoon shook his head but they must be crazy everybody is crazy saul said patiently if you dont understand his motives he held up his tie imagine you arrive in a flying saucer from mars or from vulcan like the illuminati did according to one of our allegedly reliable sources you see me get up this morning and for no clear reason wrap this cloth around my neck in spite of the heat what explanation can you think of im a fetishist a nut in other words most human behavior is that sort not oriented to survival but some symbolsystem that people believe in long hair short hair fish on friday no pork rising when the judge enters the room all symbols symbols symbols sure the illuminati are crazy from our point of view from their point of view were crazy if we can find out what they believe what their symbols mean to them well understand why they want to kill most of the rest of us or all of the rest of us barney call your brother get him out of bed i want to find out more about satanism the devil the president shouted on march nuclear war over an insignificant place like fernando poo you must be mental the american people are tired of our army policing the whole world let equatorial guinea fish its own nuts out of the troubled waters or whatever that expression is wait said the director of the cia let me show you these aerial photographs back at the watergate g gordon liddy carefully aims his pistol and shoots out the streetlight in memory he is in an old castle at millbrook new york eagerly searching for naked women and not finding any beside him professor timothy leary is saying with maddening serenity but science is the most ecstatic kick of all the intelligence of the galaxy is revealed in every atom every gene every cell well get him back liddy thinks savagely if we have to assassinate the whole swiss government that man is not going to remain free beside him bernard barker shifts nervously as in rightangular time a future president metamorphoses the plumbers into the cesspool cleaners but now inside the watergate the illuminati bug is unnoticed by those planting the creep bug although both were subsequently found by the technicians installing the bugger bug its the same intelligence making endlessly meaningful patterns dr leary goes on enthusiastically here kittykitty hagbard repeats for the th time the devil father james augustine muldoon repeated well thats a very complicated story do you want me to go all the way back to gnosticism saul listening on the extension phone nodded a vigorous affirmative go as far back as you have to barney said this is a complicated matter were trying to untangle here ok ill try to remember youre not in my theology class at fordham and keep this as brief as i can the priests voice faded then came back probably he was shifting the phone as he got out of bed and moved to a chair saul guessed there were many approaches to gnosticism the voice went on in a moment all of them centered on gnosisdirect experience of god as distinguished from mere knowledge about god the search for gnosis or illumination as it was sometimes called took many odd forms some of them probably similar to oriental yogas and some of them using the very same drugs that modern rebels against the slow path of orthodox religion have rediscovered naturally with such a variety of paths to gnosis different pilots would land at different ports each insisting he had found the real new jerusalem mystics are all a bit funny in the head anyway the priest added cynically which is why the church locks them all up in mental hospitals and euphemistically calls these institutions monasteries but i digress what youre interested in i guess is cainism and manicheanisra the former regarded cain as a specially holy figure because he was the first murderer you have to be a mystic yourself to understand that kind of logic the notion was that by bringing murder into the world cain created an opportunity for people to renounce murder but then other cainites went further paradox always seems to breed more paradox and heresy creates more heresy and ended up glorifying murder along with all the other sins the credo was that you should commit every sin possible just to give yourself a chance to win a really difficult redemption after repenting also it gave god a chance to be especially generous when he forgave you related ideas popped up in tantric buddhism about the same time and its a great historical mystery which group of lunatics east or west was influencing the other does any of this help you so far a bit barney said about this gnosis saul asked is it the orthodox theological position that the illuminations or visions were actually coming from the devil and not from god yes thats where manicheanism enters the picture father muldoon said the manicheans made exactly the same charge against the orthodox church according to their way of looking at it the god of orthodox christianity and orthodox judaism was the devil the god they contacted through their own peculiar rites was the real god this of course is still the teaching of satanists today and saul asked begining to intuit what the answer would be what has all this to do with atomic energy with atomic energy nothing at allat least nothing that i can see why is satan called the lightbringer saul plunged on convinced he was on the right track the manicheans reject the physical universe the priest said slowly they say that the true god their god would never lower himself to mess around with matter the god who created the world our god jehovah they call panurgia which has the connotations of a kind of blind stupid blundering force rather than a truly intelligent being the realm which their god inhabits is pure spirit of pure light hence he is called the lightbringer and this universe is always called the realm of darkness but they didnt know about atomic energy in those days did they the last sentence had started as a statement and ended as a question thats what im wondering saul said atomic power releases a lot of light doesnt it and it sure would immanentize the eschaton if enough atomic power was unleashed at once wouldnt it fernando poo the priest exclaimed is this connected with fernando poo im beginning to think so saul said im also beginning to think weve stayed in one place a long time using a phone that is almost certainly tapped we better get moving thanks father youre quite welcome although im sure i dont know what youre getting at the priest said if you think satanists control the united states government a few priests would agree with you especially the berrigan brothers but i dont see how this can be a police matter does the new york police department now maintain a bureau of holy inquisitions dont mind him barney said softly hes very cynical about dogma like most clergymen these days i heard that the priest said i may be cynical but i really dont think satanism is a joking matter and your friends theory is very plausible in its way after all the satanists motive in infiltrating the church in the old days was to disgrace the institution thought to represent god on earth now that the united states government makes the same claim well that may be a joke or a paradox on my part but its the way their minds work too i am a professional cynic a theologian must be these days if he isnt going to seem a total fool to young people with their skeptical minds but im orthodox or downright reactionary about the inquisitions ive read all the rationalist historians of course and there was certainly an element of hysteria in the church in those days but still satanism is not any less frightening than cancer or plague it is totally inimical to human life and in fact to all life the church had good reasons to be afraid of it just as people who are old enough to remember have good reasons to be panicky at any hint of a revival of hitlerism saul thought of the cryptic evasive phrases in eliphas levy the monstrous gnosis of manes the cultus of material fire and nearly ten years ago the hippies gathered at the pentagon hanging flowers on the mps rifles chanting out demon out hiroshima the white light of the void wait saul said is there more to it than just ideas about killing isnt killing a mystical experience to the satanists of course the priest replied thats the whole point they want gnosis personal experience not dogma which is somebody elses word rationalists are always attacking dogma for causing fanaticism but the worst fanatics start from gnosis modern psychologists are just beginning to understand some of this you know how people in explosive grouptherapy sessions talk about sudden bursts of energy occurring in the whole group at once one can get the same effect with dancing and drumbeating thats what is called a primitive religion use drugs nowadays and youre a hippie do it with sex and youre a witch or one of the knights templar mass participation in an animal sacrifice has the same effect human sacrifice has been used in many religions including the aztec cult everybody has heard about as well as in satanism modern psychologists say that the force released is freuds libidinal energy mystics call it prajna or the astral light whatever it is human sacrifice seems to release more of it than sex or drugs or dancing or drumbeating or any less violent method and mass human sacrifice unleashes a ton of it now do you understand why i fear satanism and half apologize for the inquisition yes saul said absently and im beginning to share your fear a song he hated was pounding inside his skull wenn das judenblut vom messer spritz he realized that he was holding the phone and seeing scenes forty years ago in another country he jerked himself back to attention as muldoon thanked his brother again and hung up saul raised his eyes and the two detectives exchanged glances of mutual dread after a long pause muldoon said we cant trust anybody with this we can hardly even trust each other before saul could answer the phone rang it was danny pricefixer at headquarters bad news there was only one girl in research at confrontation named pat patricia walsh to be exact and i know saul said wearily shes disappeared too what are you going to do now the fbi is still raising hell and demanding to know where you two are and the commissioner is having the shits the fits and the blind staggers tell them saul said succinctly that weve disappeared he hung up carefully and began stuffing the memos back into the box what now muldoon asked we go underground and we stick to this until we crack it or it kills us how long is this motherfucker george asked gesturing at the danube six stories below he and stella were in their room at the donau hotel you wont believe me stella replied smiling its exactly one thousand seven hundred and seventysix miles in length onesevensevensix george the same as the date weishaupt revived the illuminati exactly stella grinned we keep telling you synchronicity is as universal as gravity when you start looking you find it everywhere heres the money banananose maldonado said generously opening a briefcase full of crisp new bills it is now november they were meeting on a bench near cleopatras needle in central park the younger man however is nervous i want to tell you that my superior is very pleased this will definitely decrease bobbys power in the justice department and stop a lot of annoying investigations the younger man ben volpe gulps look mr maldonado theres something ive got to tell you i know how the brotherhood is when somebody fucks up and hides it you didnt fuck up banananose says bewildered in fact you lucked out amazingly that schmuck oswald is going to fry for it he came along at just the right time it was a real fortuna jesus mary and joseph banananose sits up straight as the thought hits him you mean you mean did oswald really do it did he shoot before you no no volpe is miserable let me explain it as clearly as i can im there on top of the dallas county records building like we planned see the motorcade turns onto elm and heads for the underpass i use my magnifying sight swinging the whole gun around to look through it just to make one last check that i have all the feds spotted when i face the school book depository i catch this rifle that was oswald i guess then i check out the grassy knoll and goddam theres another cat with a rifle i just went cold i couldnt figure it out while im in this state like a zombie a dog barks and just then the guy in the grassy knoll calm and cool as if he was at a shooting range lays three of them right into the car thats it volpe ends miserably i cant take the money the brotherhood would have my ass if they ever found out the truth maldonado sat silently rubbing his famous nose as he did when making a hard decision youre a good boy bennie i give you ten percent of the money just for being honest we need more honest young boys like you in the brotherhood volpe swallowed again and said theres one more thing i oughta tell you i went down to the grassy knoll after the cops run from there to the school book depository i thought i might find the guy who did the shooting still hanging around and tell you what he looked like he was long gone though but heres what so spooky i ran into another galoot who was sneaking down from the triple underpass long skinny guy with buck teeth kind of reminded me of a python or some kind of snake he just looks at me and my umbrella and guesses whats in it his mouth falls open jesus christ and his black bastard brother harry he says how the fuck many people does it take to kill a president these days and theyre teaching them about perversions as well smiling jim was building toward his climax homosexuality and lesbianism are being taught in our schools and were paying for it out of our tax money now is that communism or isnt it welcome to the playboy club the beautiful blonde said im your bunny virgin saul took his seat in the dark wondering if he had heard correctly virgin was an odd name for a bunny perhaps she had actually said virginia yes virginia there is a santa claus how do you wish your steak sir the bunny was asking a stake through the heart for a vampire medium well saul said wondering why his mind was wandering in such odd directions odd erections somebody said in the nearby dark or was it a distorted echo of his own voice medium well the bunny repeated seemingly speaking to the wall a medium wall saul thought immediately the wall opened and saul was looking into a combination kitchen and butcher shop a steer was standing not five feet from him but before he could recover from this shock a male figure stripped to the waist and wearing the hood of a medieval executioner caught his attention with one stroke of a huge hammer this figure knocked the steer unconscious and it fell to the floor with a crash immediately the executioner produced an axe and chopped its head off blood gushed in a crimson pool from its neck the wall closed and saul had the terrifying feeling that the whole scene had been a hallucination that he was losing his mind all our lunches are educational today the bunny said in his ear we believe every customer should understand fully whats on the end of his fork and how it got there before he takes a bite good god saul said getting to his feet this wasnt a playboy club it was some den of lunatics and sadists he stumbled toward the door no way out a man at another table said softly as he passed saul saul the maitre d murmured politely why dost thou persecute me hab rochmunas its a drug saul said thickly youve given me a drug of course that was it something like mescaline or lsdand they were guiding his hallucinations by providing proper stimuli perhaps they were even faking some of the hallucinations but how had he fallen into their hands the last thing he remembered he was in joe maliks apartment with barney muldoon no there was a voice saying now sister victoria as they came out the door onto riverside drive no man should marry a woman more than thirty years younger than himself the maitre d said mournfully how did they know about that had they investigated his whole life how long had they held him im getting out of here he shouted pushing the maitre d aside and bolting for the door hands grasped for him and missed they werent really trying he realized he was being allowed to reach the door when he plunged through the doorway he realized why he was not on the street but in another room this was the next ordeal a rectangle of light appeared on the wall somewhere in the darkness there was a projector a card light an old silentmovie caption appeared in the rectangle it said all jew girls like to ball with buck niggers sons of bitches saul shouted back at them they were still working on his feelings about rebecca well that would get them nowhere he had ample reason to trust her devotion to him especially her sexual devotion the card moved out of the rectangle and a picture appeared in its place it was rebeccas in her nightgown kneeling before her stood a naked and enormous black man six feet six at least with an equally impressive penis which she held sensuously in her mouth her eyes were closed in bliss like a baby nursing motherfuckers saul screamed its a fake thats not rebecca its an actress with makeup you forgot the mole on her hip they could drug his senses but not his mind there was a nasty laugh in the darkness try this one saul a voice said coldly a new picture slid into view adolph hitler in full nazi uniform and a naked rebecca backing up to him taking his penis in her rectum her face showed both pain and pleasure and the mole on her hip was visible another fake rebecca was born years after hitler died but they hadnt produced the slide in the thirty seconds after his shout and that meant they knew her body intimately and they also knew how skeptical and quick his mind was and were prepared to administer a series of jolts until something got past his ability to doubt no comment the voice asked mockingly i dont believe a man who died thirty years ago would be buggering any woman today saul said dryly your tricks are kind of corny sometimes with the vulgar we must communicate vulgarly the voice replied and it was almost gentle and pitying this time a new picture appeared and this time without doubt it was rebecca but it was rebecca three years ago when he first met her she sat at a table in a cheap east village pad wearing the emaciated and selfpitying look he remembered from those days and she was preparing to inject a needle in her arm it was the real thing but the terror was in its implications they had been watching him that long ago perhaps it was hard to date the picture precisely although he remembered her apartment in those days they even knew he would fall in love with her before he knew it himself no more likely a friend of hers in those days had taken the picture and they had somehow found it when they became interested in him their resources must be fantastic a new card came on the screen once a junkie always a junkie a new picture quickly followed rebecca as she looked today sitting in his kitchen with the new cafe curtains they had just hung last week once again injecting a needle into her arm youre the vulgar ones o mighty illuminati saul said caustically i would have noticed the tracks on her arm if she was shooting up again the answer was nonverbal the picture of rebecca and the giant black man came back on the screen and was immediately followed by a closeup of her face eyes closed mouth open receiving the penis it was in perfect focus the work of an artist with the camera and he could see no sign of any makeup that would help another woman to pass as rebecca he held to his memory that the mole on her hip was missing but perversely his mind tasted at last the other possibility makeup can change a face and it can also hide a mole if they wanted him to use his skepticism so that they could gradually destroy that and in the process undermine his total psyche another sign came on the screen that we can call these delicate creatures ours but not their appetites saul remembered all too well rebeccas passion in bed shakespeare he called hoarsely advertising your erudition at a time like this is worse than vulgarity its petitbourgeois pretentiousness the answer was brutal a whole series of slides maybe fifteen or twenty in all cascaded across the screen in such rapid succession that he couldnt examine them carefully except that the central character was rebecca always rebecca rebecca with the black giant in other sexual positions rebecca with another woman rebecca with spiro agnew rebecca with a little sevenyearold boy rebecca rebecca in a rising crescendo of perversion and abnormality rebecca with a saint bernard dog and a peppermintcolored sinewave part of the drug still working on him cutting across the scene the true sadist has style saul gasped fighting for control of his voice you people are about as evil and frightening as a bad bmovie there was a whirring mechanical sound and a movie began in place of the slides it was rebecca and the saint bernard with several closeups and her expressions were the ones he knew could any actress portray another womans individual style of sexual response yes if necessary these people would use hypnosis to get the effect letterperfect the movie stopped abruptly and the projector had another message for him held on the screen for minutes only the madman is absolutely sure when he realized that there would be no further progress until he spoke saul said coldly very entertaining where do i go to crumble into a bundle of neuroses there was no answer no sound nothing happened he halfsaw a latticework of red pentagons but that was the drug and it helped identify which drug for geometric patterns were characteristic of the mescaline experience as he considered that the peppermint sinewaves appeared before the pentagons and the screen gave him a new message how much is the drug how much is our trickery how much is reality suddenly saul was in copenhagen on a cruise boat passing the mermaid of the harbor she turned and looked at him this case is fishy she said and as she opened her mouth a school of guppies swam out im a mouthbreeder she explained saul had a reproduction of that famous statue in his home which must be the source of the hallucination yet he was strangely disturbed her punning words seemed to conceal a deeper meaning than mere casual references to the confrontation bombing something that went back back through his whole life and explained why he had purchased the statue in the first place im about to have one of those famous drug insights that hippies always talk about he thought but the mermaid broke apart into pentagons of red orange yellow and a unicorn winked at him man it said am i ever horny those sketches i made the other day saul thought but the screen asked him is the thought of a unicorn a real thought and he suddenly understood for the first time what the words a real thought meant what hegel meant by defining the absolute idea as pure thought thinking about pure thought what bishop berkeley meant by denying the reality of the physical world in seeming contradiction of all human experience and common sense what every detective was secretly attempting to detect although it was always right out in the open why he became a detective in the first place why the universe itself became why everything and then he forgot it caught a fleeting glimpse of it again it had something to do with the eye at the top of the pyramid and lost it again in visions of unicorns stallions zebras bars bars bars now his whole visual field was hallucinatory octagons triangles pyramids organic shapes of embryos and growing ferns the drug was taking stronger hold on him criminals he had sent to jail appeared sullen hating faces and the screen said goodman is a bad man he laughed to keep from crying they had touched his deepest doubt about his job his career his lifes work precisely at the time the drug also was leading him there with those damnable accusing faces it was as if they could read his mind and see his hallucinations no it was just one lucky coincidence because among all their tricks one was statistically likely to occur in tandem with an appropriate drug experience while there is a soul in prison i am not free saul laughed again more wildly almost hysterically and knew even more clearly than before the tears hiding behind the laughter prisons reform nobody my life is wasted i offer society a delusion of security but not a real service worse yet i have known it for years and lied to myself the sense of total failure and utter bitterness that washed over saul at that moment was he knew not produced but only magnified by the drug it had been with him a long long time but always pushed aside brushed away from his attention by concentrating on something else the drug merely allowed him forced him to look at the emotion honestly and totally for a few wrenching moments a doorway suddenly lit up toward his right and a neon light came on above it saying absolution and redemption ok he said icily ill play the next move he opened the door the room was tiny but furnished like the worlds most expensive brothel above the four poster bed was an illustration of alice and a mushroom labeled eat me and on the bed stripped of her playboy costume pinkly and beautifully naked with legs spread in anticipation was the blonde bunny good evening she said speaking rapidly and fixing his eyes with her own stare im your virgin bunny every man wants a virgin bunny to eat on easter to celebrate the miracle of the resurrection do you understand the miracle of the resurrection sir do you know that nothing is true and everything is permissible and that a man who dares to break the robot conditioning of society and commit adultery dies in the moment of orgasm with his whore and wakes resurrected to a new life did they teach you that in shule or did they just fill you with a lot of monogamous yiddish horseshit most hypnotists spoke slowly but she was obtaining the same effect by talking rapidly you thought you were going to eat a dead animal which is disgusting even if this crazy society accepts it as normal but instead youre going to eat a desirable woman and fuck her afterward which is normal even if this crazy society thinks of it as disgusting you are one of the illuminated saul but you never knew it tonight you are going to learn you are going to find your real self as you were before your mother and father conceived you and im not talking about reincarnation im talking about something much more marvelous saul found his voice your offer is appreciated but declined he said frankly i find your tawdry mysticism even more adolescent than your sentimental vegetarianism and coarse lasciviousness the trouble with the illuminati is that you have no sense of true drama and not even a patina of subtlety her eyes widened as he spoke but not with surprise at his resistance either she was really alarmed and sorry for him or she was a great actress too bad she said sadly youve refused heaven so you must travel the harder path through the halls of hell saul heard a movement behind him but before he could turn a sharp sensation pricked his neck a needle another drug just as he was guessing they had given him a stronger psychedelic to escalate the effect he felt consciousness slipping away it was a narcotic or a poison the wagon started with a jerk we were off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of arse what was it hagbard had said to me the first time we met about straight lines courtrooms and shit i couldnt remember my mind drifted joseph k opening the law books and finding pornographic illustrations kafka knew where it was at desade keeping a precise mathematical tally in the brothel how many

drake screams lies lies lies its all lies nobody tells the truth nobody says what he thinks his voice trails off go on dr besetzung says you were doing fine dont stop what the use drake replies drained of anger turning on the couch to look at the psychiatrist to you this is just abreaction or actingout or something clinical you cant believe im right perhaps i can perhaps i agree more than you realize the doctor looks up from his pad and meets drakes eye are you sure youre not just assuming ill react like everybody else youve tried to tell this to if you agreed with me drake says carefully if you understood what im really saying youd either be the head of a bank out there in the jungle with my father grabbing your own share of the loot or youd be a bombthrowing revolutionary like those sacco and vanzetti fellows those are the only choices that make sense the only choices one must go to one extreme or the other drake looks back at the ceiling and talks abstractly you had to get an md long ago before you specialized do you know any case where germs gave up and went away because the man they were destroying had a noble character or sweet sentiments did the tuberculosis bacilli leave john keats lungs because he had a few hundred great poems still unwritten inside him you must have read some history even if you were never at the front lines like me do you recall any battle that refutes napoleons aphorism about god always being on the side of the biggest cannons and the best tacticians this bolshie in russia lenin he has ordered the schools to teach chess to everybody you know why he says that chess teaches the lesson that revolutionaries must learn that if you dont mobilize your forces properly you lose no matter how high your morality no matter how lofty your goal fight without mercy use every ounce of intelligence or you lose my father understands that the people who run the world have always understood it a general who doesnt understand it gets broken back to second lieutenant or worse i saw a whole platoon wiped out exterminated like an anthill under a boot not because they were immoral or naughty or didnt believe in jesus because at that place on that day the germans had superior fire power thats the law the one true law of the universe and everything that contradicts it everything they teach in schools and churches is a lie he says the word listlessly now just a lie if you really believe that the doctor asks why do you still have the nightmares and the insomnia drakes blue eyes stare at the ceiling i dont know he says finally thats why im here moon simon the desk sergeant called i stepped forward seeing myself through his eyes beard army surplus clothes stains all over my own mucus somebody elses vomit the archetypical filthy dirty disgusting hippiecommie revolutionary well he said another bright red rose i usually look neater i told him calmly you get a bit messed over when youre arrested in this town the only way you get arrested in this town he said frowning is if you break the laws the only way you get arrested in russia is you break the laws i replied cheerfully or by mistake i added that didnt set well at all wise guy he said gently we like wise guys here he consulted my chargeslip nice record for one night moon rioting mob action assaulting an officer resisting arrest disturbing the peace nice i wasnt disturbing the peace i said i was disturbing the war i stole that oneliner from ammon hennacy a catholic anarchist that mom was always quoting the rest of the charges are all bullshit too say i know you he said suddenly youre tim moons son well well well a secondgeneration anarchist i guess well be locking you up as often as we locked him up i guess so i said at least until the revolution afterward we wont be locking you up though were going to establish nice camps in places like wisconsin and send you there free to learn a useful trade we believe that all policemen and politicians can be rehabilitated but if you dont want to go to the camp and learn a productive trade you dont have to you can live on welfare well well well he said just like your old man i suppose if i looked the other way while some of the boys took you in back and worked you over a bit youd come out still making wisecracks im afraid so i smiled irish national character you know we see the funny side of everything well he said thoughtfully he was awfully fond of that word i hope you can see the funny side of what comes next youre going to be arraigned before judge bushman youll find yourself wishing you had fallen into a buzz saw instead give my regards to your father tell him jim omalley says hello hes dead i said he looked down at his chargeslips sorry to hear it he mumbled nanetti fred he bawled and the kid with the broken arm came forward a patrolman led me to the fingerprint room this guy was a computer right hand i gave him my right hand left hand i gave him my left hand follow the officer i followed the officer and they took my picture we went down some halls to the night court and in a lonely section the patrolman suddenly hit me in the lower back with his club the exact spot he knew his business to give me liver problems for a month i grunted but refused to say anything that would set him off and get me another clout so he spoke yellowbellied faggot he said just like biloxi mississippi one cop is nice another is just impersonal a third is a mean bastard and it doesnt really matter theyre all part of the same machine and what comes out the end of the gears and levers is the same product whatever their attitude is im sure buchenwald was the same some of the guards tried to be as humane as possible some of them just did their job some of them went out of their way to make it worse for the prisoners it doesnt matter the machine produces the effect it was designed for judge bushman we slipped him aum two years later but thats another story coming up on another trip gave me his famous king kong scowl here are the rules he said this is an arraignment you can enter a plea or stand mute if you enter a plea you retain the right to change it at your trial when i set bond you can be released by paying ten percent to the bailiff cash only no checks if you dont have the cash you go to jail overnight you people have the city tied up in knots and the bail bondsmen are too busy to cover every courtroom so by sheer bad luck you landed in a courtroom theyre not covering he turned to the bailiff charge sheet he said he read the record of my criminal career as concocted by the arresting officer five offenses in one night youre bad medicine arent you moon trial set for september fifteenth bail will be ten thousand dollars do you have one thousand dollars no i told him wondering how many times hed made that speech tonight just a moment said hagbard materializing out of the hallway i can make bail for this man mr kharis does mr celine seriously suggest that the united states government is in need of a guardian mr celine i am merely offering a way out for your client any private individual with a record of such incessant murder and robbery would be glad to cop an insanity plea do you insist that your client was in full possession of its reason at wounded knee at hiroshima at dresden justice immhotep you become facetious mr celine mr celine i have never been more serious what is your relationship to this young man bushman asked angrily he had been about to come when the cop dragged me off to jail and he was strangling in some kind of gruesome sm equivalent of coitus interruptus hes my wife hagbard said calmly what commonlaw wife hagbard went on homosexual marriage is not recognized in illinois but homosexuality per se isnt a crime in this state either so dont try to make waves your honor let me pay and take him home it was too much daddy i said camping like our friend the padre youre so masterful judge bushman looked like he wanted to lay hagbard out with a gavel upside of his head but he controlled himself count the money he told the bailiff make sure he pays every penny and then he told us i want the two of you out of this courtroom as quickly as possible ill see you september fifteenth he added to me mr kharis and we believe we have demonstrated the necessity of this dam we believe we have shown that the doctrine of eminent domain is on sure constitutional grounds and has been held to apply in numerous similar cases we believe we have shown that the resettlement plan offered by the government will be no hardship for the plaintiffs fuckin faggots the cop said as we went out the door all hail discordia i told him cheerfully lets get out of this neighborhood i added to hagbard my car is right here he said pointing to a goddam mercedes for an anarchist you sure live a lot like a capitalist i commented as we got into that beautiful machine crystallized out of stolen labor and surplus value im not a masochist hagbard replied the world makes me uncomfortable enough i see no reason to make myself more uncomfortable and im damned if ill drive a brokendown jalopy that spends half its time in a garage being repaired merely because that would make me seem more dedicated to you leftwing simpletons besides he added practically the police never stop a mercedes and search it how many times a week do you get stopped and harassed with your beard and your psychedelic slaveswagon you damned moralist often enough i admitted that im afraid to transport dope in it this car is full of dope he said blithely im making a big delivery to a dealer up in evanston on the northwestern campus tomorrow youre in the dope business too im in every illegal business every time a government declares something verboten two groups move in to service the black market created the mafia and the ldd that stands for lawless delicacy dealers i thought it stood for little deluded dupes he laughed score one for moon seriously im the worst enemy governments have and the best protection for the average person the mafia has no ethics you know if it wasnt for my group and our years and years of experience everything on the black market from dope to canadian furs would be shoddy and unreliable we always give the customer his or her moneys worth half the dope you sell probably has passed through my agents on its way to you the better half what was that homosexual business just buggin old bushman entropy breaking the straight line into a curve ball hagbard i said what the hell is your game proving that government is a hallucination in the minds of governors he said crisply we turned onto lake shore drive and sped north thou jubela did he tell you the word asked the goatheaded man the gigantic black said i beat him and tortured him but he would not reveal the word thou jubelo did he tell you the word the fishlike creature said i tormented and vexed his inner spirit master but he would not reveal the word and thou jubelum did he tell you the word the hunchbacked dwarf said i cut off his testicles and he was mute i cut off his penis and he was mute he did not tell me the word a fanatic the goathead said it is better that he is dead saul goodman tried to move he couldnt twitch a single muscle that last drug had been a narcotic and a powerful one or was it a poison he tried to assure himself that the reason he was paralyzed and laying in a coffin was because they were trying to break down his mind but he wondered if the dead might tell themselves similar fables as they struggled to escape from the body before it rotted as he wondered the goathead leaned over and closed the top of the coffin saul was alone in darkness leave first jubela yes master leave next jubelo yes master leave last jubelum yes master silence it was lonely and dark in the coffin and saul couldnt move let me not go mad he thought howard spotted the lief erikson ahead and sang oh groovy groovy groovy sceneonce again ill meet celine maldonados sleek bentley edged up the drive to the home of americas bestknown financierphilanthropist robert putney drake louis marched toward the red widow maintaining his dignity an old man in a strange robe pushed to the front of the crowd trembling with exaltation the blade rose the mob sucked in its breath the old man tried to look into louiss eyes but the king could not focus them the blade fell the crowd exhaled as the head rolled into the basket the old man raised his eyes in ecstasy and cried out jacques de molay thou art avenged professor glynn lectured his class on medieval history dean deane was issuing the strawberry statement on the same campus at the same time and said the real crime of the templars however was probably their association with the hashishim george dorn hardly listening wondered if he should join mark rudd and the others who wanted to close down columbia entirely and modern novels are the same smiling jim went on sex sex sex and not normal sex even every type of perverted degenerate unnatural filthy deviated and sick kind of sex this is how theyre gonna bury us as mr khruschchev said without even firing a shot sunlight awakened saul goodman sunlight and a headache a hangover from the combination of drugs he was in a bed and his clothes were gone there was no mistaking the garment he wore a hospital gown and the room as he squinted against the sun had the dull modernpenitentiary look of a typical american hospital he hadnt heard the door open but a weatheredlooking middleaged man in a doctors smock drifted into the room he was carrying a clipboard pens stuck their necks out of his smock pocket he smiled benignly his horn rimmed heavily black glasses and crewcut marked him as the optimistic upwardmobile man of his generation without either the depressionworld war ii memories that gave anxiety to sauls contemporaries or nuclear nightmares that gave rage and alienation to youth he would obviously think of himself as a liberal and vote conservatively at least half the time a hopeless schmuck except that he was probably none of those things but another of their agents doing a very convincing performance well he said brightly feeling better mr muldoon muldoon saul thought here we go another ride into their kitsch idea of the heart of darkness my name is goodman he said thinly im about as irish as moishe dayan oh still playing that little game are we the man spoke kindly and are you still a detective go to hell saul said no longer in mood to fight back with wit and irony he would dig into his hostility and make his last stand from a foxhole of bitterness and sullen brevity the man pulled up a chair and sat down actually he said these remaining symptoms dont bother us much you were in a much worse state when you were first brought here six months ago i doubt that you remember that electroshock mercifully removes a great deal of the near past which is helpful in cases like yours do you know that you were physically assaulting people on the street and tried to attack the nurses and orderlies your first month here your paranoia was very acute at that point mr muldoon up yours bubi saul said he closed his eyes and turned the other way such moderate hostility these days the man went on bright as a bird in the morning grass a few months ago you would have tried to strangle me let me show you something there was a sound of paper curiosity defeated resistance saul turned and looked the man held out a drivers license from the state of new jersey for barney muldoon the picture was sauls saul grinned maliciously showing his disbelief you refuse to recognize yourself the man asked quietly where is barney muldoon saul shot back do you have him in another room trying to convince him hes saul goodman where is the doctor repeated seeming genuinely baffled oh yes you admit you know the name but claim he was only a friend just like a rapist we had in here a while ago he said all the rapes were committed by his roommate charlie well lets try another tack all those people you beat up on the street and that playboy club bunny you tried to strangle do you still believe they were agents of this um prussian illuminati this is an improvement saul said a very intriguing combination of reality and fantasy much better than your groups previous efforts let me hear the rest of it you think thats sarcasm the man said calmly actually behind it your recovery is proceeding nicely you really want to remember even as you struggle to keep up this goodman myth very well you are a sixtyyearold police officer from trenton new jersey you never were promoted to detective and that is the great grievance of your life you have a wife named molly and three sons roger kerry and gregory their ages are twentyeight twentyfive and twentythree a few years ago you started a game with your wife she thought it was harmless at first and learned to her sorrow that it wasnt the game was that you pretended to be a detective and late at night you would tell her about the important cases you were working on gradually you built up to the most important case of all the solution to all the assassinations in america during the past decade they were all the work of a group called the illuminati who were surviving toplevel nazis that had never been captured more and more you talked about their leadermartin borman of course and insisted you were getting a line on his whereabouts by the time your wife realized that the game had become reality to you it was too late you already suspected your neighbors of being illuminati agents and your hatred for nazism led you to believe you were jewish and had taken an irish name to avoid american antisemitism this particular delusion i must say caused you acute guilt which it took us a long time to understand it was we finally realized a projection of a guilt you have long felt for being a policeman at all but perhaps at this point i might aid your struggle for selfrecognition and abort your equal and opposite struggle for selfescape by reading you part of a report on your case by one of our younger psychiatrists are you game to hear it go ahead saul said i still find this entertaining the man looked through the papers in his clipboard and smiled disarmingly oh i see here that its the bavarian illuminati not the prussian illuminati pardon my mistake he flipped a few more pages here we are he said the root of the subjects problems he began to read can be found in the trauma of the primal scene which was reconstructed under narcoanalysis at the age of three he came upon his parents in the act of fellatio which resulted in his being locked in his room for spying this left him with a permanent horror of being locked up and a pity for prisoners everywhere unfortunately this factor in his personality which he might have sublimated harmlessly by becoming a social worker was complicated by unresolved oedipal hostilities and a reaction formation in favor of spying which led him to become a policeman the criminal became for him the fathersymbol who was locked up in revenge for locking him up at the same time the criminal was an egoprojection and he received masochistic gratification by identifying with the prisoner the deepburied homosexual desire for the fathers penis present in all policemen was next cathected by denial of the father via denial of paternal ancestry and he began to abolish all irish catholic traces from egomemory substituting those of jewish culture since the jew as persecuted minority reinforced his basic masochism finally like all paranoids the subject fancies himself to be of superior intelligence actually on his test for the trenton police force he rated only one hundred ten on the stanfordbinet iq index and his resistance to therapy will take the form of outwitting his doctors by finding the clues which reveal that they too are agents of the illuminati and that his assumed identity as saul goodman is in fact his actual identity for therapeutic purposes i would recommend the doctor broke off after that he said briefly it is of no interest to you well he added tolerantly do you want to detect the errors in this ive never been in trenton in my life saul said wearily i dont know what anything in trenton looks like but youll just tell me that ive erased those memories lets move to a deeper level of combat herr doktor i am quite convinced that my mother and father never performed fellatio in their lives they were too oldfashioned this was the heart of the labyrinth and their real threat while he was sure that they could not break down his belief in his own identity they were also insidiously undermining that identity by suggesting it was pathological many of the lines in the muldoon case history could refer to any policeman and might conceivably refer to him as usual behind a weak open attack they were mounting a more deadly covert attack do you recognize these the doctor asked producing a sketchbook open to a page with some drawings of unicorn its my sketchbook saul said i dont know how you got it but it doesnt prove a damned thing except that i sketch in my spare time no the doctor turned the book around a bookplate on the cover identified the owner as barney muldoon pleasant avenue trenton nj amateur work saul said anybody can paste a bookplate onto a book and the unicorn means nothing to you saul sensed the trap and said nothing waiting you are not aware of the long psychoanalytical literature on the unicorn as symbol of the fathers penis tell me then why did you decide to sketch unicorns more amateurism saul said if i sketched mountains they would be symbols of the fathers penis too very well you might have made a good detective if your illness hadnt prevented your promotion you do have a quick skeptical mind let me try another approach and i wouldnt be using such tactics if i werent convinced you were on the road to recovery a true psychotic would be driven into catatonia by such a blunt assault on his delusions but tell me your wife mentioned that just before the acute stage of your problem you spent a lot of money more than you could afford on a patrolmans salary on a reproduction of the mermaid of copenhagen why was that damn it saul exclaimed it wasnt a lot of money but he recognized the displaced anger and saw that the other man recognized it too he was avoiding the question of the mermaid and her relation to the unicorn there must be a relationship between fact number one and fact number two the mermaid he said getting there before the enemy could is a mother symbol right she has no human bottom because the male child dare not think about that area of the mother is that correct jargon more or less you avoid of course the peculiar relevance in your own case that the sex act in which you caught your mother was not a normal one but a very perverted and infantile act which of course is the only sex act a mermaid can perform as all collectors of mermaid statues or mermaid paintings unconsciously know its not perverted and infantile saul protested most people do it then he saw the trap but not your mother and father they were different from most people and then it clicked the spell was broken every detail from sauls notebook every physical characteristic peter jackson had described was there youre not a doctor he shouted i dont know what your game is but i sure as hell know who you are youre joseph malik georges stateroom was paneled in teak the walls hung with small but exquisite paintings by rivers shahn de kooning and tanguy a glass cabinet built into one wall held several rows of books the floor was carpeted in wine red with a blue stylized octopus in the center its waving tentacles radiating out like a sunburst the light fixture hanging from the ceiling was a lucite model of that formidable jellyfish the portuguese manofwar the bed was full size with a rosewood headboard carved with venetian seashell motifs its legs didnt touch the floor the whole thing was supported on a huge rounded beam that allowed the bed to seesaw when the ship rolled the sleeper remaining level beside the bed was a small desk going to it george opened a drawer and found several different sizes of writing paper and half a dozen felttipped pens in various colors he took out a legalsize pad and a green pen climbed on the bed curled up at the head and began writing april objectivity is presumably the opposite of schizophrenia which means that it is nothing but acceptance of everybody elses notion of reality but nobodys perception of reality is the same as everybodys notion of it which means that the most objective person is the real schizophrenic it is hard to get beyond the accepted beliefs of ones own age the first man to think a new thought advances it very tentatively new ideas have to be around a while before anyone will promote them hard in their first form they are like tiny imperceptible mutations that may eventually lead to new species thats why cultural crossfertilization is so important it increases the genepool of the imagination the arabs say have one part of the puzzle the franks another so when the knights templar meet the hashishim something new is born the human race has always lived more or less happily in the kingdom of the blind but there is an elephant among us a oneeyed elephant george put the pen down and read the green words with a frown his thoughts still seemed to be coming from outside his own mind what was that business about the knights templar he had never felt the slightest interest in that period since his freshman year in college when old morrison glynn had given him a d for that paper on the crusades it was supposed to be a simple research paper displaying ones grasp of proper footnote style but george had chosen to denounce the crusades as an early outbreak of western racist imperialism hed even gone to the trouble of finding the text of a letter from sinan third leader of the hashishim in which he exonerates richard coeur de lion of any complicity in the murder of conrad of montferret king of jerusalem george felt the episode demonstrated the essential goodwill of the arabs how was he to know that morrison glynn was a staunch conservative catholic glynn claimed among other dyspeptic criticisms that the letter from the castle called messiac was well known as a forgery why were the hashishim coming back to mind again did it have to do with the weird dream hed had of the temple in the mad dog jail the subs engine was vibrating pleasantly through the floor the beam the bed the trip so far had reminded george of his first flight in a a surge of power followed by motion so smooth it was impossible to tell how fast or how far they were going there was a knock at the stateroom door and at georges invitation hagbards receptionist came in she was wearing a tightfitting goldenyellow slack ensemble she stared compellingly at george her pupils huge obsidian pools and smiled faintly will you eat me if i cant guess the riddle george said you remind me of a sphinx her lips the color of ripe grapes parted in a grin i modeled for it but no riddle just an ordinary question hagbard wants to know if you need anything anything but me ive got work to do now george shrugged you beat me to the question id like to get together with hagbard and find out more about him and the submarine and where were going we are going to atlantis he must have told you that she shifted her weight from one foot to the other rolling her hips she had marvelously long legs atlantis is roughly speaking about half way between cuba and the west coast of africa at the bottom of the ocean yeah well thats where its supposed to be right right hagbards going to want you in the captains control room later meanwhile smoke some of this if you want helps to pass the time she held out a gold cigarette case george took it from her his fingers brushing the velvety black skin of her hand a pang of desire for her swept through him he fumbled with the catch of the case and opened it there were slender white tubes inside each one stamped with a gold k he took one out and held it to his nose a pleasant earthy smell weve got a plantation and a factory in brazil she said hagbard must be a wealthy man oh yeah hes worth billions and billions of tons of flax well look george if you need anything just press the ivory button on your desk someone will come along well be calling you later she turned with a languid wave and walked down the fluorescentlit corridor georges gaze clung to her unbelievable ass till she climbed a narrow flight of carpeted stairs and was out of sight what was that womans name he lay down on the bed took out a joint and lit it it was marvelous he was up in seconds not the usual gradual balloon ascent but a rocket trip not unlike the effect of amyl nitrate he might have known this hagbard celine would have something special in the way of grass he studied the sparkles glinting through the portuguese manofwar and wiggled his eyeballs rapidly to make the lights dance all things that are are lights the thought came that hagbard might be evil hagbard was like some robber baron out of the nineteenth century also like some robber baron out of the eleventh century the normans took sicily in the ninth century which gave you mixtures of viking and sicilian but did they ever look like anthony quinn or his son greg la strade what son what the sun done cannot be undone but is well dun the quintessence of evil nemesis of all evil god bless us every one even one odd the big red one eye think it was his i the eye of apollo his luminous i aum shiva aye trust me not trust not a man whos rich in flax his morals may be sadly lax her name is stella stella maris black star of the sea the joint was down to the last half inch he put it down and crushed it out with grass flowing like tobacco around here it was a luxury he could afford he wasnt going to light another one that wasnt a high that was a trip a saturn rocket right out of the world and back just as fast george i want you in the captains control room clearly this hallucinating of voices and images meant he wasnt all the way back reentry was not completed he now saw a vision of the layout of that part of the submarine between his stateroom and the captains control room he stood up stretched shook his head his hair swirling around his shoulders he walked to the door slid it back and walked on down the hall a little later he stepped through a door onto a balcony which was a reproduction of the prow of a viking ship above below in front to the sides was greenblue ocean they seemed to be in a glass globe projecting into the ocean a longnecked redandgreen dragon with golden eyes and a spiky crest reared above george and hagbard my approach is fanciful rather than functional hagbard said if i werent so intelligent it would get me into a lot of trouble he patted the dragon figurehead with a blackfurred hand some viking george thought a neanderthal viking perhaps that was a good trick george said feeling shrewd but still high how you got me up on the bridge with that telepathy thing i called you on the intercom hagbard said with a look of absurd innocence you think i cant tell a voice in my head from a voice in my ears hagbard roared with laughter so loud that it made george feel a little uncertain not when youve had your first taste of kallisti gold man who am i to call a man a liar when hes just turned me on with the best shit i ever had said george with a shrug i suspect you of making use of telepathy most people who have that power would not only not try to hide it theyd go on television instead i put the ocean on television said hagbard he gestured at the globe surrounding their viking prow what you see is simply color television with a few adaptations and modifications we are inside the screen the cameras are all over the surface of the sub the cameras dont use ordinary light of course if they did you wouldnt be able to see anything the submarine illuminates the sea around us with an infrared laserradar to which our tv cameras are sensitive the radiations are of a type that is more readily conducted by the hydrogen in water than by any other element the result is that we can see the ocean bottom almost as clearly as if it were dry land and we were in a plane flying above it thatll make it easy to see atlantis when we get to it george said by the way why did you say were goingto atlantis again i didnt believe it when you told me and now im too stoned to remember the illuminati are planning to loot one of the greatest works of art in the history of man the temple of tethys it happens to be a solidgold temple and their intention is to melt it down and sell the gold to finance a series of assassinations in the us i intend to get there before them the reference to assassinations reminded george that hed gone down to mad dog texas on joe maliks hunch that hed find a clue there to an assassination conspiracy if joe knew that the clue was leading leagues under the sea and eons back through time would he believe it george doubted it malik was one of those hardnosed scientific leftists though he had been acting and talking a little strangely lately who did you say was looting this temple he asked hagbard the illuminati the real force behind all communist and fascist movements whether youre aware of it or not theyre also already in control of the united states government i thought everybody in your crowd was a rightwinger and i told you spacial metaphors are inadequate in discussing politics today hagbard interrupted well you sound like a gang of rightwingers up until the last minute all ive heard from you and your people was that the illuminati were commies or were behind the commies now you say theyre behind fascism and behind the current government in washington too hagbard laughed we came on like rightwing paranoids at first to see how youd react it was a test and you passed you didnt believe us that was obvious but you kept your eyes and ears open and were willing to listen if you were a rightwinger we would have done our procommunist rap the idea is to find out if a new man or woman will listen really listen or just shut their minds at the first really shocking idea im listening but not uncritically for instance if the illuminati control america already whats the purpose of the assassinations their grip on washington is still pretty precarious theyve been able to socialize the economy but if they showed their hand now and went totalitarian all the way there would be a revolution middlereaders would rise up with rightwingers and leftlibertarians and the illuminati arent powerful enough to withstand that kind of massive revolution but they can rule by fraud and by fraud eventually acquire access to the tools they need to finish the job of killing off the constitution what sort of tools more stringent security measures universal electronic surveillance noknock laws stop and frisk laws government inspection of firstclass mail automatic fingerprinting photographing blood tests and urinalysis of any person arrested before he is charged with a crime a law making it unlawful to resist even unlawful arrest laws establishing detention camps for potential subversives gun control laws restrictions on travel the assassinations you see establish the need for such laws in the public mind instead of realizing that there is a conspiracy conducted by a handful of men the people reason or are manipulated into reasoning that the entire populace must have its freedom restricted in order to protect the leaders the people agree that they themselves cant be trusted targets for assassination will be mavericks of left or right who are either not part of the illuminati conspiracy or have been marked as unreliable the kennedy brothers and martin luther king for example were capable of mobilizing a somewhat libertarian leftrightblackwhite populist movement but the assassinations that have occurred so far are nothing compared to what will take place the next wave will be carried out by the mafia who will be paid in illuminati gold not moscow gold said george with a smile the puppets in the kremlin have no idea that they and the puppets in the white house are working for the same people the illuminati control all sorts of organizations and national governments without any of them being aware that others are also controlled each group thinks it is competing with the others while actually each is playing its part in the illuminati plan even the morituri the sixperson affinity groups which splintered from the sds weathermen because the weathermen seemed too cautious are under the control of the illuminati they think theyre working to bring down the government but actually they are strengthening its hand the black panthers are also infiltrated everything is infiltrated at present rate within the next few years the illuminati will have the american people under tighter surveillance than hitler had the germans and the beauty of it is the majority of the americans will have been so frightened by illuminatibacked terrorist incidents that they will beg to be controlled as a masochist begs for the whip george shrugged hagbard sounded like a typical paranoid but there was this submarine and the strange events of the past few days so the illuminati are conspiring to tyrannize the world is that it do you trace them back to the first international no theyre what happened when the enlightenment of the eighteenth century collided with german mysticism the correct name for the organization is ancient illuminated seers of bavaria according to their own traditions they were founded or revived in seventeen seventysix on may first by a man named adam weishaupt weishaupt was an unfrocked jesuit and a mason he taught that religions and national governments had to be overthrown and the world ruled by an elite of scientificallyminded materialistic atheists to be held in trust for the masses of mankind who would eventually rule themselves when enlightenment became universal but this was only weishaupts outer doctrine there was also an inner doctrine which was that power is an end in itself and that weishaupt and his closest followers would make use of the new knowledge being developed by scientists and engineers to seize control of the world back in seventeen seventysix things were run largely by the church and the feudal nobility with the capitalists slowly getting a bigger and bigger piece of the pie weishaupt declared that these groups were obsolete and it was time for an elite with a monopoly on scientific and technological knowledge to seize power instead of eventually producing a democratic society as the outer doctrine promised the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria would saddle mankind with a dictatorship that would last forever well it would be logical enough that someone around that time would think of that said george and who more likely than a mason who was an unfrocked jesuit you recognize that what i tell you is relatively plausible said hagbard thats a good sign a sign that its plausible laughed george no a sign that youre the kind of person im always looking for well the illuminati after staying above ground long enough to recruit a hardcore membership from masons and freethinkers and to establish international contacts allowed it to seem that the bavarian government had suppressed them subsequently the illuminati launched their first experimental revolution in france here they suckered the middle class whose true interests lay in laissez faire free enterprise to follow the weishaupt slogan of liberty equality fraternity the catch of course is that where equality and fraternity rule there is no liberty after the career of napoleon whose rise and fall was purely the result of illuminati manipulations they started planting the seeds of european socialism leading to the revolutions of eighteen fortyeight to marxism finally to the seizure of russia onesixth of the earths land mass of course they had to engineer a world war to make the russian revolution possible but by nineteen seventeen they had become quite good at that world war two was an even more clever job and resulted in more gains for them another thing this explains george said is why orthodox marxismleninism in spite of all its ideals always turns out to be not worth a shit why its always betrayed the people wherever it established itself and it explains why theres such an inevitable quality about americas drift toward totalitarianism right said hagbard america is the target now theyve got most of europe and asia once they get america they can come out into the open the world will then be much as orwell predicted in nineteen eightyfour they bumped him off after it was published you know the book hit a little too close to home he was obviously on to them the references to inner and outer parties with different teachings obriens speech about power being an end in itself and they got him orwell you see ran across them in spain where they were functioning quite openly at one point during the civil war but artists also arrive at truth through their imaginations if they let themselves wander freely theyre more likely to arrive at the truth than more scientificminded people youve just tied two hundred years of world history up in a theory that would make me feel i should have myself committed if i accepted it said george but im drawn to it i admit partly intuitively i feel you are a person who is essentially sane and not paranoid partly because the orthodox version of history that i was taught in school never made sense to me and i know how people can twist history to suit their beliefs and therefore i assume that the history ive learned is twisted partly because of the very wildness of the idea if i learned one thing in the last few years its that the crazier an idea is the more likely it is to be true still and all given all those reasons for believing you i would like some further sign hagbard nodded all right a sign so be it first a question for you assuming your boss joe malik was on to something assuming that the place he sent you did have something to do with assassinations and might lead to the illuminati what would be likely to happen to joe malik i know what youre suggesting i dont like to think about it dont think hagbard suddenly pulled a telephone from under the railing of the ship we can tap into the bell system through the atlantic cable from here dial the new york area code and dial any person in new york any person who could give you uptodate information on joe malik and on confrontation magazine dont tell me who youre dialing otherwise you might suspect i had someone on the ship impersonate the person you want to speak to holding the phone so hagbard couldnt see george dialed a number after a wait of about thirty seconds after numerous clicks and other strange sounds george could hear a phone ringing after a moment a voice said hello this is george dorn said george who is this well who the hell did you think it was you dialed my number oh christ said george look im in a place where i dont trust the phones i have to be sure im really talking to you so i want you to identify yourself without my telling you who youre supposed to be do you understand of course i understand you dont have to use that grade school language this is peter jackson george as i presume you intended that it should be where the hell are you are you still in mad dog im at the bottom of the atlantic ocean knowing your bad habits im not surprised have you heard about what happened to us is that why youre calling no what happened george gripped the telephone tighter the office was blown up by a bomb early this morning and joe has disappeared was joe killed not as far as we know there werent any bodies in the wreckage how about you are you okay im getting into an unbelievable story peter its so unbelievable that im not going to try to tell you about it not till i get back if youre still running a magazine there then as of now theres still a magazine and im running it from my apartment said peter i only hope they dont decide to blow me up who whoever youre still on assignment and if this has anything to do with what youve been doing down in mad dog texas youre in trouble reporters are not supposed to go around getting their bosss magazines bombed you sound pretty cheerful considering joe might be dead joe is indestructible by the way george whos paying for this call a wealthy friend i think hes got a corner on flax or something like that more on him later im going to sign off now pete thanks for talking sure take care baby george handed the phone to hagbard do you know whats happened to joe do you know who bombed confrontation you knew about this before i called your people are pretty handy with explosives hagbard shook his head all i know is the pot is coming to a boil your editor joe malik was onto the illuminati thats why he sent you to mad dog as soon as you show your face down there you get busted and maliks office is bombed what do you think i think that what youve been telling me is the truth or a version of it i dont know whether to trust you completely but ive got my sign if the bavarian illuminati dont exist something does so then where do we go from here hagbard smiled spoken like a true homo neophilus george welcome to the tribe we want to recruit you because you are so gullible that is gullible in the right way youre skeptical about conventional wisdom but attracted to unorthodox ideas an unfailing mark of homo neophilus the human race is not divided into the irrational and the rational as some idealists think all humans are irrational but there are two different kinds of irrationally those who love old ideas and hate and fear new ones and those who despise old ideas and joyfully embrace new ones homo neophobus and homo neophilus neophobus is the original human stock the stock that hardly changed at all for the first four million years of human history neophilus is the creative mutation that has been popping up at regular intervals during the past million years giving the race little forward pushes the kind you give a wheel to make it spin faster and faster neophilus makes a lot of mistakes but he or she moves they live life the way it should be lived ninetynine percent mistakes and one percent viable mutations everyone in my organization is neophilus george thats why were so far ahead of the rest of the human race concentrated neophilus influences without any neophobe dilution we make a million mistakes but we move so fast that none of them catch up with us before you get any deeper george id like you to become one of us which means what become a legionnaire in the legion of dynamic discord george laughed now that sounds like a gas but its hard to believe that an organization with an absurd name like that could build anything as serious as this submarine or work for such a serious end as foiling the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria hagbard shook his head whats serious about a yellow submarine its right out of a rock song and everybody knows people who worry about the bavarian illuminati are crackpots will you join the legion in whatever spirit you choose certainly said george promptly hagbard clapped him on the back ah youre our type all right good back through the door you came then turn right and through the golden door is there someone lifting a lamp beside it there are no honest men on this voyage get along with you now hagbards full lips curled in a leer youre in for a treat every perversion smiling jim screamed men having sex with men women having sex with women obscene desecrations of religious articles for deviant purposes even men and women having sex with animals why friends the only thing they havent gotten around to yet is people copulating with fruits and vegetables and i guess thatll be next some degenerate getting his kicks with an apple the audience laughed at the wit youve got to run very fast to catch up with the sun thats the way it is when youre lost out here the old woman said stressing the last five words in a kind of childish singsong the woods were incredibly thick and dark but barney muldoon stumbled after her its getting darker and darker she said darkly buts always dark when youre lost out here why do we have to catch the sun barney asked perplexed in search of more light she cackled gleefully you always need more light when youre lost out here behind the golden door stood the lovely black receptionist she had changed into a short red leather skirt that left all of her long legs in view her hands rested lightly on her white plastic belt hi stella said george is that your name is it really stella maris sure no honest men on this voyage is right hagbard was talking to me telepathically he told me your name i told you my name when you boarded the sub you must have forgotten youve been through a lot and sad to say youll be going through a lot more i must ask you to remove your clothing just shed it on the floor please george unhesitatingly did as he was told total or partial nudity was required in lots of initiation rituals but a twinge of anxiety ran through him he was trusting these people simply because they hadnt done anything to him yet but there was really no telling what kind of freaks they might be what kind of ritual torture or murder they might involve him in such fears were part of initiation rituals too stella was grinning at him eyebrows raised as he dropped his shorts he understood the meaning of the grin and he felt the blood rush hot as a blush to his penis which grew thicker and heavier in an instant being aware that he was standing nude with the start of an erection in front of this beautiful and desirable woman who was enjoying the spectacle made him swell and harden still more thats a goodlooking tool youve got there nice and thick and pink and purple stella sauntered over to him reached out and touched her fingers to the underside of his cock just where it met his scrotum he felt his balls draw up then her middle finger ran down the central cord flicking the underside of the head georges penis rose to full staff in salute to her manual dexterity the sexually responsive male said stella good good good now youre ready for the next chamber right through that green door if you please naked erect regretfully leaving stella behind george walked through the door these people were too healthy and goodhumored to be untrustworthy he thought he liked them and you ought to trust your feelings but as the green door slammed shut behind him his anxiety came back even stronger than before in the center of the room was a pyramid of seventeen steps alternating red and white marble the room was large with five walls that tapered together in a gothic arch thirty feet above the pentagonal floor unlike the pyramid in the mad dog jail this one had no huge eye goggling down at him instead there was an enormous golden apple a sphere of gold the height of a man with a footlong stem and a single leaf the size of an elephants ear cut into the side of the apple was the word kallisti in greek letters the walls of the room were draped with enormous gold curtains that looked like theyd been stolen from a cinerama theater and the floor was covered with lush gold carpet into which georges bare feet sank deeply this is different george told himself to quiet his fear these people are different theres a connection with the others but theyre different the lights went out the golden apple was glowing in the dark like a harvest moon kallisti was etched in sharp black lines a voice that sounded like hagbard boomed at him from all sides of the room there is no goddess but goddess and she is your goddess this is actually an elks club ceremony george thought but there were strange unbpoe fumes drifting into his nostrils an unmistakable odor highpriced incense these people use an expensive religion or lodge or whatever it is but you can afford the best when youre a flax tycoon flax huh hard to see how a man could make such big money in the flax biz did you corner the market or what now mutual funds that was more down to earth than flax i do believe im feeling the effects they shouldnt drug a man without his consent he found he was holding his penis which had shrunk considerably he gave it a reassuring pull said the voice there is no movement but the discordian movement and it is the discordian movement that would appear to be selfevident george rolled his eyes and watched the giant goldenglowing apple wheel and spin above him this is a most sacred and a most serious hour for discordians it is the hour when the great palpitating heart of discordia throbs and swells when she what began it all prepares to ingest into her heaving chaotic bosom another legionnaire of the legion of dynamic discord o minerval are ye willing to make a commitment to discordia embarrassed at being addressed directly george let go of his wang yes he said in a voice that sounded muffled to him are ye a human being and not a cabbage or something george giggled yes thats too bad the voice boomed do ye wish to better yerself yes how stupid are ye willing to become philosophically illuminated why that word george wondered briefly why illuminated but he said i suppose so very funny will ye dedicate yerself to the holy discordian movement george shrugged as long as it suits me there was a draft against his belly stella maris naked and gleaming stepped out from behind the pyramid the soft glow from the golden apple illuminated the rich browns and blacks of her body george felt the blood charging back into his penis this part was going to be ok stella walked toward him with a slow stately stride gold bracelets sparkling and tinkling on her wrists george felt hunger thirst and a pressure as if a balloon were slowly being inflated in his bowels his cock rose heartbeat by heartbeat the muscles in his buttocks and thighs tightened relaxed and tightened again stella approached with gliding steps and danced around him in a circle one hand reaching out to brush his bare waist he stepped forward and held out his hands to her she danced away on tiptoes spinning arms over her head heavy conical breasts with black nipples tilted upward for once george understood why some men like big boobs his eyes moved to the globes of her buttocks the long muscular shadows in her thighs and calves he stumbled toward her she stopped suddenly legs slightly apart forming an inverse with her patch of very abundant hair at the royal arch her hips swaying in a gentle circular motion his tool pulled him to her as if it were iron and she were magnetized he looked down and saw that a little pearl of fluid gleaming gold in the light from the apple had appeared in the eye polyphemus wanted very much to get into the cave george walked up to her until the head of the serpent was buried in the bushy prickly garden at the bottom of her belly he put his hands out and pressed them against the two cones feeling her ribcage rise and fall with heavy breathing her eyes were half closed and her lips slightly open her nostrils flared wide she licked her lips and he felt her fingers lightly circling his cock lightly brushing it with a friction strong enough to gently electrify it she stepped back a bit and pushed her finger into the moisture on his tip george put his hand into the tangle of her pubic hair feeling the lips hot and swollen feeling her juices slathering his fingers his middle finger slid into her cunt and he pushed it in past the tight opening all the way up to his knuckle she gasped and her whole body writhed around his finger in a spiral motion wow god george whispered goddess stella answered fiercely george nodded goddess he said hoarsely meaning stella as much as the legendary discordia she smiled and drew away from him try to imagine that this is not me stella maris the youngest daughter of discordia she is merely the vessel of goddess her priestess think of goddess think of her entering me and acting through me i am her now all the while she was stroking polyphemus gently but insistently it was already ferocious as a stallion but it seemed to be getting more inflamed if that were possible im going to go off in your hand in a second george moaned he gripped her slender wrist to stop her ive got to fuck you whoever you are woman or goddess please she stepped back from him her tan palms turned toward him her arms held away from her sides in a receiving accepting gesture but she said climb the steps now climb up to the apple her feet twinkling on the thick carpet she ran backward away from him and disappeared behind the pyramid he climbed the seventeen steps old oneeye still swollen and aching the top of the pyramid was broad and flat and he stood facing the apple he put a hand out and touched it expecting cold metal surprised when the softly glowing texture felt warm as a human body to his touch about half a foot below the level of his waist he saw a dark elliptical opening in the side of the apple and a sinister suspicion formed in his mind you got it george said the booming voice that presided over his initiation now youre supposed to plant your seeds in the apple go to it george give yourself to goddess shit man george thought what a silly idea they get a guy turned on like this and then they expect him to fuck a goddamn golden idol he had a good mind to turn his back on the apple sit down on the top step of the pyramid and jackoff to show them what he thought of them george would we let you down its nice there in the apple come on stick it in hurry up i am so gullible thought george but a hole is a hole its all friction he stepped up to the apple and gingerly placed the tip of his cock in the elliptical opening half expecting to be sucked in by some mechanical force half fearing it would be chopped off by a miniature guillotine but there was nothing his cock didnt even touch the edges of the hole he took another small step and put it halfway in still nothing then something warm and wet and hairy squirmed up against the tip of his cock and whatever it was he felt it give as he reflexively pushed forward he pushed some more and it pushed back and he slid into it a cunt by all the high hidden gods a cunt and by the feel it was almost surely stellas george exhaled a deep sigh planted his hands on the smooth surface of the apple to support himself and began thrusting the pumping from inside the apple was as fierce the metal was warm against his thighs and belly suddenly the pelvis inside slammed up against the hole and a hollow scream resounded from the inside of the apple the echo effect made it seem to hang in the air containing all the agony spasm itch twitch moon madness horror and ecstasy of life from the oceans birth to now georges prick was stretched like the skin of a balloon about to burst his lips drew back from his teeth the delicious electricity of orgasm was building in his groin in the deepest roots of his penis in his quick he was coming he cried out as he fired his seed into the unseen cunt into the apple into goddess into eternity there was a crash above georges eyes opened a nude male body at the end of a rope came hurtling at him from the vaulted ceiling it jerked to a stop with a horrible crack its feet quivering above the stem of the apple even as the leaps of ejaculation still racked georges body the penis over his head lifted and spurted thick white gobbets of come like tiny doves arcing out over georges uplifted horrified head to fall somewhere on the side of the pyramid george stared at the face canted to one side the neck broken a hangmans knot behind the ear it was his own face george went ape he pulled his penis out of the apple and nearly fell backward down the stairs he ran down the seventeen steps and looked back the dead figure was still hanging through a trap in the ceiling directly above the apple the penis had subsided the body slowly rotated enormous laughter boomed out in the room sounding very much like hagbard celine our sympathies said the voice you are now a legionnaire in the legion of dynamic discord the hanging figure vanished soundlessly there was no trapdoor in the ceiling a colossal orchestra somewhere began to play pomp and circumstance stella maris came round from the back of the pyramid again this time clothed from head to foot in a simple white robe her eyes shone she was carrying a silver tray with a steaming hot towel on it she put the tray on the floor knelt and wrapped georges relaxing dick in the towel it felt delicious you were beautiful she whispered yeah but wow george looked up at the pyramid the golden apple gleamed cheerfully get up off the floor he said youre embarrassing me she stood up smiling at him the broad grin of a woman whose lover has thoroughly satisfied her im glad you liked it said george his wildly disparate emotions gradually coalescing as anger what was the idea of that last little gag to turn me off permanently on sex stella laughed george admit it nothing could turn you off sex right so dont be such a bad sport bad sport that sick trick is your idea of sport what a goddam rotten dirty motherfucking thing to do to a man motherfucking no thats for when we ordain deacons george shook his head angrily she absolutely refused to be shamed he was speechless if you have any complaints sweet man take them to episkopos hagbard celine of the lief erikson cabal said stella she turned and started walking back toward the pyramid hes waiting for you back the way you came and theres a change of clothes in the next room wait a minute george called after her what the blazes does kallisti mean she was gone in the anteroom of the initiation chamber he found a green tunic and tight black trousers draped over a costumer he didnt want to put them on it was probably some sort of uniform of this idiotic cult and he wanted no part of it but there werent any other clothes there was also a beautiful pair of black boots everything fit perfectly and comfortably there was a fulllength mirror on the wall and he looked at himself and grudgingly admitted that the outfit was a gas a tiny golden apple glinted on the left side of his chest the only thing was that his hair needed washing it was getting stringy through two more doors and he was facing hagbard you didnt like our little ceremony said hagbard with exaggerated sympathy thats too bad i was so proud of it especially the parts i lifted from william burroughs and the marquis de sade its sick said george and putting the woman inside the apple so i couldnt have any kind of personal sex with her so i had to use her as a receptacle as as an object you made it pornographic and sadistic pornography at that dig george said hagbard thou art that if there were no death there would be no sex if there were no sex there would be no death and without sex there would be no evolution toward intelligence no human race therefore death is necessary death is the price of orgasm only one being on all this planet is sexless intelligent and immortal while you were pumping your seeds into the symbol of life i showed you orgasm and death in one image and brought it home to you and youll never forget it it was a trip george wasnt it a trip george nodded reluctantly it was a trip and you know in your bones a little more about life than you did before right george yes well then thank you for joining the legion of dynamic discord youre welcome hagbard beckoned george to the edge of the boatshaped balcony he pointed down far below in the bluegreen medium through which they seemed to be flying george could see rolling lands hills winding riverbeds and then broken buildings george gasped pyramids rose up below as high as the hills this is one of the great port cities hagbard said galleys from the americas plied their trade to and from this harbor for a thousand years how long ago ten thousand years said hagbard this was one of the last cities to go of course their civilization had declined quite a bit by then meanwhile weve got a problem the illuminati are here already a large undulating bluegray shape appeared ahead of them swam toward them whirled and matched their speed so it seemed to drift alongside george felt another momentary leap of fright was this another of hagbards tricks what is that fish how does it keep up with us george asked its a porpoise not a fish a mammal and they can swim a lot faster than submarines can sail underwater we can keep up with them though they form a film around their bodies that enables them to slide through the water without setting up any turbulence i learned from them how to do it and i applied it to this sub we can cross the atlantic under water in less than a day a voice spoke from the control panel better go transparent youll be within range of their detectors when youve gone another ten miles right said hagbard we will maintain present course until further notice so youll know where we are ill know said the voice hagbard slashed his hand through the air disgustedly youre so fucking superior who are you talking to said george howard the voice said ive never seen machines like this before they look something like crabs theyve just about got the temple all dug up when the illuminati do something on their own they go first class said hagbard who the hell is howard said george its me out here hello mr human said the voice im howard unbelieving yet knowing quite well what was happening george slowly turned his head the dolphin appeared to be looking at him how does he talk to us said hagbard hes swimming alongside the prow of the submarine which is where we pick up his voice my computer translates from delphine to english a mike here in the control room sends our voices to the computer which translates into delphine and broadcasts the correct sounds through the water to him ladyoh oh deyouday a new human being has come my way howard sang he has swum into my ken i hope hes one of the friendly men they sing a lot said hagbard also recite poetry and make it up on the spot a large part of their culture is poetry poetics and athletics and of course the two are very closely related what they do mostly is swim hunt and communicate with each other but we do all with artful complexity and rare finesse said howard looping the loop outside lead us to the enemy howard said hagbard howard swam out in front of them and as he did so he sang right on right on astream against the foe the sallying schools of the southern seas make their course to go attack attack with noses sound as rock no shark or squid can shake us loose or survive our dour shock epics said hagbard theyre mad for epics they have their whole story for the past forty thousand years in epic form no books no writing how could they handle pens with their fins you know all memorization which is why they favor poetry and their poems are marvelous but you must spend years studying their language before you know that our computer turns their works into doggerel its the best it can do when i have the time ill add some circuits that can really translate poetry from one language to another when the porpoise corpus is translated into human languages it will advance our culture by centuries or more it will be as if wed discovered the works of a whole race of shakespeares that had been writing for forty millennia on the other hand said howard your civilizations may be demoralized by culture shock not likely said hagbard grumpily weve a few things to teach you you know and our psychotherapists can help you over the anguish of digesting our knowledge said howard they have psychotherapists said george they invented psychoanalysis thousands of years ago as a means of passing the time on long migrations they have highly complex brains and symbolsystems but their minds are unlike ours in very important ways they are all in one piece so to speak they lack the structural differentiation of ego superego and id there is no repression they are fully aware and accepting of their most primitive wishes and conscious will rather than parentinculcated discipline guides their actions there is no neurosis no psychosis among them psychoanalysis for them is an imaginative poetic exercise in autobiography rather than a healing art there are no difficulties of the mind that require healing not quite true said howard there was a school of thought about twenty thousand years ago that envied humans they were called the original sinners because they were like the first parents of your human race who according to some of your legends envied the gods and suffered for it they taught that humans were superior because they could do many more things than dolphins but they despaired and most ended up by committing suicide they were the only neurotics in the long history of porpoises our philosophers mostly hold that we live in beauty all the days of our lives as no human does our culture is simply what you might call a commentary on our natural surroundings whereas human culture is at war with nature if any race is afflicted it is yours you can do much and what you can do you must do and speaking of war the enemy lies ahead in the distance george could make out what appeared to be a mighty city rising on hills surrounding a deep depression which must have been a harbor when atlantis was on the surface the buildings marched on and on as far as the eye could see they were mostly low but here and there a square tower reared up the sub was heading for the center of the ancient waterfront george stared at the buildings he was able to see them better now they were angular very modern in appearance whereas the other city theyd flown sailed over had a mixed greekegyptianmayan quality to its architecture here there were no pyramids but the tops of many of the structures were broken off and many others were heaps of rubble still it was remarkable that a city which had sunk so many thousands of feet to the bottom of the ocean in the course of what must have been an enormous earthquake should be this well preserved the buildings must be incredibly durable if new york went through a catastrophe like that thered be nothing left of its glassandalloy skyscrapers there was one pyramid it was much smaller than the towers around it it gleamed a dull yellow despite its lack of height it seemed to dominate the harbor skyline like a squat powerful chieftain in the center of a circle of tall slender warriors there was movement around its base this is the city of peos in the region of poseida said hagbard and it was great in atlantis for a thousand years after the hour of the dragon star it reminds me of byzantium which was a great city for a thousand years after the fall of rome and that pyramid is the temple of tethys goddess of the ocean sea it was seafaring that made peos great ihave a soft spot in my heart for those people crawling around the base of the temple were strange sea creatures that looked like giant spiders lights flashed from their heads and glinted on the sides of the temple as the submarine swept closer george could see that the spiders were machines each with a body the size of a tank they appeared to be excavating deep trenches around the base of the pyramid wonder where they had those built muttered hagbard hard to keep innovations like that a secret as he spoke the spiders stopped whatever work they were doing around the pyramid there was no motion among them at all for a moment then one of them rose up from the sea bottom followed by another and another they formed quickly into a v shape and started toward the submarine like a pair of arms outstretched to seize it they picked up speed as they came theyve detected us hagbard growled they werent supposed to but they have it never pays to underestimate the illuminati all right george button up your asshole were in for a fight at that moment but exactly two hours earlier on the clock rebecca goodman awoke from a dream about saul and a playboy bunny and something sinister the phone was ringing was there a pyramid in the dreamshe tried to remember something like that and she reached groggily past the mermaid statue and held the receiver to her ear yes she said cautiously put your hand on your pussy and listen said august personage id like to lift your dress and rebecca hung up she suddenly remembered the hit when the needle went in and all those wasted years saul had saved her from that and now saul was gone and strange voices on the phone talked of sex the way addicts talked of junk in the beginning of all things was mummu the spirit of pure chaos in the beginning was the word and it was written by a baboon rebecca goodman twentyfive years old started to cry if hes dead she thought these years have been wasted too learning to love learning that sex was more than another kind of junk learning that tenderness was more than a word in the dictionary that it was just what d h lawrence said not an embellishment on sex but the center of the act learning what that poor guy on the phone could never guess as most people in this crazy country never guessed it and then losing it losing it to an aimless bullet fired from a blind gun somewhere august personage about to leave the phone booth at the automat on fortieth street and the avenue of the americas catches a flash of plastic on the floor bending he picks up a pornographic tarot card which he quickly shoves into a pocket to be examined at leisure later it was the five of pentacles and when the throne room was empty and the believers had departed in wonder and redoubled faith hassan knelt and separated the two halves of the vessel which held the head of ibn azif very convincing screams he commented slipping the trapdoor beneath the plate and ibn azif climbed out grinning at his own performance his neck was thick bulllike undamaged and quite solid the fifth trip or geburah swiftkick inc and behold thusly was the law formulated imposition of order escalation of chaos lord omar khayaam ravenhurst the gospel according to fred the honest book of truth the lights flashed the computer buzzed hagbard attached the electrodes on january a silly little man in berlin gave a silly little speech among other things he said and another thing i wish to say on this day which perhaps is memorable not only for us germans in my life i have many times been a prophet and most of the times i have been laughed at during the period of my struggle for power it was in the first case the jews that laughed at my prophecies that some day i would take over the leadership of the state and thereby of the whole folk and that i would among other things solve also the jewish problem i believe that in the meantime the hyenalike laughter of the jews of germany has been smothered in their throats today i want to be a prophet once more if the internationalfinance jews inside and outside europe should succeed once more in plunging nations into another world war the consequence will be the annihilation of the jewish race in europe and so on he was always saying things like that by quite a few heads here and there realized that the silly little man was also a murderous little monster but only a very small number even of these noticed that for the first time in his antisemitic diatribes he had used the word vernichtungannihilation and even they couldnt believe he meant what that implied in fact outside of a small circle of friends nobody guessed what the little man adolf hitler had planned outside that small very small circle of friends others came in intimate contact with der fuhrer and never guessed what was in his mind hermann rauschning the governor of danzig for instance was a devout nazi until he began to get some hints of where hitlers fancies were tending after fleeing to france rauschning wrote a book warning against his former leader it was called the voice of destruction and was very eloquent but the most interesting passages in it were not understood by rauschning or by most of his readers whoever sees in national socialism nothing but a political movement doesnt know much about it hitler told rauschning and this is in the book but rauschning and his readers continued to see national socialism as a particularly vile and dangerous political movement and nothing more creation is not yet completed hitler said again and rauschning again recorded without understanding the planet will undergo an upheaval which you uninitiated people cant understand der fuhrer warned on another occasion and still another time he remarked that nazism was not only more than a political movement but more than a new religion and rauschning wrote it all and understood none of it he even recorded the testimony of hitlers physician that the silly and murderous little man often awoke screaming from nightmares that were truly extraordinary in their intensity and would shout its him its him hes come for me good old hermann rauschning a german of the old school and not equipped to participate in the new germany of national socialism took all this as evidence of mental unbalance in hitler all of them coming back all of them hitler and streicher and goebbels and the powers behind them what look like something you cant even imagine guvnor you think they was human the patient went on as the psychiatrist listened in astonishment but wait till you see them the second time and theyre comingby the end of the month theyre coming karl haushofer was never tried at nuremberg ask most people to name the men chiefly responsible for the vernichtung annihilation decision and his name will not be mentioned even most histories of nazi germany relegate him to footnotes but strange stories are told about his many visits to tibet japan and other parts of the orient his gift for prophecy and clairvoyance the legend that he belonged to a bizarre sect of dissident and most peculiar buddhists who had entrusted him with a mission in the western world so serious that he vowed to commit suicide if he did not succeed if the last yarn is true haushofer must have failed in his mission for in march he killed his wife martha and then performed the japanese suiciderite of sepukku upon himself his son albrecht had already been executed for his role in the officers plot to assassinate hitler of his father albrecht had written in a poem my father broke the sealhe did not feel the breath of the evil onehe set it free to roam the world it was karl haushofer clairvoyant mystic medium orientalist and fanatic believer in the lost continent of thule who introduced hitler to the illuminated lodge in munich in shortly thereafter hitler made his first bid to seize power no rational interpretation of the events of august in chicago satisfactory to all participants and observers has yet been produced this suggests the need for valuefree models inspired by the structural analysis in von neumann and morgensterns theory of games and economic behavior which will allow us to express what actually occurred functionally without tainting our analysis with bias or moral judgments the model we will employ is that of two teams an uphill motorcar race and a downhill bicycle race accidentally intersecting on the same hill the picasso statue in the civic center will be regarded as start for the downhill motorcar race and finish for the uphill bicycle race pontius pilate disguised as sirhan sirhan fires the opening shot thereby disqualifying robert f kennedy for whom marilyn monroe committed suicide as recorded in the most trustworthy tabloids and scandal sheets this is the voice of your friendly neighborhood spider man speaking you must realize that you are not joseph wendell malik hells angels on motorcycles do not fit the structure of the race at all so they endlessly orbit around the heroic statue of general logan in grant park finish for the uphill crucifixion racers and can be considered as isolated from the action which is of course america when jesus falls the first time this can be considered as a puncture and simon operates an air pump on his tires but the threat to throw lsd in the water supply constitutes a foul and this team thereby is driven back three squares by mace clubs and the machine guns of the capone mob unleashed from another time track in the same multiverse willard gibbs far more than einstein created the modern cosmos and his concept of contingent or statistical reality when crossfertilized with the second law of thermodynamics by shannon and wiener led to the definition of information as the negative reciprocal of probability making the clubbings of jesus by chicago cops just another of those things that happens in this kind of quantum jump a centurion named semper cuni linctus passes simon in grant park looking for the uphill bike race when we crucify a man he mutters he should confounded well stay crucified the three marys clutch handkerchiefs to their faces as the teargas and zyklon b pours upward on the hill to the spot where the crosses and the statue of general logan stand nor dashed a thousand kirn croons saint toad looking through the door at fission chips arthur flegenheimer and robert putney drake ascend the chimney you dont have to believe in santa claus h p lovecraft explains ambrose the dutchman says to him imploringly but it cant be joe malik says half weeping it cant be that crazy buildings wouldnt stand planes wouldnt fly dams would collapse engineering colleges would be lunatic asylums they arent already simon asks have you read the latest data on the ecological catastrophe you have to face it joe god is a crazy woman there are no straight lines in curved space stella adds but my mind is dying joe protests shuddering simon holds up an ear of corn and tells him urgently osiris is a black god sir charles james napier bearded longhaired and sixtyodd years old general of her majestys armies in india met a most engaging scoundrel in january and immediately wrote to his cronies in england about this remarkable person whom he described as brave clever fabulously wealthy and totally unscrupulous since this curious fellow was also regarded as god by his followers who numbered over three million he charged twenty rupees for permission to kiss his hand asked and got the sexual favors of the wives or daughters of any true believers who took his fancy and proved his divinity by brazenly and openly committing sins which any mortal would shrivel with shame to have acknowledged he also proved at the battle of miani where he aided the british against the rebellious baluchi tribesmen that he could fight like ten tigers all in all general napier concluded a most unusual human beinghasan ali shah mahallat fortysixth imam or living god of the ishmaelian sect of islam direct descendant of hassan i sabbah and first aga khan dear joe im back in czechago again fabulous demesne of crookbacked richard pigbaschard of the world etc where the pollution comes up like thunder out of gary across the lake etc and the padre and i are still working on the heads of the local heads etc so ive finally got tune to write you that long letter i promised the law of fives is all the farther that weishaupt ever got and hagbard and john arent much interested in any further speculations along those lines the phenomenon is entirely my discovery except that william s burroughs has noted the without coming to any conclusions about it im writing this on a bench in grant park near the place i got maced three years ago nice symbolism a woman just came along from the mothers march against polio i gave her a quarter what a drag just when i was trying to get my thoughts in order when you come out here ill be able to tell you more this will obviously have to be somewhat sketchy burroughs anyway encountered the in tangiers when a ferryboat captain named clark remarked that hed been sailing years without an accident that day his ship sunk with all hands and feet aboard burroughs was thinking about it in the evening when the radio newscast told him that an eastern airlines plane new york to miami had crashed the pilot was another captain clark and the plane was flight if you want to know the extent of their control simon told joe speaking this time not writing a letter they were driving to san francisco after leaving dillinger take a dollar bill out of your wallet and look at it go ahead do it now i want to make a point joe took out his wallet and looked for a single a year later in the city simon called czechago in honor of the synchronous invasions in august the kcuf convention is taking its first luncheon break after smiling jims sockittoem opening speech simon brushes against an usher shouts hey you damned faggot keep your hands off my ass and in the ensuing tumult joe has no trouble slipping the aum in the punch do i have to get a library card just to look at one book carmel asks the librarian in the main branch of the las vegas library after maldonado had failed to produce any lead to a communist agent one of the most puzzling acts of washingtons presidency professor percival petsdeloup tells an american history class at columbia back in was his refusal to aid tom paine when paine was condemned to death in paris why puzzling george dorn thinks in the back of the class washington was an establishment fink first of all look at that face on the front simon says it isnt washington at all its weishaupt compare it with any of the early authentic pictures of washington and youll see what i mean and look at that cryptic halfsmile on his face the same smile weishaupt wore when he finished the letter explaining to paine why he couldnt help him sealed it with the great seal of the united states whose meaning only he knew and settling back in his chair murmured to himself jacques de molay thou art again avenged what do you mean im creating a disturbance it was that faggot there with his big mitts on my ass well i dont know which particular book honey something that tells how the communists work you know how a patriotic citizen can spot a commie spy ring if theres one in his neighborhood that kind of thing carmel explained a swarm of men in blue shirts and white plastic helmets rushes down the steps at fortythird street and un plaza past the inscription reading they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks neither shall they study war any more waving heavy wooden crosses and shouting angry battle cries the helmeted men surge into the crowd like a wave hitting a sand castle george sees them coming and his heart skips a beat and when you turn the bill over the first thing you see is the illuminati pyramid youll notice it says seventeen seventysix on it but our government was founded in seventeen eightyeight supposedly the seventeen seventysix is there because thats when the declaration of independence was signed the real reason is that seventeen seventysix is the year weishaupt revived the illuminati and why do you suppose the pyramid has seventytwo segments in thirteen layers simon asks in nineteen sixtynine misunderstanding my eye when a guy gropes my butt that way i understand exactly what he wants simon shouts in nineteen seventy george nudges peter jackson gods lightning he says the plastic hats gleam in the sunlight more of them jostling down the stairs a banner red letters on a white background unfurling above america love it or well stomp you christ on rollerskates peter says now watch the cops do a vanishing act dillinger settles down crosslegged in a fivesided chamber under the un meditation room he curls into the lotus posture with an ease that would appear unusual in an american in his late sixties were there anyone to witness it seventytwo is the cabalistic number for the holy unspeakable name of god used in all black magic and thirteen is the number in a coven simon explains thats why the volkswagen purrs toward san francisco carmel comes down the steps of the las vegas public library a copy of j edgar hoovers masters of deceit under his arm an anticipatory smirk on his face and simon is finally ejected from the sheratonchicago shouting faggots i think youre all a bunch of faggots and heres one of their jokes simon adds over the eagles head do you dig that star of david they put that one in one single sixpointed jewish star made up of all the fivepointed stars just so some rightwing cranks could find it and proclaim it as proof that the elders of zion control the treasury and the federal reserve overlooking the crowd in un plaza zev hirsch new york state commander of gods lightning watches his thickshouldered troops swinging their wooden crosses like tomahawks drive back the lilylivered peaceniks there is an obstacle a blue line of policemen has formed between the men of gods lightning and their prey over the cops shoulders the peaceniks are screeching dirty words at their plastichatted enemies zevs eyes scan the crowd he catches the eye of a redfaced cop with gold braid on his cap zev gives the police captain a questioning look the captain winks a minute later the captain makes a small gesture with his left hand immediately the line of police vanishes as if melted in the bright spring sun that beats down on the plaza the battalion of gods lightning falls upon their anguished outraged and astonished victims zev hirsch laughs this is a lot more fun than the old days in the jewish defense league all the servants are drunk and the rain continues at an outdoor cafe in jerusalem two whitehaired old men wearing black are drinking coffee together they try to mask their emotions from the people around them but their eyes are wild with excitement they are staring at an inside page of a yiddish newspaper reading two ads in yiddish a large quarterpage announcement of the greatest rock festival of all time to be held near ingolstadt bavaria bands of all nations people of all nations to be known as woodstock europa on the same page is the papers personals column and the watery eyes of the two old men are rereading for the fifth time the statement in yiddish in thanks to st jude for favors granteda w one old man points at the page with a trembling finger it is coming he says in german the other one nods a beatific smile on his withered face jawohl it is coming very soon der tag soon we must to bavaria go ewige blumenkraft carlo put the gun on the table between us this is it george he said are you a revolutionary or are you just on an ego trip playing at being a revolutionary can you take the gun i wiped my eyes the passaic was flowing below me a steady stream of garbage from the paterson falls down to newark and the atlantic ocean like the garbage that was my contemptible cowardly soul the gods lightning troopers fan out clubbing each person wearing an i wont die for fernando poo button blood dances in the air fragile red bubbles before the tomblike slab of the un building dillingers breathing slows down he stares at the ruby eye atop the step pyramid hidden in the un building and he thinks of pentagons im a gods lightning carlo said this is no joke baby im going to do the whole bit his intense eyes burned into mine as the switchblade came out of his pocket motherfuckin commie he screamed suddenly leaping up so quickly that the chair fell over behind him youre not getting off with a beating this time im gonna cut your balls off and take them home as a souvenir he slashed forward with the knife deflecting his swing at the last minute made you jump you longhaired faggotty freak i wonder if you have any balls to cut off well ill find out he inched forward the knife weaving snakelike patterns in the air look i said desperately i know youre only playacting you dont know nothing baby maybe im fbi or cia maybe this is just an excuse to get you to go for the gun so i can kill you and claim selfdefense life isnt all demonstrations and playacting george there comes a time when it gets serious he lunged again with the knife and i stumbled clumsily backward are you going to take the gun or am i going to cut your balls off and tell the group youre no fucking good and we couldnt use you he was totally mad and i was totally sane is that a more flattering way of telling it instead of the truth that he was brave and i was yellow listen i said i know you wont really stab me and you know i wont really shoot you shit on you know and i know carlo hit me in the chest with his free hand hard im a gods lightning really a gods lightning im gonna do the whole scene this is a test but the test is for real he hit me again jarring my balance then slapped my face twice rapidly back and forth like a windshield wiper i always said you longhaired commie freaks dont have no guts you cant even fight back you cant even feel angry can you you just feel sorry for yourself right it was too damned true a nerve twinged deep down inside at the unfairness of it of his ability to see into me more than i usually dared see into myself and at last i grabbed the gun from the table screaming you sadistic stalinist sonofabitch and look at the eagle simon says look real close that aint really no olive branch in his left claw baby thats our old friend maria juana you never really looked at a dollar bill before did you and the real symbolism of the pyramid is alchemical of course the traditional code represents the three kinds of sex by a cube a pyramid and a sphere the cube is that travesty we call normal sex in which the two nervous systems never actually merge at the orgasm like the two parallel sides of the cube the pyramid is the two coming together and joining the magicaltelepathic orgasm the sphere is the tantric ritual endlessly prolonged with no orgasm at all the alchemists used that code for over two thousand years the rosicrucians among the founding fathers used the pyramid as a symbol of their kind of sex magic aleister crowley used that symbol the same way more recently the eye on the pyramid is the two minds meeting neurological interlock the opening of the eye of shiva ewige schlangekraftthe eternal serpent power the joining of the rose and cross vagina and penis into rosecross the astral leap mind escaping from physiology the aum was supposed to work almost instantly according to what the scientists at elf had told hagbard so joe approached the first man who had sampled the punch and started a conversation nice talk smiling jim gave he said earnestly i rammed the gun into carlos gut and saw him go white about the lips no dont worry i said smiling im not using it on you but when i come back therell be a dead pig on the streets somewhere in morningside heights he started to speak and i jabbed downward with the gun grinning as he gasped for air comrade i added yeah smiling jim was born with a silver tongue the other man said a silver tongue joe agreed solemnly then added holding out his hand by the way im jim mallison from the new york delegation knew by your accent the other said shrewdly im clem cotex from down little rock they shook pleasure to meet you too bad about that kid that got thrown out joe said lowering his voice it looked to me like that usher really was you know touching him cotex looked surprised for a moment but then shook his head in doubt cant tell nowadays especially in big cities do you really think an andy frain usher could be a fairy like you said nowadays in big cities joe shrugged im just saying that it looked like it to me of course maybe the usher isnt one maybe hes just a cheap thief who was trying to pick the kids pocket a lot of that goes on these days too cotex involuntarily reached back to check his own wallet and joe went on blandly but i wouldnt rule out the other not by a long shot what sort of man would want to be an usher at a kcuf meeting if you stop and think about it you must have observed how many homosexuals there are in our organization what cotexs eyes bulged you havent noticed it joe smiled loftily there are very few of us who are really christians most of the membership are just a little bit lavender know what i mean i think its one of our biggest problems and we ought to bring it out into the open and discuss it frankly clear the air right for instance take the way smiling jim always puts his arm around your shoulder when he talks to you cotex interrupted hey mister youre pretty darn bright just now hit me like a flash some of the men here when smiling jim showed those beaver shots to prove how bad some magazines are getting they really shuddered they didnt just disapprove it really honesttopete revolted them what kind of man actually finds a naked lady disgusting go baby go joe thought the aum is working he quickly derailed the conversation another thing that bothers me why dont we ever challenge the spherical earth theory huh look joe said if all the scientists and eggheads and commies and liberals are pushing it in our schools all the time there must be something a little fishy about it did you ever stop to think that theres no way just no way at all to reconcile a spherical earth with the story of the flood or joshuas miracle or jesus standing on the pinnacle of the temple and seeing all the kingdoms of the earth and i ask you man to man in all your travels have you ever seen the curvature anywhere every place ive been is flat are we going to trust the bible and the evidence of our own senses or are we going to listen to a bunch of agnostics and atheists in laboratory smocks but the earths shadow on the moon during an eclipse joe took a dime out of his pocket and held it up this casts a circular shadow but its flat not spherical cotex stared into space for a long moment while joe waited with suppressed excitement you know something cotex said finally all the bible miracles and our own travels and the shadow on the moon would make sense if the earth was shaped like a carrot and all the continents were on the flat end praise be to simons god bugs bunny joe thought elatedly its happening hes not only gullible hes creative i followed the cop the pig i corrected myself out of the cafeteria i was so keyed up that it was a trip the blue of his uniform the neon signs even the green of the lampposts all were coming in super bright that was adrenalin my mouth was dry dehydration all the classic flightfight symptoms the activation syndrome skinner calls it i let the cop the pig get half a block ahead and reached in my pocket for the revolver come on george malik shouted george didnt want to move his heart was thumping his arms and legs trembling so hard he knew theyd be useless to him in a fight but he just didnt want to move hed had enough of running from these motherfuckers but he couldnt help himself as the men in blue shirts and white helmets came on the crowd surged away from them and george had to move back with the crowd or be knocked down and trampled come on george it was pete jackson at his side now with a good hard grip on his arm tugging him goddam it why do we have to run away from them george said stumbling backward peter was smiling faintly dont you read your mao george enemy attacks we retreat let the morituri fanatics stand and get creamed i couldnt do it my hand held the gun but i couldnt take it out and hold it in front of me any more than i could take out my penis and wave it around i was sure even though the street was empty except for me and the pig that a dozen people would jump out of doorways yelling look he took it out of his pants just like right now when hagbard said button up your asshole were in for a fight i stood frozen like i stood frozen on the embankment above the passaic are you on an ego trip playing at being a revolutionary carlo asked and mavis all the militant radicals in your crowd ever do is take out the molotov cocktail diagram that they carefully clipped from the new york review of books hang it on the bathroom door and jackoff in connection with it howard sang the foe is attacking their ships coming near now is the time to fight without fear now is the time to look death in the eye before we submit well fight till we die this time i got the gun out of my pocket standing there looking down at the passaic and raised it to my forehead if i didnt have the courage for homicide jesus knows i have despair enough for a hundred suicides and i only have to do it once just once and then oblivion i cock the firing pin more playacting george or will you really do it ill do it damn you damn all of you i pull the trigger and fall with the explosion into blackness aum was a product of the scientists at elf the erisian liberation front and shared by them with the jams an extract of hemp boosted with rna the learning molecule it also had small traces of the famous frisco speedball heroin cocaine and lsd the effect seemed to be that the heroin stilled anxiety the rna stimulated creativity the hemp and acid opened the mind to joy and the cocaine was there to fit the law of fives the delicate balance created no hallucinations no sense of high just a sudden spurt in what hagbard celine liked to call constructive gullibility it was one of those sudden shifts of movement that occur in a mob scene instead of pushing george and peter back the crowd between them and the white helmets were parting a slender man fell heavily against george anguish in his eyes there was a terrible thump and the man fell to the ground george saw the dark brown wooden cross before he saw the man who wielded it there was blood and hair at the end of the crossarm the gods lightning man was dark broad and muscular with a blue shadow on his cheeks he looked italian or spanish he looked in fact a lot like carlo his eyes were wide and his mouth was open and he was breathing heavily the expression was neither rage nor sadistic joy just the unthinking panting alertness of a man doing a difficult and fatiguing job he bent over the fallen slender man and raised the cross all right snapped peter jackson he pushed george aside there was a sillylooking yellow plastic water pistol in his hand he squirted the oblivious gods lightning man in the back of the neck the man screamed arched backward the cross flying end over end into the air he fell on his back and lay screaming and writhing come on now motherfucker pete snarled as he dragged george into the crowd brokenfield running toward fortysecond street an hour and a half to go hagbard says finally beginning to show suppressed tension george checks his watch its exactly pm ingolstadt time the plastic canoe is wailing krishna krishna hare hare under the noon sun two days earlier carmel speeds in his jeep away from las vegas who am i going to meet at the norton cabal joe asks judge crater amelia earhart nothing would surprise me now a few real together people simon replies but no one like that but youll have to die really die man before youre illuminated he smiles gently aside from death and resurrection you wont find anything youd call supernatural with this bunch not even a whiff of old chicagostyle satanism god joe says was that only a week ago yep simon grins gunning his vw around a chevrolet with oregon license plates its still nineteen sixtynine even if you seem to have lived several years since we met at the anarchist caucus his eyes are amused as he half turns to glance at joe i suppose that means you know whats been happening in my dreams im getting the flash forwards already always happens after a good dirty black mass with pot mixed in the incense simon says what sort of thing you getting is it happening when youre awake yet no only in my dreams joe pauses thinking i only know its the real article because the dreams are so vivid one set has to do with some kind of procensorship rally at the sheratonchicago hotel i think about a year from now theres another set that seems farther in the future five or six years where im impersonating a doctor for some reason and a third group of images comes to me now and then that seems to be the set of a frankenstein movie except that the extras are all hippies and there seems to be a rock festival going on does it bother you a little im used to waking up in the morning with the future ahead of me not behind me and ahead of me both youll get used to it youre just beginning to contact what old weishaupt called die morgensheutegesternwelf the tomorrowtodayyesterday world it gave goethe the idea for faust just like weishaupts ewige blumenkraft slogan inspired goethes ewige weibliche ill tell you what simon suggested you might try wearing three wristwatches like bucky fuller does one showing the time where youre at one showing the tune where youre going and one showing the time at some arbitrary place like greenwich mean time or your home town itll help you get used to relativity meanwhile never whistle while youre pissing and you might repeat to yourself when you get disoriented fullers sentence i seem to be a verb they drove in silence for a while and joe pondered on being a verb hell he thought i have enough trouble understanding what fuller means when he says god is a verb simon let him mull it over and began humming again rameses the second is dead my lovehes walking the fields where the blessed liiiiive joe realized he was starting to doze and all the faces at the luncheon table looked at him in astonishment no seriously he said anthropologists are too timid to say it out in the open in public but corner one of them in private and ask him every detail was clear it was the same room in the sheratonchicago hotel and the faces were the same ive been here before and said this before the rain dances of the indians work the rain always comes so why isnt it possible that their gods are real and ours isnt have you ever prayed to jesus for something and really gotten it there is a long silence and finally an old tightfaced woman smiles youthfully and declares young man im going to try it how do meet an indian in chicago like tomahawks the crosses of gods lightning rose and fell on the slender mans defenseless skull theyd found their injured comrade lying on the street twisting and moaning beside his erstwhile victim a couple of them hauled the wounded gods lightning man away while the rest took their revenge on the unconscious peace demonstrator you luke says yeshua ben yosef dont write that down spacetime then may be slanted or kiltered when youre lost out here fernando poo looks through his glass at a new island not guessing that it will be named after himself not imagining that someday simon moon will write in fourteen hundred and seventy two fernando poo discovered fernando poo and hagbard says truth is a tiger while timothy leary does a crown point pavanne out of san luis obispo jail and four billion years earlier one squink says to another ive solved the ecology problem on this new planet the other squink partner to the first they own swift kick inc the shoddiest contractors in the milky way says how the first squink laughs coarsely every organism produced will be programmed with a death trip itll give them a rather gloomy outlook i admit especially the more conscious ones but it will sure minimize costs for us swift kick inc cut the edges every other way they could think and earth emerged as the horrible example invoked in all classes on planetary design throughout the galaxy when burroughs told me that i flipped because i was that year and lived on clark street besides i immediately saw the application to the law of fives and clark has letters i was mulling this over when i happened to notice the shipwreck in pounds canto thats the only shipwreck mentioned in the whole page poem in spite of all the nautical voyages described canto also contains the line with the sun in a golden cup which yeats says inspired his own lines the golden apples of the sun the silver apples of the moon golden apples of course brought me back to eris and i realized i was onto something hot then i tried adding the illuminati five to and i got the average menstrual period of woman the lunar cycle back to the silver apples of the moon and im moon of course pound and yeats both have five letters in their names if this be schizophrenia i said with a p henry twist one better than an o henry twist make the most of it i looked deeper through a bullhorn a police captain began to shout clear the plaza clear the plaza the first reports of the annihilation camps were passed on to the oss by a swiss businessman evaluated as being one of the most trustworthy informants on affairs in nazi europe the state department decided that the stories were not confirmed that was early in by autumn of that year more urgent reports from the same source transmitted still through the oss forced a major policy conference it was again decided that the reports were not true as winter began the english government asked for another conference to discuss similar reports from their own intelligence networks and from the government of rumania the delegates met in bermuda for a warm sunny weekend and decided that the reports were not true they returned to their work refreshed and tanned the death trains continued to roll early in henry morgenthau jr secretary of the treasury was reached by dissenters in the state department examined the evidence and forced a meeting with president franklin delano roosevelt shaken by the assertions in morgenthaus documents roosevelt pledged that he would act at once he never did it was said later that the state department convinced him once again of their own analysis the reports simply were not true when mr hitler said vernichtung he had not really meant vemichtung an author ben hecht then placed an ad in the new york times presenting the evidence to the public a group of prominent rabbis attacked him for alarming jews unnecessarily and undermining confidence in americas chief executive during wartime finally late that year american and russian troops began liberating the camps and general eisenhower insisted that news photographers take detailed movies which were released to the whole world in the interval between the first suppressed report by the swiss businessman and the liberation of the first camp six million people had died thats what we call a bavarian fire drill simon explained to joe it was another time he was driving another volkswagen in fact it was the night of april and they were going to meet tobias knight at the un building it was one official named winifred whod been transferred from the justice department to a key state department desk where every bit of evidence passed for evaluation but the same principles apply everywhere for instance were half an hour early for the meeting anyhowill give you an illustration right now they were approaching the corner of fortythird street and third avenue and simon had observed that the streetlight was changing to red as he stopped the car he opened the door and said to joe follow me puzzled joe got out as simon ran to the car behind them beat on the hood with his hand and shouted bavarian fire drill out he made vigorous but ambiguous motions with his hands and ran to the car next back joe saw the first subject look dubiously at his companion and then open the door and get out obediently trailing behind simons urgent and somber figure bavarian fire drill out simon was already shouting at the third car back as joe trotted along occasionally adding his own voice to persuade the more dubious drivers every car gradually emptied and people formed a neat line heading back toward lexington avenue simon then ducked between two cars and began jogging toward the front of the line at third avenue again shouting to everybody complete circle stay in line obediently everyone followed in a great circle back to their own cars reentering from the side opposite to that from which they had left simon and joe climbed back into the vw the light changed and they sped ahead you see simon asked use words theyve been conditioned to since childhood fire drill stay in line like that and never look back to see if theyre obeying theyll follow well thats the way the illuminati guaranteed that the final solution wouldnt be interrupted winifred one guy who had been around long enough to have an impressive title and his scrawl evaluation dubious on the bottom of each memo and six million died hilarious isnt it and joe remembered from the little book by hagbard celine never whistle while youre pissing privately printed and distributed only to members of the jams and the legion of dynamic discord the individual act of obedience is the cornerstone not only of the strength of authoritarian society but also of its weakness on november the body of stanislaus oedipuski fortysix of west living park road was found floating in the chicago river death according to the police laboratory did not result from drowning but from beating about the head and shoulders with a squareended object the first inquiries by homicide detectives revealed that oedipuski had been a member of gods lightning and the theory was formed that a conflict between the dead man and his former colleagues might have resulted in his being snuffed with their wooden crosses further investigation revealed that oedipuski had been a construction worker and until very recently well liked on his job behaving in a normal downtoearth manner bitching about the government cursing the lazy bums on welfare hating niggers shouting obscene remarks at goodlooking dolls who passed construction sites and when the odds were safely above the tol level joining other middleaged workers in attacking and beating young men with long hair peace buttons or other unamerican stigmata then about a month before all that had changed he began bitching about the bosses as well as the government almost sounding like a communist at times when somebody else cussed the crumbbums on welfare stan remarked thoughtfully well you know our union keeps them from getting jobs fellows so what else can they do but go on welfare steal he even said once when some of the guys were goodhumoredly giving the finger and making other gallant noises and signals toward a passing eighteenyearold girl hey you know that might really be embarrassing and scaring her worse yet his own hair begun to grow surprisingly long in the back and his wife told friends that he didnt look at tv much anymore but instead sat in a chair most evenings reading books the police found that was indeed true and his small library gathered in less than a month was remarkable indeed featuring works on astronomy sociology oriental mysticism darwins origin of the species detective novels by raymond chandler alice in wonderland and a collegelevel text on number theory with the section on primes heavily marked with notes in the margin the gallant and now pathetic tracks of a mind that was beginning to grow after four decades of stagnation and then had been abruptly stomped most mysterious of all was the card found in the dead mans pocket which although waterlogged could still be read one side said there is no enemy anywhere and the other side even more mysteriously was inscribed the police might have tried to decipher this but then they discovered that oedipuski had resigned from gods lightning giving his fellow members a lecture on tolerance in the process the night before his death that closed the case definitely homicide did not investigate murders clearly connected with gods lightning since the red squad had its own personal accommodation with that burgeoning organization poor motherfucker a detective said looking at oedipuskis photographs and closed the file forever nobody ever reopened it or traced the change in the dead man back to his attendance at the meeting one month before of kcuf at the sheratonchicago where the punch was spiked with aum in the act of conception of course the father contributes chromosomes and the mother contributes another in the ching hexagram has connotations of sinking or breaking apart shades of the unfortunate captain clarks another woman just came by collecting for the mothers march against muscular dystrophy i gave her a quarter where was i oh yes james joyce had five letters in both his front name and his hind name so he was worth looking into a portrait of the artist has five chapters all well and good but ulysses has chapters a stumper until i remembered that how about finnegans wake alas that has chapters and i was bogged down for a while trying another angle i wondered if frank sullivan the poor cluck who got shot instead of john at the biograph theatre that night could have lingered until after midnight dying on july instead of july as usually stated i looked it up in tolands book the dillinger days poor frank sad to say died before midnight but toland included an interesting detail which i told you that night at the seminary bar people died of heat prostration that day in chicago he added something else people had died of heat prostration the day before why did he mention that im sure he doesnt know but there it was again and maybe something important is going to happen in the year i couldnt check that of course you cant navigate precisely in the morgensheutegesternwelt so i went back to and struck golden apples that was the year adam smith and adam weishaupt were both born and smith published the wealth of nations the same year weishaupt revived the illuminati well fitting the law of fives but fitting nothing where did that leave me eight i reflected is the number of letters in kallisti back to the golden apple again and is also hot damn naturally it came as no surprise when the defendants in the chicago conspiracy trial which grew out of our little convention week carnival were tried on the rd floor of the federal building amid a flurry of synchronicity a hoffman among the defendants a hoffman as judge the illuminati pyramid or great seal of the us right inside the door of the building and a scale getting worse abuse than the other defendants fiveletter names and proliferatingabbie davis foran scale jerry rubin twice and the clincher clark ramsey not captain who was torpedoed and sunk by the judge before he could testify i got interested in dutch shultz because he died on october a cluster of synchronicity that man he ordered the shooting of vincent mad dog coll remember mad dog texas coll was shot on rd street when he was years old and charlie workman who allegedly shot schultz served years in prison for it although rumor has it that mendy weiss two fiveletter names again did the real shooting does come in you bet shultz was first sentenced to prison at the age of around this time i bought robert heinleins the puppet masters thinking the plot might parallel some illuminati operations imagine how i felt when chapter two began hours and minutes ago a flying saucer landed in iowa and in new york peter jackson is trying to get the next issue of confrontation out on time although the office is still a shambles the editor and star researcher have disappeared the best reporter has gone ape and claims to be at the bottom of the atlantic with a wax tycoon and the police are hounding peter to find out why the first two detectives assigned to the case cant be located sitting in his apartment now the magazines office in his shut and shorts peter dials his phone with one hand adding another crushed cigarette to the pile in the ashtray with the other throwing a manuscript onto a basket marked ready for printer he crosses off lead article the youngest student ever admitted to columbia tells why he dropped out by l l durrutti from a list on the pad before him his pencil moves down to the bottom book review as he listens to the phone ring finally he hears the click of a lifted receiver and a rich flutey voice says epicene wildeblood here got your book review ready eppy have it tomorrow dear boy cant be any faster honestly tomorrow will do peter says writing call againam next to book review its a dreadfully long monster of a book wildeblood says pettishly and i certainly wont have time to read it but im giving it a thorough skimming the authors are utterly incompetent no sense of style or structure at all it starts out as a detective story switches to sciencefiction then goes off into the supernatural and is full of the most detailed information of dozens of ghastly boring subjects and the time sequence is all out of order in a very pretentious imitation of faulkner and joyce worst yet it has the most raunchy sex scenes thrown in just to make it sell im sure and the authors whom ive never heard of have the supreme bad taste to introduce real political figures into this mishmash and pretend to be exposing a real conspiracy you can be sure i wont waste time reading such rubbish but ill have a perfectly devastating review ready for you by tomorrow noon well we dont expect you to read every book you review peter says mollifyingly just so long as you can be entertaining about them the foot fetishist liberation front will be participating in the rally at the un building joe malik said as george and peter and he were affixing their black armbands christ jackson said disgustedly we cant afford to take that attitude joe said severely the only hope for the left at this time is coalition politics we cant exclude anybody who wants to join us ive got nothing against faggots personally peter begins gays joe says patiently ive got nothing against gays personally peter goes on but they are a bringdown at rallies they just give gods lightning more evidence to say were all a bunch of fruits but ok realism is realism there are a lot of them and they swell our ranks and all that but jesus joe these toe freaks are a splinter within a splinter theyre microscopic dont call them toe freaks joe says they dont like that a woman from the mothers march against psoriasis just came by with another collection box i gave her a quarter too the marching mothers are going to strip moon of his bread if this keeps up where was i i meant to add in relation to the dutch shultz shooting that marty krompier who ran the policy racket in harlem was also shot on october the police asked him if there was a connection with phlegmatic flegenheimers demise and he said its got to be one of them coincidences i wonder how he emphasized that one of them coincidences or one of them coincidences how much did he know that brings me to the enigma as pointed out the number of letters in kallisti x more interestingly without invoking the mystic we still arrive at by adding what then is the significance of ive run through various associationsjesus had his days in the desert ali baba had his thieves buddhists have their meditations the solar system is almost exactly astronomical units in radius pluto yoyos a bitbut i have no definite theory yet the color television set in the three lions pub in the tudor hotel at fortysecond street and second avenue shows the whitehelmeted men carrying wooden crosses fall back as the bluehelmeted men carrying billy clubs move forward the cbs camera pans over the plaza there are five bodies on the ground scattered like flotsam tossed on a beach by a receding wave four of them are moving making slow efforts to get up the fifth is not moving at all george said i think thats the guy we saw getting clubbed my god i hope he isnt dead joe malik said if he is dead it may get people to demand that something be done about gods lightning peter jackson laughed mirthlessly you still think some honky peacenik getting killed is going to make people indignant dont you understand nobody in this country cares what happens to a peace freak youre in the same boat with the niggers now you silly sonsofbitches carlos looked up in astonishment as i burst into the room still wet from the passaic and threw the gun at his feet screaming you silly sonsofbitches you cant even make bombs without blowing yourselves up and when you buy a gun the motherfucker is defective and misfires you cant expel mei quit you silly sonsofbitches you silly sonsofbitches simon shouted joe woke as the vw swerved amid a flurry of hells angels bike roaring by he was back in real time again but the word had quotes around it in his mind now and it always would wow he said i was in chicago again and then at that rock festival and then i was in somebody elses lifeline goddam harleydavidsons simon mutters as the last angel thunders by when fifty or sixty of them swarm by like that its as bad as trying to drive on the sidewalk in times square at high noon without hitting a pedestrian laterforthat joe said conscious of his growing ease in using simons own language this tomorrowtodayyesterday time is beginning to get under my skin its happening more and more often simon sighed you want words to put around it you cant accept it until it has labels dangling off it like a new suit ok and your favorite wordgame is science fine right on tomorrow well drop by the main library and you can look up the english science journal nature for summer nineteen sixtysix theres an article in there by the university college physicist f r stannard about what he calls the faustian universe he tells how the behavior of kmesons cant be explained assuming a oneway timetrack but fits into a neat pattern if you assume our universe overlaps another where time runs in the opposite direction he calls it the faustian universe but ill bet he has no idea that goethe wrote faust after experiencing that universe directly just as youre doing lately incidentally stannard points out that everything in physics is symmetrical except our present concept of oneway time once you admit twoway time traffic youve got a completely symmetrical universe fits the occamites demand for simplicity stannardll give you lots of words man meanwhile just settle for what abdul alhazred wrote in the necronomicon past present future all are one in yogsothoth or what weishaupt wrote in his konigen kirchen und dummheit there is but one eye and it is all eyes one mind and it is all minds one time and it is now grok joe nods dubiously faintly hearing the music rama rama rama haaaaare two big rhinoceroses three big rhinoceroses dillinger made contact with the mind of richard belz fortythreeyearold professor of physics at queens college as belz was being loaded into an ambulance to be taken to bellevue hospital where x rays would reveal severe skull fractures shit dillinger thought why does somebody have to be half dead before i can reach him then he concentrated on his message two universes flowing in opposite directions two together form a third entity which is synergetically more than the sum of its two parts thus two always leads to three two and three duality and trinity every unity is a duality and a trinity a pentagon sheer energy no matter involved from the pentagon depend five more pentagons like the petals of a flower a white rose five petals and a center six two times three the flower interlocks with another flower just like it forming a polyhedron made of pentagons each such polyhedron could have common surfaces with other polyhedrons forming infinite latticework based on the pentagonal unit they would be immortal selfsustaining not computers beyond computers gods all space for their habitation infinitely complex the howl of a siren reached the unconscious ears of professor belz consciousness is present in the living body even in one that is apparently unconscious unconsciousness is not the absence of consciousness but its temporary immobility it is not a state resembling death it is not like death at all once the necessary complexity of braincell interconnections is reached substantial energy relationships are set up these can exist independently of the material base that brought them into being all of this of course is merely visual structural metaphor for interactions on the energy level that cannot be visualized the siren howled in the three lions pub george said to peter what was in that water pistol sulphuric acid acid is just the first stage said simon like matter is the first stage of life and consciousness acid launches you but once youre out there if the mission is successful you jettison the first stage and youre traveling free of gravity which means free of matter acid dissolves the barriers which prevent the maximum possible complexity of energy relationships from building up in the brain at norton cabal well show you how to pilot the second stage waving their crosses over their heads and howling incoherently the men of gods lightning formed wavering ranks and marched around the territory they had conquered zev hirsch and frank ochuk carried the banner that read love it or well stomp you howard sang the tribes of the porpoise are fearless and strong our land is the ocean our banners a song our weapon is speed and our noses like rock no foe can withstand our terrible shock a cloud of porpoise bodies swam out from somewhere behind hagbards submarine through the pale bluegreen medium which hagbards tv cameras made out of water they seemed to fly toward the distant spiderlike ships of the illuminati whats happening said george wheres howard howard is leading them said hagbard he flipped a toggle on the railing of the balcony on which they stood in the center of a globe that looked like a bubble of air at the bottom of the atlantic ocean war room get missiles ready we may have to back up the porpoise attack da tovarish celine came a voice the porpoises were too far away to be seen now george discovered that he was not afraid the whole thing was too much like watching a sciencefiction movie there was too much illusion involved in this submarine of hagbards if he were able to realize in his glands and nerves that he was in a vulnerable metal ship thousands of feet below the surface of the atlantic under such enormous pressure that the slightest stress could crack the hull and send water bursting in that would crush them to death then he might be afraid if he were really able to accept the fact that those little distant globes with waving legs appended to them were undersea craft manned by people who intended to destroy the vessel he was in then he could be afraid actually if he could not see as much as he was seeing but only feel and sense things and be told what was happening as in the average airplane flight then he would be afraid as it was the yearold city of peos looked like a tabletop model and though he might intellectually accept hagbards statement that they were over the lost continent of atlantis in his bones he didnt believe in atlantis as a result he didnt believe in any of the rest of this either suddenly howard was outside their bubble or some other porpoise that was another thing that made this hard to accept talking porpoises ready for destruction of enemy ships said howard hagbard shook his head i wish we could communicate with them i wish i could give them a chance to surrender but they wouldnt listen and they have communications systems on their ships that i cant get through to he turned to george they use a type of insulated telepathy to communicate the very thing that tipped off sheriff jim cartwright that you were in a hotel room in mad dog smoking weishaupts wonder weed you dont want them too close when they go said howard are your people out of the way said hagbard five big rhinoceroses six big rhinoceroses of course quit this hesitating this is no time to be a humanitarian the sea is crueler than the land said hagbard sometimes the sea is cleaner than the land said howard theres no hate just death when and as needed these people have been your enemies for twenty thousand years im not that old said hagbard and i have very few enemies if you wait any longer youll endanger the submarine and my people george looked out at the red and white striped globes which were moving toward them through the bluegreen water they were much larger now and closer whatever was propelling them wasnt visible hagbard reached out a brown finger let it rest on a white button on the railing in front of him then pressed it decisively there was a bright flash of light dimmed slightly by the medium through which it traveled on the surface of each of the globes it was like watching fireworks through tinted glasses next the globes crumbled as if they were pingpong balls being struck by invisible sledge hammers thats all there is to it said hagbard quietly the air around george seemed to vibrate and the floor under him shook suddenly he was terrified feeling the shock wave from the simultaneous explosions out there in the water made it real a relatively thin metal shell was all that protected him from total annihilation and nobody would ever hear from him or know what happened to him large glittering objects drifted down through the water from one of the nearby illuminati spider ships they vanished among the streets of the city that george now knew was real the buildings in the area near the explosion of the illuminati ships looked more ruined than they had before the ocean bottom was churned up in brown clouds down into the brown clouds drifted the crushed spider ships george looked for the temple of tethys it stood intact in the distance did you see those statues fall out of the lead ship said hagbard im claiming them he hit the switch on the railing prepare for salvage operation they dropped down among buildings deeply buried in sediment and at the bottom of their television globe george saw two huge claws reach out seemingly from nowhere actually he guessed from the underside of the submarine and pick up four gleaming gold statues that lay halfburied in the mud suddenly a bell rang and a red flash lit up the interior of the bubble were under attack again said hagbard oh no george thought not when im starting to believe that all this is real i wont be able to stand it here goes dorn doing his worldfamous coward act again hagbard pointed a white globe hovered like an underwater moon above a distant range of mountains on its pale surface a red emblem was painted a glaring eye inside a triangle give me missile visibility said hagbard flicking a switch between the white globe and the lief erickson four orange lights appeared in the water rushing toward them it just doesnt pay to underestimate them ever said hagbard first it turns out they can detect me when they shouldnt have equipment good enough to do that now i find that not only do they have small craft in the vicinity theyve got the zwack herself coming after me and the zwack is firing underwater missiles at me though im supposed to be indetectable i think we might be in trouble george george wanted to close his eyes but he also didnt want to show fear in front of hagbard he wondered what death at the bottom of the atlantic would feel like probably something like being under a pile driver the water would hit them engulf them and it wouldnt be like any ordinary water it would be like liquid steel every drop striking with the force of a tenton truck prying cell apart from cell and crushing each cell individually reducing the body to a protoplasmic dishrag he remembered reading about the disappearance of an atomic submarine called the thresher back in the s and he recalled that the new york times had speculated that death by drowning in water under extreme pressure would be exceedingly painful though brief every nerve individually being crushed the spinal cord crushed everywhere along its length the brain squeezed to death bursting rupturing bleeding into the steelhard water the human form would doubtless be unrecognizable in minutes george thought of every bug he had ever stepped on and bugs made him think of the spider ships thats what we did to them and i define them as enemies only on hagbards say so carlo was right i cant kill hagbard hesitated didnt he yes but he did it any man who can cause a death like that to be visited upon other men is a monster no not a monster only too human but not my kind of human shit george hes your kind of human all right youre just a coward cowardice doth make consciences for us all hagbard called out howard where the hell are you the torpedo shape appeared on the right side of the bubble over here hagbard weve got more mines ready we can go after those missiles with mines like we did the spider ships think that would work its dangerous said hagbard because the missiles might explode on contact with the metal and electronic equipment in the mines were willing to try said howard and without another word he swam away wait a minute hagbard said i dont like this theres too much danger to the porpoises he turned to george and shook his head im not risking a goddamned thing and they stand to be blown to bits its not right im not that important you are risking something said george trying to control the quaver in his voice those missiles will destroy us if the dolphins dont stop them at that moment there were four blinding flashes where the orange lights had been george gripped the railing sensing that the shock wave of these explosions would be worse than that caused by the destruction of the spider ships it came george had been readying himself for it but unable to tell when it would come and it still took him by surprise everything shook violently then the bottom dropped out of his stomach as if the submarine had suddenly leaped up george grabbed the railing with both arms clinging to it as the only solid thing near him o god were gonna be killed he cried they got the missiles hagbard said that gives us a fighting chance laser crew attempt to puncture the zwack fire at will howard reappeared outside the bubble how did your people do hagbard asked him all four of them were killed said howard the missiles exploded when they approached them just as you predicted george who was standing up straight now thankful that hagbard had simply ignored his episode of terror said they were killed saving our lives im sorry it happened howard laserbeam firing hagbard a voice announced there was a pause i think we hit them you neednt be sorry said howard we neither look forward to death in fear nor back upon it in sorrow especially when someone has died doing something worthwhile death is the end of one illusion and the beginning of another what other illusion asked george when youre dead youre dead right energy can neither be created nor destroyed said hagbard death itself is an illusion these people were talking like some of the zen students and acid mystics george had known if i could feel that way he thought i wouldnt be such a goddamned coward howard and hagbard must be enlightened ive got to become enlightened i cant stand living this way any more whatever it took acid alone wasnt the answer george had tried acid already and he knew that while the experience might be wholly remarkable for him it left little residue in terms of changed attitudes or behavior of course if you thought your attitudes and behavior should change you mimicked other acidheads ill try to find out whats happening to the zwack said howard and swam away the porpoises do not fear death they do not avoid suffering they are not assailed by conflicts between intellect and feeling and they are not worried about being ignorant of things in other words they have not decided that they know the difference between good and evil and in consequence they do not consider themselves sinners understand very few humans consider themselves sinners nowadays said george but everyone is afraid of death all human beings consider themselves sinners its just about the deepest oldest and most universal human hangup there is in fact its almost impossible to speak of it in terms that dont confirm it to say that human beings have a universal hangup as i just did is to restate the belief that all men are sinners in different languages in that sense the book of genesis which was written by early semitic opponents of the illuminati is quite right to arrive at a cultural turning point where you decide that all human conduct can be classified in one of two categories good and evil is what creates all sin plus anxiety hatred guilt depression all the peculiarly human emotions and of course such a classification is the very antithesis of creativity to the creative mind there is no right or wrong every action is an experiment and every experiment yields its fruit in knowledge to the moralist every action can be judged as right or wrong and mind you in advance without knowing what its consequences are going to be depending upon the mental disposition of the actor thus the men who burned giordano bruno at the stake knew they were doing good even though the consequence of their actions was to deprive the world of a great scientist if you can never be sure whether what you are doing is good or bad said george arent you liable to be pretty hamletlike he was feeling much better now much less afraid even though the enemy was still presumably out there trying to kill him maybe he was getting darshan from hagbard whats so bad about being hamletlike said hagbard anyway the answer is no because you only become hesitant when you believe there is such a thing as good and evil and that your action may be one or the other and youre not sure which that was the whole point about hamlet if you remember the play it was his conscience that made him indecisive so he should have murdered a whole lot of people in the first act hagbard laughed not necessarily he might have decisively killed his uncle at the earliest opportunity thus saving the lives of everyone else or he might have said hey am i really obligated to avenge my fathers death and done nothing he was due to succeed to the throne anyway if he had just bided his time everyone would have been a lot better off there would have been no deaths and the norwegians would not have conquered the danes as they did in the last scene of the last act though being norwegian myself i would hardly begrudge fortinbras his triumph at that moment howard appeared again outside their bubble the zwack is retreating your laser beam punctured the outer shell causing a leak in the fuelstorage cells and putting excessive stress on the pressureresisting system they were forced to climb to higher levels which put them so far away from you that theyre now heading south toward the tip of africa hagbard expelled a great sigh of relief that means theyre heading for their home base theyll enter a tunnel in the persian gulf which will bring them into the great underground sea of valusia which is deepest beneath the himalayas that was the first base they established they were preparing it even before the fall of high atlantis its devilishly well defended one day well penetrate it though the thing that puzzled joe most after his illuminization was john dillingers penis the rumors about the smithsonian institute he knew were true even though any casual phonecaller would get a flat denial from institute officials certain highplaced government people could provide a dispensation and the relic would be shown in the legendary alcohol bottle all legendary inches of it but if john was alive it wasnt his and if it wasnt his whose was it frank sullivans simon said when joe finally asked him and who the hell was frank sullivan to have a tool like that but simon only answered i dont know just some guy who looked like john atlantis also bothered joe after he saw it the first time hagbard took him for a ride in the lief erikson it was all too pat too plausible too good to be true especially the ruins of cities like peos with their architecture that obviously combined egyptian and mayan elements science has been flying on instruments like a pilot in a fog ever since nineteen hundred he said casually to hagbard on the return trip to new york this was in according to his later recollections fall of almost two years exactly after the test of aum in chicago youve been reading bucky fuller was hagbards cool reply or was it korzybski never mind who ive been reading joe said directly the thought in my head is that i never saw atlantis any more than i ever saw marilyn monroe i saw moving pictures which you told me were television reception of cameras outside your sub and i saw moving pictures of what hollywood assured me was a real woman even though she looked more like a design by petty or vargas in the marilyn monroe case it is reasonable to believe what i am told i dont believe a robot that good has been built yet but atlantis i know specialeffects men who could build a city like that on a tabletop and have dinosaurs walking through it and your cameras trained on it you suspect me of trickery hagbard asked raising his eyebrows trickery is your metier joe said bluntly you are the beethoven the rockefeller the michelangelo of deception the shakespeare of the gypsy switch the twoheaded nickel and the rabbit in the hat what little liver pills are to carter lies are to you you dwell in a world of trapdoors sliding panels and hindu ropetricks do i suspect you since i met you i suspect everybody im glad to hear it hagbard grinned you are well on your way to paranoia take this card and keep it in your wallet when you begin to understand it youll be ready for your next promotion just remember ifs not true unless it makes you laugh that is the one and sole and infallible test of all ideas that will ever be presented to you and be handed joe a card saying there is no friend anywhere burroughs incidentally although he discovered the synchronicity principle is unaware of the correlation with this makes it even more interesting that his date for the invasion of earth by the nova mob in nova express is september when i asked him how he picked that date he said it just came to him out of the air damn i was just interrupted by another woman collecting for the mothers march against hernia i only gave her a dime w the rd letter keeps popping up in all this note weishaupt washington william s burroughs charlie workman mendy weiss len weinglass in the conspiracy trial and others who will quickly come to mind even more interesting the first physicist to apply the concept of synchronicity to physics after jung published the theory was wolfgang pauli another suggestive letternumber transformation adam weishaupt aw is and george washington gw is spot the hidden in there but perhaps i grow too imaginative even whimsical there was a click george turned all the time hed been in the control center with hagbard he had never looked back at the door through which he had come he was surprised to see that it looked like an opening in thin air or thin water on either side of the doorway was bluegreen water and a dark horizon which was actually the ocean bottom then in the center the doorway itself and a golden light silhouetting the figure of a beautiful woman mavis strode onto the balcony pulling the door shut behind her she was wearing forestgreen tights with white patent leather boots and a wide white belt her small but wellshaped breasts jiggled naturally under her blouse george found himself thinking back to the scene on the beach that was only this morning and what time was it anyway what time where back in florida it was probably two or three in the afternoon which would make it one pm in mad dog texas and probably about six out here in the atlantic did time zones extend beneath the water he supposed they did on the other hand if you were at the north pole you could skip around the pole and be in a different time zone every few seconds and cross the international date line every five minutes if you wanted to which would not he reminded himself make it possible to travel hi time but if he could go back to this morning and replay maviss demand for sex this time he would respond he now wanted her desperately well and good but why did she say he was not a schmuck why did she imply admiration for him because he would not fuck her if he had fucked her because she asked him and he felt he should but without wanting to he would have been a pure and simple schmuck but he could have pronged her simply because she would have been nice to fuck regardless of whether she would have admired him or despised him but that was their gamemaviss and hagbards game of saying i do what i want to do and i dont give a damn what you think george cared a great deal about what other people thought so not fucking mavis at the time was at least honest even if he was beginning to see some merit in the discordian he supposed it was discordian attitude of super selfsufficiency mavis smiled at him well george had your baptism of fire george shrugged well there was the mad dog jail and ive been in a few other bad scenes for instance there was the time i held a pistol to my head and pulled the trigger shed sucked his cock hed watched her in manic masturbation but he was desperate to get inside her all the way up the womb riding her ovarian trolley to the wonderful land of fuck as henry miller said what the hell was so special about maviss cunt especially after that induction ceremony scene hell stella marls seemed like a less neurotic woman and was certainly a classic lay after stella maris who needed mavis a sudden question struck him how did he know hed laid stella it could have been mavis inside that golden apple it could have been some woman hed never met he was pretty sure it was a woman unless it was a goat or a cow or a sheep best not put that kind of joke past hagbard either but even if it was a woman why visualize stella or mavis or somebody like them it was probably some diseased old etruscan whore that hagbard kept around for religious purposes some sibyl some wop witch maybe it was hagbards rotten old sicilian mother with no teeth a black shawl and three kinds of vd no it was hagbards father who was sicilian his mother was norwegian what color were they he said suddenly to hagbard who the atlanteans oh hagbard nodded they were covered with fur over most of their bodies like any normal ape at least the high atlanteans were a mutation occurred around the time of the hour of the evil eye the catastrophe that destroyed high atlantis later atlanteans like modern humans were hairless those of the oldest atlantean ancestry tend to be rather furry george couldnt help looking down at hagbards hand as it rested on the railing it was covered with thick black hair all right said hagbard its time to head back to our north american base howard you out there the long streamlined shape performed a somersault on their right whats happening hagbard have some of your people keep an eye on things here weve got work to do on land andhoward as long as i live i will be in debt to your people for the four who died to save me havent you and the lief erickson saved us from several kinds of deaths planned for us by the shore people said howard well keep watch over atlantis for you and the seas in general and that which atlantis has spawned hail and farewell hagbard and other friends the sea is wide and the sea is deep but warm as blood through it there rolls a tide of friendship that will keep us close in oceans blackest holes he was gone lift off hagbard called george felt the surge of the subs colossal engines and they were sailing high above the hills and valleys of atlantis with the special lighting of hagbards television screen system it seemed much like flying in a jet plane over one of the continents above the oceans surface too bad we dont have time to get deeper into atlantis said hagbard there are many mighty cities to see though of course none of them can approach the cities that existed before the hour of the evil eye how many of these atlantean civilizations were there asked george basically two one leading up to the hour and one afterward before the hour there was a civilization of about a million human beings on this continent technically they were further advanced than the human race is today they had atomic power space travel genetic technology and much else this civilization was struck a death blow in the hour of the evil eye twothirds of them were killed almost half the human population of the planet at that time after the hour something made it impossible for them to make a comeback the cities that came through the first catastrophe relatively undamaged were destroyed in later disasters the inhabitants of atlantis were reduced to savagery in a generation part of the continent sank under the sea which was the beginning of the process that ended when all of atlantis was under water as it is today was this the earthquakes and tidal waves that you always read about george asked no said hagbard with a curious closed expression it was manmade high atlantis was destroyed in a kind of war probably a civil war since there was no other power on the planet that could have matched them anyway if thered been a victor theyd still be around now said george they are said mavis the victors are still around only theyre not what you might visualize not a conquering nation and we are the descendants of the defeated now said hagbard im going to show you something i promised when we first met it has to do with the catastrophe ive been talking about look there the submarine had risen high above the continent and it was possible to see landscapes stretching for hundreds of miles looking in the direction in which hagbard pointed george saw a vast expanse of black glazed plain out of its center jutted something white and pointed like a canine tooth it is said of them that they even controlled the comets in their courses said hagbard he pointed again the submarine sailed closer to the jutting white object it was a foursided white pyramid dont say it said mavis giving him a warning look and george remembered the tattoo he had seen between her breasts he looked down again they were above the pyramid now and george could see the side that had been hidden from him as they approached he saw what he had halffeared halfexpected to see a bloodred design in the shape of a baleful eye the pyramid of the eye hagbard said it stood in the center of the capital of high atlantis it was built in the last days of that civilization by the founders of the worlds first religion it doesnt look very big from up here but its five times the size of the great pyramid of cheops which was modeled after it its made of an imperishable ceramic substance which repels even ocean sediment as if the builders knew that to last it would have to survive tens of thousands of years of ocean burial and maybe depending on who they were they did know that or maybe they just built well in those days peos as you saw was a pretty durable city and that was built after high atlantis fell by the second civilization i spoke of that second civilization reached a level somewhat more advanced than that of the greeks and romans but it was nothing like its predecessor and some malevolent force seemed bent on destroying it too and it was destroyed about ten thousand years ago of that civilization we have the evidence of ruins but of high atlantis we have only records and legends dug up from the later civilization and of course poetry from the porpoise corpus this is the only artifact this pyramid but its existence and durability prove that as long ago as ten egypts a race of men existed whose technology was far advanced beyond what we know today so advanced that it took twenty thousand years for that civilizations successor culture to disappear completely the men who destroyed high atlantis did their best to make it disappear but they couldnt quite manage it the pyramid of the eye for instance is indestructible though its probable that they didnt want to destroy it mavis nodded somberly that is their most sacred shrine in other words said george youre telling me that the people who destroyed atlantis still exist do they have the powers they had then substantially yes said hagbard is this the illuminati you told me about illuminati or ancient illuminated seers of bavaria is one of the names they have used yes so they didnt start in seventeen seventysix they go a long way back before that right right said mavis then why did you lie to me about their history and why the hell havent they taken over the world by now if theyre all that powerful when our ancestors were savages they could have dominated them completely hagbard replied i lied to you because the human mind can only accept a little of the truth at a time also initiation into discordianism has stages the answer to the other question is complicated but ill try to give it to you simply there are five reasons first there are organizations like the discordians which are almost as powerful and which know almost as much as the illuminati and which are able to thwart them second the illuminati are too small a group to enjoy the creative crossfertilization necessary to progress of any kind and they have been unable to advance much beyond the technological level they reached thirty thousand years ago like chinese mandarins third the illuminati are hamstrung in their actions by the superstitious beliefs that set them apart from the other atlanteans as i told you theyre the worlds first religion fourth the illuminati are too sophisticated ruthless and decadent to want to take over the world it amuses them to play with world fifth the illuminati do rule the world and everything that happens happens by their sufferance those reasons contradict each other said george thats the nature of logical thought ah propositions are true in some sense false in some sense and meaningless in some sense hagbard didnt smile the submarine had described a great arc as they talked and now the pyramid of the eye was far behind them the eye itself since it faced eastward was no longer visible below george could see the ruins of several small cities at the edges of tall cliffs that fell away into darker depths cliffs that doubtless had been the seacoast of atlantis at one time hagbard said ive got a job for you george youre going to like it and youre going to want to do it but it is going to make you shit a brick well talk about it when we get to chesapeake base now though lets go down into the hold and have a look at our acquisitions he flicked a switch fuckup get your finger out of your ass and drive this thing for a while ill see the statues later said mavis ive got other things to do just now george followed hagbard down carpeted staircases and halls paneled in glowing polished oak at last they came to a large hall which was apparently paved with marble flagstones a group of men and women wearing horizontally striped nautical shirts similar to hagbards were clustered around four tall statues in the center of the room when hagbard entered the room they stopped talking and stepped away to give him a clear look at the sculptures the floor was covered with puddles of water and the statues themselves were dripping no wiping them dry hagbard said every molecule is precious just as it is and the less disturbed the better he stepped closer to the nearest one and looked at it for a long moment what do you say about a thing like this its beyond exquisite can you imagine what their art was like before the disaster and to think the unbroken circle destroyed every trace of it except for that crude stupid pyramid which is the greatest piece of ceramic technology in the history of the human race said one of the women george looked around for stella maris but she wasnt there wheres stella he asked hagbard upstairs minding the store shell see them later the sculptures were unlike the work of any culture george knew which was to be expected after all they were at once realistic fanciful and abstractly intellectual they bore resemblance to egyptian and mayan classical greek chinese and gothic combined with a surprisingly modernlooking note there were some qualities in the statues that were totally unique though qualities doubtless lost by the civilizations to which atlantis was ancestral but that might have been found in known world art had there been other civilizations to preserve and emphasize them this george realized was the urart and looking at the statues was like hearing a sentence in the first language spoken by men an elderly sailor pointed at the statue farthest from where they were standing look at that beatific smile a woman thought of that statue ill bet thats every womans dream to be totally selfsufficient some of the time joshua said the oriental woman who had spoken before but not all of the time now what i prefer is that she pointed to another statue hagbard laughed you think thats just nice healthy oragenitalism tsuhsi but the child in the womans arms is the son without a father the selfbegotten and the couple at the base represent the unbroken circle of gruad usually its a serpent with its tail in its mouth but in some of the earlier representations the couple in oral intercourse symbolizes sterile lust the unloved mother has her foot on the mans head to indicate that she conquers lust the whole sculpture is the product of the foulest cult to come out of atlantis they originated human sacrifice first they practiced castration but then they escalated to killing men instead of just cutting off their balls later when women were subjugated the sacrifice became a virgin female supposedly to give her to the unloved ones while she was still pure that halo around the childs head looks like the peace symbol said george peace symbol my ass said hagbard thats the oldest symbol of evil there is of course in the cult of the unbroken circle it was a symbol of good but thats the same difference they cant have been so vicious if they produced that statue said the oriental woman stubbornly could you deduce the spanish inquisition from a painting of the manger at bethlehem said hagbard dont be naive miss mao he turned to george the value of any one of these statues is beyond calculation but not many people know that im sending you to one who doesrobert putney drake one of the finest art connoisseurs in the world and the head of the american branch of the world crime syndicate youre going to see him with a gift from me these four statues the illuminati were planning to buy his support with gold from the temple of tethys im going to get to him first if they only needed four statues why were they trying to raise the whole temple george asked i think they wanted to remove the temple to agharti their stronghold under the himalayas for safekeeping i havent been any closer to the temple of tethys than we were today but i suspect its a treasurehouse of evidence of high atlantis as such it would be something the illuminati would want to remove until now there was no reason to because no one had access to the sea bottom other than the illuminati now i can get around down here just as well better in fact than they can and pretty soon others will be following several nations and many groups of private persons are exploring the undersea world its time for the illuminati to finish taking away whatever tells of high atlantis will they destroy that city we saw and what about the pyramid of the eye hagbard shook his head theyd be willing to let later atlantean ruins to be found that wouldnt say anything about their existence as for the pyramid of the eye i suspect they have a real problem with that they cant destroy it and even if they could they wouldnt want to but its a dead giveaway to the existence of a supercivilization in the past well said george not at all wanting to meet the head of the american crime syndicate what we ought to do is go back and raise the temple of tethys ourselves before the illuminati grab it good grief said miss mao this happens to be the most critical moment in the history of this civilization we dont have time to fiddlefuck around with archeology hes just a legionnaire said hagbard though after this mission hell know the fairest and become a deacon hell understand more then george i want you to act as a gobetween for the discordian movement and the syndicate youre going to bring these four statues to robert putney drake and tell him there are more where they came from ask drake to stop working for the illuminati to take the heat off our people wherever hes after them and to drop the assassination project the illuminati have been working on with him and as an earnest of good faith hes to snuff twentyfour illuminati agents for us in the next twentyfour hours their names will be contained in a sealed envelope which youll give him fives sex here is wisdom the mumble of the breast is the mutter of man states attorney milo a flanagan stood on the roof of the high rise condominium on lake shore drive in which he lived scanning bluegray lake michigan with powerful binoculars it was april and project tethys should be completed at any moment flanagan expected to sight what would look like another great lakes freighter heading for the chicago river locks only this one would be carrying a dismantled atlantean temple crated in its hold the ship would be recognizable by a red triangle painted on the funnel after being inspected by flanagan whose name in the order was brother johann beghard and after his report had been sent on to vigilance lodge the north american command center the crated temple would be moved downriver to saint louis where by prior agreement with the president of the united states it would be trucked overland to fort knox under the guard of the us army the president didnt know with whom he was dealing the cia had informed him that the source of the artifacts was the livonian nationalist movement now behind the iron curtain and that the crates would contain livonian art treasures certain high officers in the cia did know the real nature of the organization which the us was helping because they were members of it of course the syndicate without even a cover story was keeping threequarters of its gold in with the government store at fort knox these days where could you find a safer place robert putney drake once asked but the freighter was behind schedule the wind battered at flanagan whipping his wavy white hair and the welltailored jacket sleeves and trouser legs the goddamned chicago wind flanagan had been fighting it all his life it had made him the man he was police sergeant otto waterhouse emerged from the doorway to the roof waterhouse was a member of flanagans personal staff which meant he was on the police department payroll the syndicate payroll and another payroll that regularly deposited a fixed sum in the account of herr otto wasserhaus in a bavarian bank waterhouse was a sixandahalffoottall black man who had made a career for himself in the chicago police department by being more willing and eager to harass torture maim and kill members of his race than the average mississippi sheriff flanagan had early spotted waterhouses icecold selfhating love affair with death and had attached him to his staff a message from cfr communications center in new york said waterhouse the word has come through from ingolstadt that project tethys was aborted flanagan lowered his binoculars and turned to look at waterhouse the states attorneys florid face with its bushy pepperandsalt eyebrows was shrewd and distinguished the sort of face people vote for especially in chicago it was a face that had once belonged to a kid who had run with the hamburgers in chicagos south side irish ghetto and bashed out the brains of black men with cobblestones for the fun of it it was a face that had come from that primitive beginning to knowing about tenthousandyearold sunken temples spider ships and international conspiracies it was stamped indelibly with the lines of milo a flanagans ancestors the ancestors of the gauls britons scots picts welsh and irish around the time the temple of tethys was sinking into the sea they had been driven forth on orders from agharti from that thick ancient forest that is now the desert country of outer mongolia but flanagan was only a fourthdegree illuminatus and not fully instructed in the history though he did not display much emotion there were bluewhite flames of murderous madness burning deep in his eyes waterhouse was one of the few people in chicago who could meet flanagans baleful stare headon how did it happen flanagan asked they were attacked by porpoises and an invisible submarine the spider craft were all blown to bits the zwack came in and counterattacked was damaged by a laser beam and forced to disengage how did they find out we had spider ships at the temple site maybe the porpoises told them flanagan looked at waterhouse coldly and thoughtfully maybe it leaked at this end otto there are jams active in this town more here than anywhere in the country right now dillinger has been spotted twice in the last week by gruad how id like to be the one to really get him once and for all what would hoovers ghost say then huh otto flanagan grinned one of his rare genuine smiles exposing prominent canine teeth we know theres a jam cult center somewhere on the north side someones been stealing hosts from my brothers church for the past ten years even at times when ive had as many as thirty men staked out there and my brother says that there have been more cases of demonic possession in his parish in the last five years than in all of chicago in all its previous history one of our sensitives has reported emanations of the old woman in this area at least once a month during the past year its long past time we found them they could be reading our minds otto that could be the leak why havent we got a fix on them waterhouse who only a few years ago had known nothing more unconventional than how to turn a homicide into killed while resisting arrest looked back calmly at flanagan and said we need ten sensitives of the fifth grade to form the pentacle and weve only got seven flanagan shook his head there are seventeen fifth graders in europe eight in africa and twentythree scattered around the rest of the world youd think they could spare us three for a week thats all it would take waterhouse said maybe youve got enemies in the higher circle maybe somebody wants to see us get it why the hell do you say things like that waterhouse just to fuck you up man eight floors below in an apartment which was regularly used for black masses a north clark street hippie named skip lynch opened his eyes and looked at simon moon and padre pederastia times getting very short he said weve got to finish off flanagan soon it cant be too soon for me said padre pederastia if daddy hadnt favored him so outrageously hed be the priest today and id be states attorney simon nodded but then wed be snuffing you instead of milo anyway i believe george dorn will be taking care of the problem for us right now squinks it all began with the squinks and that sentence is more true than you will realize until long after this mission is over mr muldoon it was the night of february and it was dark and windy in ingolstadt in fact adam weishaupts study looked like a set for a frankenstein movie with its windows rattling and candles flickering and old adam himself casting terrifying shadows as he paced back and forth with his peculiar lurching gait at least the shadows were terrifying to him because he was flying high on the new hemp extract that kolmer had brought back from his last visit to baghdad to calm himself he was repeating his english vocabularybuilding drill working on the new words for that week tomahawk succotash squink squink he laughed out loud the word was skunk but he had shortcircuited from there to squid and emerged with squink a new word a new concept but what would a squink look like midway between a squid and a skunk no doubt it would have eight arms and smell to hoch himmel a horrible thought it reminded him uncomfortably of the shoggoths in that damnable necronomicon that kolnier was always trying to get him to read when he was stoned saying that was the only way to understand it he lurched over to the black magic and pornography section of his bookshelves which he kept sardonically next to his bible commentaries and took down the longforbidden volume of the visions of the mad poet abdul alhazred he turned to the first drawing of a shoggoth strange he thought how a creature so foul could also from certain angles and especially when you were high look vaguely like a crazily grinning rabbit du haxen hase he chortled to himself then his mind made the leap five sides on the borders on the shoggoth sketches five sides always on all the shoggoth sketches and squid and skunk both had five letters in them he held up his hands looked at the five fingers on each and began to laugh it was all clear suddenly the sign of the horns made by holding up the first two fingers in a v and folding the other three down the two the three and their union in the five father son and holy devil the duality of good and evil the trinity of the godhead the bicycle and the tricycle he laughed louder and louder looking despite his long thin face like the chinese statues of the laughing buddha while the gas chambers were operating other features of life in the camps were also contributing to the final solution at auschwitz for instance many perished from beatings and other forms of ill treatment but the general neglect of elementary sanitary and health precautions had the most memorable results first there was spotted fever then paratyphoid fever and abdominal typhus erysipelas tuberculosis of course was rampant and particularly amusing to certain of the officers incurable diarrhea brought death to many inmates degrading as it killed no attempt was made either to prevent the ubiquitous camp rats from attacking those too ill to move or defend themselves never before witnessed by twentiethcentury doctors noma also appeared and was recognized only from the descriptions in old textbooks it is the complication of malnutrition which eats holes in the cheeks until you can see right through to the teeth vernichtung a survivor said later is the most terrible word in any language even so the aztecs grew more frantic toward the end increasing the number of sacrifices doubling and tripling the days of the year that called for spilled blood but nothing saved them just as eisenhowers army advanced across europe to end the ovens of auschwitz cortez and his ships moved toward the great pyramid the statue of tlaloc the confrontation seven hours after simon spoke of george dorn to padre pederastia a private jet painted gold landed at kennedy international airport four heavy crates were moved by crane from the belly of the plane into a truck which bore on its side the sign gold amp appel transfers a young man with shoulderlength blond hair wearing a fashionable cutaway and knee breeches of red velvet with bottlegreen silk stockings stepped down from the plane and climbed into the cab of the truck holding an alligator briefcase in his lap he sat silently beside the driver tobias knight the driver kept his thoughts to himself and asked no questions george dorn was frightened it was a feeling he was getting used to so accustomed in fact that it no longer seemed to stop him from doing insane things besides hagbard had given him a talisman against harm assuring him that it was percent infallible george slipped it out of his pocket and glanced at it again curiously and with a wan hope it was goldtinted card with the strange glyphs it was probably another of hagbards jokes george decided it might even be etruscan for kick this boob in the ass hagbards refusal to translate it suggested some such celinean irony and yet he had seemed very sober almost religious about the symbols one thing was sure george was still frightened but the fear was no longer paralyzing if i was this casual about fear a few years ago he thought thered be one less cop in new york and i wouldnt be here either probably no thats not right either i would have told carlo to go fuck himself i wouldnt have let the fear of being called a copout stop me george had been scared when he went to mad dog when harry coin tried to fuck him up the ass when harry coin was killed when he escaped from the mad dog jail when he saw his own death just as he was coming and when the illuminati spider ships had attacked the lief erickson being scared was beginning to seem a normal condition to him so now he was going to meet the men who ran organized crime in the us he knew practically nothing about the syndicate and the mafia and what little he did know he tended to disbelieve on the grounds that it was probably myth hagbard had sketched in a little additional information for him while he was preparing for this flight but the one thing that george was absolutely certain about was that he was going unprotected among men who killed human beings as easily as a housewife kills silverfish and he was supposed to negotiate with them the syndicate had been working with the illuminati until now now they were supposed to switch over to the discordians on georges sayso with of course the help of four priceless statues except what were robert putney drake and federico maldonado going to say when they heard these statues had been dredged up from the bottom of the ocean floor out of the ruins of atlantis they would probably express their skepticism with pistols and send george back to the place he claimed the statues came from why me george had asked hagbard earlier that day why me hagbard repeated with a smile the question asked by the soldier as the enemy bullets whistle around him by the harmless homeowner as the homicidal maniac steps through the kitchen door hunting knife in hand by the woman who has given birth to a dead baby by the prophet who has just had a revelation of the word of god by the artist who knows his latest painting is a work of genius why you because youre there schmuck because something has to happen to you ok but what if i fuck it up i dont know anything about your organization or the syndicate if times are as crucial as you say its silly to send somebody like me on this mission i have no experience meeting people like this hagbard shook his head impatiently you underrate yourself just because youre young and afraid you think you cant talk to people thats stupid and its not typical of your generation so you should be all the more ashamed of yourself furthermore you are experienced with even worse people than drake and maldonado you spent part of a night in a cell with the man who killed john f kennedy what george felt the blood rush out of his face and he thought he might faint oh sure said hagbard casually joe malik was on the right track when he sent you to mad dog you know after all that hagbard told george he was perfectly free to turn down the mission if he didnt want to go and george said he would go for the same reason he had agreed to accompany hagbard on his golden submarine because he knew that he would have been a fool to pass up the experience a twohour drive brought the truck to the outskirts of blue point long island to the gates of an estate two heavyset men in green coveralls searched george and the driver pointed the bellshaped nozzle of an instrument at the truck and studied some dials and then waved them through they drove up a winding narrow asphalt road through woods just beginning to show the light green budding of early spring shadowy figures prowled among the trees suddenly the road burst out of the woods and into a meadow from here there was a long gentle rising slope to the top of a hill that was crowned by houses from the edge of the woods george could see four large comfortablelooking cottages each three stories high a little smaller than newport a little larger than atlantic city they were made of brick painted in seaside pastel colors and formed a semicircle on the crest of the hill the grass of the meadow was cut very short and halfway up the hill it became a beautifully manicured lawn the woods screened the houses from the road the meadow made it impossible for anyone emerging from woods to approach the houses without being seen and the houses themselves constituted the elements of a fortress the gold amp appel truck followed the driveway which led between two of the houses rolling over slots in the driveway where a section might be hydraulically raised to form a wall the driver stopped at a gesture from one of two men in khakis who approached george could now see the syndicate fortress consisted of eight separate houses forming an octagon around a lawn each house had its own fencedin yard and george noticed with surprise that there was play equipment for children in front of several cottages in the center of the compound was a tall white pole from which sew an american flag george and the driver stepped down from the cab of the truck george identified himself and was ushered to the far side of the compound the hill was much steeper on this side george saw it sloped down to a narrow boulderstrewn beach drenched by huge atlantic waves a nice view george thought and eminently secure the only way drakes enemies could get at him would be to shell his home from a destroyer a slender blond man at least sixty and maybe a wellpreserved seventy came down the steps of the house george was approaching he had a concave nose that ended in a sharp point a strong cleft chin iceblue eyes he shook hands vigorously hi im drake the others are inside lets go oh is it ok with you if we go ahead and unload your truck he gave george a sharp birdlike look george realized with a sinking feeling that drake was saying that they would take the statues regardless of whether any deal went through why then should they inconvenience themselves by changing sides in this underground war but he nodded in acquiescence youre young arent you said drake as they went into the house but thats the way it is nowadays boys do mens work the house was handsome inside but not as one might expect incredible the carpets were thick the woodwork heavy dark and polished the furnishings probably genuine antiques george didnt see how atlantean statues would fit into the decor there was a painting at the top of the stairs to the second floor of a woman who looked slightly like queen elizabeth ii she wore a white gown with diamonds at her neck and wrists two small fragilelooking blond boys in navy blue suits with white satin ties stood with her staring solemnly out of the painting my wife and sons said drake with a smile they entered a large study full of mahogany oak paneling leather bound books and red and green leather furniture theodore roosevelt would have loved it george thought over the desk hung a painting of a bearded man in elizabethan costume he was holding a bowling ball in his hand and looking superciliously at a messenger type who pointing out to sea there were sailing ships in the distant background an ancestor said drake simply he pressed a button in a panel on the desk a door opened and two men came in the first a tall young chinese with a bony face and unruly black hair the second a short thin man who bore a faint resemblance to pope paul vi don federico maldonado a man of the greatest respect said drake and richard jung my chief counselor george shook hands with both of them he couldnt understand why maldonado was known as banananose his proboscis was on the large side but bore little resemblance to a banana it was more like an eggplant the name must be a sample of low sicilian humor the two men took seats on a red leather couch george and drake sank into armchairs facing them and how are my favorite musicians doing jung said genially was this some kind of password george was sure of one thing his survival depended on sticking absolutely to truth and sincerity with these people so he said very sincerely i dont know who are your favorite musicians jung smiled back saying nothing until george his heart racing inside his chest like a hamster determined to run clear off the treadmill reached into his briefcase and took out a parchment scroll this he said is the fundamental agreement proposed by the people i represent he handed it to drake maldonado he noticed was staring fixedly expressionlessly at him in the most unnerving way the mans eyes looked as if they were made of glass his face was a waxen mask he was george decided a wax dummy of pope paul vi which had been stolen from madame tussauds dressed in a business suit and brought to life to serve as the head of the mafia george had always thought there was something witchy about sicilians do we sign this in blood said drake removing the clothofgold ribbon from the parchment and unrolling it george laughed nervously pen and ink will do fine sauls angry triumphant eyes stare into mine and i look away guiltily let me explain i say desperately i really am trying to help you your mind is a bomb what weishaupt discovered that night of february second seventeen seventysix hagbard celine explained to joe malik in on a clear autumn day in miami about the same time that captain tequilla y mota was reading luttwak on the coup detat and making his first moves toward recruiting the officers cabal that later seized fernando poo was basically a simple mathematical relationship its so simple in fact that most administrators and bureaucrats never notice it lust as the householder doesnt notice the humble termite until its too late here take this paper and figure for yourself how many permutations are there in a system of four elements joe recalling his high school math wrote xxx and read aloud his answer twentyfour and if youre one ofthe elements the number of coalitions or to be sinister conspiracies that you may have to confront would be twentythree despite simon moons obsessions the twentythree has no particularly mystic significance hagbard added quickly just consider it pragmatically its a number of possible relationships which the brain can remember and handle but now suppose the system has five elements joe wrote xxxx and read aloud one hundred and twenty you see one always encounters jumps of that size when dealing with permutations and combinations but as i say administrators as a rule arent aware of this korzybski pointed out back in the early thirties that nobody should ever directly supervise more than four subordinates because the twentyfour possible coalitions ordinary office politics can create are enough to tax any brain when it jumps up to one hundred and twenty the administrator is lost that in essence is the sociological aspect of the mysterious law of fives the illuminati always has five leaders in each nation and five international illuminati primi supervising all of them but each runs his own show more or less independent of the other four united only by their common commitment to the goal of gruad hagbard paused to relight his long black italian cigar now he said put yourself in the position of the head of any counterespionage organization imagine for instance that youre poor old mccone of the cia at the time of the first of the new wave of illuminati assassinations ten years ago in sixtythree oswald was of course a double agent as everybody always knew the russians wouldnt have let him out of russia without getting a commitment from him to do small jobs as theyre called in the business although hed be a sleeper that is hed go about his ordinary business most of the time and only be called on occasionally when he was in the right place at the right time for a particular small job now of course washington knows this they know that no expatriate comes back from moscow without some such agreement and moscow knows the other side that the state department wouldnt take him back unless he accepted a similar status with the cia then november twentysecond dealy plazablam the shit hits the fan moscow and washington both want to know the sooner the quicker who was he working for when he did it or was it his own idea two more possibilities loom at once could a loner with confused politics like him have been recruited by the cubans or the chinese and then the kicker could he be innocent could another group to avoid the obvious lets call them force x have stagemanaged the whole thing so youve got mvd and cia and fbi and whoall falling over each other sniffing around dallas and new orleans for clues and force x gets to seem more and more implausible to all of them because it is intrinsically incredible it is incredible because it has no skeleton no shape no flesh nothing they can grab hold of the reason is of course that force x is the illuminati working through five leaders with five times four times three times two times one or one hundred and twenty different basic vectors a conspiracy with one hundred and twenty vectors doesnt look like a conspiracy it looks like chaos the human mind cant grasp it and hence declares it nonexistent you see the illuminati is always careful to keep a random element in the one hundred and twenty vectors they didnt really need to recruit both the leaders of the ecology movement and the executives of the worst pollutionproducing corporations they did it to create ambiguity anybody who tries to describe their operations sounds like a paranoid what clinched it hagbard concluded was a real stroke of luck for the weishaupt gang there were two other elements involved which nobody had planned or foreseen one was the syndicate it always starts with nonsense simon is telling joe in another timetrack between los angeles and san francisco in weishaupt discovered the law of fives while he was stoned and looking at one of those shoggoth pictures you saw in arkham he imagined the shoggoth was a rabbit and said du hexen hase which has been preserved as an injoke by illuminati agents in hollywood it runs through the bugs bunny cartoons you wascal wabbit but out of that schizzy mixture of hallucination and logomania weishaupt saw both the mystic meaning of the five and its pragmatic application as a principal of international espionage using permutations and combinations that ill explain when we have a pencil and paper that same mixture of revelation and puton is always the language of the supraconscious whenever you contact it whether through magic religion psychedelics yoga or a spontaneous brain nova maybe the puton or nonsense part comes by contamination from the unconscious i dont know but its always there thats why serious people never discover anything of real importance you mean the mafia joe asks what i didnt say anything about the mafia are you in another timetrack again no not the mafia alone hagbard says the syndicate is much bigger than the maf the room returns to focus it is a restaurant a seafood restaurant on biscayne avenue facing the bay in miami in the walls are decorated with undersea motifs including a huge octopus hagbard undoubtedly had chosen this meeting place just because he liked the decor crazy bastard thinks hes captain nemo still weve got to deal with him as john says the jams cant do it alone hagbard grinning seemed to be noting joes return to present time youre reaching the critical stage he said changing the subject you now only have two mental states high on drugs and high without drugs thats very good but as i was saying the syndicate is more than just the maf the only syndicate up until october twentythird nineteen thirtyfive was nothing more than the mafia of course but then they killed the dutchman and a young psychology student who also happened to be a psychopath with a power drive like genghis khan was assigned to do a paper on how the dutchmans last words illustrate the similarity between somatic damage and schizophrenia the dutchman had a bullet in his gut while the police interviewed him and they recorded everything he said but on the surface it was all gibberish this psychology student wrote the paper that his professor expected and got an a for the course but he also wrote another interpretation of the dutchmans words for his own purposes he put copies in several bank vaults he came from one of the oldest banking families in new england and he was even then under family pressure to give up psychology and go into banking his name was robert putney drake visited zurich in he personally talked to carl jung about the archetypes of the collective unconscious the i ching and the principle of synchronicity he talked to people who had known james joyce before that drunken irish genius had moved to paris and learned much about joyces drunken claims to be a prophet he read the published portions of finnegans wake and went back for further conversations with jung then he met hermann hesse paul klee and the other members of the eastern brotherhood and joined them in a mescaline ritual a letter from his father arrived about then asking when he was going to give up wasting his time and return to harvard business school he wrote that he would return for the fall semester but not to study business administration a great psychologist was almost born then and harvard might have had its timothy leary scandal thirty years earlier except for drakes power drive i the faust parson singular napalm sundaes for how chow mein misfortunes cookie josephine malik lies trembling on the bed trying to be brave trying to hide her

you trying to turn me into barney muldoon my god now its happening when im awake as well as when im asleep simumultitaneously he hears the alarm and cries the illuminati must be attacking attacking this building saul asks confusedly building youre on a submarine man the lief erickson on its way to atlantis twenty big rhinoceroses twentyone big rhinoceroses number seventeen read professor curve law and anarchists will give the american people a speedy cadillac all the helen hokinson types are out today another one just hit me for the mothers march against dandruff i gave her a nickel was a very interesting year for the occult by the way not only did hitler join the illuminati and attempt the munich putsch but glancing through the books of charles fort i found quite a few suggestive events on march th which not only fits our it correlation but is also the anniversary of the defeat of the kronstadt rebellion the day the lord nelson statue was bombed in dublin in and of course good saint patricks holy day a naked man was seen mysteriously running about the estate of lord caernarvon in england he appeared several times in the following days but was never caught meanwhile lord caernarvon himself died in egypt some said he was a victim of the curse of tutankhamen whose tomb he had burglarized an archaeologist is a ghoul with credentials fort also records two cases that may of a synchronistic phenomenon he has traced through the centuries a volcanic eruption coinciding with the discovery of a new star in september there was a mumiai scare in indiamumiais are invisible demons that grab people in broad daylight throughout the year there were reports of exploding coal in england some tried to explain this by saying the embittered miners it was a time of labor troubles were putting dynamite in the coal but the police couldnt prove this the coal went on exploding in the summer french pilots began having strange mishaps whenever they flew over germany and it was suggested that the germans were testing an invisible ray machine considering the last three phenomena together invisible demons in india exploding coal in england invisible rays over germany i guess somebody was testing something you can call me doc iggy my full name at present is dr ignotum p ignotius the p stands for per if youre a latinist youll realize that translates as the unknown explained by the still more unknown i think its a quite appropriate name for my function tonight since simon brought you here to be illuminized my slave name before i was turned on myself is totally immaterial as far as im concerned your slave name is equally pointless and ill call you by the password of the norton cabal which simon used at the door until tomorrow morning when the drug starts wearing off you are u wascal wabbit thats u the initial not whyohyou by the way we accept bugs bunny as an exemplar of mummu here too but otherwise we have little in common with the sss thats the satanist surrealists and sadists the crew who began your illuminization in chicago all we share with them actually is use of the tristero anarchist postal system to evade the governments postal inspectors and a financial agreement whereby we accept their dmm scriptdivine marquis memorial script and they accept our hempscript and the flaxscript of the legion of dynamic discord anything to avoid federal reserve notes you know itll be a while yet before the acid starts working so ill just chat like this about things that are more or less trivial or quadrivial or maybe pentivialuntil i can see that youre ready for more serious matters simons in the chapel with a woman named stella who youll really dig getting things ready for the ceremony you might wonder why were called the norton cabal the name was chosen by my predecessor malaclypse the younger before he left us to join the more esoteric group known as elfthe erisian liberation front theyre the occidental branch of the hung mung tong cong and all their efforts go into a longrange antiilluminati project known only as operation mindfuck but thats another very complicated story one of malaclypses last writings before he went into the silence was a short paragraph saying everybody understands mickey mouse few understand hermann hesse hardly anyone understands albert einstein and nobody understands emperor norton i guess malaclypse was already into the mindfuck mystique when he wrote that who was emperor norton joe asks wondering if the drug is beginning to work already or dr ignotius just has a tendency to speak more slowly than most people joshua norton emperor of the united states and protector of mexico san francisco is proud of him he lived in the last century and got to be emperor by proclaiming himself as such for some mysterious reason the newspapers decided to humor him and printed his proclamations when he started issuing his own money the local banks went along with the joke and accepted it on par with us currency when the vigilantes got into a lynching mood one night and decided to go down to chinatown and kill some chinese emperor norton stopped them just by standing in the street with his eyes closed reciting the lords prayer are you beginning to understand emperor norton a little mr wabbit a little joe said a little well chew on this for a while friend there were two very sane and rational anarchists who lived about the same time as emperor norton across the country in massachusetts william green and lysander spooner they also realized the value of having competing currencies instead of one uniform state currency and they tried logical arguments empirical demonstrations and legal suits to get this idea accepted they accomplished nothing the government broke its own laws to find ways to suppress greens mutual bank and spooners peoples bank thats because they were obviously sane and their currency did pose a real threat to the monopoly of the illuminati but emperor norton was so crazy that people humored him and his currency was allowed to circulate think about it you might begin to understand why bugs bunny is our symbol and why our currency has the ridiculous name hempscript hagbard celine and his discordians even more absurdly call their money flaxscript that commemorates the zen master who was asked what is the buddha and replied five pounds of flax do you begin to see the full dimensions of our struggle with the illuminati at least for now you can probably grasp this much their fundamental fallacy is the aneristic delusion they really believe in law n order as a matter of fact since everybody in this crazy millenniaold battle has his own theory about what the illuminati are really aiming at i might as well tell you mine i think theyre all scientists and they want to set up a scientific world government the jacobins were probably following precise illuminati instructions when they sacked the churches in paris and proclaimed the dawn of the age of reason you know the story about the old man who was in the crowd when louis xvi went to the guillotine and who shouted as the kings head fell jacques de molay thou art avenged all the symbols that de molay introduced into masonry are scientific implements the tsquare the architects triangle even that pyramid that has caused so much bizarre speculation if you count the eye as part of the design the pyramid has divisions you know not whats mean simple multiply it by five in accordance with weishaupts funfwissenschaft the science of fives and you get the days of the year the damn thing is some kind of astronomical computer like stonehenge the egyptian pyramids are facing to the east where the sun rises the great pyramid of the mayans has exactly divisions and is also facing to the east what theyre doing is worshipping the order they have found in nature never realizing that they projected the order there with their own instruments thats why they hate ordinary mankind because were so disorderly theyve been trying for six or seven thousand years to reestablish atlantisstyle high civilization law n order the body politic as they like to call it a giant robot is what their body politic really amounts to you know a place for everything and everything in its place a place for everybody and everybody in his place look at the pentagon look at the whole army for goddesss sake thats what they want the planet to be like efficient mechanical orderly very orderly and inhuman thats the essence of the aneristic delusion to imagine you have found order and then to start manipulating the quirky eccentric chaotic things that really exist into some kind of platoons or phalanxes that correspond to your concept of the order theyre supposed to manifest of course the quirkiest most chaotic things that exist are other people and thats why theyre so obsessed with trying to control us why are you staring like that am i changing colors or growing bigger or something good the acid is starting to work now we can really get to the nittygritty first of all most of what ive been telling you is bullshit the iiluminati have no millenniaold history neither do the jams they invented their great heritage and tradition jacques de molay and charlemagne and all of it out of whole cloth in picking up all sorts of outofcontext history to make it seem plausible weve done the same you might wonder why we copy them and even deceive our own recruits about this well part of illumination and weve got to be illuminized ourselves to fight them is in learning to doubt everything thats why hagbard has that painting in his stateroom saying think for yourself schmuck and why hassan i sabbah said nothing is true youve got to learn to doubt us too and everything we tell you there are no honest men on this voyage in fact maybe this part is the only lie ive told you all evening and the illuminati history before really is true and not an invention or maybe were just a front for the illuminati to recruit you indirectly feeling paranoid good illumination is on the other side of absolute terror and the only terror that is truly absolute is the horror of realizing that you cant believe anything youve ever been told you have to realize fully that you are a stranger and afraid in a world you never made like houseman says twentytwo big rhinoceroses twentythree big rhinoceroses the illuminati basically were structurefreaks hence their hangup on symbols of geometric law and architectural permanence especially the pyramid and the pentagon gods lightning like all authoritarian judeochristian heresies had its own share of this typically occidental straightline mystique which was why even the jews among them like zev hirsch accepted the symbol first suggested by atlanta hope that most euclidean of all religious emblems the cross the discordians made their own sardonic commentary on the legal and scientific basis of law v order by using a step pyramid being a number with virtually no interesting geometric arithmetic or mystic properties outside of java where it was the basis of a particularly weird musical scale and topping it with the apple of discord symbol of the unrational ungeometrical and thoroughly disorderly spontaneity of the vegetable world of creative evolution the erisian liberation front elf had no symbol and when asked for one by new recruits replied loftily that their symbol could not be pictured since it was a circle whose circumference was everywhere and its center nowhere they were the most farout group of all and only the most advanced discordians could begin to understand their gibberish the jams however had a symbol that anyone could understand and just as harry pierpont showed it to john dillinger midway through a nutmeg high in michigan city prison dr ignotius showed it to joe midway through his first acid trip this he said dramatically is the sacred chao thats a symbol of technocracy joe said giggling well dr ignotius smiled at least youre original nine out of ten new members mistake it for the chinese yinyang or the astrological symbol of cancer its similar to both of them and also to the symbols of the northern pacific railroad and the sex information and education council of the united states all of which is eventually going to lead to some interesting documents being produced at john birch headquarters im sure proving that sex educators run the railroads or that astrologers control the sex educators or something of that sort no this is different it is the sacred chao symbol of mummu god of chaos on the right o nobly born you will see the image of your female and intuitive nature called yin by the chinese the yin contains an apple which is the golden apple of eris the forbidden apple of eve and the apple which used to disappear from the stage of the flatbush burlesque house in brooklyn when linda larue did the split on top of it at the climax of her striptease it represents the erotic libidinal anarchistic and subjective values worshiped by hagbard celine and our friends in the legion of dynamic discord now o nobly born as you prepare for total awakening turn your eyes to the left yang side of the sacred chao this is the image of your male rationalistic ego it contains the pentagon of the illuminati the satanists and the us army it represents the anal authoritarian structural law n order values which the illuminati have imposed through their puppet governments on most of the peoples of the world this is what you must understand o newborn buddha neither side is complete or true or real each is an abstraction a fallacy nature is a seamless web in which both sides are in perpetual war which is another name for perpetual peace the equation always balances increase one side and the other side increases by itself every homosexual is a latent heterosexual every authoritarian cop is the shell over an anarchistic libido there is no vernichtung no final solution no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and you are not saul goodman when youre lost out here listen the chaos you experience under lsd is not an illusion the orderly world you imagine you experience under the artificial and poisonous diet which the illuminati have forced on all civilized nations is the real illusion i am not saying what you are hearing the only good fnord is a dead fnord never whistle while youre pissing an obscure but highly significant contribution to sociology and epistemology occurs in malignowskis study retroactive reality printed in wieczny kwiat wtadza the journal of the polish orthopsychiatric psociety for autumn all affirmations are true in some sense false in some sense meaningless in some sense true and false in some sense true and meaningless in some sense false and meaningless in some sense and true and false and meaningless in some sense do you follow me in some sense joe mutters the author dr malignowski was assisted by three graduate students named korzybski korzybski and korzybski siamese triplets born to a mathematician and hence indexed rather than named malignowski and his students interviewed married couples questioning husband and wife separately in each case and asked key questions about their first meeting first sexual experience marriage ceremony honeymoon economic standing during the first year of marriage and similar subjects which should have left permanent impressions on the memory not one couple in the gave exactly the same answers to questions and the highest single score was made by a couple who gave the same answers to of the questions this study demonstrated graphically what many psychologists have long suspected the lifehistory which most of us carry around in our skulls is more our own creation at least seven percent more than it is an accurate recording of realities as malignowski concludes reality is retroactive retrospective and illusory under these circumstances things not personally experienced but recounted by others are even more likely to be distorted and after a tale passes through five tellers it is virtually one hundred percent pure myth another example of the law of fives only marxists dr iggy concluded opening the door to usher joe into the chapel room still believe in an objective history marxists and a few disciples of ayn rand jung took the parchment from drake and stared at it its not to be signed in blood and what the hell is this yinyang symbol with the pentagon and the apple youre a fucking fake his lips curled tightly in against his teeth what do you mean said george through a throat that was rapidly closing up i mean youre not from the goddam illuminati said jung who the hell are you didnt you know that before i came here that im not from the illuminati said george im not trying to fake anybody out honest really i thought you knew the people who sent me i never said i was from the illuminati maldonado nodded a slight smile bringing his face to life i know who he is the people of the old strega the sybil of sybils all hail discordia kid right hail eris said george with a slight feeling of relief drake frowned well we seem to be at cross purposes we were contacted by mail then by telephone then by messenger by parties who made it quite clear that they knew all about our business with the illuminati now to the best of my knowledge perhaps don federico knows better there is only one organization in the world that knows anything about the aisb and that is the aisb itself george could tell he was lying maldonado raised a warning hand wait up everybody to the bathroom drake sighed oh don federico you and your tired notions of security if my house isnt safe were all dead men as of this moment and if the aisb is as good as its said to be an old trick like running water will be no obstacle to them lets conduct this discussion like civilized men for gods sake and not huddled around my shower stall there are times when dignity is suicide said maldonado he shrugged but i yield ill settle the question with you in hell if youre wrong im still in the dark said richard jung i dont know who this guy is or where hes from look chinaman said maldonado you know who the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria are right well every organization has opposition right so do the illuminati opposition thats like them religious magical spooky stuff not simply interested in becoming rich as is our gentlemanly aim in life playing supernatural games capeesh jung looked skeptical you could be describing the communist party the cia or the vatican superficial said maldonado scornfully and upstarts compared with the aisb because the bavarian illuminati arent bavarians you understand thats just a recent name and manifestation for their order both the illuminati and their opposition which this guy represents go back a long ways before moscow washington or rome a little imagination is called for to understand this chinaman if the illuminati are yang george said helpfully were yin the only solution is a yin revolution dig i am a graduate of harvard law school said jung loftily and i do not dig it what are you a bunch of hippies we never made a deal with your bunch before said maldonado they never had enough to offer us robert putney drake said yes but wouldnt you like to though don federico havent you had a bellyfull of the others i know i have i know where youre from now george and you people have been making giant strides in recent decades im not surprised that youre able to tempt us its worth our lives and we are supposedly the most secure men in the united states to betray the illuminati but i understand you offer us statues from atlantis by now they should be uncrated and that there are more where these came from is that right george hagbard had said nothing about that but george was too worried about his own survival to quibble yes he said there are more drake said whether we want to risk our lives by working with your people will depend on what we find when we examine the objets dart you are offering don federico being a highly qualified expert in antiquities particularly in those antiquities which have been carefully kept outside of the ken of conventional archaeological knowledge will pronounce on the value of what youve brought as a sicilian thoroughly versed in his heritage don federico is familiar with things atlantean the sicilians are about the only extant people who do know about atlantis it is not generally realized that the sicilians have the oldest continuous civilization on the face of the planet with all due respects to the chinese drake nodded formally to jung i consider myself an american said jung though my family knows a thing or two about tibet that might surprise you im sure said drake well you shall advise as you are able but the sicilian heritage goes back thousands of years before rome as does their knowledge of atlantis there were a few things washed up on the shores of north africa a few things found by divers it was enough to establish a tradition if there were a museum of atlantean arts don federico is one of the few people in the world qualified to be a curator in other words said maldonado with a ghastly smile those statues better be authentic kid because i will know if they are not they are said george i saw them picked up off the ocean bottom myself thats impossible said jung lets look said drake he stood up and placed the palm of his hand flat against an oak panel which immediately slid to one side revealing a winding metal staircase drake leading the way the four of them descended what seemed to george five stories to a door with a combination lock drake opened the door and they passed through a series of other chambers ending up in a large underground garage the gold amp appel truck was there and beside it the four statues freed of their crates there was no one in the room where did everybody go said jung theyre sicilians said drake they saw these and were afraid they did the job of uncrating them and left his face and maldonados wore a look of awe jungs craggy features bore an irritated puzzled frown im beginning to feel that ive been left out of a lot he said later said maldonado he took a small jewelers glass out of his pocket and approached the nearest statue this is where they got the idea for the great god pan he said but you can see the idea was more complicated twenty thousand years ago than two thousand fixing the jewelers glass in his eye he began a careful inspection of a glittering hoof at the end of an hour maldonado with the help of a ladder had gone over each of the four statues from bottom to top with fanatical care and had questioned george about the manner of their seizure as well as what little he knew of their history he put his jewelers glass away turned to drake and nodded you got the four most valuable pieces of art in the world drake nodded i surmised as much worth more than all the gold in all the spanish treasure ships there ever were if i have not been dosed with a hallucinogenic drug said richard jung i gather you are all saying these statues come from atlantis ill take your word for it that theyre solid gold and that means theres a lot of gold there the value of the matter is not worth one one tenthousandth the value of the form said drake that i dont see said jung what is the value of atlantean art if no reputable authority anywhere in the world believes in atlantis maldonado smiled there are a few people in the world who know that atlantis existed and who know there is such a thing as atlantean art and believe me richard those few got enough money to make it worth anyones while who has a piece from the bottom of the sea any one of these statues could buy a middlesized country drake clapped his hands with an air of authority im satisfied if don federico is satisfied for these and for four more like them or the equivalent if four such statues simply dont exist my hand is joined with the hand of the discordian movement let us go back upstairs and sign the papers in pen and ink and then george we would like you to be our guest at dinner george didnt know if he had the authority to promise four more statues and he was certain that total openness was the only safe approach with these men as they were climbing the stairs he said to drake who was above him i wasnt authorized by the man who sent me to promise anything more and i dont believe he has any more at the moment unless he has a collection of his own i know these four statues are the only ones he captured on this trip drake let out a small fart an incredible thing it seemed to george for the leader of all organized crime in the united states to do excuse me he said the exertion of these stairs is too much for me would love to put in an elevator but that wouldnt be as secure one of these days my heart will give out going up and down those stairs the fart smelled moderately bad and george was glad when he had climbed out of its neighborhood he was surprised that a man of drakes importance would acknowledge that he farted perhaps that kind of straightforwardness was a factor in drakes success george doubted that maldonado would admit to a fart the don was too devious he was not your earthy sort of latin he was paperthin and paperpale like a tuscan aristocrat of attenuated bloodline they reentered drakes office and drake and maldonado each signed the parchment scroll after the phrase for valuable considerations received drake inserted the words and considerations of equal value yet to come he smiled at george since you cant guarantee the additional objects ill expect to hear from your boss within twentyfour hours after you leave here this whole deal is contingent upon the additional payment from you orgasm her bubbies fritchid by the gyning deep seadoodler all in a lewdercrass chaste for a moulteeng fawkin in fact hearing drake say that he was to be leaving the syndicate fortress made george feel a bit better he signed in behalf of the discordians and jung signed as a witness drake said you understand there is no way the organizations which don federico and i represent can be bound by anything we sign what we agree to here is to use our influence with our many esteemed colleagues and to hope that they will grant us the favor of cooperation in the mutual enterprise maldonado said i couldnt have said it better myself we of course personally pledge our lives and our honor to further your purposes robert putney drake took a cigar out of a silver humidor slapping george on the back he shoved the cigar into his mouth you know youre the first hippie ive ever done business with i suppose youd like to have some marijuana i dont keep any around the house and as you probably know we dont deal much in the stuff too bulky to transport considering the amount you can make on it aside from that i think youll like the food and drink here well have a big dinner and some entertainment the dinner was steak diane and it was served to the four men at a long table in a dining room hung with large old paintings they were waited on by a series of beautiful young women and george wondered where the gang leaders kept their wives and mistresses in some sort of purdah perhaps there was something arabic about this whole setup during the main course a blonde in a long white gown which left one breast bare played the harp in a corner of the room and sang there was conversation with the coffee four young women sat down briefly with the men and regaled them with witticisms and funny stories with the brandy came tarantella serpentine she was an amazingly tall woman at least six feet two with long blond hair that was piled high on her head and fell below her shoulders she was wearing tinkling gold bracelets around her wrists and ankles and there were diaphonous veils wrapped around her slender body and nothing else george could see pink nipples and dark crotch hair when she strode through the door banananose maldonado wiped his mouth with his napkin and began applauding gleefully robert putney drake smiled proudly and richard jung swallowed hard george just stared the star of our little rural retreat said drake by way of introduction may i present miss tarantella serpentine maldonados applause continued and george wondered if he should join in music oriental but with a touch of rock flooded the room the sound reproduction equipment was excellent nigh perfect tarantella serpentine began to dance it was a strange hybrid sort of dance a synthesis of bellydancing gogo and modern ballet george licked his lips and he felt his face get warm and his penis begin to throb and swell as he watched tarantella serpentines dance was even more sensuous than the dance stella maris had done when he was being initiated into the discordian movement after she had done three dances tarantella bowed and left you must be tired george said drake resting his hand on georges shoulder suddenly george realized he had been going on almost no sleep except for the times hed dozed off in the car on the way from mad dog to the gulf he had been under incredible physical and even more important emotional pressure he agreed that he was tired and praying that he would not be murdered in his sleep he let drake lead him to a bedroom the bed was an enormous four poster with a clothofgold canopy naked george slid between cool crisp sheets and clutching the top sheet around his neck lay flat on his back shut his eyes tight and sighed that morning he had been on a beach in the gulf of mexico watching naked mavis masturbate he had fucked an apple he had been to atlantis and now he was lying on a downysoft mattress in the home of the chief of all organized crime in america if he closed his eyes he might find himself back in the mad dog jail he shook his head there was nothing to fear he heard the bedroom door open there was nothing to fear to prove it he kept his eyes closed he heard a board squeak squeaky boards in this place sure to warn the sleeper that there was someone sneaking up on him he opened his eyes tarantella serpentine was standing over the bed bobbybaby sent me she said george closed his eyes again sweetheart he said you are beautiful you really are youre beautiful make yourself comfortable she reached down and turned on a bedside lamp she was wearing a gold metallic bikini top with a short matching skirt her breasts were delightfully small george thought although on a fivefoottwo girl theyd be ample but tarentella was built like a vogue model george liked her looks he had always been partial to tall slender boyish women im not intruding on you am i she asked you sure you wouldnt rather sleep well its not so much what td rather do said george i doubt that i can do anything other than sleep i have had a very trying day masturbated once he thought had one blow job and fucked one apple forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors plus been scared out of my wits percent of the time tarantella said my name is known in ratified circles for what i can achieve with men whose days are all trying presidents kings syndicate heads naturally rock stars oil billionaires people like that my thing is i can make men come over and over and over and over again ten times sometimes even twenty times no matter how old or how tired i get paid a lot tonight bobbybaby is paying for my services and im to service you which i like very much because most of my clientele is on the middleaged side and youre nice and young and have a firm body she gently pulled the sheet loose from georges grip he had forgotten he was still holding it up around his neck and caressed his bare shoulder how old are you george twentytwo twentythree said george but i dont want to disappoint you im willing and im interested in fact im curious about what you do but im pretty tired honey you cant disappoint me the more limp you are the more i like it the more of a challenge you are to me let me show you my specialty tarantella doffed her bra skirt and panties quickly but deliberately enough to let george enjoy watching her smiling at him she stood before him her legs spread wide apart her fingernails tickled her nipples and george watched them swell up then her left hand playing with her left breast her right hand snaked down to her groin and began massaging the goldenbrown hairs of her mons her middle finger disappeared between her legs after a few moments a scarlet flush spread over her face neck and chest her body arched backward and she gave a single agonized cry her skin from head to toe was glowing with a fine coating of sweat after a momentary pause she smiled and looked at him her right hand caressed his cheek and he felt the wetness on his face and smelled the lobster newburg aroma of a young cunt her fingers drifted to the sheets and with a sudden movement she stripped them away from georges body she grinned down at his stiff cock and in a moment was on top of him holding his prick inserting it into herself two minutes of smooth pistonlike movements on her part brought him to an unexpectedly pleasant orgasm baby he said you could wake the dead he enjoyed his second orgasm about a half hour later and his third a half hour after that the second time tarantella lay on her back and george lay on top of her and the third time she was on her stomach and he was straddling her from the rear there was something about the mood tarantella created that was crucial to what she called her specialty though she had boasted about her ability to make a man come repeatedly when it came right down to doing things she made him feel that it didnt really matter what happened with him she was funloving playful carefree he did not feel obligated in any sense to stiffen to come tarantella might view men as a challenge but she made it clear that george was not to see her as a challenge after a short nap he woke to find her sucking his rapidly hardening penis it took much longer this time for him to come but he enjoyed every second of mounting pleasure after that they lay side by side and talked for a while then tarantella went to the bedside table and took a tube of petroleum jelly out of a drawer she began applying it to his penis which grew erect during the process then she rolled over and presented him with her rosy asshole it was the first time george had had a woman that way and he came rather quickly after insertion from the novelty and excitement of it all they slept for a while and he awoke to find her masturbating him her fingers were very clever and seemed quickly to find their way to all the most sensitive parts of his penis with special attention to that area just behind the crown of the head he opened his eyes wide when he came and saw after a few seconds a small pale pearllike drop of semen appear on the end of his dick a wonder there was any at all it was getting to be a trip his ego went away somewhere and he was all body letting it all happen it was fucking tarantella and it was coming and judging by the sounds she was making and the wetness in which his penis was sloshing she was coming too there followed two more blow jobs then tarantella pulled something that looked like an electric razor out of the bedtable drawer she plugged it into the wall and began to stroke his penis with its vibrating head pausing every so often to lick and lubricate the areas she was working on george closed his eyes and rolled his hips from side to side as he felt yet another orgasm coming on from a great distance he heard tarantella serpentine say my greatness lies in the life i can generate in limp pricks georges pelvis began to pump up and down it was really going to be that superorgasm hemingway described it began to happen it was pure electricity no juice all energy pouring out like lightning through the magic wand at the center of his being he wouldnt be surprised to discover that his balls and cock were disintegrating into whirling electrons he screamed and behind his tightclenched eyes he saw very clearly the smiling face of mavis he awoke in the dark and his instinctive groping motion told him that tarantella was gone instead mavis in a white doctors smock stood at the foot of the bed watching him with large bright eyes the darkened drake bedroom had turned into a hospital ward and was suddenly brightly lit how did you get here he blurted i mean how did i get here saul she said kindly its almost all over youve come through it and suddenly he realized that he felt not twentythree but sixtythree years old youve won he admitted im no longer sure who i am youve won mavis contradicted youve gone through ego loss and now youre beginning to discover who you really are poor old saul he examined his hands old mans wrinkled goodmans hands there are two forms of ego loss mavis went on and the illuminati are masters of both one is schizophrenia the other is illumination they set you on the first track and we switched you to the other you had a time bomb in your head but we defused it maliks apartment the playboy club the submarine and all the other past lives and lost years by god saul goodman cried ive got it i am saul goodman but i am all the other people too and all time is this time mavis added softly saul sat upright tears gleaming in his eyes ive killed men ive sent them to the electric chair seventeen times seventeen suicides the savages who cut off fingers or toes or ears for their gods are more sensible we cut off whole egos thinking they are not ourselves but separate god god god and he burst in sobs mavis rushed forward and held him cradling his head to her breast let it out she said let it all out its not true unless it makes you laugh but you dont understand until it makes you weep queens psychoanalysts in living cells moving in military ordure and a shitty outlook on life and sex dancing coins in harrys krishna it all coheres even if you approach it bass ackwards it coheres gruad the grayface saul screamed weeping beating his fist against the pillow as mavis held his head stroked his hair gruad the damned and i have been his servant his puppet sacrificing myselves on his electric altars as burnt offerings yes yes mavis cooed in his ear we must learn to give up our sacrifices not our joys they have taught us to give up everything except our sacrifices and those are what we must give up we must sacrifice our

thinks in a halfilluminated trance either im more stoned than i think or that sign is absolutely the whole clue to how the show runs rags hail ghoulumbia her monadmen are fled and all shes left now is a bloody period the funny part saul said smiling while a few tears still flowed is that im not ashamed of this two days ago i would have rather died than be seen weeping especially by a woman yes mavis said especially by a woman thats it isnt it saul gasped thats their whole gimmick i couldnt see you without seeing a woman i couldnt see that editor jackson without seeing a negro i couldnt see anybody without seeing the attached label and classification thats how they keep us apart mavis said gently and thats how they train us to keep our masks on love was the hardest bond for them to smash so they had to create patriarchy male supremacy and all that crap and the masculine protest and penis envy in women came in as a result so even lovers couldnt look at one another without seeing a separate category o my god my god saul moaned beginning to weep heavily again a rag a bone a hank of hair o my god and you were with them he cried suddenly raising his head youre a former illuminatus thats why youre so important to hagbards plan and thats why you have that tattoo i was one of the five who run the us mavis nodded one of the insiders as robert welch calls them ive been replaced now by atlanta hope the leader of gods lightning ive got it ive got it saul said laughing i looked every way but the right way before hes inside the pentagon thats why they build it in that shape so he couldnt escape the aztecs the nazis and now us yes mavis said grimly thats why thirty thousand americans disappear every year without trace and their cases end up in the unsolved files he has to be fed a man though naked may be in rags saul quoted ambrose bierce knew about it and arthur machen mavis added and lovecraft but they had to write in code even so lovecraft went too far mentioning the necronomicon by name thats why he died so suddenly when he was only fortyseven and his literary executor august derleth was persuaded to insert a note in every edition of lovecrafts works claiming that the necronomicon doesnt exist and was just part of lovecrafts fantasy and the lloigor saul asked and the dols real mavis said all real thats what causes bad acid trips and schizophrenia psychic contact with them when the ego wall breaks thats where the illuminati were sending you when we raided their fake playboy club and shortcircuited the process du hexen hase saul quoted and he began to tremble unheimlich urvater whose arts uneven horrid be thine aim harpoons in him corpus whalem take ye and hate fernando poo was given prominent attention in the world press only once before the notorious fernando poo incident it occurred in the early s while captain tequilla y mota was first studying the art of the coup detat and laying his first plans and was occasioned by the outrageous claims of the anthropologist j n marsh of miskatonic university that artifacts he had found on fernando poo proved the existence of the lost continent of atlantis although professor marsh had an impeccable reputation for scholarly caution and scientific rigor before this his last published book atlantis and its gods was greeted with mockery and derision by his professional colleagues especially after his theories were picked up and sensationalized by the press many of the old mans friends in fact blame this campaign of ridicule for his disappearance a few months later which they suspect was the suicide of a brokenhearted and sincere searcher after truth not only were marshs theories now beyond all scientific credibility but his methods such as quoting allegros the sacred mushroom and the cross or graves the white goddess as if they were as reputable as boas mead or frazer seemed to indicate senility this impression was increased by the eccentric dedication to ezra pound jacques de molay and emperor norton i the real scientific scandal was not the theory of atlantis that was a bee that had haunted many a scholarly bonnet but marshs claim that the gods of atlantis actually existed not as supernatural beings of course but as a superior class of life now extinct which had preexisted mankind and duped the earliest civilization into worshiping them as divine and offering terrible sacrifices at their altars that there was absolutely no archaeological or paleontological evidence that such beings ever existed was the mildest of the scholarly criticisms aimed at this hypothesis professor marshs rapid decline in the few months between the books unanimous rejection by the learned world and his sudden disappearance caused great pain to colleagues at miskatonic many recognized that he had acquired some of his notions from dr henry armitage generally regarded as having gone somewhat bananas after too many years devoted to puzzling out the obscene metaphysics of the necronomicon when the librarian miss horus mentioned at a faculty tea shortly after the disappearance that marsh had spent much of the past month with that volume one catholic professor urged only halfjokingly that miskatonic should rid itself of scandals once and for all by presenting that damned book he emphasized the word very deliberately to harvard missing persons department of the arkham police assigned the marsh case to a young detective who had previously distinguished himself by tracing several missing infants to one of the particularly vile satanist cults that have festered in that town since the witchhunting days of his first act was to examine the manuscript on which the old man had been working since the completion of atlantis and its gods it seemed to be a shortish essay intended for an anthropological magazine and was quite conservative in tone and concept as if the professor regretted the boldness of his previous speculations only one footnote expressing guarded and qualified endorsement of urqhuarts theory about wales being settled by survivors from mu showed the bizarre preoccupations of the atlantis book however the final sheet was not related to this article at all and seemed to be notes for a piece which the professor evidently intended to submit brazenly and in total contempt of academic opinion to a pulp publication devoted to flying saucers and occultism the detective puzzled over these notes for a long time the usual hoax fiction presented as fact this hoax described here opposite to this fact presented as fiction huysmans labas started it turns the satanist into hero machen in paris s met with huysmans circle dols and aklo letters in machens subsequent fiction same years bierce and chambers both mention lake of hali and carcosa allegedly coincidence crowley recruiting his occult circle after bierce disappears in lovecraft introduces halt dols aklo cthulhu after lovecraft dies unexpectedly seabrook discusses crowley machen etc in his witchcraft seabrooks suicide emphasize bierce describes oedipus complex in death of halpin frazer before freud and relativity in inhabitant of carcosa before einstein lovecrafts ambiguous descriptions of azathoth as blind idiotgod demonsultan and nuclear chaos circa fifteen years before hiroshima direct drug references in chambers king in yellow machens white powder lovecraffs beyond the wall of sleep and mountains of madness the appetites of the lloigor or old ones in bierces damned thing machens black stone lovecraft constantly atlantis known as thule both in german and panama indian lore and of course coincidence again the accepted explanation opening sentence for article the more frequently one uses the word coincidence to explain bizarre happenings the more obvious it becomes that one is not seeking but evading the real explanation or shorter the belief in coincidence is the prevalent superstition of the age of science the detective then spent an afternoon at miskatonic library browsing through the writings of ambrose bierce jk huysmans arthur machen robert w chambers and h p lovecraft he found that all repeated certain key words dealt with lost continents or lost cities described superhuman beings trying to misuse or victimize mankind in some unspecified manner suggested that there was a cult or group of cults among mankind who served these beings and described certain books usually not giving their titles lovecraft was an exception that reveal the secrets of these beings with a little further research he found that the occult and satanist circles in paris in the s had influenced the fiction of both huysmans and machen as well as the career of the egregious aleistair crowley and that seabrook who knew crowley hinted at more than he stated outright in his book on witchcraft published two years before his suicide he then wrote a little table huysmanshysteria complaints about occult attacks final seclusion in a monastery chambersabandons such subjects turns to light romantic fiction biercedisappears mysteriously lovecraftdead at an early age crowleyhounded into silence and obscurity machenbecomes a devout catholic huysmans escape seabrookalleged suicide the detective then went back and reread not skimming this time the stories by these writers in which drugs were specifically mentioned according to marshs notes he now had a hypothesis the old man had been lured into a drug cult as had these writers and had been terrified by his own hallucinations finally ending his own life to escape the phantoms his own narcoticfogged brain had created it was a good enough theory to start with and the detective conscientiously set about interviewing every friend on campus of old marsh leading into the subject of grass and lsd very slowly and indirectly he made no headway and was beginning to lose his conviction when good fortune struck in the form of a remark by another anthropology professor about marshs preoccupation in recent years with amanita muscaria the hallucinogenic mushroom used in ancient near eastern religions a very interesting fungus amanita this professor told the detective some sensationalists without scholarly caution have claimed it was every magic potion in ancient lore the soma of the hindus the sacrament used in the dionysian and eleusinian mysteries in greece even the holy communion of the earliest christians and gnostics one chap in england even claims amanita and not hashish was the drug used by the assassins in the middle ages and theres a psychiatrist in new york puharich who claims it actually does induce telepathy most of that is rubbish of course but amanita certainly is the strongest mindaltering drug in the world if the kids ever latch onto it lsd will seem like a tempest in a teapot by comparison the detective now concentrated on finding somebody anybody who had actually seen old marsh when he was stoned out of his gourd the testimony finally came from a young black student named pearson who was majoring in anthropology and minoring in music excited and euphoric yeah he said thoughtfully i saw old joshua that way once it was in the library of all places thats where my girl works and the old man jumped up from a table grinning about a yard wide and said out loud but talking to himself you know i saw them i saw the fnords then he ran out like jesse owens going to get his ashes hauled i was curious and went over to peek at what hed been reading it was the new york times editorial page and not a picture on it so he certainly didnt see the fnords whatever the hell they are there you think he was maybe bombed a little maybe maybe not the detective said noncommittally obeying the police rule of never accusing anyone of anything in hearing of a witness unless ready to make an arrest but he was already quite sure that professor marsh would never reappear to be subject to arrest or any other harassment by those who had not entered his special world of lost civilizations vanished cities lloigors dols and fnords to this day the file on the joshua n marsh case in the arkham police department bears the closing line probable cause of death suicide during drug psychosis nobody ever traced the change in professor marsh back to a kcuf meeting in chicago and a strangely spiked punch but the young detective daniel pricefixer always retained a nagging doubt and a shapeless disquiet about this particular investigation and even after he moved to new york and went to work for barney muldoon he was still addicted to reading books on prehistory and thinking strange thoughts simon magus you will come to know gods after the disappearance of saul goodman and barney muldoon the fbi went over the malik apartment with a finetooth comb everything was photographed fingerprinted analyzed catalogued and where possible shipped back to the crime laboratory in washington among the items was a short note on the back of a playboy club lunch receipt not in maliks handwriting which meant nothing to anybody and was included only for the sake of the completeness so loved by the bureau the note said machens dols lovecrafts dholes vectors you will come to no gods on april most of new york was talking about the incredible event that had occurred shortly before dawn at the long island mansion of the nations bestknown philanthropist robert putney drake danny pricefixer of the bomb squad however was almost oblivious of this bizarre occurrence as he drove through heavy traffic from one part of manhattan to another interviewing every witness who might have spoken to joseph malik in the week before the confrontation explosion the results were uniformly disappointing aside from the fact that malik had grown increasingly secretive in recent years none of the interviews seemed to provide any useful information a killer smog had again settled on the city for the seventh straight day and danny a nonsmoker was very aware of the wheeze in his chest which did nothing to improve his mood finally at three in the afternoon he left the office of orgasm at west fortieth street an associate editor there was an old friend of maliks and frequently lunched with him but had nothing substantial to offer in leads and remembered that the main branch of the new york public library was only half a block away the hunch had been in the back of his mind he realized ever since he glanced at maliks weird illuminati memos what the hell he thought itll only be a few more wasted minutes in a wasted day for once the congestion at the window in the main reference room was not quite as bad as a canal street traffic jam atlantis and its gods by professor j n marsh was delivered to him in seventeen minutes and he began leafing through it looking for the passage he vaguely remembered at last on page he found it hans stefan santesson points out the basic similarity of mayan and egyptian investiture rituals as previously indicated in colonel churchwards insightful but wrongheaded books on the lost continent of mu as we have demonstrated churchwards obsession with the pacific based on his having received his first clues about our lost ancestors in an asiatic temple led him to attribute to the fictitious mu much of the real history of the actual atlantis but this passage from santessons understanding mu paperback library new york page needs little correction next he was taken to the throne of regeneration of the soul and the ceremony of investiture or illumination took place then he experienced further ordeals before attaining to the chamber of the orient to the throne of ra to become truly a master he could see for himself in the distance the uncreated light from which was pointed out the whole happiness of the future in other words as churchward puts it both in egypt and in maya the initiate had to sustain ie survive the fiery ordeal to be approved as an adept the adept had to become justified the justified must then become illuminate the destruction of mu was commemorated by the possibly symbolic house of fire of the quiche mayas and by the relatively later chamber of central fire of the mysteries which we are told were celebrated in the great pyramid substituting atlantis for mu churchward and santesson are basically correct the god of course could choose the shape in which he would appear in the final ordeal and since these gods or lloigor in the atlantean language possessed telepathy they would read the initiates mind and manifest in the form most terrifying to the specific individual although the shoggoth form and the classic angry giant form such as appears in aztec statues of tlaloc were most common to employ an amusing conceit if these beings had survived to our time as some occultists claim they would appear to the average american as say king kong or perhaps dracula or the wolfman the sacrifices demanded by these creatures evidently contributed significantly to the fall of atlantis and we can conjecture that the mass burnings practiced by the celts at beltain and even the aztec religion which turned their altars into abattoirs were minor in comparison being merely the result of persistent tradition after the real menace of the lloigor had vanished we of course cannot fully understand the purpose of these bloody rituals since we cannot fathom the nature or even the sort of matter or energy that comprised the lloigor that the chief of these beings is known in the pnakotic manuscripts and the eltdown shards as loksotot eater of souls suggests that it was some energy or psychic vibration of the dying victim that the lloigor needed the physical body was as in the case of the corpseeating cult of leng consumed by the priests themselves or merely thrown away as among the thuggee of india thoughtfully and quietly danny pricefixer returned the book to the clerk at the checkout window thoughtfully and quietly he walked out on fifth avenue and stood between the two guardian lions who was it he wondered who had asked since nobody wants war why do wars keep happening he looked at the killer smog around him and asked himself another riddle since nobody wants air pollution why does air pollution keep increasing professor marshs words came back to him ifthese beings had survived to our time as some occultists claim walking toward his car he passed a newsstand and saw that the disaster at the drake mansion was still the biggest headline even in the afternoon editions it was irrelevant to his problem however so he ignored it sherri brandi continued the chant in her mind maintaining the rhythm of her mouth movements fiftythreebig rhinoceroses fiftyfour big rhinoceroses fiftyfivecamels nails dug into her shoulders suddenly and the salty gush splashed hot on her tongue thank the lord she thought the bastard finally made it her jaw was tired and she had a crick in her neck and her knees hurt but at least the sonofabitch would be in a good mood now and wouldnt beat her up for having so little to report about charley and his bugs she stood up stretching her leg and neck muscles to remove the cramps and looked down to see if any of carmels come had dribbled on her dress most men wanted her naked during a blow job but not creepy carmel he insisted she wear her best gown always he liked soiling her she realized but hell he wasnt as bad as some pimps and weve all got to get our kicks some way carmel sprawled back in the easy chair his eyes still closed sherri fetched the towel she had been warming over the radiator and completed the transaction drying him and gently kissing his ugly wand before tucking it back inside his fly and zippering him up he does look like a gaddam frog she thought bitterly or a nastytempered chipmunk terrif he said finally the johns really get their moneys worth from you kid now tell me about charley and his bugs sherri still feeling cramped pulled over a footstool and perched on its edge well she said you know i gotta be careful if he knows im pumping him he might drop me and take up with some other girl so you were too damn cautious and you didnt get anything out of him carmel interrupted accusingly oh hes over the loop she answered still vague i mean really crazy now that must be uh important if you have to deal with him she came back into focus how i know is he thinks hes going to other planets in his dreams some planet called atlantis do you know which one that is carmel frowned this was getting stickier first find a commie then find out how to get the info out of charley despite the fbi and cia and all the other government people and now how to deal with a maniac he looked up and saw that she was out of focus again staring into space dopey broad he thought and then watched as she slid slowly off the stool onto a neat sleeping position on the floor what the hell he said out loud when he knelt next to her and listened for her heart his own face paled jesus jesus jesus he thought standing up now i got to get rid of a fucking corpus delectus the damned bitch went and died i can see the fnords barney muldoon cried looking up from the miami herald with a happy grin joe malik smiled contentedly it had been a hectic day especially since hagbard had been tied up with the battle of atlantis and the initiation of george dorn but now at last he had the feeling their side was winning two minds set on a death trip by the illuminati had been successfully saved now if everything worked out right between george and robert putney drake the intercom buzzed and joe answered calling across the room without rising malik hows muldoon hagbards voice asked coming all the way he sees the fnords in a miami paper excellent hagbard said dustractedly mavis reports that saul is all the way through too and just saw the fnords in the new york times bring muldoon up to my room weve located that other problem the sickness vibrations that fuckup has been scanning since march its somewhere around las vegas and its at a critical stage we think theres been one death already but weve got to get to ingolstadt before walpurgia night joe said thoughtfully revise and rewrite hagbard said some of us will go to ingolstadt some of us will have to go to las vegas its the old illuminati onetwo punch two attacks from different directions get your asses in gear boys theyre immanentizing the eschaton weishaupt fnords prffft another interruption this time it was the mothers march against muzak since that seems to be the most worthwhile cause ive been approached for all day i gave the lady i think that if muzak can be stamped out alot of our other ailments will disappear too since theyre probably stress symptoms caused by noise pollution anyway its getting late and i might as well conclude this one month before our kcuf experiment that is on september timothy leary passed five federal agents at ohare airport here in chicago he had vowed to shoot rather than go back to jail and there was a gun in his pocket none of them recognized him and oh yes there was a policeman named timothy oleary in the hospital room where dutch schultz dies on october ive been saving the best for last aldous huxley the first major literary figure illuminated by leary died the same day as john f kennedy the last essay he wrote revolved around shakespeares phrase time must have a stop which he had previously used for the title of a novel about life after death life is an illusion he wrote but an illusion which we must take seriously two years later laura huxleys widow met the medium keith milton rhinehart as she tells the story in her book this timeless moment when she asked if rinehart could contact aldous he replied that aldous wanted to transmit classical evidence of survival a message that is which could not be explained merely as telepathy as something rinehart picked out of her mind it had to be something that could only come from aldouss mind later that evening rinehart produced it instructions to go to a room in her house a room he hadnt seen and find a particular book which neither he nor she was familiar with she was to look on a certain page and a certain line the book was one aldous had read but she had never even glanced at it was an anthology of literary criticism the line indicatedi have memorized it was aldous huxley does not surprise us in this admirable communication in which paradox and erudition in the poetic sense and the sense of humor are interlaced in such an efficacious form need i add that the page was and the line was of course line i suppose youve read seutonius and know that the late j caesar was rendered exactly stab wounds by brutus and co brace yourself joe worse attacks on your reason are coming along soon youll see the fnords hail eris ps your question about the vibes and telepathy is easily answered the energy is always moving in us

than usual the fits about to hit the shan he thought grimly turning on the eight oclock news only to catch the story about the drake mansion another bad sign in las vegas in rooms where the light never changed none of the gamblers noticed that it was now morning but carmel returning from the desert where he had buried sherri brandi drove out of his way to look over dr charles mocenigos home hoping to see or hear something helpful he heard only a revolver shot and quickly sped away looking back he saw flames leaping toward the sky and over the midatlantic r buckminster fuller glanced at his three watches noting that it was two in the morning on the plane midnight at his destination nairobi and am back home in carbondale illinois in nairobi itself nkrumah fubar maker of voodoo dolls that caused headaches to the president of the united states prepared for bed looking forward to mr fullers lecture at the university next morning mr fubar in his sophisticatedprimitive way like simon moon in his primitivesophisticated way saw no conflict between magic and mathematics in washington dc the clocks were striking five when ben volpes stolen volkswagen pulled up in front of the home of senator edward coke bacon the nations most distinguished liberal and leading hope of all those young people who hadnt yet joined morituri groups in quick and out quick ben volpe said tersely to his companions a cowboy senator bacon turned in his bed albert the teacher stern fires directly at the dutchman and mumbled newark beside him his wife half woke and heard a noise in the garden mama mama mama the dutchman mumbles mama she hears her sons voice saying as she sinks back toward a dream the rain of bullets jolts her awake into a sea of blood and in one flash she sees her husband dying beside her her son twenty years ago weeping for a dead turtle the face of mendy weiss and ben volpe and two others backing out of the room but in when robert putney drake returned from europe to accept a vice presidency in his fathers bank in boston the police already knew that albert the teacher really hadnt shot the dutchman there were even a few such as elliot ness who knew the orders had come from mr lucky luciano and mr alphonse scarface capone residing in atlanta penitentiary and had been transmitted through federico maldonado nobody outside the syndicate itself however could name jimmy the shrew charley the bug and mendy weiss as the actual killers nobody except robert putney drake on april federico maldonados phone rang and when he answered it a cultivated boston voice said conversationally mother is the best bet dont let satan draw you too fast this was followed by an immediate click as the caller hung up maldonado thought about it all day and finally mentioned it to a very close friend that evening some nut calls me up today and gives me part of what the dutchman told the cops before he died funny thing about it he gives one of the parts that would really sink us all if anybody in the police or the feds could understand it thats the way some nuts are pronounced the other mafioso don an elegant elderly gentleman resembling one of frederick iis falcons theyre tuned in like gypsies telepathy you know but they get it all scrambled because theyre nuts yeah i guess thats it maldonado agreed he had a crazy uncle who would sometimes blurt out a brotherhood secret that he couldnt possibly know in the middle of ramblings about priests making it with altar boys and mussolini hiding on the fire escape and nonsense like that they tune in like the eye eh and he laughed but the next morning the phone rang again and the same voice said with elaborate new england intonation those dirty rats have tuned in french canadian bean soup maldonado broke into a cold sweat it was that moment in fact when he decided his son the priest would say a mass for the dutchman every sunday he thought about it all day boston the accent was boston they had witches up there once french canadian bean soup christ harvard is just outside boston and hoover is recruiting feds from the harvard law school were there lawyers who were witches too cowboy the son of a bitch i told them and they found him in the mens crapper that damned dutchman a bullet in his gut and he lives long enough to blab everything about the segreto the goddam tedeschi robert putney drake dined on lobster newburg that evening with a young lady from one of the lesserknown branches of the house of morgan afterward he took her to see tobacco road and in the cab back to his hotel they talked seriously about the sufferings of the poor and the power of henry hulls performance as jeeter then he took her up to his room and fucked her from hell to breakfast at ten in the morning after she had left he came out of the shower stark naked thirtythree years old rich handsome feeling like a healthy and happy predatory mammal he looked down at his penis thought of snakes in mescaline visions back in zurich and donned a bathrobe which cost enough to feed one of the starving families in the nearby slums for about six months he lit a fat cuban cigar and sat down by the phone a male mammal predatory happy he began to dial listening to the clicks the dot and the dot and the dotdot remembering the perfume his mother had worn leaning over his crib one night thirtytwo years ago the smell of her breasts and the time he experimentally tried homosexuality in boston common with the pale faggot kneeling before him in the toilet stall and the smell of urine and lysol disinfectant the scrawl on the door saying eleanor roosevelt sucks and his instant fantasy that it wasnt a faggot genuflecting in church before his hot hard prick but the presidents wife yes said the taut angry voice of banana nose maldonado when i reached the can the boy came at me drake drawled his mild erection becoming warm and rubbery what happened to the other sixteen he hung up quickly the analysis is brilliant professor tochus at harvard had said of his paper on the last words of dutch schultz i particularly like the way youve combined both freud and adler in finding sexuality and power drives expressed in the same image at certain places that is quite original drake laughed and said the marquis de sade anticipated me by a century and a half i fear power and possession are sexual to some males drakes brilliance had also been noted by jungs circle in zurich once when drake was off taking mescaline with paul klee and friends on what they called their journey to the east drake had been a topic of long and puzzled conversation in lungs study we havent seen his like since joyce was here one woman psychiatrist commented he is brilliant yes jung said sadly but evil so evil that i despair of comprehending him i even wonder what old freud would think this man doesnt want to murder his father and possess his mother he wants to murder god and possess the cosmos maldonado got two phone calls the third morning the first was from louis lepke and was crudely vehement whats up banana nose the insult of using the forbidden nickname in personal conversation was deliberate and almost unforgivable but maldonado forgave it you spotted my boys following you eh he asked genially i spotted your soldiers lepke emphasized the word and that means you wanted me to spot them whats up you know if i get hit you get hit you wont get hit caromio don federico replied still cordial i had a crazy idea about something i thought might be coming from inside and youre the only one who would know enough to do it i thought i was wrong i can tell by your voice and if i was right you wouldnt have called me a million apologies nobody will be following you anymore except maybe tom deweys investigators eh he laughed okay lepke said slowly call them off and ill forget it but dont try to scare me again i do crazy things when im scared never again maldonado promised he sat frowning at the phone after lepke hung up now i owe him he thought illhave to arrange to bump off somebody whos annoying him to show the proper and most courteous apology but virgin mother if it isnt the butcher who is it a real witch the phone rang again crossing himself and calling on the virgin silently maldonado lifted the receiver let him harness himself to you and then bother you robert putney drake quoted pleasantly fun is fun he did not hang up listen don federico said who is this dutch died three times drake said in a sepulchral tone when mendy weiss shot him when vince coils ghost shot him and when that dumb junkie the teacher shot him but dillinger never even died once mister you got a deal maldonado said im sold ill meet you anywhere in broad daylight in central park any place youll feel safe no you will not meet me just now drake said coolly you are going to discuss this with mr lepke and mr capone first you will also discuss it with he read off a card in his hand fifteen names then after you have all had time to consider it you will be hearing from me drake farted as he always did in the nervous moments when an important deal was being arranged and hung up quickly now he said to himself insurance a photostat of his second analysis of the last words of dutch schultz the private one not the public version which he had turned in to the department of psychology at harvard was on the hotel desk before him he folded it smartly and pinned on top of it a note saying there are five copies in the vaults of five different banks he then inserted it in an envelope addressed it to luciano and strolled out to drop it down the hotel mail chute returning to his room he dialed louis lepke born louis buchalter of the organization later to be named murder inc by the sensational press when lepke answered drake recited solemnly still quoting the dutchman i get a month they did it come on illuminati who the hell is this lepkes voice cried as drake gently cradled the phone a few moments later he completed checking out of the hotel and flew home on the noon flight to spend five grueling twentyhour days reorganizing and streamlining his fathers bank on the fifth night he relaxed and took a young lady of the lodge family to dance to ted weemss orchestra and listen to their new young vocalist perry como afterwards he fucked her thirteen to the dozen and seven ways to a sunday the next morning he took out a small book in which he had systematically listed all the richest families in america and placed her first name and a check after lodge as he had done with morgan the week before a rockefeller would be next he was on the noon flight to new york and spent the day negotiating with morgan trust officials that night he saw a breadline on fortieth street and became profoundly agitated back in his hotel he made one of his rare almost furtive diary entries revolution could occur at any time if huey long hadnt been shot last year we might have it already if capone had let the dutchman hit dewey the justice department would be strong enough now due to the reaction to ensure that the state would be secure if roosevelt cant maneuver us into the war when it starts all will be lost and the war may be three or four years away yet if we could bring dillinger back the reaction might strengthen hoover and justice but john seems to be with the other side my plan may be the last chance and the illuminati havent contacted me yet although they must have tuned in oh weishaupt what a spawn of muddleheads are trying to carry on your work he tore the page out nervously farted and crumbled it in the ashtray where he burned it slowly then still agitated he dialed mr charles luciano on the phone and said softly i am a pretty good pretzler winifred department of justice i even got it from the department dont hang up luciano said softly weve been waiting to hear from you are you still there yes drake said carefully with tight lips and a tighter sphincter okay mr lucky said you know about the illuminati you know what the dutchman was trying to say to the police you even seem to know about the liberteri and johnnie dillinger how much do you want everything drake replied and you are all going to offer it to me but not yet not tonight and he hung up the wheel of tune as the mayans knew spins three ways and just as the earth revolves on its own axis simultaneously orbits about the sun and at the same time trails after the sun as that star traverses the galaxys edge the wheel of time which is a wheel of ifs is come round again as drakes phone clicks off to gruad the grayface calculating the path of a comet and telling his followers see even the heavenly bodies are subject to law and even the lloigor so must not men and women also be subject to law and in a smaller cycle semper cuni linctus centurion stationed in a godforsaken outpost of the empire listens in boredom as a subaltern tells him excitedly that guy we crucified last fridaypeople all over town are swearing theyve seen him walking around one guy even claims to have put a hand through his side semper cuni linctus smiles cynically tell that to the gladiators he says and albert stern turns on the gas takes one last fix and full of morphine and euphoria dies slowly confident that he will always be remembered as the man who shot dutch schultz not knowing that abe reles will reveal the truth five years later camptown racetrack five miles long during joes second trip on the leif erikson they went all the way to africa and hagbard had an important conference with five gorillas at least he said afterwards that it was important joe couldnt judge since the conversation was in swahili they speak some english hagbard explained back on the sub but i prefer swahili since theyre more eloquent in it and can express more nuances are you the first man to teach an ape to speak joe asked in addition to your other accomplishments oh not at all hagbard said modestly its an old discordian secret the first person to communicate with a gorilla was an erisian missionary named malaclypse the elder who was born in athens and got exiled for opposing the imposition of male supremacy when the athenians created patriarchy and locked up their women he then wandered all over the ancient world learning all sorts of secrets and leaving behind a priceless collection of mindblowing legends hes the phoenix madman mentioned in the confucian scriptures and he passed himself off as krishna to recite that gorgeous bible of revolutionary ethics the bhagavad gita to arjuna in india among other feats i believe you met him in chicago while he was pretending to be the christian devil but how have you discordians concealed the fact that gorillas talk were rather closemouthed you might say and when we do speak its usually to put somebody on or blow their minds ive noticed that joe said and the gorillas themselves are too shrewd to talk to anybody but another anarchist theyre all anarchists themselves you know and they have a very healthy wariness about people in general and government people in particular as one of them told me once if it got out that we can talk the conservatives would exterminate most of us and make the rest pay rent to live on our own land and the liberals would try to train us to be enginelathe operators who the fuck wants to operate an engine lathe they prefer their own pastoral and eristic ways and i for one would never interfere with them we do communicate though just as we communicate with the dolphins both species are intelligent enough to realize that its in their interest as part of earths biosphere to help the handful of human anarchists to try to stop or at least slow down the bloodletting and slaughter of our aneristic rulers and aneristic mobs sometimes i still get confused about your theological terms or are they psychological the aneristic forces especially the illuminati are structure freaks they want to impose their concept of order on everybody else but i still get confused about the differences between the erisian the eristic and the discordian not to mention the jams the eristic is the opposite of the aneristic hagbard explained patiently and therefore identical with it remember the hodgepodge writers like de sade max stirner and nietzsche are eristic so are the gorillas they represent total supremacy of the individual total negation of the group it isnt necessarily the warofallagainstall as aneristic philosophers imagine but it can under stress degenerate into that more often its quite pacifistic like our hairy friends in the trees back there the erisian position is modified it recognizes that aneristic forces are part of the world drama too and can never be totally abolished we merely stress the eristic as a balance because human society has been tilted grotesquely toward the aneristic side all through the piscean age we discordians are the activists in the erisian movement we do things the pure erisians work in more mysterious ways in accordance with the taoist principle of wuwei doing nothing effectively the jams are leftwingers who might have become aneristic except for special circumstances that led them in a libertarian direction but theyve fucked it all up with typical leftwing hatred trips they havent mastered the gita the art of fighting with a loving heart strange joe said dr iggy in the san francisco jam cabal explained it to me differently what would you expect hagbard replied no two who know know the same in their knowing by the way why havent you told me that youre sure those gorillas back there were just men i dressed up in gorilla suits im becoming more gullible joe said too bad hagbard told him sadly they really were men in gorilla suits i was testing how easily you could be bamboozled and you flunked now wait a minute they smelled like gorillas that was no fake youre putting me on now thats right hagbard agreed i wanted to see if youd trust your own senses or the word of a naturalborn leader and guru like me you trusted your own senses and you pass my putons are not just jokes friend the hardest thing for a man with dominance genes and piratical heredity like me is to avoid becoming a goddam authority figure i need all the feedback and information i can get from men women children gorillas dolphins computers any conscious entity but nobody contradicts an authority you know communication is possible only between equals thats the first theorem of social cybernetics and the whole basis of anarchism and i have to keep knocking down peoples dependence on me or ill become a fucking big daddy and wont get accurate communication anymore if the pigheaded illuminati and their aneristic imitators in all the governments corporations universities and armies of the world understood that simple principle theyd occasionally find out whats actually going on and stop screwing up every project they start i am freeman hagbard celine and i am not anybodys bloody leader as soon as you fully understand that im your equal and that my shit stinks just like yours and that i need a lay every fewdays or i get grouchy and make dumb decisions and that there is one more trustworthy than all the buddhas and sages but you have to find him for yourself then youll begin to understand what the legion of dynamic discord is all about one more trustworthy than all the buddhas and sages joe repeated finding himself most confused when he had been closest to total comprehension a second earlier to receive light you must be receptive hagbard said curtly work that one out for yourself meanwhile take this back to new york and chew on it a bit and he presented joe with a book entitled never whistle while youre pissing a guide to selfliberation by hagbard celine hm sh joe read the book carefully in the following weeks while pat walsh in confrontations research department checked out every assertion about the illuminati that joe had picked up from hagbard simon dillinger and dr ignotiusbut although some of the book was brilliant much was obscure and he found no clue to the one more trustworthy than all buddhas then one night high on alamout black hashish he started working on it with expanded and intensified consciousness malaclypse the elder no he was wise and somewhat benevolent in a fey sort of style but certainly not trustworthy simon for all his youth and nuttiness he had moments of incredible perception but he was almost certainly less enlightened than hagbard dillinger dr ignotius the mysterious malaclypse the younger who had disappeared leaving behind only the inscrutable principia discordia christ joe thought what a male chauvinist i am why didnt i think of stella the old joke came back to him did you see god yes and shes black of course hadnt stella presided over his initiation in dr iggys chapel hadnt hagbard said she would preside over george dorns initiation when george was ready of course joe always remembered that moment of ecstasy and certainty it taught him a lot about the use and misuse of drugs and why the illuminati went wrong for the unconscious which always tries to turn every good lay into a mother figure had contaminated the insight which his supraconscious had almost given him it was many months later just before the fernando poo crisis that he finally discovered beyond all doubt the one who was more trustworthy than all buddhas and all sages doda doda dodadodaday and semper cuni linctus the very night that he reamed his subaltern for taking native superstitions seriously passed an olive garden and saw the seventeen and with them was the eighteenth the one they had crucified the friday before magna mater he swore creeping closer am i losing my mind the eighteenth whatshisname the preacher had set up a wheel and was distributing cards to them now he turned the wheel and called out the number at which it stopped the centurion watched in growing amazement as the process was repeated several times and the cards were marked each time the wheel stopped finally the big one simon shouted bingo the scion of the noble linctus family turned and fled behind him the luminous figure said do this in commemoration of me i thought we were supposed to do the bread and wine bit in commemoration of you simon objected do both the ghostly one said the bread and wine is too symbolic and arcane for some folks this one is what will bring in the mob you see fellows if you want to bring the movement to the people you have to start from where the people are at you luke dont write that down this is part of the secret teachings slurp slurp camptown ladies sing this song but how do you account for a man like drake one of carl jungs guests asked at the sunday afternoon kaffeeklatsch where the strange young american had inspired so much speculation jung sucked on his pipe thoughtfully wondering actually how he could ever cure his associates of treating him like a guru and answered finally a fine mind strikes on an idea like the arrow hitting bullseye the americans have not yet produced such a mind because they are too assertive too outgoing they land on an idea even an important idea like one of their fullbacks making a tackle hence they always crumple or cripple it drake has such a mind he has learned everything about power more than adler knows for all his obsession on the subject but he has not learned the important thing that is of course how to avoid power what he needs and will probably never achieve is religious humility impossible in his country where even the introverts are extroverted most of the time it was a famous novelist who was later to win the nobel prize who actually gave drake his first lead on what the mafia always called il segreto they had been talking about joyce and his unfortunate daughter and the novelist mentioned joyces attempts to convince himself that she wasnt really schizophrenic he told jung after all i do the same sorts of things with language myself do you know what jung that old chinese sage disguised as a psychiatrist answered you are diving but she is sinking incisive of course and yet all of us who write anything that goes below the surface of naturalism can understand joyces skepticism we never know for sure whether were diving or just sinking that reminded drake of his thesis and he went and got the last words of mr arthur flegenheimer aka dutch schultz from his bureau he handed the sheets to the novelist and asked would you say the author of this was diving or sinking the novelist read slowly with increasing absorption and finally looked up to regard drake with extremely curious eyes is it a translation from the french he asked no drake said the author was an american so its not poor artaud i thought it might be hes been around the bend as the english say since he went to mexico i understand hes currently working on some quite remarkable astrological charts involving chancellor hitler the novelist lapsed into silence and then asked what do you regard as the most interesting line in this a boy has never wept nor dashed a thousand kim drake quoted since that was the line that bothered him most oh that boy imagery is all personal just repressedhomosexuality quite ordinary the novelist said impatiently i was in the can and the boy came at me i think the author hurt the boy in some way all the references are tinged with more than normal homosexual guilt my god drake thought vince coll he was young enough to seem like a boy to schultz the dutchman thought coils ghost was shooting at him in that john in newark i would imagine the author killed himself or is in a mental hospital by now the novelist went on thoughtfully hes dead drake said grudgingly but i wont give you any more clues its fascinating to see how well youre doing on your own this is the interesting line the novelist said or three lines rather i would hear it the circuit court would hear it and the supreme court might hear it if that aint the payoff please crack down on the chinamans friends and hitlers commander you swear this author was american well he came of german ancestry drake said thinking of jungs theory of genetic memory but chancellor hitler would hate to admit it his people were not aryan he was jewish the novelist exclaimed whats so surprising about that only that scarcely two or three people in the whole world outside the inner circle of the nazi party would understand what was meant by the chinaman and hitlers commander this author must have delved very deeply into occult literature things like eliphas levi or ludvig prinn or some of the most closely guarded rosicrucian secrets and then made a perfectly amazing guess in the right direction what in the world are you talking about the novelist looked at drake for a long time then said i hate to even discuss it some things are too vile some books as your mr poe said should not allow themselves to be read even i have coded things in my most famous work which is admired for all the wrong reasons in my search for the mystical i have learned things i would rather forget and the real goal of herr hitler is one of those things but you must tell me who was this remarkable author he just called me luciano told maldonado and i got this much at least hes not a shakedown artist hes aiming big and hes big already himself im getting my lawyer out of bed to run down all the best boston families and find one with a son who shows signs of having the old larceny in his heart i bet its a banking family i can hear money in a voice and he has it drake was persistent and finally the novelist said as you know i refuse to live in germany because of what is happening there nevertheless it is my home and i do hear things if i try to explain you must get your mind out of the arena of ordinary politics when i say hitler does have a master that doesnt mean he is a front man in the pedestrian political sense the novelist paused how can i present the picture so you will understand it you are not german how can you understand a people of whom it has been said truthfully that they have one foot in their own land and one foot in thule have you even heard of thule thats the german name for the fabulous kingdom the greeks called atlantis whether this kingdom ever existed is immaterial the belief in it has existed since the dawn of history and beliefs motivate actions in fact you cannot understand a mans actions unless you understand his beliefs the novelist paused again and then began talking about the golden dawn society in england in the s strange things were written by the members algernon blackwood for instance wrote of intelligent beings who preexisted mankind on earth can you take such a concept seriously can you think about blackwoods warnings of his guarded phrases such as of such great powers or beings there may conceivably be a survival of which poetry and legend alone caught a flying memory and called them gods monsters mythical beings of all sorts and kinds or arthur machen who wrote of the miracles of mons during the great war describing the angels as they were called and published this two days before the soldiers at the scene sent back reports of the incident machen was in the golden dawn and he left it to rejoin the catholic church warning there are sacraments of evil as well as of good william butler yeats was a member too and you must certainly know his remarkable lines what rough beast its hour come round at last slouches toward bethlehem to be born and the golden dawn was just the outer portal of the mysteries the things that crowley learned after leaving the golden dawn and joining the ordo templi orientis hitler suppressed both the dawn and the ordo templi orientis you know he belonged to the vril society himself where the really extraterrestrial secrets are kept you seem to be having a hard time getting to the point drake said some things need to be approached in hints even in allegories you have taken mescaline with klee and his friends and spent the night seeing the great visions do i need to remind you that reality is not a onelevel affair very well drake said behind the golden dawn and the oto and the vril society is a hidden group of real initiates there was a german branch of the golden dawn and hitler was a member you want me to understand that to treat these sacraments of evil and these beings from atlantis as no more than fictions would be to oversimplify is that right the golden dawn was founded by a german woman carrying on a tradition that was already a hundred years old in bavaria as for these powers or beings from thule they do not exist in the sense that bricks and beefsteak exist either the physicist by manipulating these fantastic electrons which i remind you have to be imagined as moving from one place to another without passing through any intervening space like a fairy or a ghost produces real phenomena visible to the senses say then that by manipulating these beings or powers from thule certain men are able to produce effects that can also be seen and experienced what was the golden dawn drake asked absorbed how did it begin its very old more than medieval the modern organization began in with a man who quit the jesuits because he thought he was an atheist until his researches into eastern history had surprising results its him hitler screamed he has come for me and then as herman rauschning recorded he lapsed into gibberish the boss himself dutch schultz moaned oh mama i cant go through with it please come on open the soap duckets the chimney sweeps take to the sword shut up you got a big mouth weve got two real possibilities lepkes lawyer reported but one of them is boston irish and what you described was the old original boston accent the second one is probably your man then his name is robert putney drake standing before the house on benefit street drake could see across the town the peak of sentinel hill and the old deserted church that had harbored the starry wisdom sect in the s he turned back to the door and raised the old georgian knocker remembering lillibridge the reporter and blake the painter had both died investigating that sect then rapped smartly three times howard phillips lovecraft pale gaunt cadaverous opened the door mr drake he asked genially it was good of you to see me drake said nonsense lovecraft replied ushering him into the colonial hallway any admirer of my poor tales is always welcome here they are so few that i could have them all here on a single day without straining my aunts dinner budget he may be one of the most important men alive drake thought and he doesnt really suspect he left boston by train this morning the soldier reported to maldonado and lepke he was going to providence rhode island of course i have no hesitation in discussing it lovecraft said after he and drake were settled in the old booklined study and mrs gamhill had served them tea whatever your friend in zurich may feel i am and always have been a strict materialist but you have been in touch with these people oh certainly and an absurd lot they are all of them it began after i published a story called dagon in let me see i had been reading the bible and the description of the philistine sea god dagon reminded me of sea serpent legends and of the reconstructions of dinosaurs by paleontologists and the notion came to me suppose dagon were real not a god but simply a longlived being vaguely related to the great saurians simply a story to entertain those who enjoy the weird and gothic in literature you cant imagine my astonishment when various occult groups began contacting me asking which group i belonged to and which side i was on they were all terribly put out when i made perfectly clear that i didnt believe any such rubbish but drake asked perplexed why did you pick up more and more of these hidden occult teachings and incorporate them in your later stories i am an artist lovecraft said a mediocre artist i fear and dont contradict me i value honesty above all the other virtues i would like to believe in the supernatural in a world of social justice and in my own possession of genius but reason commands that i accept the facts the world is made of blind matter the wicked and brutal always have and always will trample on the weak and innocent and i have a very microscopic capacity to create a small range of esthetic effects all macabre and limited in their appeal to a very special audience nevertheless i would that things were otherwise hence although a conservative i support certain social legislation that might improve the conditions of the poor and although a poor writer i try to elevate the status of my own wretched prose vampires and ghosts and werewolves are worn out they provoke chuckles rather than terror thus when i began to learn of the old lore after dagon was published i began to use it in my stories you cant imagine the hours i have spent with those old volumes at miskatonic wading through tons of trash alhazred and levi and von juntzt were all mental cases you know to sift out the notions that were unfamiliar enough to cause a genuine shock and a real shudder in my readers and youve never received threats from any of these occult groups for mentioning lok sotot or cthulhu outright in your stories only when i mentioned kali lovecraft said with a wry smile some thoughtful soul reminded me of what happened to bierce after he wrote a bit frankly on that subject but that was a friendly warning not a threat mr drake you are a banker and a businessman certainly you dont take any of this seriously let me reply with a question of my own drake said carefully why in all the esoteric lore which you have chosen to make exoteric through your stories have you never mentioned the law of fives in fact lovecraft said i did hint at it rather broadly in at the mountains of madness have you not read that its my longest and i think my best effort to date but he seemed abruptly paler in the case of charles dexter ward drake pursued you quote a formula from eliphas levis history of magic but you dont quote it in full why was that lovecraft sipped his tea obviously framing his answer carefully finally he said one doesnt have to believe in santa claus to recognize that people will exchange presents at christmas time one doesnt have to believe in yog sothoth the eater of souls to realize how people will act who do hold that belief it is not my intent in any of my writings to provide information that will lead even one unbalanced reader to try experiments that will result in the loss of human life drake arose i came here to learn he said but it appears that my only possible function is to teach let me remind you of the words of laotse those who speak do not know those who know do not speak most occult groups are in the first class and their speculations are as absurd as you think but those in the second class are not to be so lightly dismissed they have left you alone because your stories appear only in magazines that appeal to a small minority these magazines however have lately been printing stories about rockets and nuclear chain reactions and other matters that are on the edge of technological achievement when these fantasies start coming true which will probably occur within a decade there will be much wider interest in such magazines and your stories will be included in that renaissance then you will receive some very unwelcome attention lovecraft remained seated i think i know of whom you are speaking i can also read newspapers and make deductions even if they are mad enough to attempt it they do not have the means they would have to take over not one government but many that project would keep them busy enough i should think to distract them from worrying about a few lines here and there in stories that are published as fiction i can conceive of the next war leading to breakthroughs in rocketry and nuclear energy but i doubt that even that will lead many people to take my stories seriously or to see the connections between certain rituals which i have never described explicitly and acts which will be construed as the normal excesses of despotism good day sir drake said formally i must be off to new york and your welfare is really not a major concern in my life good day lovecraft said rising with colonial courtesy since you have been so good as to give me a warning i will return the favor i do not think your interest in these people is based on a wish to oppose them but to serve them i beg you to remember their attitude toward servants back out on the street drake experienced a momentary dejection for nearly twenty years hes been writing about them and they havent contacted him ive been rocking the boat on two continents and they havent contacted me what does it take to make them show their hand and if i dont have an understanding with them anything i work out with maldonado and capone is written on the wind i just cant afford to deal with the mafia before i deal with them what should i do put an ad in the new york times will the allseeing eye please look in my direction r p drake boston and a pontiac stolen an hour before in kingsport pulled away from the curb several houses back and started following drake as he left benefit street and walked back toward the downtown area he wasnt looking back so he didnt see what happened to it but he noticed an old man coming toward him stop in his tracks and turn white jesus on a pogo stick the old man said weakly drake looked over his shoulder and saw nothing but an empty street what is it he asked never mind the old man replied youd never believe me mister and he cut across the sidewalk toward a saloon what do you mean you lost four soldiers maldonado screamed into the phone just what im saying eddie vitelli of the providence gambling heroin and prostitution vitellis said we found your drake at a hotel four of the best soldiers weve got followed him they called in once to say he was at a house on benefit street i told them to pick him up as soon as he comes out and thats it period its all she wrote theyre all gone like something picked them off the face of the earth ive got everybody looking for the car they were in and thats gone too drake canceled his trip to new york and went back to boston plunging into bank business and mulling over his next move two days later the janitor came to his desk hat in hand and asked could i speak to you mr drake yes getty what is it drake replied testily his tone was deliberate the man was probably about to ask for a raise and it was best to put him on the defensive immediately its this sir the janitor said laying a card on drakes desk drake looked down impatiently and saw a rainbow of colors the card was printed on some unknown plastic and created a prismatic effect recalling his mescaline trips in zurich through the rainbow shimmering and radiant he saw the outlines of a thirteenstep pyramid with a red eye at the top he stared up at the janitor and saw a face without subservience or uncertainty the grand master of the eastern united states is ready to talk to you the janitor said softly holy cleopatra drake cried and tellers turned to stare at him kleopatra simon moon asked twentythree years later tell him about kleopatra it was a sunny afternoon in october and the drapes in the living room of the apartment on the seventeenth floor of lake shore drive were pulled back to reveal a corner window view of chicagos loop skyscrapers and the whitecapdotted blue surface of lake michigan joe sprawled in a chair facing the lake simon and padre pederastia were on a couch under an enormous painting titled kleopatra she looked a good deal like stella maris and was holding an asp to her bosom the eyeandpyramid symbol appeared several times in the hieroglyphs on the tomb wall behind her sitting in an armchair opposite the painting was a slender man with sharp dark features shoulderlength chestnut hair a forked brown beard and green eyes kleopatra said the man was an instant study would have made her polymother of the great globe itself if shed lived she damned near brought down the roman empire and she did shorten its life by centuries she forced octavius to bring so much aneristic power to bear that the empire went prematurely into the state of bureaucracy what do i call you said joe lucifer satan call me malaclypse the elder said the forkbearded man with a smile that seemed to beam through endless shifting veils of warm selfregard i dont get it said joe the first tune i saw you we were all terrified out of our minds though when you finally showed up looking like billy graham i didnt know whether to laugh or go catto but i know i was scared padre pederastia laughed you were so terrified my son that you were trying to climb right inside our little redheads big red birds nest you were so frightened that that hefty cock of yours he licked his lips was squirting juice all over the carpet oh you were terrified all right oh my yes well i wasnt so scared just at that moment you mention said joe with a smile but a little later when our friend here was about to appear you were terrified yourself padre pederastia you kept hollering come not in that form come not in that form now were all sitting around the living room behaving like old chums and this this being here is reminiscing about the good old days with kleopatra they were terrible days said malaclypse very cruel days very sad days constant wars tortures mass murders crucifixions bad times i believe you and whats worse i can understand what it means if i believe you and i can live knowing that you exist and even sit down in this living room and smoke a cigarette with you two lit cigarettes appeared between malaclypses fingers he passed one to joe joe drew on it it tasted sweet with just a hint of marijuana thats a corny trick said joe just so you dont lose your old associations to me too quickly said malaclypse too quick to understand too soon to misunderstand padre pederastia said the night of that black mass i simply had worked myself up to the point where i totally believed thats what magic is after all the people who were here that night relate to lefthand magic to the satan myth to the faust legend its a quick way to get them involved it worked with you at the time but weve brought you along fast because we want more help from you so now you dont need the trappings you dont have to be a satanist to love malaclypse said malaclypse in fact its better if youre not said simon satanists are creeps they skin dogs alive and shit like that because most satanists are christians said joe which is a very masochistic religion now just a minute said padre pederastia with some asperity hes right pederastia said malaclypse nobody knows that better than you or me for that matter did you ever meet jesus joe asked awed in spite of his skepticism malaclypse smiled i was jesus padre pederastia flapped his hands and bounced up and down in his chair youre telling too much for me trust is total or nonexistent said malaclypse i perceive that i can trust joe i wasnt the original jesus joe the one they crucified but this happened a few centuries after i experienced transcendental illumination at melos i was passing through judea in the persona of a greek merchant when they crucified jesus i met some of his followers the day he died and i talked with them if you think christianity is a bloody religion as it is this is nothing to what it would have been if jesus hadnt seemed to come back if the seventeen original apostles five of them have been purged from the records had been left on their own they would have passed from horror and terror at jesuss death to vindictive fury it would have been as if islam had come seven centuries earlier instead of slowly taking over the roman empire and preserving much of the grecoroman world intact it would have swept and mobilized the east destroyed most of western civilization and replaced it with a theocracy more oppressive than pharaonic egypt i stopped that with a few magic tricks appearing in the persona of the resurrected jesus i taught there was no need for hatred and vengeance after my death i even tried to get them to realize that life is a game by teaching them bingo to this day nobody understands and critics call it part of the commercialism of the church the sacred tarot wheel the moving mandala so despite my influence christianity focused obsessively on the crucifixion of jesus which is really irrelevant to what he taught while he was alive and remained a kind of death worship when paul went to athens and made the linkup with the illuminati who were using platos academy as a front the ideology of plato combined with the mythology of christ to deliver the knockout blow to pagan humanism and lay the foundations for the modern world of superstates after that i changed my appearance again and took the name of simon magus and had some success spreading ideas contradictory to christianity you can change your appearance at will then said joe oh sure thing im just as quick with a thought projection as anybody he pushed his pinkie thoughtfully into his left nostril and worked it around joe stiffened he didnt care to watch people picking their noses in public he looked resolutely over malaclypses left shoulder now that you know as much as you do about us joe its time you started working with us chicago as you know is the illuminati nerve center in this hemisphere so well use this town to test aum a new drug with astonishing properties if elfs technicians are correct its supposed to turn neophobes into neophiles simon slapped his forehead and shouted wow man and started laughing pederastia gasped and whistled you look blank joe said malaclypse has no one explained to you that the human race is divided into two distinct genotypes neophobes who reject new ideas and accept only what they have known all their lives and neophiles who love new things change invention innovation for the first four million years of mans history all humans were neophobes which is why civilization did not develop animals are all neophobes only mutation can change them instinct is simply the natural behavior of a neophobe the neophile mutation appeared about a hundred thousand years ago and speeded up thirty thousand years ago however there has never been more than a handful of neophiles anywhere on the planet the illuminati themselves sprang from one of the oldest neophileneophobe conflicts on record i take it the illuminati were trying to hold back progress said joe is that their general aim youre still thinking like a liberal said simon nobody gives a fuck for progress right said malaclypse they were the innovators in that instance all the illuminati were and are neophiles even today they see their work as directed toward progress they want to become like gods its possible for humans given the right methods to translate themselves into sentient latticework of pure energy that will be more or less permanent the process is called transcendental illumination to distinguish it from the acquisition of insight into the true nature of man and the universe which is ordinary illumination ive gone through transcendental illumination and am a being composed altogether of energy as you may have guessed however prior to becoming energy fields men often fall victim to hubris their actions cause pain to others and make them insensitive uncreative and irrational mass human sacrifice is the most reliable method of achieving transcendental illumination human sacrifice can of course be masked as other things such as war famine and plague the vision of the four horsemen vouchsafed to saint john is actually a vision of mass transcendental illumination how did you achieve it joe asked i was present at the massacre of the male inhabitants of the city of melos by the athenians in bc have you read thucydides a long time ago well thucydides had it wrong he presented it as an outandout atrocity but there were extenuating circumstances the melians had been stabbing athenian soldiers in the back poisoning them filling them full of arrows from ambush some of them were working for the spartans and some were on the side of athens but the athenians didnt know which ones they could trust they didnt want to do any unnecessary killing but they did want to get back to athens alive so they rounded up all the melian men one day and hacked them to pieces in the town square the women and children were sold into slavery what did you do said joe were you there with the athenians yes but i didnt do any killing i was a chaplain of the erisian denomination of course but i was prepared to perform services to hermes dionysus heracles aphrodite athena hera and some of the other olympians i almost went mad with horror i didnt understand that pangenitor is panphage i was praying to eris to deliver me or deliver the melians or do something and she answered me hail she what done it all said simon i almost believe you said joe but every once in a while the suspicion creeps in that youre simply doing a twothousandyearold man routine and the butt of the joke is me malaclypse stood up with a little smile come here joe what for just come here malaclypse held his hands away from his sides palms turned toward joe appealingly joe walked over and stood before him put your hand into my side said malaclypse oh come on said joe pederastia snickered malaclypse just looked at him with a gentle encouraging smile so he reached out to touch malaclypses shirt his hands still felt nothing he closed his eyes to verify that there was no sensation whatever thin air eyes still shut he moved his hand forward he opened his eyes and when he saw his arm sunk into malaclypses body up to the elbow he almost barfed his cookies he drew back it cant be a movie id be almost willing to say a moving holograph but the illusion is too perfect youre looking right at me to my eyes you are unquestionably there try a few karate chops said malaclypse joe obliged swinging his hand like a scythe through malaclypses waist chest and head for a finale joe brought his hand straight down through the top of the beings head i suspend judgment said joe maybe you are what you say you are but its pretty hard to take can you feel anything i can create temporary sensory organs for myself whenever i want to i can enjoy just about anything a human enjoys or experiences but my primary mode of perception is a very advanced form of what you would call intuition intuition is a kind of sensitivity in the mind to events and processes what i have is a highly developed intuitional receptor which is completely controllable joe went back and sat down shaking his head you certainly are in an enviable position like i said its the real reason for human sacrifice said malaclypse he too sat down and joe now noticed that the soft upholstery of his chair didnt sink beneath his weight he seemed to rest on the surface of the cushions any sudden or violent death releases a burst of consciousness energy which can be controlled and channeled as any explosive energy can be the illuminati would all like to become as gods that has been their ambition for longer than i care to say which means they have to perpetrate mass murder said joe thinking of nuclear weapons gas chambers chemicalbiological warfare malaclypse nodded now i dont disapprove of that on moral grounds since morals are purely illusory i do have a personal distaste for that sort of thing although when youve lived as long as i have you have lost so many friends and lovers that it is impossible not to take the deaths of humans as a matter of course so it goes and since i achieved my own immortality and nonmateriality as the result of a mass murder it would be hypocritical of me to condemn the illuminati for that matter i dont condemn hypocrisy though it is also personally distasteful to me but i do say that the method of the illuminati is stupid and wasteful since everybody is already everything so why fuck around with things it is absurd to try to be something else when there is nothing else that kind of statement is simply beyond my comprehension said joe i dont know maybe its my engineering training but even after my own partial illumination in san francisco with dr iggy this kind of talk doesnt make any more sense than christian science to me soon youll understand more said malaclypse about the history of man about some of the esoteric knowledge that has been lying around for tens of thousands of years eventually youll know all thats worth knowing about absolutely everything tobias knight the fbi agent monitoring the bugging equipment in dr mocenigos home heard the pistol shot the same time carmel did what the hell he said out loud sitting up straight he had heard the door open and footsteps walking about and had been waiting for a conversation and then without warning he had heard the shot now a voice spoke sorry dr mocenigo you were a great patriot and this is a dogs death but i will share it with you then there were more footsteps and something else knight recognized the sound it was liquid being poured the steps and the pouring liquid continued and knight abruptly tore himself out of his state of shock and pressed the intercom knight asked a voice which he recognized as esperando despond the special agent in charge for las vegas mocenigos house knight said crisply get a whole crew out there doublequick something is happening one killing at least he released the intercom and listened paralyzed to the footsteps and the liquid sounds which were now mixed with subdued humming a man doing an unpleasant job but trying to keep his cool knight recognized the tune finally camptown races the humming and walking and slurping continued dodadoda then the voice spoke again this is general lawrence stewart talbot speaking to the cia the fbi and whoever else has this house bugged i discovered at two this morning that several people in our anthrax leprosy pi project have accidentally been subjected to live cultures all of them are living at the installation and can easily be isolated while the antidote works i have already given orders to that effect dr mocenigo himself unknowingly received the worst dose and was in advanced morbidity a few minutes from death when i arrived his whole house obviously will have to be burned down and i am also due to my proximity while examining him too far gone to be saved i will therefore shoot myself after setting fire to the house there is one remaining problem i found evidence that a woman had been in dr mocenigos bed earlier thats what comes of allowing important people to live off base and she must be found and given the antidote and each of her contacts must be traced needless to say this must be done quietly or there will be a nationwide panic tell the president to see that my wife gets the medal for this tell my wife that with my last breath i still insist she was wrong about that girl in red lion pennsylvania in closing i firmly believe that this is the greatest country in the history of the world and can still be saved if congress will lock up those damned college kids for once and for all god bless america there was a scratching sound my god knight thought the match and the sound of flames in the midst of which general talbot tried to add a postscript but couldnt get the words out because he was screaming finally the second shot came and the screaming stopped knight raised his head jaw clenched repressed tears in his steely eyes that was a great american he said aloud over cigars and brandy after george had been sent off to bed to be distracted by tarantella richard jung asked pointedly just how sure are you that this discordian bunch is a match for the illuminati its kind of late in the game to change sides drake started to speak then turned to maldonado tell him about italy in the th century he said the illuminati are just men and women maldonado replied obligingly more women than men in fact it was eve weishaupt who started the whole show adam just acted as her front because people are used to taking orders from men this atlantis stuff is mostly bullshit everybody who knows about atlantis at all traces his family or his clan or his club back there some of the old dons in the maf even try to trace la cosa nostra back there all bullshit just like all the wasps tracing themselves back to the mayflower for everyone who can prove it like mr drake theres a hundred who are just bluffing you see maldonado went on more intensely chewing his cigar ferociously originally the illuminati was just a how do you call it a kind of thcentury womens liberation front behind adam weishaupt was eve behind godwin who started all this socialism and anarchism with his political justice book was his mistress mary wollstonecraft who started the woman revolution with a book called uh vindication of the rights of women drake contributed and they got tom paine to write on womens lib too and to defend their french revolution and try to import it here but that all fell through and they didnt get a real controlling interest in the us until they hoodwinked woody wilson into creating the federal reserve in and thats the way it usually goes in italy they had a front called the haute vente that was so damn secret mazzini was a member all his life and never knew the control came from bavaria my grandpa told me all about those days we had a threeway dogfight the monarchists on one side the haute vente and the liberteri the anarchists on the other and the maf in the middle trying to roll with the punches and figure out which way the bread was buttered you know then the liberteri got wise to the haute vente and split from it and it was a fourway fight you look it up in the history books they tell it like it was except they dont mention who ran the haute vente and then the good old law of fives came into it and we had the fascisti and it was a fiveway dogfight who won not the illuminati it wasnt until manipulating the english government to discourage mussolinis peace plans and using hitler to get benito into the berlintokyo axis that the illuminati had some kind of control in italy and even then it was indirect when we made our deal with the cia it was called the oss back in those days luciano got out of the joint and we turned over italy and delivered mussolini dead and the point of all this jung asked coldly the point is maldonado said the maf has been against the illuminati more of the time than weve been with them and were still doing business and were stronger than ever believe me their bark is much worse than their bite because they know some magic they scare everybody weve had magicians and belladonnas witches to you in sicily since before paris got hot pants for helen and believe me a bullet kills them as dead as it kills anybody else the illuminati do have a bite drake interjected but it is my judgment that they are going out with the age of pisces the discordians i think represent an aquarian swing oh i dont go for that mystic stuff jung said next thing youll be quoting i ching at me like my old man youre an anal type like most accountants drake replied coolly and a capricorn as well downtoearth and conservative i wont attempt to persuade you about this aspect of the matter just take my word i didnt get where i am by ignoring significant facts just because they wont fit on a profitandloss statement on the profitandloss level however i have had reasons to believe that the discordians can currently outbid the illuminati these reasons date back many months before the appearance of those marvelous statues today later in bed drake turned the matter around in his head and looked at it from several sides lovecrafts words came back to him i beg you to remember their attitude toward their servants that was it basically he was an old man and he was tired of being their servant or satrap or satellite when he was thirtythree he was ready to take them over as cecil rhodes had once done somehow he had been maneuvered into taking over just one section of their empire if he could think truthfully that he owned the united states more thoroughly than any president in four decades the fact remained that he did not own himself not until he signed his declaration of independence tonight by joining the discordians the other jung the alter zauber in zurich had tried to tell him something about power once but he had dismissed it as sentimental slop now he tried to remember it and suddenly all the old days came back klee and his numinous paintings the journey to the east old crowley saying of course mixing the lefthand and righthand paths is dangerous if you fear such risks go back to hesse and jung and those old ladies their way is safe and mine isnt all that can be said for me is that i have real power and they have dreams but the illuminati had crushed crowley just as they smashed willie seabrook when those men revealed too much i beg you to remember their attitude toward their servants damn it what was it jung had said about power and he turned the card over and on the back was an address on beacon hill with the words tonight he looked up at the janitor who backed away deferentially saying thank you mr drake sir without a touch of irony in his face or voice and it hadnt surprised him at all that for deliberate contrast the grand master he met that night one of the five illuminati primi for the us was an official of the justice department and what had jung said about power a few of them will have to fall lepke i would recommend perhaps luciano also no mystical trappings just a businesslike meeting our interest is the same as yours increasing the power of the justice department an equal increment in the power of the other branches of government will proceed nicely when we get the war into gear drake remembered his excitement it was all as he had foreseen the end of the republic the dawn of the empire after germany russia drake asked once very good you are indeed farseeing the grand master replied mr hitler of course is only a medium virtually no ego at all on his own you have no idea how dull and prosaic such types are except when under proper inspiration naturally his supplied ego will collapse he will become psychotic and we will have no control over him at all then we are prepared to help him fall our real interest now is here let me show you something we do not work in general outlines our plans are always specific to the last detail he handed drake a sheaf of papers the war will probably end in or we will have russia built up as the next threat within two years read this carefully drake read what was to become the national security act of this abolishes the constitution he said almost in ecstasy quite and believe me mr drake by or we will have congress and the public ready to accept it the american empire is closer than you imagine but the isolationists and pacifistssenator taft and that crowd they will wither away when communism replaces fascism as the number one enemy your smalltown conservative will be ready for global adventures on a scale that would make the heads of poor mr roosevelts liberals spin trust me we have every detail pinpointed let me show you where the new government will be located drake stared at the plan and shook his head some people will recognize what a pentagon means he said dubiously they will be dismissed as superstitious cranks believe me this building will be constructed within a few years it will become the policeman of the world nobody will dare question its actions or judgments without being denounced as a traitor within thirty years mr drake within thirty years anyone who attempts to restore power to the congress will be cursed and vilified not by liberals but by conservatives holy god drake said the grand master rose and walked to an oldfashioned globe nearly as large as king kongs head pick a spot mr drake any spot i guarantee you we will have american troops there within thirty years the empire that you dreamed of while reading tacitus robert putney drake felt humbled for an instant even though he recognized the gimmick using one single example of telepathy plucking tacitus out of his head to climax the presentation of the incredible dream at last he understood firsthand the awe that the illuminati created in both its servitors and its enemies there will be opposition the grand master went on in the s and early s especially thats where your notion for a unified crime syndicate fits into our plan to crush the opposition we will need a justice department equivalent in many ways to hitlers gestapo if your scheme works if the mafia can be drawn into a syndicate that is not entirely under sicilian control and the various other groups can be brought under the same umbrella we will have a nationwide outlaw cartel the public itself will then call for the kind of justice department that we need by the mids wiretapping of all sorts must be so common that the concept of privacy will be archaic and tossing sleeplessly drake thought how smoothly it had all worked out why then was he rebelling against it why did it give him no pleasure and what was it jung had said about power richard jung wearing carl jungs old sweater and smoking his pipe said and next the solar system the room was crowded with white rabbits playboy bunnies bugs bunny the wolf man ku kluxers mafiosos lepke with accusing eyes a dormouse a mad hatter the king of hearts the prince of wands and jung was shouting over the din billions to reach the moon trillions to get to mars all pouring into our corporations better than the gladiatorial games linda lovelace elbowed him aside call me ishmaelian she said suggestively but jung handed drake the skeleton of a biafran baby for petruchios feast he explained producing a piece of ticker tape we now own he began to read seventytwo percent of earths resources and fiftyone percent of all the armed troops in the world are under our direction here he said passing the body of an infant that had died in appalachia see that this one gets an apple in its mouth a bunny passed drake a thompson machine gun the model that had been called an automatic rifle because the army had no funds to buy submachine guns that year whats this for drake asked confused we have to defend ourselves the bunny said the mob is at the gates the hungry mob an astronaut named spartacus is leading them drake handed the gun to maldonado and crept upstairs to his private heliport he passed through the lavatory to the laboratory where dr frankenstein was attaching electrodes to linda lovelaces jaws and entered the golf course again where the door opened to the airplane cabin he was escaping in his jet and below he could see black panthers college kids starving coal miners indians viet cong brazilians an enormous army pillaging his estate they must have seen the fnords he said to the pilot but the pilot was his mother and the sight of her threw him into a rage leaving me alone he screamed always leaving me alone to go to your damned parties with father i never had a mother just one nigger maid after another acting as mothers were the parties that fucking important oh she said reddening how can you use that word in front of your own mother to hell with that all i remember is your perfume hanging in the air and some strange black face coming when i called for you youre such a baby she said sadly all your life youve always been a big baby it was true he was wearing diapers a vice president of morgan guarantee trust stared at him incredulously i say drake do you really think that is appropriate garb for an important business meeting beside him linda lovelace bent in ecstasy to kiss the secret ardor of ishmael a whale of a good time the vice president said suddenly giggling inanely oh fuck you all drake screamed ive got more money than any of you the money is gone carl jung said wearing freuds beard what totem will you use now to ward off insecurity and the things that go bump in the night he sneered what childish codes mafiamorte alla francia italia anela french canadian bean so up the five consecrated bavarian seers annuit coeptis novus or do seclorumantichrist now our savior a boy has never wept nor dashed a thousand kimasmodeus belial hastur nyarlathotep wotan niggurath dholes azathoth tindalos kadith childs play glasspielen well if youre so damned smart who are the inner five right now drake asked testily groucho chico harpo zeppo and gummo jung said riding off on a tricycle the illuminati is your mothers breast sucker added albert hoffman peddling after jung on a bicycle drake awoke as the eye closed it was all clear in an instant without the labor he had spent working over the dutchmans words maldonado stood by the bedside his face karloffs and said we deserve to be dead yes that was what it was like when you discovered you were a robot not a man like karloff in the last scene of bride of frankenstein drake awoke again and this time he was really awake it was clear crystal clear and he had no regrets far away over long island sound came the first distant rumble of thunder and he knew this was no storm that any scientist less heretical than jung or wilhelm reich would ever understand our job huxley wrote before death is waking up drake put on his robe quickly and stepped out into the dark elizabethan hallway five hundred thousand dollars this house and grounds had cost including the cottages and it was only one of his eight estates money what did it mean when nyarlathotep appeared and the wild beasts followed him and licked his hands as that damned stupidsmart lovecraft wrote what did it matter when the blind idiot god chaos blew earths dust away drake pushed open the dark paneled doorway of georges room good tarantella was gone the thunder rumbled again and drakes own shadow looming over the bed reminded him once more of a karloff movie he bent over the bed and shook georges shoulder gently mavis the boy said drake wondered who the hell mavis was somebody terrific obviously if george could be dreaming about her after a session with the illuminatitrained tarantella or was mavis another exilluminatus there were a lot of them with the discordians lately drake had surmised he shook georges shoulder again more vigorously oh no i cant come again george said drake gave another shake and two weary and frightened eyes opened to look at him what up drake grunted grabbing george under the arms and pulling him to a sitting position out of bed he added panting rolling the boy to the edge drake was looking through waves upward at george damn it the thing has already found my mind youve got to get out he repeated youre in danger here october charley workman mendy weiss and jimmy the shrew charge through the door of the palace chop house and according to orders cowboy the joint lead pellets like rain and rain like lead pellets hitting georges window christ what is it he asked drake stood him up stark naked and handed him his drawers repeating hurry charley the bug looked over the three bodies abadaba berman lulu rosenkrantz and somebody he didnt recognize none of them was the dutchman my god we fucked up he said dutch aint here but a commotion has started in the alleys of the dream albert stern taking his last fix of the night suddenly recalls his fantasy of killing somebody as important as john dillinger the can mendy weiss says excitedly he had a hardon like he always did on this kind of job man is a giant drake says forced to live in a pigmys hut what does that mean george asks it means were all fools drake says excitedly smelling the old whore death especially those of us who try to act like giants by bullying the others in the hut instead of knocking the goddam walls down carl jung told me that only in more elegant language georges dangling penis kept catching his eye homosexuality an occasional thing with drake heterosexuality his normal state and the new lust for the old whore death were all tugging at him the dutchman dropped his penis urine squirting his shoes and went for his gun as he heard the shots in the barroom he turned quickly unable to stop pissing and albert stern came through the door shooting before dutch could take aim falling forward he saw that it was really vince coll a ghost oh mama mama mama he said lying in his urine which way do we go george asked buttoning his shirt you go drake said down the stairs and out the back to the garage heres the key to my silver wraith rolls royce it wont be any use to me anymore why arent you coming george protested we deserve to be dead drake said all of us in this house hey thats crazy i dont care what youve done a guilt trip is always crazy ive been on a crazier trip as youd call it all my life drake said calmly the power trip now move george dont make no bull moves the dutchman said hes talking sergeant luke conlon whispered at the foot of the hospital bed the police stenographer f j long began taking notes what have you done with him the dutchman went on oh mama mama mama oh stop it oh oh oh sure sure mama drake sat down in the window seat and too nervous for a cigar lit one of his infrequent cigarettes one hundred and fiftyseven he thought remembering the last entry in his little notebook one hundred and fiftyseven rich women one wife and seventeen boys and never once did i really make contact never once did i smash the walls the wind and the rain were now deafening outside fourteen billion dollars thirteen billion illegal and taxfree more than getty or hunt even if i could never publicize the fact and that arab boy in tangier who picked my pocket after he blew me my mothers perfume hours and hours in zurich puzzling over the dutchmans words outside flegenheimers livery stable in the bronx phil silverberg is teasing young arthur flegenheimer in holding the burglars tools out of reach asking mockingly do you really think youre big enough to knock over a house on your own in the newark hospital the dutchman cries angrily now listen phil fun is fun the seventeen illuminati representatives vanished in the dark the one with the goats head suddenly returned what happened to the other sixteen dutch asked the hospital walls the blood from his arm signed the parchment oh he done it please he asked vaguely sergeant conlon looks bemusedly at the stenographer lang the lightning seemed dark and the darkness seemed light its taking hold of my mind completely drake thought sitting by the window i will hold onto my sanity drake swore silently what was that rock song about jesus i was remembering only five inches between me and happiness was it no thats from deep throat the whiteness of the whale the waves covered his vision again wrong song obviously i have to reach him to unify the forces no dammit thats not my thought thats his thought hes coming up up out of the waves i must rise i must rise to unify the forces dillinger said youre right dutch fuck the illuminati fuck the maf the justified ancients of mummu would be glad to have you the dutchman looked right into sergeant conlons eyes and asked john please oh did you buy the whole tale you promised a million sure get out i wished i knew please make it quick fast and furious please fast and furious please help me get out i should have gotten out in when i first learned about the camps drake thought i never realized until then that they really meant to do it and next hiroshima why did i stay after hiroshima it was so obvious it was just the way lovecraft wrote the idiot god chaos blew earths dust away and back in i knew the secret if a cheap hoodlum like dutch schultz had a great poet buried in him what might be released if any man looked the old whore death in the eye say that i betrayed my country and my planet but worse add that i betrayed robert putney drake the giant of psychology i murdered when i used the secret for power and not for healing i see the plumbers the cesspool cleaners the colorless allcolor of atheism i am the fates lieutenant i act under ardors white white void ahabs eye five inches from happiness the law of fives always ahab schlurped down down this bavarian stuff is all bullshit dillinger said theyre mostly englishmen since rhodes took command in and theyve already infiltrated justice state and labor as well as the treasury thats who youre playing ball with and let me tell you what they plan to do with your people the jews in this war theyre cooking up listen the dutchman interrupted capone would have a bullet in me if he knew i was even talking to you john are you afraid of capone he arranged to have the feds put a bullet in me at the biograph and im still sassy and lively as ever im not afraid of capone or lepke or maldonado or the dutchmans eyes brought back the hospital room im a pretty good pretzeler he told sergeant conlon anxiously winifred department of justice i even got it from the department the pain shot through him sharp as ecstasy sir please stop it he had to explain about demolay and weishaupt listen he urged the last knight i dont want to holler it was so hard with the pulsings of the pain i dont know sir honestly i dont i went to the toilet i was in the can and the boy came at me if we wanted to break the ring no please i get a month come on illuminati cut me off it was so hard to explain i had nothing with him and he was a cowboy in one of the seven days ewige fight no business no hangouts no friends nothing just what you pick up and what you need the pain wasnt just the bullet they were working on his mind trying to stop him from saying too much he saw the goat head let him harness himself to you and then bother you he cried they are englishmen and they are a type and i dont know who is best they or us so much to say and so little time he thought of francie his wife oh sir get the doll a rofting the illuminati formula to summon the lloigor he could at least reveal that a boy has never wept nor dashed a thousand kim did you hear me they had to understand how high it went all over the world i would hear it the circuit court would hear it and the supreme court would hear it if that aint the payoff please crack down on the chinamans friends and hitlers commander eris the great mother was the only alternative to the illuminatis power he had to tell them that much mother is the best bet and dont let satan draw you too fast hes blabbing too much the one who wore the goat head winifred from washington said increase the pain the dirty rats have tuned in dutch shouted control yourself sergeant conlon said soothingly but i am dying dutch explained couldnt they understand anything drake met winifred at a cocktail party in washington in just after the national security act was passed by the senate well winifred asked do you have any further doubts none at all drake said all my open money is now invested in defense industries keep it there winifred smiled and youll get richer than you ever dreamed our present projection is that we can get congress to approve one trillion dollars in war preparations before drake thought fast and asked softly youre going to add another villain beside russia watch china winifred said calmly for once curiosity surpassed cupidity in drake he asked are you really keeping him in the pentagon would you like to meet him face to face winifred asked with a faint hint of a sneer in his voice no thank you drake said coolly ive been reading herman rauschning i remember hitlers words about the superman he is alive among us i have met him he is intrepid and terrible i was afraid of him thats enough for my curiosity hitler winifred replied not hiding the sneer now saw him in his more human form hes progressed since then tonight drake thought as the thunder rose to a maddening crescendo i will see him or one of them surely i could have picked a more agreeable form of suicide the question was pointless jung had been right all along with his law of opposites even freud knew it every sadist becomes a masochist at last on an impulse drake arose and fetched a pad and pen from the bedside tudor table he began to scribble by the light of the increasing electrical storm outside what am i afraid of havent i been building up to this rendezvous ever since i threw the bottle at mother when i was years old and it is kin to me we both live on blood do we not even if i have prettied it over by taking the blood money instead of the blood itself dimensions keep shifting whenever it gets a fix on me prinn was right in his de vermis mysteriis they dont really participate in the same spacetime as us thats what alhazred meant when he wrote their hand is at your throat but you see them not they walk serene and unsuspected not in the spaces we know but between them pull me out the dutchman moaned i am half crazy they wont let me get up they dyed my shoes give me something i am so sick i can see kadath and the two magnetic poles i must unify the forces by eating the entity which me is the real me is it so easy to flow into my soul because there is so little soul left is that what jung was trying to tell me about power i see newark hospital and the dutchman i see the white light and then the black that does not pulsate or move i see george trying to drive the rolls in this damnable rain i see the whiteness of whiteness is black anybody the dutchman pleaded kindly take my shoes off no theres a handcuff on them the baron says these things i see weishaupt and the iron boot no wonder only five ever withstand the ordeal to become the top of the pyramid baron rothschild wont let rhodes get away with that what is time or space anyway what is soul that we claim to judge it which is real the boy arthur flegenheimer seeking for his mother the gangster dutch schultz dealing in murder and corruption with the cool of a medici or a morgan or the mad poet being born in the newark hospital bed as the others die and elizabeth was a bitch they sang the golden vanity about raleigh but none could speak a word against me yet he received the preference the globe theatre new drama by will shakespeare down the street they torture sackerson the bear for sport christ they opened the san andreas fault to hide the most important records about norton sidewalks opening like mouths john barrymore falling out of bed will shakespeare in his mind my mind sir franciss mind roderick usher starry wisdom they called it the sidewalk was in trouble the dutchman tried to explain and the bears were in trouble and i broke it up please put me in that room please keep him in control i can hear it the very sounds recorded by poe and lovecraft tekelili tekelili it must be close i didnt mean to throw the bottle mother i just wanted your attention i just wanted attention okay the dutchman sighed okay i am all through cant do another thing look out mama look out for her you cant beat him police mama helen mother please take me out i can see it and it can see me in the dark there are things worse than death vivisections of the spirit i should run why do i sit here the bicycle and the tricycle skiddoo inside the pentagon the cold of interstellar space they came from the stars and brought their images with them mother im sorry come on open the soap duckets the dutchman said hopelessly the chimney sweeps take to the sword it is like a chimney without end up and up forever in deeper and deeper darkness and the red allseeing eye please help me up french canadian bean soup i want to pay let them leave me alone i want to join it i want to become it i have no more will of my own i take thee old whore death as my lawful wedded wife i am mad i am half mad mother the bottle linda schlurped sucked down unity a nineyearold girl named patty cohen lived three miles down the coast from the drake estate and she went mad in those early morning hours of april at first her parents thought she had gotten hold of some of the lsd which was known to be infiltrating the local grammar school and being fairly hip they fed her niacin and horse doctors doses of vitamin c as she ran about the house alternately laughing and making faces at them howling about hes laying in his own piss and hes still alive inside it and roderick usher by morning they knew it was more than acid and months of sadness began as they took her to clinics and private psychiatrists and more clinics and more private psychiatrists finally just before chanukah in december they took her to an elegant shrink on park avenue and she had a virtual epileptic fit in the waiting room staring at a statue on the end table and screaming dont let him eat me dont let him eat me her recovery began from that day and the sight of that miniature representation of the giant tlaloc in mexico city but three hours after drakes death george dorn lay on his bed in the hotel tudor holding a phone to his ear listening to it ring a young womans voice on the other end suddenly said hello id like to speak to inspector goodman said george there was a momentary pause then the voice said whos calling please my name is george dorn but it probably wouldnt mean anything to the inspector but would you ask him to come to the phone please and tell him i have a message for him about the case of joseph malik there was a constricted silence as if the woman on the other end of the phone wanted to scream and had stopped breathing finally she said my husband is working just now but ill be glad to give him any message you have thats funny said george ive been told inspector goodmans duty hours are noon to pm i dont think its any of your business where he is the woman suddenly blurted george felt a little shock rebecca goodman was frightened and she didnt know where her husband was something in the tone of her last three words revealed her mental state to george i must be getting more sensitive to people he thought do you ever hear from him he said gently he was feeling sorry for mrs inspector saul goodman who was come to think of it the wife of a pig if just a few years ago george had read in the paper that this womans husband had been shot down at random by some unknown revolutionarytype assailants he would probably have whispered right on one of georges own friends of that period might have killed inspector goodman there was even a moment when george himself might have done it once one of the kids in georges group had called up the young widow of a policeman killed one december by young blacks and called her a bitch and the wife of a pig and told her that her husband was guilty of crimes against the people and that those who had shot him would go down in history as heroes george had approved of this verbal action as a means of hardening oneself against bourgeois sentimentality the papers had been full of stories about how this policemans three little kids would have no christmas this year such tripe made george urgently want to throw up but now this womans anguish was coursing through the wire and he was feeling it just because her husband was not known to be dead just missing and probably not dead at all otherwise why would hagbard have said that george should get in touch with him ii dont know what you mean she said she was starting to break george thought in another minute shed be blurting out all her fears to him well for christs sake he didnt know where goodman was look he said sharply pushing back against the flow of emotion coming through to him if you hear from inspector goodman tell him if he wants to know more about the bavarian illuminati he should call george dorn at the hotel tudor thats dorn hotel tudor have you got that the illuminati look uh mr dorn whatever you want to tell you can tell me ill pass it on to him i cant do that mrs goodman thank you now goodbye wait dont hang up i cant help you mrs goodman i dont know where he is either george dropped the phone into its cradle with a sigh his hands were cold and moist well hed have to tell hagbard he couldnt reach inspector goodman but he had learned something that saul goodman who was supposed to be investigating joe maliks disappearance had himself disappeared and the words bavarian illuminati meant something to his wife george crossed the small room and turned on the tv the noon news would be on he went back to his bed lay down and lit a cigarette he was still exhausted from his sexual bout of the night before with tarantella serpentine the announcer said the attorney general has announced that he will speak at six this evening on the early morning epidemic of ganglandstyle assassinations at widely separated locations all over the country the death toll from killings of this type has reached twentyseven though local officials refuse to say whether all or any of these deaths are connected among those shot are senator edward coke bacon two highranking los angeles police officers the mayor of a town called mad dog texas a new york fight promoter a boston pharmacist a detroit ceramicist a chicago communist three new mexico hippie leaders a new orleans restaurateur a barber in yorba linda california and a sausage manufacturer in sheboygan wisconsin there were bomb explosions at fifteen locations killing thirteen more people six persons around the country have disappeared and four of these were seen being forced into cars at different times last night and this morning the attorney general today called this a reign of terror perpetrated by organized crime pointing out that though the motives for the widely scattered slayings is obscure they bear the earmarks of gangster killings however new fbi director eorge wallace who has ordered fbi agents around the country into action issued a written statement declaring quoteonce again the attorney general has treed the wrong coon proving that law enforcement should be left to the experienced professionals we have reason to think that these murders are the work of negro communists directed from pekingend of quote meanwhile the office of the vice president has issued an apology to the italianamerican antidefamation league for his reference to mafioso rubouts and the league has withdrawn its picket line from the white house remember the attorney general will address the nation at pm tonight the announcer suddenly changed his facial expression from neutral newscaster to pugnacious patriot certain dissident elements keep complaining that people dont get a chance to participate in decisions made by their government yet at a time like this when the whole nation has an opportunity to hear the attorney general the ratings are not always as good as they should be so lets do everything we can to build up those ratings tonight and let the whole world know that this is still a democracy fuck george shouted at the screen he didnt recall tv newscasters being that obnoxious must be a fairly recent development something that had happened after he left for mad dogmaybe a late outgrowth of the fernando poo crisis it was in this very hotel george remembered just after the bloody fernando poo demonstrations at the un that joe malik had first broached the subject of mad dog now joe had disappeared not unlike those people who as george knew the syndicate had snuffed in earnest of their good intentions having accepted hagbards gift of objets dart not unlike inspector saul goodman who perhaps had gone down the same rabbit hole as joe there was a knock at the door george went to it turning off the tv set in passing it was stella maris well glad to see you baby strip off that dress and come over to the bed so we can reaffirm my initiation rites stella put her hands on his shoulders never mind that now george weve got things to worry about robert putney drake and banana nose maldonado are dead come on weve got to get back to hagbard right away traveling first by helicopter then by executive jet and finally by motorboat to hagbards chesapeake bay submarine base george was exhausted and dazed in terrors aftermath he rallied when he saw hagbard again you motherfucker you sent me to get goddam killed and that has given you the courage to tell me off said hagbard with an indulgent smile fear is a funny thing isnt it george if we werent afraid of dying of diseases wed never develop the science of microbiology that science in turn creates the possibility of germ warfare and each superpower is so afraid that the others may wage germ warfare against it each develops its own plagues to wipe out the human race your mind is wandering you stupid old fart said stella george isnt kidding about nearly being killed the fear of death is the beginning of slavery hagbard said simply even though it was early george found himself on the verge of collapse ready to sleep for twentyfour hours or more the submarines engines vibrated under his feet as he trudged to his cabin but he wasnt even curious about where they were going he lay down on his bed and picked a book off the headpost bookshelf part of his gettingreadyforsleep ritual sexuality magic and perversion said the binder well that sounded juicy and promising author named francis king whoever that is citadel press only a few years ago well then george opened at random within a few years prater paragranus had become chief of the swiss section of the oto had entered into friendly relationships with the disciples of aleister crowley notably karl germer and had established a magazine subsequently prater paragranus inherited the chieftainship of krumm hellers ancient rosicrucian fraternity and the patriarchate of the gnostic catholic churchthis latter dignity he derived from chevillon murdered by the gestapo in who was himself the successor of johnny bricaud prater paragranus is also the head of one of the several groups who claim to be the true heirs and successors of the illuminati of weishaupt as revived circa by leopold engd george blinked several illuminati he had to ask hagbard about this but he was already beginning to visualize into hypnogogic revery and sleep was coming in less than a halfhour joe had distributed ninetytwo paper cups of tomato juice containing aum the drug that promised to turn neophobes into neophiles he stood in pioneer court just north of the michigan avenue bridge at a table from which hung a poster reading free tomato juice each person who took a cupful was invited to fill out a short questionnaire and leave it in a box on joes table however joe explained the questionnaire was optional and anyone who wanted to drink the tomato juice and run was welcome to do so aum would work just as well either way but the questionnaire would give elf an opportunity to trace its effect on some of the subjects a tall black policeman was suddenly standing in front of the table you got a permit for this you bet said joe with a quick smile im with the general services corporation and were running a test on a new brand of tomato juice care to try some officer no thanks said the cop unsmilingly we had a bunch of yippies threatening to put lsd in the citys water supply two years ago lets just see your credentials there was something cold hard and homicidal in this cops eyes joe thought something beyond the ordinary this would be a unique guy and the stuff would affect him uniquely joe looked down at the nameplate on the policemans jacket which read waterhouse the line behind patrolman waterhouse was getting longer joe found the paper malaclypse had given him he handed it to waterhouse who glanced at it and said this isnt enough you apparently didnt tell them you were going to set up your stand in pioneer court youre blocking pedestrian traffic here this is a busy area youll have to move joe looked out at the street where crowds walked back and forth at the bridge across the green greasy chicago river and at the buildings surrounding pioneer court the brickpaved area was an ample public square and there was clearly room for everyone joe smiled at waterhouse he was in chicago and knew what to do he took a tendollar bill out of his pocket folded it twice lengthwise and wrapped it around a cup of the tomato juice which he deftly filled from the plastic jug on his table waterhouse drained the tomato juice without comment and when he tossed the cup into the wastebasket the tendollar bill was gone a bunch of baldheaded cackling smalltown businessman types was lined up in front of the table each one wore an acetatecovered badge bearing a red crusaders cross the letters kcuf and the words dominus vobiscum my name is joe smilingly handed them cups of tomato juice noting that the lapels of several bore an additional decoration a square white plastic cross with the letters cl printed across it any of these men joe knew would love to put him in jail for the rest of his life because he was the publisher of a radical magazine that occasionally got very explicit about sex and several times had published what joe considered very beautiful erotica the knights of christianity united for the faith were rumored to be behind the firebombing of two theaters in the midwest and the lynching of a news dealer in alabama and of course they had close ties with atlanta hopes gods lightning party aum would be strong medicine for this bunch joe thought he wondered if it would get them off their censorship kick or just make them more formidable in either case they would be bound to bust loose from iiuminati control for a time if only there were a way he and simon could get into their convention and administer aum to more of them behind the kcuf contingent there was a small man who looked like a rooster with a gray comb when joe read the questionnaire later he found out that he had administered aum to judge caligula bushman a shining ornament of the chicago judiciary there followed a succession of faces joe did not find memorable they all had that complex stupid shrewd angry defeated cynical gullible look characteristic of chicago new york and other big cities then he found himself confronting a tall redhead whose features seemed to combine the best of elizabeth taylor and marilyn monroe any vodka in that she asked him no maam just straight tomato juice said joe too bad she said as she tossed it down i could use one caligula bushman known as the toughest judge on the chicago bench was trying six people who were charged with attacking a draft board destroying all its furniture ruining its files and dumping a wheelbarrow full of cow manure on the floor suddenly bushman interrupted the trial about halfway through the prosecutions presentation of its case with the announcement that he was going to hold a sanity hearing to the bewilderment of all he then asked states attorney milo a flanagan a series of rather odd questions what would you think of a man who not only kept an arsenal in his home but was collecting at enormous financial sacrifice a second arsenal to protect the first one what would you say if this man so frightened his neighbors that they in turn were collecting weapons to protect themselves from him what if this man spent ten times as much money on his expensive weapons as he did on the education of his children what if one of his children criticized his hobby and he called that child a traitor and a bum and disowned it and he took another child who had obeyed him faithfully and armed that child and sent it out into the world to attack neighbors what would you say about a man who introduces poisons into the water he drinks and the air he breathes what if this man not only is feuding with the people on his block but involves himself in the quarrels of others in distant parts of the city and even in the suburbs such a man would clearly be a paranoid schizophrenic mr flanagan with homicidal tendencies this is the man who should be on trial though under our modern enlightened system of jurisprudence we would attempt to cure and rehabilitate him rather than merely punish speaking as a judge he continued i dismiss this case on several grounds the state is clinically insane as a corporate entity and is absolutely unfit to arrest try and incarcerate those who disagree with its policies but i doubt that this judgment though obvious to any man of common sense quite fits into the rules of our american jurisprudential game i also rule therefore that the right to destroy government property is protected by the first amendment to the us constitution and therefore the crime with which these people are charged is not a crime under the constitution government property belongs to all of the people and the right of any of the people to express displeasure with their government by destroying government property is precious and shall not be infringed this doctrine had come to judge bushman suddenly while he was speaking without his robe it startled him but he had noticed that his mind was working better and faster this afternoon he went on the state does not exist as a person or thing exists but is a legal fiction a fiction is a form of communication anything said to be owned by a form of communication must also thereby be itself a form of communication government is a map and government paper is a map of the map the medium in this case is definitely the message as any semanticist would agree furthermore any physical act directed against a communication is itself a communication a map of the map of the map thus destruction of government property is protected by the first amendment i will issue a more ample written opinion on this point but i feel now that the defendants need suffer in durance no longer case dismissed many spectators trooped out of the courtroom sullenly while those who loved the defendants surrounded them with tears laughter and hugs judge bushman who stepped down from the bench but remained in the courtroom was the benign center of a cluster of reporters he was thinking that his opinion would be a map of the map of the map of the map or a fourthorder map how many potential further orders of symbolism were there he barely heard the praises showered on him of course he knew his decision would be overturned but the judge business already bored him it would be interesting to get into mathematics really deep harold canvera had not bothered to fill out a questionnaire and therefore was not under observation and was not protected he returned to his home and his job as an accountant and his avocation which was recording telephone spiels against the illuminati the communists the socialists the liberals the middleoftheroaders and all insufficiently conservative republicans mr canvera also mailed out similar pamphlets whenever anybody was intrigued enough by his phone messages to send him twentyfive cents for additional information he performed these worthy educational services for a group calling itself white heroes opposing red extremism which was a splinter off taxpayers warring against tyranny which was a splinter off gods lightning in the following weeks however strange new ideas began to appear in canveras taped phone messages lower taxes arent enough he said for instance when you hear some socalled conservative bircher or some follower of william buckley jr call for lower taxes beware theres a man whos squishy soft on iiluminism all taxes are robbery instead of attacking joan baez a real american should support her for refusing to pay any more money into the illuminati treasury in washington the next week was even more interesting white heroes opposing red extremism has often told you that theres no real difference between the democrats and republicans both are pawns of the illuminati scheme to destroy private property and make everybody a slave of the state so the international bankers of a certain minority group can run everything now its time for all thinking patriots to take an even more skeptical look than ever before at the socalled antiilluminati john birch society why are they always putting up those stickers saying support your local police ever wonder about that whats the most important thing to a police state isnt it police and if we got rid of the police how could we ever have a police state think about it fellow americans and remember the alamo a few of these new strange ideas had come from various rightwing anarchist periodicals all secretly subsidized by hagbard celine that canvera had mysteriously received three months earlier and hadnt glanced at until swallowing the aum the periodicals had been mailed by simon moon as a joke in an envelope with the return address illuminati international east th street new york city the headquarters of the council on foreign relations long regarded by the birchers as an illuminati hotbed remember the alamo canvera had picked up from bowie knife a publication of the davy crockett society a paramilitary rightwing fascist group which had splintered off gods lightning when their leader a texas oil millionaire of gigantic paranoias became convinced that many apparent mexicans were actually red chinese agents in slight disguise later the dogma became retroactive and he claimed that the chinese had always been communists all mexicans had always been chinese and the attack on the alamo was the first communist assault against american capitalism the third week was quite remarkable evidently aum like lsd changed some personality traits but left others fairly intact in any event in canveras irregular evolution from rightwing authoritarianism to rightwing libertarianism he had somehow managed to arrive at a thesis never before enunciated except by donatien alphonse francois de sade what this rare man did was to give a threeminute spiel in favor of the right of any person of either sex to use any other person of either sex with or without their consent for sexual gratification of any sort needed or at least desired the only option he granted the recipients of these intimate invasions was the reciprocal right to use the initiator for their own needs or desires now most of the people who regularly called canveras phone service were not offended by any of this they were lincoln avenue hippies and dialed him only when stoned for what they called a really weird and farout head trip and they were bored that he was no longer as funky as in his old negrobaiting jewhating and illuminaticastigating days however there were a few members of white heroes opposing red extremism who called occasionally to check that their contributions were still financing the dissemination of true americanism and these people were severely puzzled and finally disturbed some of them even wrote to whore headquarters in mad dog texas to complain that there was something a little bit peculiar in the americanism lately however the president of whore dr horace naismith who also ran the john dillinger died for you society veterans of the sexual revolution and the colossus of yorba linda foundation was in it only for the money sad to say and had no time for such petty complaints he was too busy implementing his newest fundraising scheme the male chauvinist organization macho which he hoped would milk mucho denaros from russ meyers illegal abortionists pimps industrialists who regularly paid female workers thirty percent of the salaries of men doing the same jobs and all others threatened by the womens liberation movement the fourth week was to be frank about it definitely bizarre canvera discoursed at length on the lost civilization that once existed in the gobi desert and denounced those such as brion gysin who believed it had destroyed itself in atomic war rather he asserted it had been obliterated when the illuminati arrived from the planet vulcan in flying saucers remember the alamo was now replaced by remember carcosa canvera having discerned that both ambrose bierce and h p lovecraft were describing this tragic gobian society in their fiction the hippies were again delighted this was the funky kind of trip that had originally made canvera a mock folk hero among them and they especially appreciated his call for the us to abandon the next moon shot and launch a punitive expedition to vulcan both to wipe out illuminism at its source and to avenge poor carcosa the whore regulars however were again upset all that concern with carcosa struck them as creeping oneworldism the fifth week canvera took a new turn denouncing the masses for their stupidity and proclaiming that the boobs probably deserved being governed by the illuminati since most of them were too dumb to find their own behinds in a dark room even using both hands he had been browsing through a volume of h l mencken sent to him over a year earlier by el haj stackerlee mohammed ne pearson after one of his putprayersbackinthepublicschools tirades but he had also been pondering an invitation to join the illuminati this document which came in an envelope with no return address informed him that he was too smart to stay with the losers all his life and ought to climb on the winning side before it was too late it added that membership dues were which should be put in a cigar box and buried in his back yard after which it promised one of our underground agents will contact you at first canvera had considered this a hoax he received many putons in the mail together with pornography rosicrucian pamphlets illustrated with the eyeandpyramid design and pretended fan letters signed by such names as eldridge cleaver fidel castro anton szandor levay or judge crater all of course cooked up by his lincoln avenue audience later however it struck him that was five to the fifth power and that convinced him a true illuminatus was indeed communicating with him he took the out of his savings account buried it as instructed made a proilluminati recording as a gesture of good faith and waited the next day he was shot several times in the head and shoulders dying of natural causes as a result in present time again rebecca goodman enters the hotel tudor lobby in answer to the second mysterious phone call of the day while hagbard decides george dorn needs to be illuminized further before ingolstadt and esperando despond clears his throat and says i want to explain the mathematics of plague to you men actually poor old canveras death had nothing to do with the illuminati or with his former compatriots in whore the man had been practicing the libertine philosophy of his postaum phone editorials and had tampered with cassandra acconci the beloved daughter of ronald acconci chicago regional commander of gods lightning and a longtime contributor to kcuf acconci arranged via states attorney milo a flanagan for the local maf to do a hit on canvera but there are no endings any more than there are any beginnings it next developed that canveras seed lived on in wedlock with cassandras ovum and was in danger of becoming a human being within her previously trim abdomen saul goodman had no idea that the room he was in had last been rented to george dorn he was conscious only of his impatience not knowing that rebecca was at that moment on an elevator approaching his floor and a mile north peter jackson still trying to put together the july issue of confrontation virtually singlehanded dives into the slush pile which is the magazine industrys elegant name for unsolicited manuscripts and comes up with more fallout from the moonmalik aum project of orthodox science the new religion he reads well lets sample it what the hell opening at random he finds einsteins concept of spherical space furthermore suffers from the same defect as the concept of a smoothly or perfectly spherical earth it rests upon the use of the irrational number this number has no operational definition there is no place on any engineers scale to which one can point and say this is exactly although these scales are misleadingly marked with such a spot in fact can never be found in the real world and there are historical and archeological reasons to believe it was created by a greek mathematician under the influence of the mindwarping hallucinogenic mushroom amanita muscaria it is pure surrealism you cannot write as a real number you can only approximate it as etc chemistry knows no such units three atoms of an element may combine with four atoms of another element but you will never find atoms combining with anything quantum physics reveals that an electron may jump three units or four units but it will not jump units nor is necessary to geometry as is sometimes claimed r buckminster fuller has created an entire geometric system at least as reliable as that of the ancient greek dope fiends in which does not appear at all space then may be slanted or kiltered in various ways but it cannot be smoothly spherical what the ringtailed rambling hell peter jackson said aloud he flipped to the end in conclusion i want to thank a strange and uncommon man james mallison who provided the spark which set me thinking about these matters in fact it was due to my meeting with mr mallison that i sold my hardware business returned to college and majored in cartography and topology although he was a religious fanatic as i was at the time of our meeting and would therefore not appreciate many of my discoveries it is due to this mans perverse peculiar and yet brilliant prodding that i embarked on the search which has lead to this new theory of a pentahedroidal universe w clement cotex phd far fucking out peter muttered james mallison was a pen name joe malik sometimes used and here was another james mallison inspiring this guy to become a phd and invent a new cosmological theory what was the word joe used for such coincidences synchsomething esperando despond concludes his gloomy mathematical calculations thats the number of plague cases we might have right now at noon if the girl had only two contacts after leaving dr mocenigo now if she had three contacts the assembled fbi agents are gradually turning a pale greenish color from the neck up cannel the only actual contact is busy two blocks away stuffing money into a briefcase thats him mrs edward coke bacon cried excitedly addressing basil banghart another fbi agent in an office in washington she is pointing at a photo of albert the teacher stern maam banghart says kindly that cant be him dont even know why his pictures still in the file thats a noaccount junkie who once got on our mostwanted list because he confessed to a murder he didnt even commit in cincinnati an fbi artist is completing a portrait under the direction of the widow of a slain tv repairman the face of the killer gradually emerging combines various features of vincent mad dog coll george dorn and the lead vocalist of the american medical association which group was at that moment boarding a plane at kennedy international airport for the ingolstadt gig rebecca goodman rising in the hotel tudor elevator has a flash memory of a nightmare of the night before saul being shot by the same vocalist dressed as a monk in redandwhite robes while a playboy bunny danced in front of some kind of giant pyramid in princeton new jersey a nuclear physicist named nils nosferatuone of the few survivors of the early morning shootings babbles to the detective and police stenographer at his bedside tlaloc sucks you cant trust them the midget is the one to watch well be moved all right when the tear gas hits fun is fun omega georges brother met the dolphins first and that was the psychic hook that brought george in shes at the door shes buried in the desert any deviation will result in termination unify the forces you hold the hose ill get mark ive got to start telling you the truth george hagbard began hesitantly as the midget carmel and dr horace naismith collided in front of the door of the sands hotel watch the fuck where youre going carmel growled and she was at the door her heart was pounding an intuition was forming in her mind and she knocked and peter jackson began dialing epicene wildeblood and she was sure of it and she was afraid of being sure because she might be wrong and the midget said to dr naismith rude bastard wasnt he and the door opened and the door of milo o flanagans office opened to admit cassandra acconci and her heart stopped and dr nosferatu screamed the door shes in the door the door in the desert he eats carmels and it was him and she was in his arms and she was weeping and laughing and asking where have you been baby and saul closed the door behind her and drew her further into the room im not a cop anymore he said im on the other side what rebecca noticed there was a new thing in his eyes a thing for which she had no word you can stop worrying that youll get back on horse he went on gaily and if youve ever been afraid of your sexual fantasies dont be weve all got them saint bernards but even that wasnt as weird as the new thing in his eyes baby she said babywhat the hell is this i wanted sex with my father when i was two years old when did you have that thing about the saint bernard when i was eleven or twelve i think just before my first period my god you must have been a lot further away than i ever imagined she was beginning to recognize the new thing it wasnt intelligence he had always had that with awe she realized it was what the ancients called wisdom ive always had a thing about black women just like your thing about black men he went on i think everybody in this country has a touch of it the blacks have it about us too i was in one head a brilliant black guy musician scientist poet a million talents and white women were like the holy grail to him and your fantasy about spiro agnewi had one just like that about ilse koch a nazi bitch from before your time it was the same thing in both cases revenge not real sex hatesex oh were all so crazyinthehead rebecca backed up and sat down on the bed its too much too fast im scared i can see you dont have any contempt for me but lord can i live knowing that somebody else knows every single repressed desire i have yes saul said calmly and youre mistaken about time i cant know every secret darling ive only had a smattering of them a handful there are a dozen people right now whove been through my head the same way and i can look any one of them in the eye the things i know about them he laughed its still too fast rebecca said you disappear and then you come back knowing thongs about me that i only half know myself and youre not a cop anymore what do you mean youve joined the other side the mafia the morituri groups no saul answered happily much further out than that darling ive been driven mad by the worlds best brainwashers and put back together again by a computer that does psychotherapy predicts the future and steers a submarine all at once on the way i learned things about humanity and the universe that it would take a year to tell you and i dont have much time right now because ive got to fly to las vegas in two or three days if everything works out ill be able to show you not just tell you are you reading my mind right now rebecca asked still awed and nervous saul laughed again it isnt that simple it takes years of training and even then its like an old radio would you like to hear a scientific lecture while youre being laid thats a perversion weve never tried before his hand moved down from her cheek to her neck and then began unbuttoning her blouse theres a morituri bomb factory in your building cassandra acconci said flatly on the seventeenth floor the name on the buzzer is the same as yours my brother milo o flanagan bellowed right under my nose that freaking faggot oh saul oh saul saul rebecca closed her eyes as the mouth tightened on her nipple and dr horace naismith crossed the lobby of the sands affixing the vsr badge to his lapel and passed the midget again well the attorney general told the president one solution of course is to nuke las vegas but that wouldnt solve the problem of the possible carriers who could have hopped a plane already and might be anywhere in the country now or anywhere in the world while the president washes down three librium a tofranil and an elavil the vice president asks thoughtfully suppose we just distribute the antidote to party workers and ride this thing out he is feeling more than usually misanthropic having had an appalling evening in new york due to his impulsiveness in answering a personal ad which had touched his heart thank you cassandra milo a flanagan said fervently im eternally grateful to you one helping hand deserves another cassandra replied she remembered how milo and smiling jim trepomena had helped her get the abortion the time she was knocked up by that canvera character her father had wanted to send her to new york for a legal d amp c but milo had pointed out that it would look kind of funny to some people for the daughter of a high kcuf spokesman to have an official abortion besides smiling jim had added you dont want to fool around with them new york jew doctors they might do dirty things to you just trust me child weve got the countrys bestqualified criminal abortionists in cincinnati actually though the real reason cassandra was blowing the whistle on padre pederastias bomb emporium was to annoy simon moon whom she had been trying to get into her bed ever since she met him at the friendly stranger coffee house six months before simon hadnt been interested due to his obsession with black women who represented the holy grail to him wildeblood here the cultured drawl came over the wire have you finished your review yet peter jackson asked crushing another cigarette butt in his ashtray and worrying about lung cancer yes and youll love it i really tear these two smartasses apart wildeblood was enthusiastic listen to this a pair of nursery nietzsches dreaming of a psychedelic superman and this a plot that is only a puton characters who are cardboard and a pretense of scholarship that amounts to sheer bluff but this is the crusher listen a constant use of obscene language for shock effect until the reader begins to feel as depressed as an unwilling spectator at a quarrel between a fishwife and a lobsterpot pirate dont you think that will get quoted at all the best cocktail parties this season i suppose so the books a real stinker eh heavens i wouldnt know for sure i told you yesterday its absurdly long three volumes in fact boring as hell i only had time to skim it but listen to this dear boy if the lord of the rings is a fairy tale for adults sophisticated readers will quickly recognize this monumental miscarriage as a fairy tale for paranoids that refers to the ridiculous conspiracy theory that the plot if there is one seems to revolve around nicely worded wouldnt you say yeah sure peter said crossing off book review on his pad send it over ill pay the messenger epicene wildeblood hanging up crossed off confrontation on his own pad found time next on the list and picked up another book to be immortalized by his devastating witticisms he was feeling more than usually misanthropic having had a disastrous evening the night before somebody had answered his personal ad about his interest in greek culture and he had thrilled at the thought of a new asshole to conquer the asshole unfortunately had turned out to be the vice president of the united states who was interested only in declaiming about the glorious achievements of the military junta that had ruled in athens when eppy despairing of sex had tried to steer the conversation to plato at least the vp asked are you sure he was a greek that sounds like a wop name to me tobias knight and two other fbi agents elbow past the midget searching for whores who might have been with dr mocenigo the night before while outside the vsrs first contingent the hugh m hefner brigade led by dr horace naismith himself marches by singing were vetrans of the sexule revolution our rifles were issued we had our own guns one was for fighting the other for fun we rose up in arms and none failed to come were vets of the sex revoloooooooooootion you see darling it all revolves around sex but not in the sense that freud thought freud never understood sex hardly anybody understands sex in fact except a few poets here and there any scientist who starts to get an inkling keeps his mouth shut because he knows hed be drummed out of the profession if he said what he knew here ill help you unhook that what were feeling now is supposed to be tension and what well feel after orgasm is supposed to be relaxation oh theyre so pretty yes i know i always say that but they are pretty pretty pretty pretty mmmm mmmm oh yes yes just hold it like that a moment yes tension lord yes thats what i mean how can this be tension whats it got in common with worry or anxiety or anything else that we

thats why theyre tense during sex theyre afraid of letting the fields merge its a unifying of the forces god i cant keep talking well if we slow way down yes this is nicer isnt it thats why its so fast for most people they rush complete the physical act before the fields are charged they never experience the fields they think its poetry fiction when somebody whos had it describes it one scientist knew he died in prison ill tell you about him later its the big taboo the one all the others grow out of it isnt sex itself theyre trying to stop thats too strong they cant stop it its this darling yes this the unifying it happens at death but they try to steal it even then theyve taken it out of sex thats why the fantasies and the promiscuity the search blacks homosexuality our parents people we know we hate saint bernards everything its not neuroses or perversion its a search a desperate search everybody wants sex with an enemy hate mobilizes the field too you see and hate is safer safer than love love too dangerous lord lord i love you i love you let me more get the weight on my elbows hold your ass with my hands yes poetry isnt poetry i mean it doesnt lie its true when i say i

rebecca rebecca rebecca the seventh trip or netzach the snafu principle the most thoroughly and relentlessly damned banned excluded condemned forbidden ostracized ignored suppressed repressed robbed brutalized and defamed of all damned things is the individual human being the social engineers statisticians psychologists sociologists market researchers landlords bureaucrats captains of industry

damned thing will not fit into their slots never whistle while youre pissing by hagbard celine hm sh the midget whose name was markoff chaney was no relative of the famous chaneys of hollywood but people did keep making jokes about that it was bad enough to be by the standards of the gigantic and stupid majority a freak how much worse to be so named as to remind these big oversized clods of the cinemas two most famous portrayers of monstrofreaks by the time the midget was fifteen he had built up a detestation for ordinary mankind that dwarfed he hated that word the relative misanthropies of paul of tarsus clement of alexandria swift of dublin and even robert putney drake revenge for sure he would have he would have revenge it was in college antioch yellow springs that markoff chaney discovered another hidden joke in his name and the circumstances were considering that he was to become the worst headache the illuminati ever encountered appropriately synchronistic it was in a math class and since this was antioch the two students directly behind the midget were ignoring the professor and discussing their own intellectual interests since this was antioch they were a good six years ahead of intellectual fads elsewhere they were discussing ethology so we keep the same instincts as our primate ancestors one student he was from chicago his name was moon and he was crazy even for antioch was saying but we superimpose culture and law on top of this so we get split in two dig you might say moons voice betrayed pride in the aphorism he was about to unleash mankind is a statutory ape and the professor old fred fidgets digits said at just that moment when such a related series appears in a random process we have what is known as a markoff chain i hope mr chaney wont be tormented by jokes about this for the rest of the term even if the related series of his appearances in class do seem part of a notably random process the class roared another ton of bile was entered in the midgets shit ledger the list of people who were going to eat turd before he died in fact his cuts were numerous both in math and in other classes there were tunes when he could not bear to be with the giants but hid in his room playboy gatefold open masturbating and dreaming of millions and millions of nubile young women built like playmates today however playboy would avail him not he needed something raunchier ignoring his next class physical anthropology always good for a few humiliating moments he hurried across david street passed by atlanta hope without noticing her and slammed into his room chainbolting the door behind him damn old fidgets digits and damn the science of mathematics itself the line the square the average the whole measurable world that pronounced him a bizarre random factor once and for all beyond fantasy in the depth of his soul he declared war on the statutory ape on law and order on predictability on negative entropy he would be a random factor in every equation from this day forward unto death it would be civil war the midget versus the digits he took out the pornographic tarot deck which he used when he wanted a really farout fantasy for his orgasm and shuffled it thoroughly lets have a markoff chain masturbation to start with he thought with an evil grin and thus without ever contacting the legion of dynamic discord the erisian liberation front or even the justified ancients of mummu markoff chaney began his own crusade against the illuminati not even knowing that they existed his first overt act his fort sumter as it were began in dayton the following saturday he was in nortons emporium a glorified amp store when he saw the sign no salesperson may leave the floor without the authorization of a superior the mgt what he thought are the poor girls supposed to pee in their panties if they cant find a superior years of school came back to him please may i leave the room sir and rituals which had appeared nonsensical suddenly made sense in a sinister way mathematics of course they were trying to reduce us all to predictable units robots hah not for nothing had he spent a semester in professor sheets kellys intensive course on textual analysis of modern poetry the following wednesday the midget was back at nortons and hiding in a coffee urn when the staff left and locked up a few moments later the sign was down and a subtly different one was in its place no salesperson may leave the floor or go to the door without the authorization of a superior the mgt he came back several times in the next few weeks and the sign remained it was as he suspected in a rigid hierarchy nobody questions orders that seem to come from above and those at the very top are so isolated from the actual work situation that they never see what is going on below it was the chains of communication not the means of production that determined a social process marx had been wrong lacking cybernetics to enlighten him marx was like the engineers of his time who thought of electricity in terms of work done before marconi thought of it in terms of information transmitted nothing signed the mgt would ever be challenged the midget could always pass himself off as the management at the same tune he noticed that the workers were more irritable the shoppers picked this up and became grouchier themselves sales he guessed correctly were falling off poetry was the answer poetry in reverse his interpolated phrase with its awkward internal rhyme and its pointlessness bothered everybody but in a subliminal preconscious fashion let the market researchers and statisticians try to figure this one out with their computers and averages his father had been a stockholder in blue sky inc generally regarded as the worst turkey on the big board it produced devices to be used in making landings on lowgravity planets profits had soared when john fitzgerald kennedy had announced that the us would put a man on the moon before the midget now had a guaranteed annuity amounting to thirtysix hundred dollars per year three hundred dollars per month it was enough for his purposes revenge in good measure he would have he would have revenge living in spartan fashion dining often on a tin of sardines and a pint of milk from a machine traveling always by greyhound bus the midget crisscrossed the country constantly placing his improved surrealist signs whenever the opportunity presented itself a slowly mounting wave of anarchy followed in his wake the illuminati never got a fix on him he had little ego to discover burning all his energies into drive like a dictator or a great painter but unlike a dictator or a great painter he had no desire for recognition for years the illuminati attributed his efforts to the discordians the jams or the esoteric elf watts went up and detroit birmingham buffalo newark a flaming picnic blanket spread across urban america as the midgets signs burned in the stores that had flaunted them one hundred thousand marched to the pentagon and some of them tried to expel the demon the illuminati foiled that at the last minute forbidding them to form a circle a democratic convention was held behind barbed wire in a senate committee announced that there had been three thousand bombings in the year or an average of ten per day by morituri groups were forming in every college every suburb the sla came and came back again atlanta hope was soon unable to control gods lightning which was going in for its own variety of terrorism years before illuminati planning had intended theres a random factor somewhere technicians said at illuminati international theres a random factor somewhere hagbard celine said reading the data that came out of fuckup theres a random factor somewhere the dealy lama leader of elf said dreamily in his underground hideout beneath dealy plaza drivers on treacherous mountain roads swore in confusion at signs that said slippery when wet maintain mph falling rock zone do not litter men paid high initiation fees to revel in the elegance of allwasp clubs whose waiters were carefully trained to be almost as snobbish as the members then felt vaguely let down by signs warning them watch your hat and coat not responsible for lost property the mgt the midget became an electronic wizard in his spare tune all over the country pedestrians stood undecided on curbs as electric signs said walk while the light was red and then switched to dont walk when the light went green he branched out and expanded his activities office workers received memos early in the morning after he had spent a night with a xerox machine and puzzled over all vacation requests must be submitted in triplicate to the personnel department at least three weeks before the planned vacation dates all employees who change their vacation plans must notify personnel department by completing form vacation plan change and submitting it three weeks before the change in plans all vacation plans must be approved by the department supervisor and may be changed if they conflict with the vacation plans of employees of higher rank andor longer tenure department supervisors may announce such cancellations at any time provided the employee is given hours notice or two working days whichever is longer as the case may be employees crossing the international date line see form employees may not discuss vacation plans with other employees or trade preferred dates these few simple rules should prevent a great deal of needless friction and frustration if all employees cooperate and we will all have a happy summer the mgt on april of the year when the illuminati tried to immanentize the eschaton the midget experienced aches pains nausea spots before his eyes numbness in his legs and dizziness he went to the hotel doctor and a short while after describing his symptoms he was rushed in a closed car to a building that had a hopi indian kachina doll shop in front and the las vegas cia office in the back he was fairly delirious by then but he heard somebody say ha were ahead of the fbi and the cesspool cleaners on this one then he got an injection and began to feel better until a friendly silverhaired man sat down by his cot and asked who the girl was what girl the midget asked irritably look son we know youve been with a girl she gave you this was it the clap the midget asked dumbfounded except for his pornographic tarot cards he was still a virgin the giant women were all so damned patronizing but his own female equivalents bored him the giantesses were the holy grail to him but he had never had the courage to approach one i never knew the clap could be this bad he added blushing his greatest fear was that somebody would discover his virginity no it wasnt the clap said the kindly man who didnt deceive the midget one bit if this guy couldnt pump him he knew they would send in the mean tough one the nice cop and the nasty cop oldest con in the business this girl had a certain uh rare disease and were with the us public health service the gentle man produced forged credentials to prove this last allegation horseshit the midget thought now the sweet old codger went on weve got to track her down and see that she gets the antidote or a lot of people will get this disease you understand the midget understood this guy was army intelligence or cia and they wanted to crack this before the fbi and get the credit the disease was started by the government obviously some fuckup in one of their biological war laboratories and they had to cover it up before the whole country got wise he hesitated none of his projects had ever been consciously intended to lead to death just to make things a little unpredictable and spooky for the giants the us public health service will be eternally grateful to you the grandfatherly man said eyes crinkling with sly affection it isnt often that a little man gets a chance to do such a big job for his country that did it well the midget said she was blonde in her midtwenties i guess and she told me her name was sarah she had a scar on her neck i suppose somebody tried to cut her throat once she was lets see about fivefive and maybe pounds and she was superb at giving head he concluded thinking that was a very plausible las vegas whore he had just created his mind was racing rapidly they wouldnt want people running around loose knowing about this the antidote had been to keep him alive while they pumped him he needed insurance oh and heres a real lead for you he said i just remembered first i want to explain something about uh people who are below average in stature were very sexy you see our sex gland or whatever its called works extra because our growth gland doesnt work so we never get enough he was making this up off the top of his head and enjoying it he hoped it would spread he had a beautiful vision of bored rich women seeking midgets as they now seek blacks so you see he went on i kept her a long time having encores and encores and encores finally she told me shed have to raise her price because she had another customer waiting i couldnt afford it so i let her go now the clincher but she mentioned his name she said joe blotz will be pissed if i disappoint him only the name wasnt joe blotz well what was it thats the problem the midget said sadly i cant remember but if you leave me alone awhile he added brightly maybe itll come back to me he was already planning his escape and twentyfive hours earlier george dorn quoting pilate asked what is truth barney muldoon just then was lounging in the lobby of the hotel tudor waiting for saul to finish what he had called a very important very private conversation with rebecca nkrumah fubar was experimentally placing a voodoo doll of the president of american express inside a tetrahedron their computer was still annoying him about a bill hed paid over two months ago on the very daynight that soapy mocenigo dreamed of anthrax leprosy pi r buckminster fuller unaware of this new development in his geodesic revolution was lecturing the royal institute of architects in london and explaining why there were no nouns in the real world august personage was breathing into a telephone in new york pearson mohammed kent was exuberantly balling a female who was not only white but from texas the midget himself was saying rude bastard isnt he to dr naismith and our other characters were variously pursuing their own hobbies predilections obsessions and holy missions but hagbard with uncharacteristic gravity said truth is the opposite of lies the opposite of most of what youve heard all your life the opposite of most of what youve heard from me they were in hagbards funky stateroom and george after his experience at the demolished drake mansion found the octopi and other sea monsters on the wall murals distinctly unappetizing hagbard as usual was wearing a turtleneck and casual slacks this time the turtleneck was lavender an odd faggoty item for him george remembered suddenly that hagbard had once told him about homosexuality ive tried it of course but added something about liking women better goodness was that only two mornings ago george wondered what it would be like to try it and if he would ever have the nerve what particular lies he asked cautiously are you about to confess hagbard lit a pipe and passed it over alamout black hash he said croakingly holding the smoke down hassan i sabbahs own private formula does wonders when heavy metaphysics is coming at you george inhaled and felt an immediate hit like cocaine or some other forebrain stimulant christ whats this shit cut with he gasped as somebody somewhere seemed to turn colored lights on in the goldandnauticalgreen room and on that outasight lavender sweater oh hagbard said casually a hint of belladonna and stramonium that was old hassans secret you know all that crap in most books about how he had turned his followers on with hash and theyd never i had it before so they thought it was magic is unhistorical hashish was known in the mideast since the neolithic age archeologists have dug it up in tombs seems our ancestors buried their priests with a load of hash to help them negotiate with their gods when they got to big rock candy mountain or wherever they thought they were going hassans originality was blending hashish with just the right chemical cousins to produce a new synergetic effect whats synergetic george asked slowly feeling seasick for the first time aboard the leif erikson nonadditive when you put two and two together and get five instead of four buckminster fuller uses synergetic gimmicks all the time in his geodesic domes thats why theyre stronger than they look hagbard took another toke and passed the pipe again what the hell george thought sometimes increasing the dose got you past the nausea he toked deeply hadnt they started out to discuss truth though george giggled just as i suspected instead of using your goddam prajna or whatever it is to spy on the illuminati youre just another dirty old man you use it to play peeping tom in other peoples heads heads hagbard protested laughing i never scan the heads who the hell wants to watch people eliminating their wastes i thought you were going to be socrates george howled between lunatic peals of tin giggles and i was prepared to be plato or at least glaucon or one of the minor characters but youre as stoned as i am you cant tell me anything important all you can do is make bad puns the pun hagbard replied with dignity ruined somewhat by an unexpected chortle is mightier than the sword as james joyce once said dont get pedantic can i get semantic yes you can get semantic or antic but not pedantic where were we truth yes well truth is like marijuana my boy a drug on the market im getting a hardon you too thats the way the balling bounces at least with alamout black nausea then microamnesia then the laughing jag then sex be patient the clear light comes next then we can discuss truth as if we havent been discussing it all along youre a hell of a guru hagbard sometimes you sound even dumber than me if the elder malaclypse were here hed tell you a few about some other gurus and geniuses do you think jesus never whacked off shakespeare never got on a crying jag at the mermaid tavern buddha never picked his nose gandhi never had the crabs ive still got a hardon cant we postpone the philosophy while i go look for stella i mean mavis thats truth what is truth up in the cortex it makes a difference to you whether its stella or mavis down in the glands no difference my grandmother would do as well thats not truth thats just cheap halfassed freudian cynicism oh yes you saw the mandala with mavis and you were inside my head somehow dirty voyeur know thyself this will never take its place beside the platonic dialogues not in a million years were both stoned out of our gourds i love you george i guess i love you too youre so damned overwhelming everybody loves you are we gonna fuck mavis had said wipe the come off your trousers fantasizing sophia loren while he masturbated or fantasizing that he masturbated while actually no you dont need it youre starting to remember what really happened in mad dog jail oh no coins enormous snaky cock the pain the pleasure im afraid so damn it now ill never know did you put that in my head or did it really happen did i fantasize the interruption then or did i fantasize the rape just now know thyself did you say that twice or did i just hear it twice what do you think i dont know i dont know right now i just dont know is this some devious homosexual seduction maybe maybe its a murder plot maybe im leading up to cutting your throat i wouldnt mind ive always had a big selfdestructive urge like all cowards cowardice is a defense against suicide hagbard laughed i never knew a young man who had so much pussy and risked death so often and there you sit still worrying about being whatever it was they called you when you first started letting your hair grow long in your early teens sissy that was the word in good old nutley new jersey it meant both faggot and coward so ive never cut my hair since then to prove they couldnt intimidate me yeah im tracking a black guy now a musician whos balling a white lady a fair flower from texas partly because she really turns him on but partly because she could have a brother who might come after him with a gun hes proving they cant intimidate him thats the truth we spend all our time proving we cant be intimidated but all the time we are intimidated on another level the colors were coming back strong again it was that kind of trip every time you thought you were the pilot it would go off in an unexpected direction to remind you that you were just a passenger thats part of the truth george another part is that every time you think youre intimidated youre really rebelling on another level oh what idiots the iiluminati really are george i once collected statistics on industrial accidents in a sample city birmingham england actually fed all the relevant facts into fuckup and got just what i expected sabotage unconscious sabotage every case was a blind insurrection every man and woman is in rebellion but only a few have the guts to admit it the others jam the system by accident har har har or by stupidity har har har again let me tell you about the indians george what indians did you ever wonder why nothing works right why the whole world seems completely fucked up all the time yeah doesnt everybody i suppose so pardon me ive got to get more stoned in a little while i go into fuckup and we put our heads together literally i attach electrodes to my temples and ill try to track down the problem in las vegas i dont spend all my time on random voyeurism hagbard pronounced with dignity he refilled the pipe asking pettishly where was i the indians in birmingham how did they get there there werent any fucking indians in birmingham youre getting me confused hagbard toked deeply youre getting yourself confused youre bombed out of your skull look whos talking hagbard toked again the indians the indians werent in birmingham birmingham was where i did the study that convinced me most industrial accidents are unconscious sabotage so are most misfiled documents among whitecollar workers id wager the indians are another story i was a lawyer once when i first came to your country and before i went in for piracy i usually dont admit that george i usually tell people i played the piano in a whorehouse or something else not quite so disreputable as the truth if you want to know why nothing makes sense in government forms remember there are two hundred thousand lawyers working for the bureaucracy these days the indians were a band of shoshones i was defending them against the great land thief or as it pretentiously titles itself the government in washington we were having a conference you know what an indian conference is like nobody talks for hours sometimes a good yoga when somebody does finally speak you can be sure it comes from the heart that old movie stereotype white man speak with forked tongue has a lot of truth in it the more you talk the more your imagination colors things im one of the most longwinded people alive and one of the worst liars hagbard toked again and finally held the pipe out inquiringly george shook his head but the story i wanted to tell was about an archeologist he was hunting for relics of the devonian culture the indians who lived in north america just before the ecological catastrophe of bc he found what he thought was a burial mound and asked to dig into it grok this george the indians looked at him they looked at me they looked at each other then the oldest man spoke and very gravely gave permission the archeologist hefted his pick and shovel and went at it like john henry trying to beat that steam drill in two minutes he disappeared right into a cesspool then the indians laughed grok george i knew them as well as any white man ever knows indians they had learned to trust me and i them and yet i sat there while they played their little joke and i didnt get a hint of what was about to happen even though i had begun to discover my telepathic talents and even focus them a little think about it george think about all the pokerfaced blacks youve seen think about every time a black has done something so fantastically outrageously stupid that you had a flash of racism which being a radical you were ashamed of rightand wondered if maybe they are inferior and think of ninetynine percent of the women in the caucasian world outside norway who do the dumb dora or marilyn monroe act all the time think a minute george think there was a silence that seemed to stretch into some long hall of nearbuddhist emptinessgeorge recognized a glimpse at last into the void all his acidhead friends had tried to describe and then he remembered this was not the trip hagbard was pushing him toward but the silence lingered as a quietness of spirit a calm in the tornado of those last few days and george found himself ruminating with total dispassion without hope or dread or smugness or guilt if not totally without ego or in full darshana at least without the inflamed and voracious ego that usually either leaped forward or shrunk back from naked fact he contemplated his memories and was unmoved objective at peace he thought of blacks and women and of their subtle revenges against their masters acts of sabotage that could not be recognized clearly as such because they took the form of acts of obedience he thought of the shoshone indians and their crude joke so similar to the jokes of oppressed peoples everywhere he saw suddenly the meaning of mardi gras and the feast of fools and the saturnalia and the christmas office party and all the other limited permissible structured occasions on which freuds return of the repressed was allowed he remembered all the times he had gotten his own back against a professor a high school principal a bureaucrat or further back his own parents by waiting for the occasion when by doing exactly what he was told he could produce some form of minor catastrophe he saw a world of robots marching rigidly in the paths laid down for them from above and each robot partly alive partly human waiting its chance to drop its own monkey wrench into the machinery he saw finally why everything in the world seemed to work wrong and the situation normal was all fucked up hagbard he said slowly i think i get it genesis is exactly backwards our troubles started from obedience not disobedience and humanity is not yet created hagbard more hawkfaced than ever said carefully you are approaching truth walk cautiously now george truth is not as shakespeare would have it a dog that can be whipped out to kennel truth is a tiger walk cautiously george he turned in his chair slid open a drawer in his danish modern quasimartian desk and took out a revolver george watched as cool and alone as a man atop everest as hagbard opened the chamber and showed six bullets inside then with a snap the gun was closed and placed on the desk blotter hagbard did not glance at it again he watched george george watched the pistol it was the scene with carlo all over again but hagbards challenge was unspoken gnomic his level glance did not even admit that a contest had begun the gun glittered maliciously it whispered of all the violence and stealth in the world treacheries undreamed of by medici or machiavelli traps set for victims who were innocent and blameless it seemed to fill the room with an aura of its presence and yes it even had the more subtle menace of a knife weapon of the sneak or of a whip in the hands of a man whose smile is too sensual too intimate too knowing into the middle of georges tranquility it had come inescapable and unexpected as a rattlesnake hi the path on the afternoon of the sweetest spring day in the worlds most manicured and artificial garden george heard the adrenalin begin to course into his bloodstream saw the activation syndrome moisten his palms accelerate his heart loosen his sphincter a micrometer and still high and cool on his mountain felt nothing the robot he said glancing finally at hagbard is easily upset dont put your hand in that fire hagbard warned unimpressed youll get burned he watched he waited george could not tear his glance from those eyes and in them then he saw the merriment of howard the dolphin the contempt of his grade school principal a high iq dorn does not justify arrogance and insubordination the despairing love of his mother who could never understand him the emptiness of nemo his tomcat of childhood days the threat of billy holtz the school bully and the total otherness of an insect or a serpent more he saw the child hagbard proud like himself of intellectual superiority and frightened like himself of the malice of stupider but brawnier boys and the very old hagbard years hence wrinkled as a reptile but still showing an endless searching intelligence the ice melted the mountain with a roar of protest and defiance crumbled and george was borne down down in the river racing toward the rapids where the gorilla howled and the mouse trotted quickly where the saurian head raised above the triassic foliage where the sea slept and the spirals of dna curled backward toward the flash that was this radiance now this raging eternally against the quite impossible dying of the light this storm and this centering hagbard he said at last i know i can see it just dont fall back into that other thing its the error of the illuminati george smiled weakly still not quite back into the world of words eat and ye shall be as gods he said i call it the noego ego trip its the biggest ego trip of all of course anybody can learn it a child of two months a dog a cat but when an adult rediscovers it after the habit of obedience and submission has crushed it out of him for years or decades what happens can be a total disaster thats why the zen roshis say one who achieves supreme illumination is like an arrow flying straight to hell keep in mind what i said about caution george you can release at any moment its great up there and you need a mantra to keep you away from it until you learn how to use it heres your mantra and if you knew the peril you are in youd brutally burn it into your backside with a branding iron to make sure youd never forget it i am the robot repeat it i am the robot hagbard made a face like a baboon and george laughed again at last when you get tune hagbard said look into my little book never whistle while youre pissingthere are copies all over the ship thats my ego tip and keep it in mind you are the robot and youll never be anything else of course youre also the programmer and even the metaprogrammer but thats another lesson for another day for now just remember the mammal the robot i know george said ive read t s eliot and now i understand him humility is endless and humanity is created the other is not human george said then so ive arrived and its just another starting place the beginning of another trip a harder trip thats another meaning in heracleitus the end is the beginning hagbard rose and shook himself like a dog wow he said i better get to work with fuckup you can stay here or go to your own room but i suggest that you dont rush off and talk about your experience to somebody else you can talk it to death that way george remained in hagbards room and reflected on what had happened he had no urge to scribble in his diary the usual defense against silence and aloneness since his early teens instead he savored the stillness of the room and of his inner core he remembered saint francis of assisi called his body brother ass and timothy leary used to say when exhausted the robot needs sleep those had been their mantras their defenses against the experience of the mountaintop and the terrible arrogance it triggered he remembered too the old classic underground press ad keep me high and ill ball you forever he felt sorry for the woman who had written that pitiful modern version of the maddened saint simon on his pillar in the desert and hagbard was right any dog or cat could do it could make the jump to the mountaintop and wait without passion until the robot brother ass survived the ordeal or perished in it that was what primitive rites of initiation were all about driving the youth through sheer terror to the point of letting go the mountaintop point and then bringing him back down again george suddenly understood how his generation in rediscovering the sacred drugs had failed to rediscover their proper use had failed or had been prevented the illuminati it was clear didnt want any competition in the godmanship business you could talk it to death in your own head as well as in conversation he realized but he went back over it again trying to dissect it without mutilating it the homosexuality bit had been a false front with its own reality of course like all false fronts behind that was the conditioned terror against the robot the fear symbolized in frankenstein and dozens of other archetypes that if it were let loose unrestrained the robot would run amok murder rape go mad and then hagbard had waited until the alamout black brought him to freedom showed him the peak the place where the cortex at last could idle as a car motor or a dog or cat idles the last refuge where the catatonic hides when george was safely in that harbor hagbard produced the gun in a more primitive or more sophisticated society it would have been the emblem of a powerful demon and george saw that he could indeed idle there and not blindly follow the panic signals from the robots adrenalin factory and because he was a human and not a dog the experience had been ecstasy to him and temptation so hagbard with a few words and a glance from those eyes pushed him off the peak into what reconciliation was the word reconciliation with the robot with the robot with himself the peak was not a victory it was the war the eternal war against the robot carried to a higher and more dangerous level the end of the war was his surrender the only possible end to that war since the robot was three billion years old and couldnt be killed there were two great errors in the world he perceived the error of the submissive hordes who fought all their lives to control the robot and please their masters and who always sabotaged every effort without knowing it and were in turn sabotaged by the robots revenge neuroses psychoses and all the tiresome list of psychosomatic ailments and the error of those who recaptured the animal art of letting the robot run itself and who then tried to maintain this split from their own flesh indefinitely until they were lost forever in that eternally widening chasm one sought to batter the robot to submission the other to slowly starve it both were wrong and yet on another plane of his stillzonked mind george knew that even this was a half truth that he was indeed just beginning his journey not arriving at his destination he rose and walked to the bookshelves and as he expected found a stack of hagbards little pamphlets on the bottom never whistle while youre pissing by hagbard celine hm sh he wondered what the hm and sh stood for then flipped open to the first page where he found only the large question who is the one more trustworthy than all the buddhas and sages george laughed out loud the robot of course me george dorn all three billion years worth of evolution in every gene and chromosome of me and that of course was what the illuminati and all the petty wouldbe illuminati who made up power structures everywhere never wanted a man or woman to realize george turned to the second page and began reading if you whistle while youre pissing you have two minds where one is quite sufficient if you have two minds you are at war with yourself if you are at war with yourself it is easy for an external force to defeat you this is why mongtse wrote a man must destroy himself before others can destroy him that was all except for an abstract drawing on page three that seemed to suggest an enemy figure moving out toward the viewer about to turn to page four george got a shock from another angle the drawing was two figures engaged in attacking each other i and it the mind and the robot his memory leaped back twentytwo years and he saw his mother lean over the crib and remove his hand from his penis christ no wonder i grab it when im frightened the robots revenge the return of the repressed george started to turn the page again and saw another trick in hagbards abstraction from a third angle it might be a couple making love in a flash he saw his mothers face above his crib again in better focus and recognized the concern in her eyes the cruel hand of repression was moved by love she was trying to save him from sin and carlo dead three years now together with the rest of that morituri group what had inspired carlo when he and the four others all of them less than eighteen george remembered blasted their way into a gods lightning rally and killed three cops and four secret service agents in their attempts to gun down the secretary of state love nothing but mad love the door opened and george tore his eyes from the text mavis back again in her sweater and slacks outfit walked in for a proclaimed rightwing anarchist she sure dresses a lot like a new leftist george thought but then hagbard wrote like a cross between reichian leftist and an egomaniacal zen master there was obviously more to the discordian philosophy than he could grasp yet even though he was now convinced it was the system he himself had been groping toward for many years mmm she said i like that smell alamout black yeah george said having trouble meeting her eyes hagbards been illuminating me i can tell is that why you suddenly feel uncomfortable with me george met her eyes then looked away again there was tenderness there but it was as he had expected sisterly at best he muttered its just that i realize our sex why couldnt he say fucking or at least balling was less important to you than to me mavis took hagbards chair and smiled at him affectionately youre lying george you mean it was more important to me than to you she began to refill the pipe christ god george thought did hagbard send her in to take me to the next stage whatever it is well i guess i mean both he said cautiously you were more emotionally involved than i was then but now im more emotionally involved and i know that what i want i cant have ever ever is a long time lets just say you cant have it now humility is endless george repeated dont start feeling sorry for yourself youve discovered that love is more than a word in poetry and you want it right away you just had two other things that used to be just words to you sunyata and satori isnt that enough for one day im not complaining i know that humility is endless also means surprise is endless hagbard promised me a happy truth and thats it mavis finally got the pipe lit and after toking deeply passed it over you can have hagbard she said george sipping very lightly since he was still fairly high mumbled hm hagbard will love you as well as ball you of course its not the same he loves everybody im not at that stage yet i can only love my equals she grinned wickedly of course i can still get horny about you but now that you know theres more than that you want the whole package deal right so try hagbard george laughed feeling suddenly lighthearted okay i will bullshit mavis said bluntly youre putting us both on youve liberated some of the energies and right away like everybody else at this stage you want to prove that there are no blocks anywhere anymore that laugh was not convincing george if you have a block face it dont pretend it isnt there humility is endless george thought youre right he said unabashed thats better at least you didnt fall into feeling guilty about the block thats an infinite regress the next stage is to feel guilty about feeling guilty and pretty soon youre back in the trap again trying to be the governor of the nation of dorn the robot george said mavis toked and said mm i call it the robot you picked that up from leary back in the mids i keep forgetting you were a child prodigy i can just see you with your eyeglasses and your shoulders all hunched poring over one of tims books when you were eight or nine you must have been quite a child theyve sure mauled you over since then havent they it happens to most prodigies and nonprodigies too for that matter yeah eight years grade school four high school four college then postgraduate studies nothing left but the robot at the end the everrebellious nation of me with poor old i sitting on the throne trying to govern it theres no governor anywhere george quoted you are coming along nicely thats chuang chou the taoist philosopher but i never understood him before so thats where hagbard stole it he has little cards that say there is no enemy anywhere and ones that say there is no friend anywhere he said once he could tell in two minutes which card was right for a particular person to jolt them awake but words alone cant do it ive known most of the words for years words can help in the right situation if theyre the wrong words i mean the right words no i do mean the wrong words they laughed and george said are we just goofing or are you taking up the liberation of the nation of dorn where hagbard left off just goofing hagbard did tell me that you had passed one of the gateless gates and that i might drop in after you had a while alone a gateless gate thats another one ive known for years without understanding it the gateless gate and the governorless nation the chief cause of socialism is capitalism what the hell does that bloody apple have to do with all this the apple is the world who did goddess say owns it the prettiest one who is the prettiest one you are dont make a pass right now think george giggled ive been through too much already i think im getting sleepy i have two answers one communist and one fascist both are wrong of course the correct answer has to fit in with your anarchocapitalism not necessarily anarchocapitalism is just our trip we dont mean to impose it on everybody we have an alliance with an anarchocommunist group called the jams john dillingers their leader come off it dillinger died in or something john dillinger is alive and well today in california fernando poo and texas mavis smiled as a matter of fact he shot john f kennedy give me another toke if i have to listen to this i might as well be in a state where i wont try to understand it mavis passed the pipe the prettiest one has quite a few levels to it like all good jokes ill give you the freudian one as beginners you know the prettiest one george you gave it to the apple just yesterday every mans penis is the prettiest thing in the world to him from the day hes born until the day he dies it never loses its endless fascination and i kid you not baby the same is true of every woman and her pussy its the closest thing to a real blind helpless love and religious adoration that most people ever achieve but theyd rather die than admit it homosexuality the urge to kill petty spites and treacheries fantasies of sadism masochism transvestism any weird thing you can name theyll confess all that in a group therapy session but that deep submerged constant narcissism that perpetual mental masturbation is the earliest and most powerful block theyll never admit it from what ive read of psychiatric literature i thought most people had rather squeamish and negative feelings about their genitals that to quote freud himself is a reaction formation the primordial emotional tone from the day the infant discovers the incredible pleasure centers there is perpetual astonishment awe and delight no matter how much society tries to crush it and repress it for instance everybody has some pet name for their genitals whats yours polyphemus he confessed what because it has one eye you know also polyphemus rhymes with penis i guess i mean i cant remember exactly what my mental process was when i invented that in my early teens polyphemus was a giant too almost a god you see what i mean about the primary emotional tone its the origin of all religion adoration of your own genitals and of your lovers genitals theres pan pangenitor and the great mother so george said owlishly still not sure whether this was profundity or nonsense the earth belongs to our genitalia to their offspring and their offsprings offspring and so on forever the world is a verb not a noun the prettiest one is three billion years old youve got it baby were all tenants here including the ones who think theyre owners property is impossible okay okay i think ive got most of it property is theft because the illuminati land titles are arbitrary and unjust and so are their banking charters and railroad franchises and all the other monopoly games of capitalism of state capitalism not of true laissezfaire wait property is impossible because the world is a verb a burning house as buddha said all things are fire my old pal heracleitus so property is theft and property is impossible how do we get to property is liberty without private property there can be no private decisions so were back where we started from no were one flight higher up on the spiral staircase look at it that way dialectically as your marxist mends say but we care back at private property after proving its an impossible fiction the statist form of private property is an impossible fiction just like the statist form of communal property is an impossible fiction think outside the state framework george think of property in freedom george shook his head it beats the hell out of my ass all i can see is people ripping each other off the war of all against all as whatshisname said hobbes hobbes snobs jobs whoever or whatever isnt he right stop the motor on this submarine what force me to love you wait i dont turn the sky green or red instead of blue i still dont get it mavis took a pen off the desk and held it between two fingers what happens when i let go of this it falls where do you sit if there are no chairs on the floor if iwasnt so stoned i would have had it by then sometimes drugs are more a hindrance than a help on the ground i added on your ass thats for sure mavis said the point is if the chairs all go away you still sit or you build new chairs she was stoned too otherwise shed be explaining it better i realized but you cant stop the motor without learning something about marine engineering first you dont know what switch to pull or switches and you cant change the sky and the pen will fall without a gravitygoverning demon rushing into the room to make it fall shit and pink petunias i said disgustedly is this some form of thomism are you trying to sell me the natural law argument i cant buy that at all okay george heres the next jolt keep your asshole tight she spoke to the wall to a hidden microphone i guessed send him in now the robot is easily upset my sphincter was already tightening as soon as she warned me there was a jolt coming and she didnt really need to add that bit about my asshole carlo and his gun hagbard and his gun drakes mansion i took a deep breath and waited to see what the robot would do a panel in the wall opened and harry coin was pushed into the room i had time to think that i should have guessed in this game where both sides were playing with illusion constantly coins death could have been faked artificial intestines dangling and all and of course mavis and her raiders could have taken him out of mad dog jail even before they took me out of course and i remembered the pain when he slapped my face and when his cock entered me and the robot was already moving and i hardly had time to aim of course and then his head was banging against the wall blood spurting from his nose and i had time to clip him again on the jaw as he went down of course and then i came all the way back and stopped myself as i was about to kick him in the face as he lay there unconscious zen in the art of facepunching i had knocked a man out with two blows i who hated hemingway and machismo so much that id never taken a boxing lesson in my life i was breathing hard but it was good and clean the feeling of afteranorgasm the adrenalin was flowing but a fight reflex instead of a flight reflex had been triggered and now it over and i was calm a glint in the air hagbards pistol was in maviss hand then flying toward me as i caught it she said finish the bastard but the rage had ended when i held back the kick on seeing him already unconscious no i said it is finished not until you kill him youre no good to us until youre ready to kill george i ignored her and rapped on the wall haul the bastard out i said clearly the panel opened and two slaviclooking seamen grinning grabbed coins arms and dragged him out the panel closed again quietly i dont kill on command i said turning back to mavis im not a german shepherd or a draftee my case with him is settled and if you want him dead do the dirty work yourself but mavis was smiling placidly is that a natural law she asked and twentythree hours later tobias knight listened to the voice in his earphones thats the problem i cant remember but if you leave me alone for a while maybe itll come back to me smoothing his mustache nervously knight set the button for automatic record removed the earphones and buzzed esperando desponds office despond the intercom said the cia has one a man who was with the girl after mocenigo send somebody down for the tape its got a pretty good description of the girl wilco despond said tersely anything else he thinks he might remember the name of her next customer she mentioned it to him we might get that too lets hope so despond said and clicked off he sat back in his chair and addressed the three agents in his office the guy weve got whats his name naismith is probably the next customer well check the two descriptions of the girl against each other and get a much more accurate picture than the cia has since theyre working from only one description but fifteen minutes later he was staring in puzzlement at the chart which had been chalked on the blackboard descriptions of suspect first witnesssecond witness height weight lbs lbs hair black blond race negro caucasian name or alias bonnie sarah scars etc none scar on throat age late teens midtwenties sex female female a tall bearish agent named roy ubu said thoughtfully ive never seen two eyewitness descriptions match exactly but this a small waspish agent named buzz vespa snapped one of them is lying for some reason but which one neither of them has any reason to lie despond said gentlemen weve got to face the facts dr mocenigo was unworthy of the trust that the us government placed in him he was a degenerate sex maniac he had two women last night one of them a nigra what do you mean that little sawedoff bastard is gone peter kurten of the cia was shouting at that very moment the only way out of his room was right through that door there and weve all had it under constant surveillance the door was only opened once when desalvo took out the coffee urn to have it refilled at the sandwich shop next door oh my god the coffee urn as he slumped back in his chair mouth hanging open an agent with a device that looked like a mine sweeper stepped forward daily sweep for fbi bugs sir he said uncomfortably im afraid the machine is registering one under your desk if youll let me just reach in and uhthat gets it and tobias knight listening heard no more it would be a few hours at least until their man in the cia was able to plant a new bug and saul goodman stepped hard on the brakes of his rented ford brontosaurus as a tiny and determined figure dashing out of the papa mescalito sandwich shop ran right in front of the fender saul heard a sickening thud and barney muldoons voice beside him saying oh christ no i was at the end of my ropes the syndicate i could see but why the feds i was flabbygastered i said to that dumb cunt bonnie quint are you a thousand percent sure carmel she says i know the syndicate theyre not that smooth these guys were just what they claimed feds oh christ jesus christ jesus with egg in his beard i couldnt help myself i just hauled off and bopped her in the kisser the dumb cunt whatd you tell them i screamed whatd you tell them she started to snivel i didnt tell them nothing she says so i had to bop her again christ i hate hitting women they always blubber so much ill use the belt i howled so help me god ill use the belt dont tell me you didnt tell them nothing everybody tells them something even a clam would sing like sinatra when theyre finished with him so whatd you tell them i bopped her again christ this was terrible i just told them i wasnt with this mocenigo which i wasnt so who did you tell them you were with i made up a prescription a midget a guy i saw on the street i wouldnt give the name of a real john i know that could come back against you and me i didnt know what to do so i bopped her again go away i says be missing let me think she goes out still blubbering and i go over to the window and look at the desert to calm my head my rose fever was starting to act up it was that time of year why did people have to bring roses to the desert i tried to contemplate hard on the problem and forget my health there was only one explanation that damned mocenigo figured out that sherri was pumping him and told the feds the syndicate wasnt in it yet they were all still running around the east like chickens with their legs cut off trying to figure who rubbed maldonado and why it happened at the house of a straight like this banker drake so they hadnt got the time yet to find out that five million of banana noses money had disappeared into my own safe as soon as i heard he was dead the feds werent in on that at all and the connection was circumsubstantial and then it hit me so hard that i almost fell over besides my own girls who wouldnt talk there were a dozen or two cab drivers and bartenders and whatnots who knew that sherri worked for me the feds would get it out of somebody sooner or later and probably sooner it was like a light bulb going on over my head in a comic strip treason aiding and abedding the enemy i remembered from when i was a kid those two jewish scientists who the feds got for that the hot squat they fried them christ jesus i thought id vomit why does the fucking government have to be that way about somebody just trying to make a buck even the syndicate would only shoot you or give you a lead enema but the cocksucking government has to go and put you in an electrical chair christ jesus i was hot as a chimney i took a candy out of my pocket and started chewing it trying to think what to do if i ran the syndicate would guess i was the one who emptied the till when maldonado was rubbed and theyd get me if i didnt run the feds would be at the door with a high treason warrant it was a double whammy i might try to highjack a plane to panama but i didnt know nearly enough about mocenigos bugs to make a deal with the commie government down there theyd just send me right back it was hopeless like trying to fill a threecard inside straight the only thing to do was find a hole and bury myself and then it was just like a light bulb in my head again and i thought lehman cave what does the computer say now the president asked the attorney general what does the computer say now the attorney general barked into the open phone before him if the girl had two contacts before she died at this moment the possible carriers number the phone paused if the girl had three contacts get the special agent in charge the president snapped he was the calmest man at the table ever since fernando poo he had been supplementing his librium tofranil and elovil with demerol the amazing little pills that had kept hermann goering so chipper and cheerful during the nuremberg trials while all the other nazis crumbled into catatonic paranoid or other dysfunctional conditions despond a second open phone said this is your president the president said give it to us straight have you treed the coon uh sir no sir we have to find the procurer sir the girl cant possibly be alive but we havent found her it is now mathematically certain that somebody hid her body the obvious theory sir is that her procurer being in an illegal business hid the body rather than report it we have two descriptions of the girl sir and uh although they dont tally completely they should lead us to her procurer of course he should die soon sir and then well find him thats the rubicon of the case sir meanwhile im happy to report sir that were lucking out amazingly only two definite cases off the base so far and both of them injected with the antidote it is possible just possible that the procurer went into hiding after disposing of the body in that case he hasnt contacted another human being and is not spreading it sir despond the president said i want results keep us informed your country depends on you yes sir tree that coon despond we will sir esperando despond turned from the phone as an agent from the computer section entered the room got something he snapped nervously the first girl the nigra sir she was one of the pros we questioned yesterday her name is bonnie quint you look worried is there a hitch despond asked shrewdly just another of the puzzles she didnt admit being with mocenigo the night before but that kind of lying we expected heres whats weird her description of the guy she says she was with the computer man shook his head dubiously it doesnt fit naismith the guy who said he was with her it fits the little mug the dwarf that the cia grabbed only he said she was the second girl despond mopped his brow what the heck has been going on in this town he asked the ceiling some kind of sex orgy in fact several kinds of sex orgies had been going on in las vegas ever since the veterans of the sexual revolution had arrived two days earlier the hugh m hefner brigade had taken two stories of the sands hired a herd of professional women and hadnt yet come out to join the alfred kinsey brigade the norman mailer guerrillas and the others in marching up and down the strip squirting young girls in the crotch with water pistols passing bottles of hooch back and forth and generally blocking traffic and annoying pedestrians dr naismith himself after a few token appearances had avoided most of the merriment and retired to a private suite to work on his latest fundraising letter for the colossus of yorba linda foundation actually the vsr like white heroes opposing red extremism was one of naismiths lesser projects and brought in only peanuts most of the real veterans of the sexual revolution had succumbed to syphilis marriage children alimony or some such ailment and few white heroes were prepared to oppose red extremism in the bizarre manner suggested by naismiths pamphlets in both of those cases he had recognized two nut markets that nobody else was exploiting and had quickly moved in even the john dillinger died for you society of which he was inordinately proud since it was probably the most implausible religion in the long history of humanitys infatuation with metaphysics didnt earn much less per annum than these fancies the real bread was in the colossus of yorba linda foundation which had been successfully raising money for several years to erect a heroic monument in solid gold and ten feet taller than the statue of liberty honoring the martyred former president richard milhous nixon this monument paid for entirely by the twenty million americans who still loved and revered nixon despite the damnable lies of the congress the justice department the press the tv the law courts et al would stand outside yorba linda tricky dickys boyhood home and scowl menacingly toward asia warning those gooks not to try to get the jump on uncle sammie beside the gigantic idols right foot checkers looked adoringly upward beneath the left foot was a crushed allegorical figure representing cesar chavez the great man held a bunch of lettuce in his right hand and a tape recording in the left it was all most tasteful and so appealed to fundamentalist americans that hundreds of thousands of dollars had already been collected by the colossus fund and naismith planned to hop to nepal with the loot at the first sign that contributors or postal inspectors were beginning to wonder when the statue would actually start rising on the plot he had purchased amid much publicity after the first few thousand arrived naismith was a small slight man and like many texans affected a cowboy hat although he had never herded cattle and a bandito mustache although his thefts were all based on fraud rather than force he was also for his nation at this time in history an uncommonly honest man and unlike most corporations of the epoch none of his enterprises had poisoned or mutilated the customers whose money he took his one vice was cynicism based on lack of imagination he reckoned most of his countrymen as total mental basket cases and fondly believed that he was exploiting their folly when he told them that a vast illiminati conspiracy controlled the money supply and interest rates or that a bandit of the s was in a sense a redeemer of the atrophying human spirit that there was an element of truth in these bizarre notions never crossed his mind in short even though born in texas naismith was as alienated from the pulse the poetry and the profundity of american emotion as a new york intellectual but his cynicism served him well when after reporting certain strange symptoms to the hotel doctor he found himself rushed to a supposed us public health service station which was manned by individuals he quickly recognized as laws this is an old texas word probably an abbreviation of lawmen texans dont know much about abbreviating and is as charged with suspicion and wariness although not quite so much rage as the new lefts word pig bonnie parker had used it eloquently in her last ballad someday theyll go down together theyll bury them side by side for some it means grief for the laws a relief but its death for bonnie and clyde that about summed it up the laws were not necessarily fascist gestapo racist pigs words largely unknown in texas but they were people who would find it a relief if bothersome and rebellious individualism disappeared however bloody the disappearance might be if you were ornery enough the laws would bushwhack you shoot you dead from ambush without a chance to surrender as they did to miss parker and mr barrowbut even if you were merely a mildly larcenous hoaxter like dr naismith they would be much cheered to put you someplace where you couldnt throw any more entropy into the functioning of the machine they served and so recognizing laws dr naismith narrowed his eyes thought deeply and when they began their questioning lied as only an unregenerate oldschool texas confidence man can lie you got it from somebody who had body contact with you so either you were in a very crowded elevator or you got it from a prostitute which was it naismith thought of the collision on the sidewalk with the midget and the weaselfaced character with the big suitcase but he also thought that the questioner leaned heavily on the second possibility they were looking for a woman and if you tell the laws what they want to hear they dont keep coming back and asking more personal questions i was with a prostitute he said trying to sound embarrassed can you describe her he thought back over the pros he had seen with other vsr delegates and one stood out being a kindly man he didnt want to implicate an innocent whore in this messy business whatever it was so he combined her with another woman the first that he ever successfully penetrated in his longago youth in the s unfortunately for dr naismiths kindly intentions the laws never expect an eyewitness description to match the person described in all respects so when his information was coded into an ibm machine three cards came out each one had more similarities to his fiction than differences from it and they came from a card file of several hundred prostitutes whose descriptions had been gathered and coded in the past twentyfour hours running the three cards through a different sorting in the machine limited to outstanding bodily characteristics most commonly remembered correctly the technicians emerged after all with bonnie quint fortyfive minutes later she was in esperando desponds office nervously twirling her mink stole picking at the hem of her miniskirt evading questions nimbly and remembering intensely camels voice saying ill use the belt so help me god ill use the belt she was also smarting from the injection you dont work freelance despond told her nastily for the fifth time in this town the maf would put a knife up your ass and break off the handle if you tried that youve got a pimp now do we throw the book at you or do we get his name dont be too hard on her tobias knight said shes only a poor confused kid not twenty yet are you he asked her kindly give her a chance to think shell do the right thing why should she protect a lousy pimp who exploits her all the time he gave her a reassuring glance poor confused kid my ass despond exploded this is a matter of life and death and no nigra whore is going to sit here lying her head off and get away with it he did a good imitation of a man literally trembling with repressed fury id like to kick her head in he screamed knight still playing the friendly cop looked shocked thats not very professional he said sadly youre overtired and youre frightening the child three hours later after despond had nearly done a complete psycho schtick and virtually threatened to behead poor bonnie with his letter opener and knight had become so fatherly and protective that both he and she were beginning to feel that she was actually his very own sixyearold daughter being set upon by goths and vandals a sobbing but accurate description of carmel emerged including his address twelve minutes later roy ubu calling via car radio reported that carmel was not in his house and had been seen driving toward the southwest in a jeep with a large suitcase beside him in the next eighteen hours eleven men in jeeps were stopped on various roads southwest of las vegas but none of them was carmel although most of them were around the height and weight and general physical description given by bonnie quint and two of them even had large suitcases in the twentyfour hours after that nearly a thousand men of all sizes and shapes were stopped on roads north south east and west in cars not remotely like jeeps and some driving toward not away from las vegas none of them was carmel either among all the men wandering around the desert door base and the city of las vegas with credentials from the us public health service one who really was employed by usphs had a long lean body a mournful countenance a general resemblance to the late great boris karloff and the name fred filiarisus by special authority of the white house dr filiarisus was able to gain access to everything known by the scientists at desert door including the course of the disease in those originally infected among whom two had died before the antidote took effect and three had shown a total lack of symptoms even though exposed along with the others he also had access to both fbi and cia information as it came in without having to bug either office it was he therefore who finally put together the correct picture on april and reported directly to the white house at eleven that morning some people are naturally immune to anthrax leprosy pi mr president filiarisus said unfortunately they serve as carriers we found three like that at the base and it is mathematically scientifically certain that a fourth is still at large everybody was lying to the fbi and cia sir they were all afraid of punishment for various activities forbidden by our laws no variation or permutation on their stories will hang together reasonably each witness lied about something and usually about several things the truth is other than it appeared in short the government being an agency of punishment acted as a distorting factor from the beginning and i had to use informationtheory equations to determine the degree of distortion present i would say that what i finally discovered may have universal application no governing body can ever obtain an accurate account of reality from those over whom it holds power from the perspective of communication analysis government is not an instrument of law and order but of law and disorder im sorry to have to say this so bluntly but it needs to be kept in mind when similar situations arise in the future he sounds like an effing anarchist the vice president muttered the true picture with a ninetyseven percent probability is this filiarisus continued dr mocenigo had only one contact and she died the fbi hypothesis is correct her body was then hidden probably in the desert by an associate wishing to avoid involvement with law enforcement agencies if prostitution were legal we might never have had this nightmare i told you he was an effing anarchist the vice president growled and a sex maniac too the associate who hid the body filiarisus went on is our fourth carrier personally immune but lethal to others it was this person who infected mr chaney and dr naismith this person was probably not a prostitute these men lied among other reasons because they knew what the government agents wanted them to say when power is wielded over people they say as well as do what they think is expected of them another reason government always finds it difficult to learn the truth about anything the only hypothesis that mathematical logic will accept when all the known data was fed into a computer is that the fourth carrier is the procurer who disappeared mr carmel experiencing no symptoms himself he is unaware that he carries the worlds most dangerous disease for reasons of his own which we cannot guess he has been hiding since he disposed of the womans body probably he feared that the corpse might be found and a case of manslaughter or homicide could be made against him or he might have a motive completely unrelated to her death only twice has he contacted other human beings i would suggest that his contact with miss quint was typical of their professional relationship he either hit her or had sex relations with her his contact with dr naismith and mr chaney was some sort of accident perhaps the crowded elevator that has been suggested by mr despond otherwise he had been as it were underground this is why we only found three cases instead of the thousands or millions we feared however the problem still remains carmel is immune will never know he has the disease unless he is told it and will eventually surface somewhere when he does we will learn of it through the outbreak of anthrax leprosy pi cases in the vicinity at that point the whole nightmare begins again sir our best hope and the computer backs me on this is public disclosure the panic we tried to avoid will have to be faced every medium of communication in the nation must be given the full facts and carmels description must be circulated everywhere this is our last chance the man is a walking biological doomsday machine and he must be found psychologists and social psychologists have fed all the relevant facts about this case and about previous panics and plagues into the computer also the conclusion with ninetythree percent certainty is that the panic will be nationwide and martial law will have to be declared everywhere liberals in congress should be placed under house arrest as the first step and the supreme court must be stripped of its powers totally the army and the national guard will have to be sent into every city with authority to override any policies of local officials democracy in short must cease until the emergency is ended hes not an anarchist the secretary of the interior said hes a goddam fascist hes a realist said the president clearminded crisp quick on the uptake and stoned clear round the corner of schizophrenia by his usual three tranquilizers a stronger dose of amphetamines than usual and loads of those happy little demerol tablets we start implementing his suggestions right now and so those few tattered remnants of the bill of rights which had survived into the fourth decade of the cold war were laid to rest temporarily it was thought by those present dr filiarisus whose name in the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria was gracchus gruad had completed on the day known as may eve or walpurgisnacht the project begun when the first dream of anthrax leprosy pi was planted in dr mocenigos mind on the day known as candelmas these dates were known by much older names in the illuminati of course and the burial of the bill of rights was expected by them to be permanent two hours before dr filiarisus spoke to the president four of the worlds five illuminati primi met in an old graveyard in ingolstadt the fifth could not be present they agreed that all was going as scheduled but one danger remained nobody in the order however developed his or her esp had been able to trace carmel leaning on a tombstone where adam weishaupt had once performed rites so unique that the psychic vibration had bounced off every sensitive mind in europe leading to such decidedly peculiar literary productions as lewiss the monk maturins melmoth walpoles castle of otranto mrs shelleys frankenstein and desades one hundred twenty days of sodomthe eldest of the four said it can still fail if one of the mehums finds the pimp before he infects a city or two mehums was an abbreviation for all descendants of those not part of the original unbroken circle it meant mere humans why can none of our ultrasensitives find him a second asked does he have no ego or soul at all he has a vibration but its not distinctly human whenever we seem to have a fix on it were usually picking up a bank vault or the safe of some paranoid millionaire the eldest replied we have that problem with an increasing number of americans the third commented morosely in that nation we have done our work too well the conditioning to those pieces of paper is so strong that no other psychic impulse remains to be read the fourth spoke now is no time for trepidation my brothers the plan is virtually realized and this mans lack of ordinary mehum qualities will prove an advantage when we do fix on him no ego no resistance we will be able to move him at our whim the stars are right he who is not to be named is impatient and now we must be intrepid she spoke with fervor the others nodded heute die welt morgens das sonnensystem the eldest cried out fiercely heute die welt all repeated morgens das sonnensystem but two days earlier as the leif erikson left the atlantic and entered the underground ocean of valusia beneath europe george dorn was listening to a different kind of chorus it was mavis had explained to him in advance the weekly agape ludens or love feast game of the discordians and the dining hall was newly bedecked with pornographic and psychedelic posters christian and buddhist and amerindian mystic designs balloons and lollypops dangling from the ceiling on dayglodabbed strings numinous paintings of discordian saints including norton i sigismundo malatesta guillaume of aquitaine chuang chou judge roy bean various historical figures even more obscure and numerous gorillas and dolphins bouquets of roses and forsythia and gladiolas and orchids clusters of acorns and gourds and the inevitable proliferation of golden apples pentagons and octopi the main course was the best alaskan king crab newburg that george had ever tasted only lightly dusted with a mild hint of panamanian red grass dozens of trays of dried fruits and cheeses were passed back and forth among the tables together with canapes of an exquisite caviar george had never encountered before only hagbard knows where those sturgeon spawn mavis explained and the beverage was a blend of the japanese seventeenherb mu tea with menomenee indian peyote tea while everyone gorged laughed and got gently but definitely zonked hagbardwho was evidently satisfied that he and fuckup had located the problem in las vegasmerrily conducted the religious portion of the agape ludens rubadubdub he chanted o hail eris rubadubdub the crew merrily chorused o hail eris syadasti hagbard chanted all that i tell you is true syadasti the crew repeated o hail eris george looked around there were three or five races present depending upon which school of physical anthropology you credited and maybe half a hundred nationalities but the feeling of brotherhood and sisterhood transcended any sense of contrast creating instead a blend as in musical progression syadavaktavya hagbard chanted now all that i tell you is false syadavaktavya george joined in o hail eris syadastisyanasti hagbard intoned all that i tell you is meaningless syadastisyanasti all agreed some jeeringly o hail eris if they had services like this in the baptist church back in nutley george thought i never would have told my mother religion is all a con and had that terrible quarrel when i was nine syadastisyanastisyadavaktavyaska hagbard sang out all that i tell you is true and false and meaningless syadastisyanastisyadavaktavyaska the massed voices replied o hail eris rubadubdub hagbard repeated quietly does anyone have a new incantation all hail crab newburg a russianaccented voice shouted that was an immediate hit all hail crab newburg everyone howled all hail these bloody fucking beautiful roses an oxfordian voice contributed all hail these bloody fucking beautiful roses all agreed miss mao arose the pope is the chief cause of protestantism she recited softly that was another roaring success everybody chorused and one harlem voice added right on capitalism is the chief cause of socialism miss mao chanted more confident that went over well too and she then tried the state is the chief cause of anarchism which was another smashing success prisons are built with the stones of law brothels with the bricks of religion miss mao went on prisons are built with the stones of law brothels with the bricks of religion the hall boomed i stole that last one from william blake miss mao said quietly and sat down any others hagbard asked there was none so he went on after a moment very well then i will preach my weekly sermon balls cried a texas voice bullshit added a brazilian female hagbard frowned that wasnt much of a demonstration he commented sadly are the rest of you so passive that youre just going to sit here on your dead asses and let me bore the piss out of you the texan the brazilian lady and a few others got up we are going to have an orgy the brazilian said briefly and they left well sink me im glad theres some life left on this old tub hagbard grinned as for the rest of you who can tell me without uttering a word the fallacy of the illuminati a young girl she was no more than fifteen george guessed and the youngest member of the crew he had heard she was a runaway from a fabulously rich italian family in rome slowly raised her hand and clenched her fist hagbard turned on her furiously how many times must i tell you people no faking you got that out of some cheap book on zen that neither the author nor you understood a damned word of i hate to be dictatorial but phony mysticism is the one thing discordianism cant survive youre on shitwork in the kitchen for a week you wiseass brat the girl remained immobile in the same position fist raised and only slowly did george read the slight smile that curled her mouth then he started to smile himself hagbard lowered his eyes for a second and gave a sicilian shrug o oi che siete in picdoletta barca he said softly and bowed im still in charge of nautical and technical matters he announced but miss portinari now succeeds me as episkopos of the leif erikson cabal anyone with lingering spiritual or psychological problems take them to her he lunged across the room hugged the girl laughed with her happily for a moment and placed his golden apple ring on her finger now i dont have to meditate every day he shouted joyously and ill have more time for some thinking in the next two days as the leif erikson slowly crossed the sea of valusia and approached the danube george discovered that hagbard had indeed put all his mystical trappings behind him he spoke only of technical matters concerning the submarine or other mundane subjects and was sublimely unconcerned with the roleplaying rolechanging and other mindblowing tactics that had previously made up his persona what emerged the new hagbard or the old hagbard of days before his adoption of guruhood was a tough pragmatic middleaged engineer with wide intelligence and interests an overwhelming kindness and generosity and many small symptoms of nervousness anxiety and overwork but mostly he seemed happy and george realized that the euphoria derived from his having dropped an enormous burden miss portinari meanwhile had lost the selfeffacing quality that made her so eminently forgettable before and from the moment hagbard passed her the ring she was as remote and gnomic as an etruscan sybil george in fact found that he was a little afraid of her an annoying sensation since he thought he had transcended fear when he found that the robot was left to itself neither cowardly nor homicidal george tried to discuss his feelings with hagbard once when they happened to be seated together at dinner on april i dont know where my head is at anymore he said tentatively well in the immortal words of marx putta your hat on your neck then hagbard grinned no seriously george murmured as hagbard hacked at a steak i dont feel really awakened or enlightened or whatever i feel like k in the castle ive seen it once but i dont know how to get back there why do you want to get back hagbard asked im damned glad to be out of it all its harder work than coal mining he munched placidly obviously bored by the direction of the conversation thats not true george protested part of you is still there and always will be youve just given up being a guide for others im trying to give up hagbard said pointedly some people seem to be trying to reenlist me sorry im not a german shepherd or a draftee non serviam george george fiddled with his own steak for a minute then tried another approach what was that italian phrase you used just before you gave your ring to miss portinari i couldnt think of anything else to say hagbard explained embarrassed so as usual with me i got arty and pretentious dante addresses his readers in the first canto of the paradiso o voi che siete in piccloletta barca roughly oh you who are sailing in a very small boat astern of me he meant that the readers not having had the vision couldnt really understand his words i turned it around o oi che siete in piccioletta barca admitting i was behind her in understanding i should get the ezra pound award for hiding emotion in tangled erudition thats why im glad to give up the guru gig i never was much better than secondrate at it well im still way astern of you george began look hagbard growled im a tired engineer at the end of a long day cant we talk about something less taxing to my depleted brain what do you think of the economic system i outline in the second part of never whistle while youre pissing ive decided to start calling it technoanarchism do you think thats more clear at first sight than anarchocapitalism and george found himself frustrated engaged in a long discussion of noninterestbearing currencies land stewardship replacing land ownership the inability of monopoly capitalism to adjust to abundance and other matters which would have interested him a week ago but now were very unimportant compared to the question which zen masters phrased as getting the goose out of the bottle without breaking the glass or specifically getting george dorn out of george dorn without destroying george dorn that night mavis came again to his bed and george said again no not until you love me the way i love you youre turning into a stiffnecked prig mavis said dont try to walk before you can crawl listen george cried suppose our society crippled every infants legs systematically instead of our minds the ones who tried to get up and walk would be called neurotics right and the awkwardness of their first efforts would be published in the all psychiatric journals as proof of the regressive and schizzy nature of their unsocial and unnatural impulse toward walking right and those of you who know the secret would be superior and aloof and tell us to wait be patient youll let us in on it in your own good time right crap im going to do it on my own im not holding anything back mavis said gently theres no field until both poles are charged and im the dead pole go to hell and bake bagels after mavis left stella arrived wearing cute chinese pajamas horny she asked bluntly christ almighty yes in ninety seconds they were naked and he was nibbling at her ear while his hand rubbed her pubic mat but a saboteur was at work at his brain i love you he thought and it was not untrue because he loved all women now knowing partially what sex was really all about but he couldnt bring himself to say it because it was not totally true either since he loved mavis more much more im awfully fond of you he almost said but the absurdity of it stopped him her hand cupped his cock and found it limp her eyes opened and looked into his enquiringly he kissed her lips quickly and moved his hand lower inserting a ringer until he found the clitoris but even when her breathing got deeper he did not respond as usual and her hand began massaging his cock more desperately he slid down kissing nipples and bellybutton on the way and began licking her clitoris as soon as she came he cupped her buttocks lifted her pelvis got his tongue into her vagina and forced another quick orgasm immediately lowering her slightly again and beginning a very gentle and slow return in spiral fashion back to the clitoris but still he was flaccid stop stella breathed let me do you baby george moved upward on the bed and hugged her i love you he said and suddenly it did not sound like a lie stella giggled and kissed his mouth briefly it takes a lot to get those words out of you doesnt it she said bemusedly honesty is the worst policy george said grimly i was a child prodigy you know a freak it was rugged i had to have some defense and somehow i picked honesty i was always with older boys so i never won a fight the only way i could feel superior or escape total inferiority was to be the most honest bastard on the planet earth so you cant say i love you unless you mean it stella laughed youre probably the only man in america with that problem if you could only be a woman for a while baby you cant imagine what liars most men are oh ive said it at times when it was at least half true but it always sounded like playacting to me and i felt it sounded that way to the woman too this time it just came out perfectly natural no effort that is something stella grinned and i cant let it go unrewarded her black body slid downward and he enjoyed the esthetic effect as his eyes followed her black on white like the yinyang or the sacred chaowhat was the psychoses of the white race that made this beauty seem ugly to most of them then her lips closed over his penis and he found that the words had loosened the knot he was erect in a second he closed his eyes to savor the sensation then opened them to look down at her afro hairdo her serious dark face his cock slipping back and forth between her lips i love you he repeated with even more conviction oh christ oh eris oh baby baby i love you he closed his eyes again and let the robot move his pelvis in response to her oh stop he said stop drawing her upward and turning her over together he said mounting her together as her eyes closed when he entered her and then opened again for a moment meeting his in total tenderness i love you stella i love and he knew it was so far along that the weight wouldnt bother her collapsing using his arms to hug her not supporting himself belly to belly and breast to breast her arms hugging him also and her voice saying i love you too oh i love you and moving with it saying angel and darling and then saying nothing the explosion and the light again permeating his whole body not just the penis a passing through the mandala to the other side and a long sleep the next morning he and stella fucked some more wildly and joyously they said i love you so many times that it became a new mantra to him and they were still whispering at breakfast the problem of mavis and the problem of reaching total enlightenment had both vanished from his mind enjoying bacon and eggs that seemed tastier than he had ever eaten before exchanging pointless and very private jokes with stella george dorn was at peace but nine hours earlier at that same time the kachinas gathered in the center of the oldest city in north america orabi and began a dance which an excited visiting anthropologist had never seen before as he questioned various old men and old women among the people of peace which is what hopi means he found that the dance was dedicated to shewomanforevernotchange he knew enough not to try to convert that title into his own grammar since it represented an important aspect of the hopi philosophy of time which is much like the simon moon and adam weishaupt philosophies of time and nothing like what physics students learn at least until they reach graduate level studies only four times he was told had this dance ever been necessary four times when the many worlds were all in danger and this was the time of the fifth and greatest danger the anthropologist who happened to be a hindu named indole ringh quickly jotted in his notebook cf four yogas in upanishads wagadu legend in sudan and marshs queer notions about atlantis this could be big the dance went on the drums pounded monotonously and carmel far away broke into a sudden perspiration and in los angeles john dillinger calmly loaded his revolver dropped it in his briefcase and set a panama hat on his neatly combed silvergray hair he was humming a song from his youth those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine i hope that pimp is where hagbard says he thought ive only got eighteen hours before they declare martial law goodbye forever he hummed on old fellows and pals i saw the fnords the same day i first heard about the plastic martini let me be very clear and precise about this since many of the people on this trip are deliberately and perversely obscure i would not could not have seen the fnords if hagbard celine hadnt hypnotized me the night before on the flying saucer i had been reading pat walshs memos at home and listening to a new record from the museum of natural history i was adding a few new samples to my collection of washingtonweishaupt pictures on the wall when the saucer appeared hovering outside my window needless to say it didnt particularly surprise me i had saved a little of the aum after chicago contrary to the instructions from elf and had dosed myself after meeting the dealy lama not to mention malaclypse the elder and seeing that nut celine actually talk to gorillas i assumed my mind was a point of receptivity where the aum would trigger something truly original the ufo in fact was a bit of a letdown so many people had seen them already and i was ready for something nobody had ever seen or imagined it was even more a disappointment when they psyched me or slurped me aboard and i found instead of martians or insect trust delegates from the crab galaxy just hagbard stella maris and a few other people from the leif erikson hail eris said hagbard all hail discordia i replied giving the threeaftertwo pattern and completing the pentad is this something important or did you just want to show me your latest invention the inside of the saucer was to be trite eerie everything was noneuclidean and semitransparent i kept feeling that i might fall through the floor and hurtle to the ground to smash myself on the sidewalk then we started moving and it got worse dont let the architecture disturb you hagbard said my own adaptation of some of bucky fullers synergetic geometry its smaller and more solid than it looks you wont fall out believe me is this contraption behind all the flying saucer reports since i asked curiously not quite hagbard laughed thats basically a hoax the plan was created in the united states government one of the few ideas theyve had without direct illuminati inspiration since about the middle of roosevelts first term a reserve measure in case something happens to russia and china hi baby i said softly to stella remembering san francisco would you tell me minus the celine rhetoric and paradox what the hell hes talking about the state is based on threat stella said simply if people arent afraid of something theyll realize they dont need that big government hand picking their pockets all the time so in case russia and china collapse from internal dissension or get into a private war and blow each other to hell or suffer some unexpected natural calamity like a series of earthquakes the saucer myth has been planted if there are no earthly enemies to frighten the american people with the saucer myth will immediately change there will be evidence that they come from mars and are planning to invade and enslave us dig so hagbard added i built this little gizmo and i can travel anywhere i want without interference any sighting of this craft whether by a radar operator with twenty years experience or a little old lady in perth amboy is regarded by the government as a case of autosuggestion since they know they didnt plant it themselves i can hover over cities like new york or military installations that are top secret or any place i damned well please nice very nice i said but why did you bring me up here its time for you to see the fnords he replied then i woke up in bed and it was the next morning i made breakfast in a pretty nasty mood wondering if id seen the fnords whatever the hell they were in the hours he had blacked out or if i would see them as soon as i went out in the street i had some pretty gruesome ideas about them i must admit creatures with three eyes and tentacles survivors from atlantis who walked among us invisible due to some form of mind shield and did hideous work for the illuminati it was unnerving to contemplate and i finally gave in to my fears and peeked out the window thinking it might be better to see them from a distance first nothing just ordinary sleepy people heading for their buses and subways that calmed me a little so i set out the toast and coffee and fetched in the new york times from the hallway i turned the radio to wbai and caught some good vivaldi sat down grabbed a piece of toast and started skimming the first page then i saw the fnords the feature story involved another of the endless squabbles between russia and the us in the un general assembly and after each direct quote from the russian delegate i read a quite distinct fnord the second lead was about a debate in congress on getting the troops out of costa rica every argument presented by senator bacon was followed by another fnord at the bottom of the page was a times depthtype study of the growing pollution problem and the increasing use of gas masks among new yorkers the most distressing chemical facts were interpolated with more fnords suddenly i saw hagbards eyes burning into me and heard his voice your heart will remain calm your adrenalin gland will remain calm calm allover calm you will not panic you will look at the fnord and see it you will not evade it or black it out you will stay calm and face it and further back way back my firstgrade teacher writing fnord on the blackboard while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk turned and turned and his voice droned on if you dont see the fnord it cant eat you dont see the fnord dont see the fnord i looked back at the paper and still saw the fnords this was one step beyond pavlov i realized the first conditioned reflex was to experience the panic reaction the activation syndrome its technically called whenever encountering the word fnord the second conditioned reflex was to black out what happened including the word itself and just to feel a general lowgrade emergency without knowing why and the third step of course was to attribute this anxiety to the news stories which were bad enough in themselves anyway of course the essence of control is fear the fnords produced a whole population walking around in chronic lowgrade emergency tormented by ulcers dizzy spells nightmares heart palpitations and all the other symptoms of too much adrenalin all my leftwing arrogance and contempt for my countrymen melted and i felt genuine pity no wonder the poor bastards believe anything theyre told walk through pollution and overcrowding without complaining watch their sons hauled off to endless wars and butchered never protest never fight back never show much happiness or eroticism or curiosity or normal human emotion live with perpetual tunnel vision walk past a slum without seeing either the human misery it contains or the potential threat it poses to their security then i got a hunch and turned quickly to the advertisements it was as i expected no fnords that was part of the gimmick too only in consumption endless consumption could they escape the amorphous threat of the invisible fnords i kept thinking about it on my way to the office if i pointed out a fnord to somebody who hadnt been deconditioned as hagbard deconditioned me what would he or she say theyd probably read the word before or after it no this word id say and they would again read an adjacent word but would their panic level rise as the threat came closer to consciousness i preferred not to try the experiment it might have ended with a psychotic fugue in the subject the conditioning after all went back to grade school no wonder we all hate those teachers so much we have a dim masked memory of what theyve done to us in converting us into good and faithful servants for the illuminati when i arrived at my desk peter jackson handed me a press release what do you make of this he asked with a puzzled frown and i looked at the mimeographed first page the old eyeandpyramid design leaped out at me demolay freres invites you to the premiere debut of the worlds first plastic nude martini the press release declared on second glance the eye in the triangle turned into the elliptical rim of a martini glass while the pupil in the eye was actually the olive floating in the cocktail what the hell is a plastic nude martini said peter jackson and why would they invite us to a press party for one you can bet that its nonbiodegradable said joe which will make it very unfashionable with honky ecology freaks said peter sarcastically joe squinted at the design again it could be a coincidence but coincidence was just another word for synchronicity i think ill go he said and whats that he added as his eye fell upon a halfunfolded poster on his desk oh that came with the latest american medical association album said peter i dont want it and i thought you might its time you took those pictures of the rolling stones off your wall this is the age of constantly accelerating change and a man who displays old pictures of the stones is liable to be labeled a reactionary four owleyed faces stared at him they were dressed in onepiece white suits and three of them were joining extended hands to form a triangle while the fourth wolfgang saure generally acknowledged to be the leader of the group stood with his arms folded in the center the picture was taken from above so that the most prominent elements were the four heads while the outstretched arms clearly made the sides of the triangle and the bodies seemed unimportant dwindling away to nothing the background was jet black the three young men and the woman with their smoothshaven bony faces their blond crewcuts and their icy blue eyes seemed extremely sinister to joe if the nazis had won the war and heinrich himmler had followed hitler as ruler of the german empire kids like this would be running the world and they almost were in a different sense because they had succeeded the beatles and stones as kings of music which made them emperors among youth although long hair remained the general fashion the kids had accepted the american medical associations antisepticclean appearance as a needed reaction against a style that had become too commonplace as wolfgang himself had said if you need an outward sign to know your own you dont really belong they give me the creeps said joe what did you think when the beatles first came out said peter joe shrugged they gave me the creeps they looked ugly and sexless and like teenage werewolves with all that hair and they seemed to be able to mesmerize twelveyearold girls peter nodded the bulk of the amas fans are even younger so you might as well start conditioning yourself to them now theyre going to be around for a long time peter lets you and me have lunch joe said then im going to get some work done and then im going to leave here at four to go to this plastic martini party first of all though hold the chair for me while i take down the stones and put up the american medical association the demolay freres group wasnt kidding he found there were martinis olives and all or cocktail onions for those who preferred them in transparent plastic bags that were shaped like nude women pretty terrible taste the manufacturer had thought joe briefly joe wondered if it would be a good idea to infiltrate this company so as to get dosages of aum in all the plastic nude martinis but then he remembered the emblem and thought maybe this company was already infiltrated but by which side there was a beautiful oriental girl in the room she had black hair that reached all the way down to the small of her back and when she raised her arms to adjust a head ornament joe was surprised to see thick black hair in her armpits orientals did not normally have much body hair he thought could she be some relation to the hairy ainu of northern japan it intrigued him turned him on as hed never thought armpit hair would and he went over to her to talk the first thing he noticed was that the headband she wore had a golden apple with the letter k printed on it right in the center of her forehead she is one of us he thought his hunch about coming to this party was right these martini bags sure have a silly shape said joe why dont you care for nude women well this has about as much to do with nude women as any other piece of plastic said joe no my point is that its in such execrable taste but then all of american industry is nothing but a giant obscene circus to me whats your name the black eyes fixed his intently mao tsuhsi any relation no my name means cat in chinese his doesnt his name is mao but mine is mao joe was enchanted by her enunciation of the two different tones well miss cat you are the most attractive woman ive met in ages she responded with a silent flirtation of her own and they were soon in a wonderfully interesting conversation which he could never remember afterwards nor did he notice the pinch of powder she dropped into his drink he began feeling strangely groggy tsuhsi took his arm and led him to the checkroom they got their coats left the building and hailed a cab in the back seat they kissed for a long time she opened her coat and he pulled the zipper that went all the way down the front of her dress he felt her breasts and stroked her belly then dropped his head into her bush she was wearing no underwear she draped her legs over his using her coat to screen what was going on from the cab driver and helped him expose his erect penis with a few quick agile movements she had swept her skirt out of the way raised her little seat into the air and slid her welllubricated cunt down over his cock and was fucking him sidesaddle it could have been difficult and awkward but she was so light and well coordinated that she managed to bring herself to orgasm easily and voluptuously she drew in her breath sharply through her teeth and a shudder ran through her body she rested her head momentarily on his shoulder then raised herself slightly and helped joe to a pleasant climax with a rotary motion of her ass the experience joe realized would have been more exquisite a few months or a few years earlier now with his growing sensitivity he was conscious of what had been missing the actual energetic contact the effect of the jams and the discordians on him he reflected had been paradoxical by ordinary standards he was no more puritanical than before they started tinkering with his nervous system he was less but at the same time casual sex was less appealing to him he remembered atlanta hopes diatribes against sexism in her book telemachus sneezedthe bible of the gods lightning movementand he suddenly saw some weird kind of sense in her rantings the sexual revolution in america was as much of a fraud as the political revolutions in china and russia atlanta had written with her usual exuberant capitalization she was in a way quite right people today were still wrapped in a cellophane of false ego and even if they fucked and had orgasms together the cellophane was still there and no real contact had been made and yet if mao was what he suspected she would know this even better than he did was this quick cool spasm some kind of test or some lesson or demonstration if so how was he supposed to respond and then he remembered that she had not given an address to the driver the cab had been waiting only for them to take them to a predetermined place for reasons unknown ive seen the fnords he thought now im going to see more the cab stopped on a narrow heavily shadowed street that seemed to be all empty stores factory buildings loading docks and warehouses with miss mao leading they entered an old dilapidatedlooking loft building with the aid of a key she had in her handbag climbed some clanging castiron stairs walked hand in hand down a long dark corridor and came at last through a series of anterooms each better appointed than the last to a splendid boardroom joe shook his head amazed at what he saw but there was something he suspected a drug that was keeping him docile and passive around a table sat men and women costumed from various eras of human history joe recognized indian chinese japanese mongol and polynesian dress also classical greek and roman medieval and renaissance there were other outfits more difficult to recognize at first glance a flying dutch board meeting joe thought to himself they were talking about the illuminati the discordians the jams and the erisians a man wearing a steel breastplate and helmet with gold inlay and a neatly trimmed mustache and goatee said it is now possible to predict with ninetyeight percent probability of accuracy that the illuminati are setting up fernando poo for an international crisis the question is do we raid the island and get the records now making sure theyre not endangered or do we wait and take advantage of the trouble as a cover for our raid a man in a dragonembroidered red silk robe said there will be no way to take advantage of the trouble in my opinion it will seem like chaos on the surface but underneath the illuminati will have everything very much under control now is the time to move a woman in a translucent silk blouse whose little vest did not hide her dark rounded breasts said you realize this could be a lovely scoop for your magazine mr malik you could send a reporter there to look into conditions on fernando poo equatorial guinea has all the usual problems of a developing african nation will tribal rivalries flare up between the bubi and the fang preventing the further development of national cooperation will the poverty of the mainland province lead to attempts to expropriate the wealth of fernando poo and what of the army what for example of a certain captain jesus tequila y mota an interview with the captain might prove to be a journalistic coup three years from now yes said a big woman in colorfully dyed furs who played incessantly with the carved leg bone of some large animal we dont expect c l sulzberger to grasp the importance of fernando poo until the crisis is upon the world so if advance warning is desirable as we think it is why not through confrontation is that why you asked me here said joe to tell me something is going to happen in fernando poo where the hell is fernando poo anyway look it up in an atlas when you get back to work its one of several volcanic islands off the coast of africa said a darkskinned sliteyed man wearing a buffalo hide decorated with feathers of course you understand that you could only hint at the real forces at work there he added for instance we wouldnt want you to mention that fernando poo is one of the last outcroppings of the continent of atlantis you know mao tsuhsi was standing beside joe with a glass containing a pinkish liquid here drink this she said it will sharpen your perceptions a man in goldbraidencrusted field marshals uniform said mr malik is the next business in order on our agenda we are to educate him to some extent lets do it to that extent the lights in the room went out there was a rustling at one end and suddenly joe was looking at a brightly lit movie screen when atlantis ruled the earth the title appears in letters that look like blocks of stone piled on top of one another to form a kind of step pyramid it is followed by shots of the earth as it looked thirty thousand years ago during the great ice ages showing woolly mammoths sabertoothed tigers and cromagnon hunters while a narrator explains that at the same time the greatest civilization ever known by man is flourishing on the continent of atlantis the atlanteans do not know anything about good or evil the narrator explains however they all live to be five hundred years old and have no fear of death the bodies of all atlanteans are covered with fur as with apes after seeing various domestic scenes in zukong gimorladsiragosa the largest and most central city on the continent but not the capital because the atlanteans do not have a government we move to a laboratory where the young one hundred years old scientist gruad is displaying a biological experiment to an associate gao twone the experiment is a giant waterdwelling serpentman gao twone is impressed but gruad declares that he is bored he wishes to change himself in some unexpected way gruad is already strange unlike other atlanteans he is not covered with fur but has only short blond hair on top of his head and a closecropped beard in comparison to other atlanteans he seems hideously naked he wears a highcollared pale green robe and gauntlets he tells gao twone that he is tired of accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge its just another guise for the pursuit of pleasure to which too many of our fellow atlanteans devote their lives of course theres nothing wrong with pleasure it moves the energies but i feel that there is something higher and more heroic i have no name for it yet but i know it exists gao twone is somewhat shocked you as a scientist can talk of knowing something exists when you have no evidence gruad is dejected by this and admits my lens needs polishing but after a moment he bounces back and yet even though i have my moments of doubt i think my lens really is clear of course i must find lie evidence but even now before i start i feel that i know what i will find we could be greater and finer than we are i look at what i am and sometimes i despise myself im just a clever animal an ape who has learned to play with tools i want to be much more i say we can be what the lloigor are and even more we can conquer time and seize eternity even as they have i mean to achieve that or destroy myself in the attempt the scene shifts to a banquet hall where ingel rild a venerable atlantean scientist has called together prominent atlanteans to celebrate a space research achievement the production of a solar flare ingel rild and his associates have developed a missile which when it strikes the sun can cause an explosion he tells the marijuanasmoking gathering we can control to the second the timing of the flare and to the millimeter the distance it will spring out from the sun a flare of sufficient magnitude could burn our planet to a crisp a smaller flare could bombard the earth with radiations such that the area closest to the sun would be destroyed while the rest of our world would suffer drastic changes most serious of all perhaps would be the biological changes these excessive radiations would bring about life forms would be damaged and perhaps become extinct new life forms would arise all of nature would undergo a tremendous upheaval this has happened naturally once or twice it happened seventy million years ago when the dinosaurs were suddenly wiped out and replaced by mammals we still have much to learn about the mechanism that produces spontaneous solar flares however to be able to cause them artificially is a step toward predicting and possibly controlling them when that stage is reached our planet and our race will be protected from the kind of catastrophe that destroyed the dinosaurs after the applause a woman named kajeci asks whether it might not be disrespectful to tamper with our father the sun ingel rild replies that man is a part of nature and what he does is natural and cant be construed as tampering now gruad interrupts angrily pointing out that he an unattractive mutation is the product of tampering with nature he tells ingel rild that the atlanteans do not truly understand nature and the order that controls it he declares that man is subject to laws all things in nature are but man is different because he can disobey the natural laws that govern him gruad goes on with humanity we can speak as we speak of our own machines in terms of performance expected and performance delivered if a machine does not do what it is designed for we try to correct it we want it to do what it ought to do what it should do i think we have the right and the duty to demand the same of people that they perform as they ought to and should perform an aged and merryeyed scientist named lhuv kerapht interrupts but people are not machines gruad exactly gruad answers i have already considered that therefore i have created new words words even stronger than should and ought when a person performs as he or she should and ought i call that good and anything less than this i call evil this outlandish notion is greeted with general laughter gruad tries to speak persuasively conscious of his lonely position as a pioneer trying desperately to communicate with the closed minds all around him after further argument though he becomes threatening declaring the people of atlantis do not live according to the law in their pride they strike the sun itself and boast of it as you have ingel rild this day i say that if atlanteans do not live according to the law a disaster will befall them a disaster that will shake the entire earth you have been warned heed my words gruad strides majestically out of the banquet hall seizing his cloak at the door and sweeping it about him as he leaves kajeci follows him and tells him that she thinks she partly understands what he has been trying to say the laws he speaks of are like the wishes of parents and the great bodies of the universe are our parents isnt that so gruads naked hand strokes kajecis furred cheek and they go off into the darkness together within six months gruad has formed an organization called the party of science their banner is an eye inside a triangle which in turn is surrounded by a serpent with its tail in its mouth the party of science demands that atlantis publish the natural laws gruad has discovered and make them binding on all with systems of reward and punishment to enforce them the word punishment is another addition to the atlantean vocabulary coined by gruad one of gruads opponents explains to friends of his that it means torture and everyones fur bristles ingel rild announces to a gathering of his supporters that gruad has proven to his own satisfaction and the demonstration runs to seventytwo scrolls of logical symbols that sex is part of what he calls evil only sex for the good of the community is to be permitted under gruads system to keep the race alive a scientist called ton lit exclaims you mean we must be thinking about conception during the act thats impossible mens penises would droop and womens vaginas wouldnt get moist its like well its like making the shrill mouthmusic while you are urinating it would take great training if it can be done at all ingel rild proposes the formation of a party of freedom to oppose gruad discussing gruads personality ingel rild says he checked the genealogical records and found that several of the most agitatedenergy people in all atlantean history were among his ancestors gruad is a mutation and so are many of his followers the energy of normal atlanteans flows slowly gruads people are impatient and frustrated and this is what makes them want to inflict suffering on their fellow humans joe sat up with a jolt if he understood that part of the movie gruad evidently the first illuminatus was also the first homo neophilus and the party of freedom which seemed to be the origin of the discordian and jam movements was pure homo neophobus how the hell could that be squared with the generally reactionary attitude of current illuminati policies and the innovativeness of the discordians and jams but the film was moving on in a disreputablelooking tavernlike place where men and women smoke dope in pipes that they pass from one to another while people grope in couples and groups in dark corners sylvan martiset proposes a party of nothingness that rejects the positions of both the party of science and the party of freedom after this we see street fighting atrocities the infliction of punishment on harmless people by men wearing gruads eyeandtriangle badge the party of freedom proclaims its own symbol a golden apple the fighting spreads the numbers of the dead mount and ingel rild weeps he and his associates decide on a desperate expedient unleashing the lloigor yog sothoth they will offer this unnatural souleating energy being from another universe its freedom in return for its help in destroying gruads movement yog sothoth is imprisoned in the great pentagon of atlantis on a desolate moor in the southern part of the continent the atlantean electric plane bearing ingel rild ton lit and another scientist drifts trailing feathery sparks to a landing in a flat field overgrown with gray weeds within the pentagon an enormous black stone structure the ground is scorched and the air shimmers like a heat mirage flickers of static electricity run through the shimmering from time to time and an unpleasant noise like flies around a corpse pervades the whole moor the faces of the three atlantean sages register disgust sickness and terror they climb the nearest tower and talk to the guard suddenly yog sothoth takes control of ton lit speaking in an oily rich deep and reverberating voice and asks them what they seek of him ton lit lets out a terrible shriek and claps his hands over his ears froth slips from the side of his mouth his fur bristles and his penis stands erect his eyes are delirious and suffering like those of a dying gorilla the guard uses an electronic instrument that looks like a magicians wand topped with a fivepointed star to subdue yog sothoth ton lit bays like a hound and leaps for ingel rilds throat the electronic ray drives him back and he stands panting tongue hanging loose as the pentagon first and then the ground begin to soften into asymptotic curves yog sothoth chants langghhangghhangghfthagn langghhangghhangghhgual the blood is the life the blood is the life all faces bodies and perspectives are skewed and there is a greenish tinge on everything suddenly the guard strikes the nearest wall of the pentagon directly with his electronic wand and ton lit shrieks human intelligence coming back into his eyes together with great shame and revulsion the three sages flee the pentagon under a sky slowly turning back to its normal shape and color the laughter of yog sothoth follows them they decide that they cannot release the lloigor meanwhile gruad has called his closest followers known as the unbroken circle of gruad to announce that kajeci has conceived then he shows them a group of manlike creatures with green scaly skin wearing long black cloaks and black skullcaps with scarlet plumes these he calls his ophidians since atlanteans have a kind of instinctive check on themselves that prevents them from killing except in blind fury gruad has developed these synthetic humanoids from the serpent which he has found to be the most intelligent of all reptiles they will have no hesitation about destroying men and will act only on gruads command some of his followers protest and gruad explains that this is not really killing he says atlanteans who will not accept the teachings of the party of science are swinish beings they are a sort of robot who has no inner spiritual substance to control it our bodies however are deceived into feeling as if they are our own kind and we cannot raise our hands against them now however the light of science has given us hands to raise at this meeting gruad also addresses his men for the first time as the illuminated ones at the next meeting of the party of freedom the ophidians attack using iron bars to club people to death and slashing throats with their fangs then the party of freedom holds a funeral for a dozen of its dead at which ingel rild gives an oration describing the ways in which the struggle between gruads followers and the other atlanteans is changing the character of all human beings hitherto atlanteans have enjoyed knowledge but not worried over the fact that there is much that we do not know we are conservative and indifferent to new ideas we have no inner conflicts and we feel like doing the things that seem wise to us we think that the things we feel like doing will usually work out for the best we consider pain and pleasure a single phenomenon which we call sensation and we respond to unavoidable pain by relaxing or becoming ecstatic we do not fear death we can read each others minds because we are in touch with all the energies of our bodies the followers of gruad have lost that ability and they are thankful that they have the scientists dote on new things and new ideas this love of the new thing is a matter of genetic manipulation gruad is even encouraging people in their twenties to have children though it is our custom never to have children before we reach a hundred the generations of gruads followers come thick and fast and they are not like us they agonize over their ignorance they are full of uncertainty and inner conflict between what they should do and what they feel like doing the children who are brought up on gruads teachings are even more disturbed and conflictfilled than their parents one doctor tells me that the attitudes and the way of life gruad is encouraging in his people is enough to shorten their life spans considerably and they are afraid of pain they are afraid of death and even as their lives grow shorter they desperately seek for some means of achieving immortality gruad tells a meeting of his unbroken circle that the tune has come to intensify the struggle if they cant rule the atlanteans they will destroy atlantis atlantis will be destroyed by light says gruad by the light of the sun gruad introduces the worship of the sun to his followers he reveals the existence of gods and goddesses they are all energy conscious energy says gruad this conscious and powerfully directed and focused pure energy i call spirit all motion is spirit all light is spirit all spirit is light under gruads direction the party of science builds a great pyramid thousands of feet high it is in two halves the upper half made of an indestructible ceramic substance and inscribed with a terrible staring eye floats five hundred feet above the base held in place by antigravity generators a band of men and women led by lilith velkor chief spokeswoman for the party of nothingness gathers at the base of the great pyramid and laughs at it they carry nothingarian signs dont clean our lenses gruad get the crack out of your own every time i hear the word progress my fur bristles the sun sucks freedom defined is freedom denied the message on this sign is a flat lie lilith velkor addresses the nothingarians satirizing all gruads beliefs claiming that the most powerful god is a crazy woman and she is the goddess of chaos to the accompaniment of laughter she declares gruad says the sun is the eye of the sun god thats more of his notion that males are superior and reason and order are superior actually the sun is a giant golden apple which is the plaything of the goddess of chaos and its the property of anyone she thinks is fair enough to deserve it suddenly a band of ophidians attacks followers of lilith velkor and kills several of them lilith velkor leads her people in an unprecedented attack on the ophidians they storm up the side of the great pyramid and throw the ophidians down to the street killing them amazingly they succeed in wiping out all the ophidians gruad declares that lilith velkor must die when the opportunity presents itself his men seize her and take her to a dungeon there an enormous wheel has been constructed with four spokes in the shape lilith velkor is crucified with ropes upside down on this device several members of the party of science lounge about watching her die gruad enters goes to the wheel and looks at the dying woman who says this is as good a day to die as any gruad remonstrates with her saying that death is a great evil and she should fear it she laughs and says all my life i have despised tradition and now i despise innovation also surely i must be a most wicked example for the world she dies laughing gruads rage is unbearable he vows that he will wait no longer atlantis is too wicked to save and he will destroy it on a windswept plain in the northern regions of atlantis a huge teardropshaped rocket with graceful fins is poised on the launching pad gruad is in the control room making lastminute adjustments while kajeci and wo topod argue with him gruad says the human race will survive it will survive the better purged of these atlanteans who are nothing but swine nothing but robots nothing but creatures who do not understand good and evil let them perish his finger strikes a red button and the rocket hurtles on its way to the sun it will take several days to reach there and meanwhile gruad has gathered the unbroken circle on an airship which takes them away from atlantis and into the huge mountains to the east in a region that will one day be called tibet gruad calculates that by the time the missile strikes the sun they will have been landed and underground for two hours the sun rides blinding yellow over the plains of atlantis it is a beautiful day in zukong gimorladsiragosa the sun shining down on its slender graceful towers with spider web bridges spiraling among them its parks its temples its museums its fine public buildings and magnificent private palaces its handsome richly furred people gracefully stride amidst the beauties of the first and finest civilization man has ever produced families lovers friends and enemies all unsuspecting what is about to happen enjoy their private moments a quintet plays the melodious zinthron balatet mordan swaz and fendrar over all however the great eye on the side of gruads pyramid glares horrid and red suddenly the suns body rages coiled flames balls of gas roll out the sun looks like a giant fiery arachnid or octopus one great flame comes rolling toward the earth burning red gas which turns yellow then green then blue then white there is nothing left of zukong gimorladsiragosa except the pyramid with its upper segment now resting on the base the antigravity generators having been destroyed the baleful eye looks out over an absolutely flat burntblack plain the ground shakes great cracks open the blackened area is a great circle hundreds of miles in diameter beyond which is a dark brown and still desolate wasteland thousands of cracks appear in the brittle surface of the continent the strength of whose rocks has been destroyed by the incredible heat of the solar flare a tide of mud starts crawling over the empty plain it leaves only the top of the pyramid with the great eye showing water sweeps over the mud at first sinking in and standing in pools then rising higher so that only the tip of the pyramid sticks out of a great lake under the water enormous parallel fissures open in the ground on either side of the blackened central circle the midsection of the continent including the pyramid begins to sink the pyramid falls into the depths of the ocean with cliffs rising on either side of it to the parts of atlantis that still remain above the ocean they will remain for many thousands of years more and they will be the atlantis remembered in the legends of men but the true atlantis high atlantis is gone gruad stares into his crimsonglowing viewplate watching the destruction of atlantis the light changes color from red to gray and the face of gruad turns gray it is a terrible face it has aged a hundred years in the last few minutes gruad may claim to be in the right but deep down he knows that what he has done isnt nice and yet deep down there is satisfaction too for gruad long tortured by unreasonable guilt now has something he can really feel guilty about he turns to the unbroken circle and proposes since it appears that the earth will survive the cataclysm he was not really sure that it would that they plan for the future most of them however are still in shock wo topod inconsolable stabs himself to death the first recorded time that a member of the human race has deliberately killed himself gruad calls upon his followers to destroy all remains of the atlantean civilization and then later to build a perfect civilization when even the ruins of atlantis have been forgotten the great beasts that inhabited europe asia and north america die off as a result of mutations and diseases caused by the solar flare all relics of the atlantean civilization are destroyed the people who were gruads erstwhile countrymen are either killed or driven forth to wander the earth besides gruads himalayan colony there is one other remnant of the high atlantean era the pyramid of the eye whose ceramic substance resisted solar flare earthquake tidal wave and submersion in the depths of the ocean gruad explains that it is right that the eye should remain it is the eye of god the one the scientifictechnical eye of ordered knowledge that looks down on the universe and by perceiving it causes it to be if an event is not witnessed it does not happen therefore for the universe to happen there must be a witness among the primitive hunters and gatherers a mutation has appeared that seems to be spreading rapidly more and more people are being born without fur and with hair in the same pattern as gruads the hour of gods eye has caused mutations in every species from the himalayas the rocket ships of the unbroken circle painted red and white swoop out in squadrons they sweep across europe and land on the brown islands where atlantis used to be there they land and raid a city of refugees from the atlantean disaster they kill many of the leaders and intellectuals and herd the rest aboard the ships fly to the americas and deposit the helpless people on a vast plain far below their route of passage lies the pyramid of the eye at the bottom of the atlantic the base of the pyramid is covered with silt and the break where the upper part of the pyramid had floated on antigravity projectors is also covered still the pyramid itself towers over the mud around it taller by three times than the great pyramid of egypt the building of which lies twentyseven thousand years in the future a vast shadow descends upon the pyramid there is a suggestion in the darkness of the ocean bottom of giant tentacles of sucker disks wide as the rims of volcanos of an eye as big as the sun looking at the eye on the pyramid something touches the pyramid and enormous as it is it moves slightly then the presence is gone the pentagonal trap in which the people of atlantis had heroically and brilliantly caught the dread ancient being yog sothoth has been amazingly undamaged by the catastrophe being on the southern plain which was relatively uninhabited the pentagon of yog sothoth becomes the center of a migration of people who survived the disaster emergency cities are set up those dying of radiation sickness are treated a second atlantis begins to take root and then from the himalayas the ships of the unbroken circle come swooping down on one of their raids lines of atlantean men and women are marched to the walls of the pentagon and there mowed down by laser fire then explosive charges are placed amid the heaps of bodies and the masked uniformed men of the unbroken circle withdraw there is a series of explosions horrid yellow smoke goes coiling up the gray stone walls crumble there is a moment of stillness balance tension then the piledup boulders of one side of the wall fly apart as if thrust by the hand of a giant an enormous claw print appears in the soft soil around the ruins of the pentagon the masked men of the unbroken circle race frantically for their ships and take off the ships dart into the sky stop suddenly waver and plummet like stones to explosive crashes on the earth the surviving refugees scream and scatter like a scythe going through wheat death sweeps among them in great arcs as they run in massed mobs mouths open in soundless screams they fall only a handful escapes over the scene a colossal reddish figure of indeterminate shape and number of limbs stands triumphant in the himalayas gruad and the unbroken circle watch the destruction of the pentagon and the massacre of the atlanteans the unbroken circle cheers but gruad strangely weeps you think i hate walls he says i love walls i love any kind of wall anything that separates walls protect good people walls lock away the evil there must always be walls and the love of walls and in the destruction of the great pentagon that held yog sothoth i read the destruction of all that i stand for therefore i am stricken with regret at this the face of evoe a young priest takes on a reddish glow and a demoniac look there is more than a hint of possession it is good to hear you say that he says to gruad no man yet has befriended me though many have tried to use me i have prepared a special place for your soul oh first of the men of the future gruad attempts to speak to yog sothoth but the possession has apparently passed and the other members of the unbroken circle praise a new beverage that evoe has prepared made of the fermented juice of grapes at dinner later that day gruad tries the new beverage and praises it saying this juice of grapes relaxes me and does not cause the disturbing visions and sounds that makes the herb the atlanteans used to smoke so unpleasant for a man of conscience evoe gives him more to drink from a fresh jar and gruad takes it before drinking he says any culture that arises in the next twenty thousand years or so is going to have the rot of atlantis in it therefore i decree a noncultural time of eight hundred generations after that we may allow man free reign on his propensity for building civilizations the culture he builds will be under our guidance with our ideas implicit in its every aspect with our control at every stage eight hundred generations from now the new human culture will be planted it will follow the natural law it will have the knowledge of good and evil the light that comes from the sun the sun that blasphemers say is only an apple it is no apple i tell you though it is a fruit even as this beverage of evoes that i now quaff is from a fruit from the grape comes this drink and from the sun comes the knowledge of good and evil the separation of light and darkness over the whole earth not an apple but the fruit of knowledge gruad drinks he puts down his glass clutches his throat and staggers back his other hand goes to his heart he topples over and lies on his back his eyes staring upward naturally everyone accuses evoe of poisoning gruad but evoe calmly answers that it was lilith velkor who did it he was doing research on the energies of the dead and had learned how to take them into him but sometimes the energies of the dead could take control of him so that he would be just a medium through which they act he cries when you write this tragedy into the archives you must say not that evoe the man did it but evoelilith possessed by the evil spirit of a woman the woman did tempt me i tell you i was helpless the unbroken circle is persuaded and agree that since lilith velkor and the crazy goddess she worshipped were responsible for gruads death henceforward women must be subordinate to men so such evils will not be repeated they decide to build a tomb for gruad and to inscribe upon it the first illuminated one never trust a woman they decide that since the lloigor is loose they will offer sacrifices to it and the sacrifices will be pure young women who have never lain with a man evoe seems to be taking control of the group and gao twone protests this to prove his dedication to the true and the good evoe declares he has had his penis amputated as a sacrifice to the allseeing eye he pulls open his robe all look at his truncated crotch and immediately retch evoe goes on furthermore it is decreed by the eye and natural law that all male children who would be close to goodness and truth must imitate my sacrifice at least to the extent of losing the foreskin or being cut enough to bleed kajeci comes in at this point and they plan a great funeral agreeing that they will not burn gruad as was the atlantean custom signifying that one is dead forever but will preserve his body symbolizing the hope that he is not really dead but will rise again there follow several thousand years of warfare between the remnants of the atlanteans and the inhabitants of agharti the stronghold of the scientists who now call themselves variously the knowledgeable or the enlightened ones the last remnants of the atlantean culture are destroyed great cities were built then destroyed by nuclear explosions all the inhabitants of the city of peos are killed in one night by the eater of souls chunks of the continent break off and sink into the sea there are earthquakes and tidal waves finally only outcroppings like the coneshaped island of fernando poo rise alone from the sea where atlantis had been about bc a new culture is planted on a hillside near the headwaters of the euphrates and it starts to spread a tribe of cromagnons magnificently tall strong largeheaded people is marched at gunpoint down from the snows of europe to the fertile lands of the middle east they are taken to the site chosen for the first agricultural settlement and shown how to plant crops for several years they do so while the unbroken circles men guard them with flame throwers their generations pass rapidly and once the new way of life has taken hold the illuminated ones leave them alone the tribe divides into kings priests scribes warriors and farmers a city surrounded by farms rises up the kings and priests are soft weak and fat the peasants are stunted and dulled by malnutrition the warriors are big and strong but brutal and unintelligent the scribes are intelligent but thin and bloodless now the city makes war on neighboring tribes of barbarians being well organized and technologically superior the people of the city win they enslave the barbarians and plant other cities nearby then a great tribe of barbarians comes down from the north and conquers the civilized people and burns their city this is not the end of the new civilization though it only revitalizes it soon the conquerors have learned to play the roles of kings priests and warriors and now there is a kind of nation consisting of several cities with a large body of armed who must be kept occupied marching robotlike in great square formations they set out over the plain to find new peoples to conquer the sun shines down on the civilization created by the illuminati and below the sea the eye on the pyramid glares balefully upward the end lights flashed on suddenly the screen rolled up into its receptacle with a snap blinded joe rubbed his eyes he had a ferocious headache he also had a ferocious need to urinate at once before his bladder exploded hed had an awful lot of drinks at the plastic martini party then made love to that chinese girl in the cab then sat down to watch this movie without once taking time out to go to the bathroom the pain in his groin was excruciating he imagined it felt something like what evoe that fellow in the movie had experienced after he castrated himself where the hell is the john said joe loudly there was no one in the room while he was absorbed in the movie they doubtless having seen it before had crept away softly leaving him alone to watch the death of atlantis christs sake he muttered gotta take a leak if i dont find the bathroom right away ill pee in my pants then he noticed a wastepaper can tinder the table it was walnut with a metal lining he bent over and picked it up sending new tremors of anguish through a body on the verge of bursting he decided to use it as a receptacle set it down again unzipped his fly took out his dick and let go into the can what if they all came trooping back into the room now he thought well he would be embarrassed but what the hell it was their fault for springing this movie on him without giving him a chance to make himself comfortable joe looked somberly down into the foam piss on atlantis he muttered who the hell were those people hed seen tonight simon and padre and big john had never told him about a group like this nor had they ever said anything about atlantis but there was the clear implication if this movie was to be believed that the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria might better be called the ancient illuminated seers of atlantis and that the word ancient meant a lot older than it was clearly time to leave this place he could try searching the offices but he doubted whether hed find anything and anyway he was much too tired and hung over not only from the alcohol hed drunk but also from the strange drug the oriental girl had given him before the movie still it had been a very nice drug it had been joes habit since when he wasnt too busy and didnt have to get up early in the morning to get stoned and watch late movies on television he found this so enjoyable a pastime that hed lost two girlfriends to it theyd both wanted to go to bed when he was just settling down in front of the tube laughing himself silly at the incredibly clever witticisms marveling at the profundity of the philosophical aphorisms tossed off by the characters such as johnnys line in bitter rice i work all week and then on sundays i watch other people ride the merrygoroundwhat a world of pathos had been expressed in that simple summation of a mans life or appreciating as one wordsmith does another the complex subtlety of the commercials and the secret links between them and the movies into which they were inserted like the slogan you can take the salem out of the country but you cant take the country out of salem in the middle of the wolf man all of this capacity for appreciating movies had been raised to a new high with the drug mao tsuhsi had given him and added to this it was a fullcolor movie on a large screen uninterrupted by commercials or come to think of it by fnords and commercials no matter how trickily interwoven with the plot of the movie did tend to seem like interruptions even to one who was stoned enough to know better it had been a great movie the best movie of his life he would never forget it joe tried the knob of the boardroom door and it opened at once he stopped considering whether he should take out his pocket knife and carve malik was here or some obscenity into the beautiful wood of the table that would he felt in an obscure way let them know that he knew where they were at but it would be a shame to spoil the wood and besides he was dreadfully tired he walked through darkened outer corridors staggered down the stairs and let himself out into the street looking toward the east river he thought he could see light in the sky over queens was the sun coming up had he been there that long a cab cruised by with its light on joe hailed it sinking into the back seat as he gave the driver his home address he noticed that the mans name on his hack license was albert feather well heres that ladder now come on lets climb the first rung is yours the rest are mine funny thought lieutenant otto waterhouse of the states attorneys police every time things get hairy that damn song starts going through my head i must be an obsessivecompulsive neurotic hed first heard the song to be a man by len chandler at the home of a chick he was balling back in it expressed pretty well for him his condition as a member of the tribe the tribe that was how he thought of black people hed heard a jew refer to the jews that way and he liked it better than that soul brother shit deep down he hated other blacks and he hated being black you had to climb that was the thing you had to climb each man alone when otto waterhouse was eight years old a gang of black kids on the south side had beaten him knifed him and thrown him into lake michigan to drown otto didnt know how to swim but somehow hed pulled himself along the concrete pilings clinging to rusty steel where there was nothing to cling to his blood seeping out into the water and hed stayed there hidden till the gang went away then he pulled himself along to a ladder climbed up and dragged himself onto the concrete pier he lay there almost dead wondering if the gang would come back and finish him someone did come along a cop the cop nudged ottos body with his toe rolled it over and looked down otto looked up at the irish face round pignosed and blueeyed oh shit said the cop and walked on somehow otto lived till morning when a woman came along and found him and called an ambulance years later it seemed logical enough to him to join the police force he knew the members of the gang that nearly killed him he didnt bother with them until after he got on the force then he found cause to kill each of the gang members several of whom had by then become respectable citizens one by one most of them didnt know who he was or why he was killing them the number he killed made his reputation in the chicago police department he was a nigger cop who could be trusted to deal with niggers otto never did know who the cop was whod left him to die he remembered the face more or less but they all looked alike to him he had another oddly vivid memory of a fall day in when hed been walking through pioneer court and had hassled a dude who was giving out free samples of of all things tomato juice otto took a ten from the dude and drank some tomato juice the guy had a crew haircut and wore hornrimmed glasses he didnt seem to mind having to pay a bribe and he looked at otto with an odd gleam in his eye as the tomato juice went down for a moment otto thought the tomato juice might be poisoned there were cop haters everywhere many people seemed to have sworn to kill the pigs as they called them but dozens of people had already drunk the juice and gone away happy otto shrugged and walked off thinking back over the strange changes that had come over him otto always traced them back to that moment there had been something in the juice it wasnt till stella maris told him about aum that he realized how hed been had and by then it was too late he was a threeway loser working for the syndicate the illuminati and discordian movement the only way out was down down into the chaos with stella pointing the way just tell me one thing baby he said to her one afternoon as they lay naked together in his apartment in hyde park why did they pick you to contact me because you hate niggers said stella calmly running her finger down his dick you hate niggers worse than any white man does thats why the way to freedom for you lies through me and what about you he said angrily pulling away from her and sitting up in bed i suppose you cant tell the difference between black and white black meat and white meat its all the same to you aint it you goddamned whore youd like to think so said stella youd like to think only a nigger whore would lay you a whore whod lay anybody regardless of race but you know you are wrong you know that otto waterhouse the black man who is better than all black men because he hates all black men is a lie its you who cant tell the difference between black and white and thinks the black man should be where the white man is and hates the black man because he isnt white no i see color but i see everything else about a person too baby and i know that nobody is where they should be and everybody should be where they are oh fuck your goddam philosophy said waterhouse come here but he learned he thought hed learned everything stella and hagbard and the rest of them had to teach him and that was a lot piled on top of all that illuminati garbage but now theyd thrown him a total curve he was to kill the message came as all the messages did from stella hagbard said to do this yes and i suppose if i go along with this ill be told why later on or ill figure it out for myself goddam stella this is asking a lot you know i know hagbard told me you have to do this for two reasons first for the honor of the discordians so that they will have respect he sounds like a wop for once but hes right i understand that second he said because otto waterhouse must kill a white man what otto started to tremble in the phone booth he picked nervously without reading it at a sticker that said this phone booth reserved for clark kent otto waterhouse must kill a white man he said youd know what that meant ottos hand was still shaking when he hung up oh damn he said he was almost crying so now on april he stood at a green metal door marked it was the service entrance to a condominium apartment at lake shore drive behind him stood a dozen states attorneys police all of them like himself were wearing body armor and babyblue helmets with transparent plastic visors two were carrying submachine guns all right said waterhouse glancing at his watch it had amused flanagan to set the time for the raid at am it was remember shoot everything that moves he kept his back to the men so they would not see the damned tears that insisted on welling up in his eyes right on lieutenant said sergeant obanion satirically sergeant obanion hated blacks but worse than that he hated filthy liceridden longhaired homosexual communistinspired morituri bomb manufacturers he believed that there was a whole disgusting nest of them sleeping together dirty naked bodies entwined like a can full of worms just on the other side of that green metal door he could see them he licked his lips he was going to clean them out he hefted the machine gun okay said waterhouse it was shielding himself with one gloved hand he pointed his at the lock on the door the instructions given orally by flanagan at the briefing were that they would not show a warrant or even knock before entering the apartment was said to be full of enough dynamite to wipe out the entire block of luxury highrise apartment houses presumably the kids if they knew they were caught would set them off that way they could take a bunch of pigs with them preserve their reputation for suicidal bravery protect themselves from giving away any information use the explosives and avoid having to live with the shaming knowledge that theyd been dumb enough to get caught obanion was imagining finding a white girl in the arms of a black boy and finishing them off with one burst from his machine gun his cock swelled in his pants waterhouse fired in the next instant he threw his weight against the door and smashed it open he was in a hallway next to the kitchen he walked into the apartment his shoes rang on a bare tile floor tears ran down his cheeks my god my god why have you forsaken me he sobbed whos that a voice called waterhouse whose eyes had adjusted to the darkness looked across the empty living room into the foyer where milo a flanagan stood silhouetted in the light from the exterior hall waterhouse raised the heavy automatic in his hand to arms length sighted carefully took a deep breath and held it and squeezed the trigger the pistol blasted and kicked his hand and the black figure went toppling backwards into the startled arms of the men behind him a bat which had been sitting on a windowsill flew out the open window toward the lake only waterhouse saw it obanion came clumping into the room he took a bentkneed stance and fired a burst of six rounds in the direction of the front door hold it waterhouse snapped hold your fire somethings wrong something would really be wrong if the guys at the front door came through again shooting turn on the lights obanion waterhouse said theres somebody in here shooting were standing here talking obanion no one is shooting at us find a light switch theyre gonna set off the bombs obanions voice was shrill with fear with the lights on obanion well see them doing it maybe well even be able to stop them obanion ran to the wall and began slapping it with the palm of one hand while he kept his machine gun cradled in the free arm one of the other men who had followed obanion through the service entrance found the light switch the apartment was bare there was no furniture there were no rugs on the floor no curtains on the windows whoever had been living here had vanished the front door opened a crack before they could start shooting waterhouse yelled its all right its waterhouse in here theres nobody here he wasnt crying anymore it was done he had killed his first white man the door swung all the way open nobody there said the helmeted policeman who the hell shot flanagan flanagan said waterhouse flanagans dead they got him there isnt anybody here said obanion who had been looking through side rooms what the hell went wrong flanagan set this up personally now that the light was on waterhouse could see that someone had drawn a pentagram in chalk on the floor in the center of the pentagram was a gray envelope otto picked it up there was a circular green seal on the back with the word eris embossed on it otto opened it and read good going otto now proceed at once to ingolstadt bavaria the bastards are trying to immanentize the eschaton sm folding the note and shoving it into his pocket as he bolstered his pistol with his other hand otto waterhouse strode across the living room he barely glanced down at the body of milo a flanagan the bullet hole in the center of his forehead like a third eye hagbard had been right despite all the advance terror and sorrow once hed done it he didnt feel a thing i have met the enemy and he is mine he thought otto pushed past the men crowded around flanagans body everyone assumed he was going somewhere to make some sort of report no one had figured out who shot flanagan by the time obanion had puzzled it out otto was already in his car six hours later when they had set up blockades at the airports and railway terminals otto was in minneapolis international airport buying a ticket to montreal he had to fly back to chicago but he sat out the brief stopover at ohare international airport aboard the plane while his brother officers searched the terminals for him twelve hours later carrying a passport supplied by montreal discordians otto waterhouse was on his way to ingolstadt ingolstadt said fuckup hagbard had programmed the machine to converse in reasonably good english this week the largest rock festival in the history of mankind the largest temporary gathering of human beings ever assembled will take place near ingolstadt on the shore of lake totenkopf two million young people from all over the world are expected the american medical association will play did you know or suspect before this that the american medical association wolfgang werner wilhehn and winifred saure are four of the dluminati primi asked hagbard they were on a list but fourteenth in order of probability said fuckup perhaps some of the other groups i suspected are illuminati veri can you now state the nature of the crisis that we will face this week there was a pause there were three crises for this month plus several subcrises designed to bring the three major crises to a peak the first was fernando poo the world nearly went to war over the fernando poo coup but the illuminati had a countercoup in reserve and that resolved the problem satisfactorily heads of state are human and this feint has helped to make them jumpier and more irrational they are in no shape to react wisely to the next two jolts unless you wish me to continue discussing the character structures of the present heads of state which are important elements in the crises through which the world is passingi will proceed to the next crisis this is las vegas i still do not know exactly what is going on there but the sickness vibrations are still coming through strongly there is i have deduced from recently acquired information a bacteriological warfare research center located in the desert somewhere near las vegas one of my more mystical probes came up with the sentence the ace in the hole is poisoned candy but thats one of those things that we probably wont understand until we find out whats going on in las vegas by more conventional means ive already dispatched muldoon and goodman there said hagbard all right fuckup obviously the third crisis is ingolstadt whats going to happen at that rock festival they intend to use the illuminati science of strategic biomysticism lake totenkopf is one of europes famed bottomless lakes which means it has an outlet into the underground sea of valusia at the end of world war ii hitler had an entire ss division in reserve in bavaria he was planning to withdraw to obersalzburg and with this fanatically loyal division make a glorious last stand in the bavarian alps instead the illuminati convinced him that he still had a chance to win the war if he followed their instructions hitler himmler and bormann fed cyanide to all the troops killing several thousand of them then their bodies dressed in full field equipment were placed by divers on a huge underground plateau near where the sea of valusia surfaces as lake totenkopf their boots were weighted at the bottom so that they would stand at attention the airplanes tanks and artillery assigned to the division were also weighted and sunk along with the troops many of them by the way knew that there was cyanide in their last supper but they ate it anyway if the fuehrer thought it best to kill them that was good enough for them i cant imagine there would be much left of them after over thirty years said hagbard you are wrong as usual hagbard said fuckup the ss men were placed under a biomystical protective field the entire division is as good as it was the day it was placed there of course the illuminati had tricked hitler and himmler the real purpose of the mass sacrifice was to provide enough explosively released consciousness energy to make it possible to translate bormann to the immortal energy plane bormann one of the illuminati primi of his day was to be rewarded for his part in organizing world war ii the fifty million violent deaths of that war helped many illuminati to achieve transcendental illumination and were most pleasing to their elder brothers and allies the lloigor and what will happen at ingolstadt during the festival the american medical associations fifth number at woodstock europa will send out biomystical waves that will activate the nazi legions in the lake and send them marching up the shore they will be in their resurrection endowed with supernormal strength and energy making them almost impossible to kill and they will achieve even greater powers as a result of the burst of consciousness energy that will be released when they massacre the millions of young people on the shore then led by the saures they will turn against eastern europe the russians already made extremely nervous by the fernando poo incident will think an army is attacking them from the west their old fear that germany will once again with the help of the capitalist powers rise up and attack russia and slaughter russians for the third time in this century will become a reality they will find that conventional weapons will not stop the resurrected nazis they will believe they are up against some new kind of american superweapon that the americans have decided to launch a sneak attack the russians will then start bringing superweapons of their own into play then the illuminati will play their ace in the hole in las vegas whatever that is the voice of the computer coming from hagbards polynesian teakwood desk was suddenly silent what happens after that said hagbard leaning forward tensely george saw perspiration on his forehead it doesnt matter what happens after that said fuckup if the situation develops as i project the eschaton will have been immanentized for the illuminati that will mean the fulfillment of the project that has been their goal since the days of gruad a total victory they will all simultaneously achieve transcendental illumination for the human race on the other hand that will be extinction the end book four beamtenherrschaft well hoover performed he would have fought that was the point he would have defied a few people he would have scared them to death he has a file on everybody richard milhous nixon the eighth trip or hod telemachus sneezed there came unto the high chapperal one who had studied in the schools of the purple sage and of the hung mung tong and of the illuminati and of the many other schools and this one had found no peace yet yea of the discordians and the teachers of mummu and of the nazarene and of the buddha he had studied and he had found no peace yet and he spake to the high chapperal and said give me a sign that i may believe and the high chapperal said unto him leave my presence and seek ye the horizon and the sign shall come unto you and ye shall seek no more and the man turned and sought of the horizon but the high chapperal crept up behind him and raised his foot and did deliver a most puissant kick in the mans arse which smarted much and humiliated the seeker grievously he who has eyes let him read and understand the book of grandmotherly kindness the dishonest book of lies by mordecai malignatus kns the starry wisdom church was not s idea of a proper ecclesiastical shop by any means the architecture was a shade too gothic the designs on the stainedglass windows a bit unpleasantly suggestive for a holy atmosphere my god they must be bloody wogs he thought and when he opened the door the altar was lacking a proper crucifix in fact where the crucifix should have been he found instead a design that was more than suggestive it was in his opinion downright tasteless not high church at all chips decided he advanced cautiously although the building appeared deserted the pews seemed designed for bloody reptiles he observed a church of course should be uncomfortable that was good for the soul but this was well gross they probably advertise in the kink newspapers he reflected with distaste the first stainedglass window was worse from inside than outside he didnt know who saint toad was but if that mosaic with his name on it gave any idea of saint toads appearance and predilections then by god no selfrespecting christian congregation would ever think of sanctifying him the next feller a shoggoth was even less appetizing at least they had the common decency not to canonize him a rat scurried out from between two pews and ran across the center aisle right before chips feet fair got on ones nerves this place did chips approached the pulpit and glanced up at the bible that was at least one civilized touch curious as to what text might have been preached last in this den of wogs he scrambled up into the pulpit and scanned the open pages to his consternation it wasnt the bible at all a lot of bragging and bombast about some yog sothoth probably a wog god who was both the gate and the guardian of the gate absolute rubbish chips hefted the enormous volume and turned it so he could read the spine necronomicon eh if his university latin could be trusted that was something like the book of the names of the dead morbid like the whole building he approached the altar refusing to look at the abominable design above it rust now what could one say of brutes who let their altar get rusty he scraped with his thumbnail the altar was marble and marble doesnt rust a decidedly unpleasant suspicion crossed his mind and he tasted what his nail had lifted blood fairly fresh blood not high church at all chips approached the vestry and walked into a web damn he muttered hacking at it with his flashlight and something fell on his shoulder he brushed it off quickly and turned the light to the floor it started to run up his trouser leg and he brushed it off again beginning to breathe heavily and stepped on it hard there was a satisfactory snapping sound and he stomped again to be sure when he removed his shoe and turned the light down again it was dead a damned huge ugly brute of a spider black gods saint toads rats mysterious and heathenish capitalized gates that nastylooking shoggoth character and now spiders a buggering tarantula it looked like in fact next count dracula he thought grimly testing the vestry door it slid open smoothly and he stepped back out of visible range waiting a moment they were either not home or cool enough to allow him the next move he stepped through the door and flashed his light around oh god no he said no god no goodbye mr chips said saint toad did you ever take the underground from charing cross to one of the suburbs you know that long ride without stops when youre totally in the dark and everything seems to be rushing by outside in the opposite direction relativity the laboratorysmock people call it in fact it was even more like going up a chimney than going forward in a tunnel but it was like both at the same time if you follow me relativity a bitterlooking old man went by dressed in turnofthecentury yankee clothing muttering something about carcosa an antique pontiac car followed him with four italians in it looking confused it was slow enough for me to spot the year definitely and even to read the license plates rhode island aw then a black man not a negro or a wog but a really truly black man without a face and id hate to tell you what he had where the face should have been all the while there was this bleating or squealing that seemed to say tekelili tekelili another man englishlooking but in early thcentury clothing he looked my way surprised and said i only walked around the horses i could sympathize i only opened a bleeding door a giant beetle who looked at me more intelligently than any bug i ever saw before he seemed to be going in a different direction if there was direction in this place a whitehaired old man with startling blue eyes who shouted roderick usher as he flew by then a whole parade of pentagons and other mathematical shapes that seemed to be talking to each other hi some language of the past or the future or wherever they called home and by now it wasnt so much like a tunnel or even a chimney but a kind of roller coaster with dips and loops but not the sort you find in a place like brighton i think i saw this land of curve once on a blackboard when a class in noneuclidean geometry had used the room before my own class in eng lit pope to swinb and neoraph then i passed a shoggoth or it passed me and let me say that their pictures simply do not do them justice i am ready to go anywhere and confront any peril on hm service but i pray to the lord harry i never have to get that close to one of those chaps again next came a jerk or cusp is probably the word i recognized something ingolstadt the middle of the university then we were off again but not for long another cusp stonehenge a bunch of hooded people right out of a yank movie about the kkk were busy with some gruesome mummery right in the center of the stones yelling ferociously about some ruddy goat with a thousand young and the stars were all wrong overhead well you pick up your education where you can now i know even if i cant tell any bloody academic how i know that stonehenge is much older than we think whizz bang were off again and now ships are floating by everything from old yankee clippers to modern luxury liners all of them signaling the old sos semaphore desperately and a bunch of airplanes following in their wake i realized that part must be the bermuda triangle and about then it dawned that the turnofthecentury yank with the bitter face might be ambrose bierce i still hadnt the foggiest who all those other chaps were then along came a girl a dog a lion a tin man and a scarecrow a real puzzler that was i visiting real places or just places in peoples minds or was there a difference when the mock turtle the walrus the carpenter and another little girl came along my faith in the difference began to crumble or did some of those writer blokes know how to tap into this alternate world or fifth dimension or whatever it was the shoggoth came by again or was it his twin brother and shouted or i should say gibbered yog sothoth neblod zin and i could tell that was something perfectly filthy by the tone of his voice i mean after all i can take a queer proposition without butting the offender on the nose one must be cosmopolitan you know but i would vastly prefer to have such offers coming out of human mouths or at the very least out of mouths rather than orifices that shouldnt properly be talking at all but you would have to see a shoggoth yourself god forbid to appreciate what i mean the next stop was quite a refrigerator miles and miles of it and thats where the creature who kept up that howling of tekelili tekelili hung his hat or its hat i shant attempt to do him or it justice that necronomicon said about yog sothoth that kadath in the cold waste hath known him and now i realized that known was used there in the biblical sense i just hope he or it stays in the cold waste you wouldnt want to meet him or it on the strand at midday believe me his habits were even worse than his ancestry and why he couldnt scrape off some of the seaweed and barnacles is beyond me he was rather like saint toad in his notions of sartorial splendor and table etiquette if you take my meaning but i was off again the curvature was getting sharper and the cusps more frequent there was no mistaking the heads where i arrived next easter island i had a moment to reflect on how those heads resembled tlaloc and the lloigor of fernando poo and then this kinks version of a cooks tour moved on and there i was at the last stop damn blast and thunder i said looking at manolete turning his veronica and concepcion lying there with her poor throat cut now that absolutely does tear it i decided not to toddle over to the starry wisdom church this tune around there is a limit after all instead i went out into tequila y mota street and approached the church but kept my distance trying to figure where bugger kept the time machine while i was reflecting on that i heard the first pistol shot then a volley the next thing i knew the whole population of fernando poo cubans descended from the prisoners shipped there when it was a penal colony in the th century spaniards from colonial days blacks wogs and whatnot were on tequila y mota street using up all the munitions they owned it was the countercoup of course the captain puta crowd who unseated tequila y mota and prevented the nuclear war but i didnt know that at the time so i dashed into the nearest doorway and tried to duck the flying bullets which were coming mind you as thick as the darling buds in may it was hairy and one spanish bloke gay as a tree full of parrots from his trot and his carriage goes by waving an old cutlass out of a book and shouting better to die on our feet than to live on our knees headed straightway into a group of regular army who had finally turned out to try to stop this business he waded right into them cutting heads like a pirate until they shot him as full of holes as aunties drawers thats your spaniards even the queers have balls well this wasnt my show so i backed up opened the door and stepped into the building i just had a moment to recognize which building i had picked when saint toad gave me his bilious eye and said you again the trip was less interesting this time i had seen it before after all and i had time to think a bit and realize that old frogface wasnt using a time machine or any mechanical device at all then i was in front of a pyramid they missed that stop last time and i waited to arrive back in the hotel durrutti to my surprise when there was a final jerk in the dimensions or whatever they were i found myself someplace else in fact was in an enormous marbled room deliberately designed to impress the bejesus out of any and all visitors pillars reached up to cyclopean heights supporting a ceiling too high and murky to be visible and every wall of which there seemed to be five was the same impenetrable ivorygrained marble the eyes instinctively sought the gigantic throne in the shape of an apple with a seat carved out of it and made of a flawless gold which gleamed the more brightly in the dim lighting and the old man who sat on the throne his white beard reaching almost to the lap of his much whiter robe commanded attention when he spoke if i may be trite he said in a resonant voice you are welcome my son this still wasnt high church but it was a definite improvement over the digs where saint toad and his loathsome objets dart festered still s british common sense was disturbed i say he ventured youre not some sort of mystic are you i must tell you that i dont intend to convert to anything heathen conversion as you understand it the aged figure told him placidly consists of pounding ones own words into a mans ears until they start coming out of his mouth nothing is of less interest to me you need have no fear on that ground i see pondered this wouldnt be shangrila or some such place would it this is dallas texas my son the old mans eyes bore a slight twinkle although his demeanor otherwise remained grave we are below the sewers of dealy plaza and i am the dealy lama shook his head i dont mind having my leg pulled he began i am the dealy lama the old man repeated and this is the headquarters of the erisian liberation front a jokes a joke chips said but how did you manage that frogfaced creature back in the starry wisdom church tsathoggua he is not managed by us we saved you from him in fact twice tsathoggua chips repeated i thought the swines name was saint toad to be sure that is one of his names when he first appeared in hyperborea he was known as tsathoggua and that is how he is recorded in the pnakotic manuscripts the necronomicon and other classics the atlantean high priests klarkash ton and lhuv kerapht wrote the best descriptions of him but their works have not survived except in our own archives you do put on a good front said sincerely i suppose fairly soon youll get around to telling me that i have been brought here due to some karma or other he was actually wishing there were some place to sit down no doubt it added to the lamas dignity to sit while chips had to stand but it had been a hard night already and his feet hurt yes i have many revelations for you the old man said i was afraid of that isnt there some place where i can bring my arse to anchor as my uncle sid would say before i listen to your wisdom im sure its going to be a long time in the telling the old man ignored this this is the turning point in history he said all the forces of evil dispersed and often in conflict before have been brought together under one sign the eye in the pyramid all the forces of good have been gathered also under the sign of the apple i see nodded and you want to enlist me on the side of good not at all the old man cried bouncing up and down in his seat with laughter i want to invite you to stay here with us while the damned fools fight it out aboveground frowned that isnt a sporting attitude he said disapprovingly but then he grinned oh i almost fell for it didnt i you are pulling my leg i am telling you the truth the old man said vehemently how do you suppose i have lived to this advanced age by running off to join in every idiotic barroom brawl world war or armageddon that comes along let me remind you of the street where we picked you up it is entirely typical of the proceedings during the kali yuga those imbeciles are using live ammunition son do you want me to tell you the secret of longevity lad my secret i have lived so outrageously long because he spoke with deliberate emphasis i dont give a fuck for good and evil i should be ashamed to say so if i were you chips replied coolly if the whole world felt like you wed all be a sorry kettle of fish very well the old man started to raise an arm ill send you back to saint toad wait chips stirred uneasily couldnt you send me to confront evil in one of its ah more human forms aha the old man sneered you want the lesser evil is it those false choices are passing away even as we speak if you want to confront evil you will have to confront it on its own terms not in the form that suits your own mediocre concepts of a last judgment stay here with me lad evil is much more nasty than you imagine never chips said firmly ours not to reason why ours but to do or die any englishman would tell you the same no doubt the old man snickered your countrymen are as fatheaded as these texans above us glorifying that idiotic light brigade the way these bumpkins brag about their defeat at the alamo as if stepping in front of a steamroller were the most admirable thing a man could do with his time let me tell you a story son you may if you wish said stiffly but no cynical parable will change my sense of right and duty actually youre glad of the interlude youre not all that eager to face the powers of tsathoggua again let that pass the old man shifted to a more comfortable position and still oblivious of chips tired shifting from leg to leg began this is the story of our lady of discord eris daughter of chaos mother of fortuna you have read some of it in bullfinch no doubt but his is the exoteric version i am about to give you the inside story is the thought of a unicorn a real thought in a sense that is the basic question of philosophy i thought you were going to tell me a story not launch into some dreary german metaphysics i had enough of that at the university quite so the thought of a unicorn is a real thought then to be brief so is the thought of the redeemer on the cross the cow who jumped over the moon the lost continent of mu the gross national product the square root of minus one and anything else capable of mobilizing emotional energy and so in a sense eris and the other olympians were and are real at the same time in another sense there is only one true god and your redeemer in his only begotten son and the lloigor like tsathoggua are real enough to reach out and draw you into their world which is on the other side of nightmare but i promised to keep the philosophy to a minimum you recall the story of the golden apple in the exoteric and expurgated version at least the true version is the same up to a point zeus a terrible old bore by the way did throw a bash on olympus and he did slight our lady by not inviting her she did make an apple but it was acapulco gold not metallic gold she wrote kallisti on it to the prettiest one and rolled it into the banquet hall everybody not just the goddesses thats a male chauvinist myth started fighting over who had the right to smoke it paris was never called in to pass judgment thats all some poets fancy the trojan war was just another imperialistic rumble and had no connection with these events at all what really happened was that everybody was squabbling over the apple and working up a sweat and pushing one another around and pretty soon their vibrations gods have very high vibration exactly at the speed of light in fact heated up the apple enough to unleash some heavy fumes in a word the olympians all got stoned and they saw a vision or a series of visions in the first vision they saw yahweh a neighboring god with a world of his own which overlapped theirs in some places he was clearing the set to change its valence and start a new show his method struck them as rather barbarous he was in fact drowning everybody except one family that he allowed to escape in an ark this is chaos said hermes that yahweh is a mean mother even for a god and they looked at the vision more closely and because they could see into the future and were all like every intelligent entity rabid laurel and hardy fans and because they were zonked on the weed they saw that yahweh bore the face of oliver hardy all around him below the mountain on which he lived his world was fiat the waters rose and rose they saw drowning men drowning women innocent babes sinking beneath the waves they were ready to vomit and then another came and stood beside yahweh looking at the panorama of horrors below and he was yahwehs adversary and stoned as they were he looked like stanley laurel to them and then yahweh spoke in the eternal words of oliver hardy now look what you made me do he said and that was the first vision they looked again and they saw lee harvey oswald perched in the window of the texas school book depository and he again wore the face of stanley laurel and because this world had been created by a great god named earl warren oswald fired the only shots that day and john fitzgerald kennedy was as the salvation army charmingly expresses it promoted to glory this is confusion said athena with her owleyes flashing for she was more familiar with the world created by the god mark lane then they saw a hallway and oswaldlaurel was led out between two policemen suddenly jack ruby with the face of oliver hardy stepped forward and fired a pistol right into that frail little body and then ruby spoke the eternal words to the corpse at his feet now look what you made me do he said and that was the second vision next they saw a city of men women and children and in an instant the city vanished shadows remained where the men were gone a firestorm raged burning pimps and infants and an old statue of a happy buddha and mice and dogs and old men and lovers and a mushroom cloud arose above it all this was in a world created by the crudest of all gods realpolitik this is discord said apollo disturbed laying down his lute harry truman a servant of realpolitik wearing the face of oliver hardy looked upon his work and saw that it was good but beside him albert einstein a servant of that most elusive and gnomic of gods truth burst into tears the familiar tears of stanley laurel facing the consequences of his own karma for a brief instant truman was troubled but then he remembered the eternal words now look what you made me do he said and that was the third vision now they saw trains many trains all of them running on time and the trains crisscrossed europe and ran hours a day and they all came to a few destinations that were alike there the human cargo was stamped catalogued processed executed with gas tabulated recorded stamped again cremated and disposed this is bureaucracy said dionysus and he smashed his wine jug in anger beside him his lynx glared balefully and then they saw the man who had ordered this adolf hitler wearing still the mask of oliver hardy and he turned to a certain rich man baron rothschild wearing the mask of stanley laurel and they knew this was the world created by the god hegel and the angel thesis was meeting the demon antithesis then hitler spoke the eternal words now look what you made me do he said and that was the fourth vision they did then look further and lo high as they were they saw the founding of a great republic and proclamations hailing new gods named due process and equal rights for all and they saw many in high places in the republic form a separate cult and worship mammon and power and the republic became an empire and soon due process and equal rights for all were not worshipped and even mammon and power were given only lipservice for the true god of all was now the impotent what can i do and his dull brother what we did yesterday and his ugly and vicious sister get them before they get us this is aftermath said hera and her bosom shook with tears for the fate of the children of that nation and they saw many bombings many riots many rooftop snipers many molotov cocktails and they saw the capital city in ruins and the leader wearing the face of stanley laurel taken prisoner amid the rubble of his palace and they saw the chief of the revolutionaries look about at the rubble and the streets full of corpses and they heard him sigh and then he addressed the leader and he spoke the eternal words now look what you made me do he said and that was the fifth vision and now the olympians were coming down and they looked at each other in uncertainty and dismay zeus himself spoke first man he said that was heavy grass far fuckin out hermes agreed solemnly tree fuckin mendous added dionysus petting his lynx we were really fuckin into it hera summed up for all and they turned their eyes again on the golden apple and read the word our lady eris had written upon it that most multiordinal of all words kallisti and they knew that each god and goddess and each man and woman was in the privacy of the heart the prettiest one the fairest the most innocent the best and they repented themselves of not having invited our lady eris to their party and they summoned her forth and asked her why did you never tell us before that all categories are false and all good and evil a delusion of limited perspective and eris said as men and women are actors on a stage of our devising so are we actors on the stage devised by the five fates you had to believe in good and evil and pass judgments on your creatures the men and women below it was a curse the fates put upon you but now you have come to the great doubt and you are free the olympians thereupon lost interest in the godgame and soon were forgotten by humanity for she had shown them a great light and a great light destroys shadows and we are all gods and mortals nothing else but gliding shadows do you believe that no said fission chips very well the dealy lama said somberly begone back to the world of maya and fission chips whirled head over heels into a vortex of bleatings and squealings as tune and space were given another sharp tug and nearly a month later head over heels the midget is up and tottering across route as the rented ford brontosaurus shrieks to a stop and saul and barney are out the doors every cop instinct telling them that a man who runs from an accident is hiding something but john dillinger driving toward vegas from the north continues to hum goodbye forever old sweethearts and gals god bless you and the same tug in spacetime grips adam weishaupt two centuries earlier causing him to abandon his planned soft sell and blurt out to an astonished johann wolfgang von goethe spielen sie strip schnippschnapp and chips hearing weishaupts words is back in the graveyard at ingolstadt as four dark figures move away in dusk strip schnippschnapp goethe asks putting hand on chin in a pose that was later to become famous das ist dein hoch zauberwerk ja ja weishaupt says nervously der zweck heiligte die mittel ingolstadt always reminds me of the set of a bleeding frankenstein movie and after saint toad and that shoggoth chap and the old lama with his wog metaphysics it was no help at all to have an invisible voice ask me to join him in a bawdy card game ive faced some weird scenes in hm service but this fernando poo caper was turning out to be outright unwholesome in fact unheimlich as these krauts would say and hi the distance i began to hear wog music but with a yank beat to it and suddenly i knew the worst that blasted lama or saint toad or somebody had lifted nearly a month out of my life i had walked into saint toads after midnight on march call it april then and this would be april or may walpurgisnacht when all the kraut ghosts are out and i was probably considered dead back in london and if i called in and tried to explain what had happened old w would be downright psychiatric about the matter oh hed be sure i was well around the bend it was a rum go either way then i remembered that the old lama in dallas had said he was sending me to the final battle between good and evil this was probably it right here right now this night in ingolstadt a bit breathtaking to think of that i wondered when the angels of the lord would appear bloody soon i hoped it would be nice to have them around when old nick unleashed the shoggoth and saint toad and that lot so i toddled out into the streets of ingolstadt and started sniffing around for the old sulphur and brimstone and half a mile below and twelve hours earlier george dorn and stella maris were smoking some alamout black hash with harry coin you havent got a bad punch for an intellectual coin said with warm regard youre pretty good at rape yourself george replied for the worlds most incompetent assassin coin started to draw back his lips in an angry snarl but the hash was too strong hagbard told you ace he asked bashfully he told me most of it george said i know that everybody on this ship once worked for the illuminati directly or for one of their governments i know that hagbard has been an outlaw for more than two decades twentythree years exactly stella said archly that figures george nodded twentythree years then and never killed anybody until that incident with the spider ships four days ago oh he killed us harry said dreamily drawing on the pipe what he does is worse than capital punishment while its going on i cant say im the same man i was before but its pretty bad until you come through i know george grinned ive had a few samples myself hagbards system stella said is very simple he just gives you a good look at your own face in a mirror he lets you see the puppet strings its still up to you to break them hes never forced anyone to do anything that goes against their heart of course she frowned in concentration he does sort of maneuver you into places where you have to find out in a hurry just what your heart is saying to you did he ever tell you about the indians the shoshone george asked the cesspool gag lets play a game coin interrupted sinking lower in his chair as the hash hit him harder one of us in this room is a martian and weve got to guess from the conversation which one it is okay stella said easily not the shoshone she told george the mohawk youre not the martian coin giggled you stick to the subject and thats a human trait george trying to decide if the octopus on the wall was somehow connected with the martian riddle said i want to hear about hagbard and the mohawk maybe that will help us identify the martian you think up good games he added kindly for a guy who was sent on seven assassination missions and fucked up every one of them im dumb but im lucky coin said there was always somebody else there blasting away at the same time politicians are awfully unpopular these days ace this was a myth hagbard had confided to george until harry coin had completed his course in the celine system it was better if he believed himself the worlds most unsuccessful assassin rather than face the truth that he had goofed only on his first job dallas november and really had killed five men since then of course even if hagbard wasnt a holy man any longer he was still tricky maybe harry had indeed missed every time perhaps hagbard was keeping the image of harry as mass murderer in georges mind to see if george could relate to the mans present instead of being hung up on his past at least ive learned this much george thought the word past is always in quotes for me now the mohawk stella said leaning back lazily georges male organ or penis or dick or whatever the hell is the natural word if there is a natural word well my cock then my delicious everhungry cock rose a centimeter as her blouse tightened on her breasts lord god wed been humping like wart hogs in rutting season for hours and hours and hours and i was still horny and still in love with her and i probably always would be but then again maybe im the martian well in fact the old pussy hunter didnt rise more than a millimeter not a centimeter and he was as slow as an old man getting out of bed in january i had just about fucked until my brains came out my ears even before harry brought in the hash and wanted to talk looking for the martian looking for the governor of dorn looking for the illuminati krishna chasing his tail around the curved space of the einsteinian universe until he disappears up his own ass leaving behind a behind the back of the void the dorn theory of circutheosodomognosis owned some land she continued that beautiful black face like ebon melody yes no painter could show but bach could hint the delight of those purpletinted lips in that black face saying and the government wanted to steal the land to build a dam the inside of her cunt had that purple hue to it also and there was a tawny beige in her palm like a caucasians skin there were so many delights in her body and in mine too treasures that couldnt be spent in a million years of the most tender and violent fucking hagbard was the engineer hired to build the dam but when he found out that the indians would be dispossessed and relocated on less fertile ground he refused the job eris eros spelled sideways he broke his contract so the government sued him she said thats how he got to be a close friend with the mohawk which was all pure crapperoo obviously hagbard had gone to court as a lawyer for the indians but that one touch of shame in him had kept him from admitting to stella that he had once been a lawyer so he made up that bit about being the engineer on the dam to explain how he got involved in the case he helped them move when they were dispossessed i could see bronze men and women moving in twilight a hill in the background this was a long time ago back in the s i think hagbard was a hell of a lot older than he looked one indian was carrying a raccoon he said was his grandfather he was a very old man himself he said grandfather could remember general washington and how he changed after he became president he would be there tonight that being who had once been george washington and adam weishaupt he of whom hitler had said he is already among us he is intrepid and terrible i am afraid of him hagbard says he kept thinking of patrick henry the one man who saw what had happened at the constitutional convention it was henry who had looked at the constitution and said right away i smell a rat it squints toward monarchy the old indian whose name was uncle john feather said that grandfather when he was a man could speak to all animals he said the mohawk nation was more than the living it was the soul and the soil joined together when the land was taken some of the soul died he said that was why he couldnt speak to all animals but only to those who had once been part of his family the soul is in the blood moving the blood it is in the night especially nutley is a typical catholicdominated new jersey town and the dorns are baptists so i was hemmed in two ways but even as a boy i used to walk along the passaic looking for indian arrowheads and the soul would move when i found one who was the anthropologist who thought the ojibway believed all rocks were alive a chief had straightened him out open your eyes he said and youll see which rocks are alive we havent had our frobenius yet american anthropology is like virgins writing about sex i know who the martian is coin crooned in a singsong but im not telling not yet that man who was either the most successful or the most unsuccessful assassin of the th century and who had raped me which was supposed to destroy my manhood forever according to some idiots was smashed out of his skull and he looked so happy that i was happy for him hagbard stella went on stood there like a tree he was paralyzed finally old uncle john feather asked what was the matter stella leaned forward her face more richly black against the golden octopus on the wall hagbard had foreseen the ecological catastrophe he had seen the rise of the welfare state warrior liberalism as he calls it and the spread of marxism out of russia across the world he saw why it all had to happen with or without the illuminati helping it along he understood the snafu principle he had worked all that night after explaining to uncle john feather that he was troubled in his heart at the tragedy of the mohawk not mentioning the more enormous tragedy coming at the planet the tragedy which the old man understood already in his own terms hard work carrying pitiful cheap furniture from cabins onto trucks tying whole households possessions with tough ropes he was sweating and winded when they finished shortly before dawn the next day he had burned his naturalization papers and put the ashes in an envelope addressed to the president of the united states with a brief note everything relevant is ruled irrelevant everything material is ruled immaterial an excitizen the ashes of his army reserve discharge went to the secretary of defense with a briefer note non serviam an exslave that years income tax form went to the secretary of the treasury after he wiped his ass on it the note said try robbing a poor box der einziege his fury still mounting he grabbed his copy of das kapital off the bookshelf smiling bitterly at the memory of his sarcastic marginal notes scrawled without private property there is no private life on the flyleaf and mailed it to josef stalin in the kremlin then he buzzed his secretary gave her three months pay in lieu of notice of dismissal and walked out of his law office forever he had declared war on all governments of the world his afternoon was spent giving away his savings which at that time amounted to seventy thousand dollars some he gave to drunks on the street some to little boys or little girls in parks when the stock exchange closed he was on wall street handing out fat bundles of bills to the wealthiestlooking men he could spot telling them enjoy it before you die it wont be worth shit that night he slept on a bench hi grand central terminal in the morning flat broke he signed on as abs aboard a merchant ship to norway that summer he tramped across europe working as tourist guide cook tutor any odd job that fell his way but mostly talking and listening about politics he heard that the marshall plan was a sneaky way of robbing europe under the pretense of helping it that stalin would have more trouble with tito than he had had with trotsky that the viet minh would surrender soon and the french would retake indochina that nobody in germany was a nazi anymore that everybody in germany was still a nazi that dewey would unseat truman easily during his last walking tour of europe in the s he had heard that hitler only wanted czechoslovakia and would do anything to avoid war with england that stalins troubles with trotsky would never end that all europe would go socialist after the next war that america would certainly enter the war when it came that america would certainly stay out of the war when it came one idea had remained fairly constant however and he heard it everywhere that idea was that more government tougher government more honest government was the answer to all human problems hagbard began making notes for the treatise that later became never whistle while youre pissing he began with a section that he later moved to the middle of the book it is now theoretically possible to link the human nervous system into a radio network so that microminiaturized receivers being implanted in peoples brains the messages coming out of these radios would be indistinguishable to the subjects from the voice of their own thoughts one central transmitter located in the nations capital could broadcast all day long what the authorities wanted the people to believe the average man on the receiving end of these broadcasts would not even know he was a robot he would think it was his own voice he was listening to the average woman could be treated similarly it is ironic that people will find such a concept both shocking and frightening like orwells this is not a fantasy of the future but a parable of the present every citizen in every authoritarian society already has such a radio built into his or her brain this radio is the little voice that asks each time a desire is formed is it safe will my wife my husbandmy bossmy churchmy community approve will people ridicule and mock me will the police come and arrest me this little voice the freudians call the superego with freud himself vividly characterized as the egos harsh master with a more functional approach peris hefferline and goodman in gestalt therapy describe this process as a set of conditioned verbal habits this set which is fairly uniform throughout any authoritarian society determines the actions which will and will not occur there let us consider humanity a biogram the basic dna blueprint of the human organism and its potentials united with a logogram this set of conditioned verbal habits the biogram has not changed in several hundred thousand years the logogram is different in each society when the logogram reinforces the biogram we have a libertarian society such as still can be found among some american indian tribes like confucianism before it became authoritarian and rigidified american indian ethics is based on speaking from the heart and acting from the heartthat is from the biogram no authoritarian society can tolerate this all authority is based on conditioning men and women to act from the logogram since the logogram is a set created by those in authority every authoritarian logogram divides society as it divides the individual into alienated halves those at the bottom suffer what i shall call the burden of nescience the natural sensory activity of the biogram what the person sees hears smells tastes feels and above all what the organism as a whole or as a potential whole wants is always irrelevant and immaterial the authoritarian logogram not the field of sensed experience determines what is relevant and material this is as true of a highly paid advertising copywriter as it is of an engine lathe operator the person acts not on personal experience and the evaluations of the nervous system but on the orders from above thus personal experience and personal judgment being nonoperational these functions become also less real they exist if at all only in that fantasy land which freud called the unconscious since nobody has found a way to prove that the freudian unconscious really exists it can be doubted that personal experience and personal judgment exist it is an act of faith to assume they do the organism has become as marx said a tool a machine a robot those at the top of the authoritarian pyramid however suffer an equal and opposite burden of omniscience all that is forbidden to the servile class the web of perception evaluation and participation in the sensed universe is demanded of the members of the master class they must attempt to do the seeing hearing smelling tasting feeling and decisionmaking for the whole society but a man with a gun is told only that which people assume will not provoke him to pull the trigger since all authority and government are based on force the master class with its burden of omniscience faces the servile class with its burden of nescience precisely as a highwayman faces his victim communication is possible only between equals the master class never abstracts enough information from the servile class to know what is actually going on in the world where the actual productivity of society occurs furthermore the logogram of any authoritarian society remains fairly inflexible as time passes but everything else in the universe constantly changes the result can only be progressive disorientation among the rulers the end is debacle the schizophrenia of authoritarianism exists both in the individual and in the whole society i call this the snafu principle that autumn hagbard settled in rome he worked as a tourist guide amusing himself by combining authentic roman history with cecil b demille none of the tourists ever caught him out he also spent long hours scrutinizing the published reports of interpol his wanderjahr was ending he was preparing for action never subject to guilt or masochism he had one reason only for his dispersal of his savings to prove to himself that what he intended could be done starting from zero when winter arrived his studies were complete interpols crime statistics had very kindly provided him with a list of those commodities which either because of tariffs intended to stifle competition or because of morals laws could become the foundation of a successful career in smuggling one year later in the hotel claridge on fortyfourth street in new york hagbard was placed under arrest by two us narcotics agents named galley and eichmann dont take it too hard galley said were only following orders its okay hagbard said dont feel guilty but what are you going to do with my cats galley knelt on the floor and examined the kittens thoughtfully scratching one under the chin rubbing the ear of the other whats their names he asked the male is called vagina hagbard said the female i call penis the male is called what eichmann asked blinking the male is vagina and the female is penis hagbard said innocently but theres a metaphysic behind it first you have to ask yourself which appeared earlier on this planet life or death have you ever thought about that this guy is nuts galley told eichmann youve got to realize hagbard went on that life is a coming apart and death is a coming together does that help i never know whether hagbard is talking profundity or asininity george said dreamily toking away reincarnation works backward in time hagbard went on as the narcs opened drawers and peered under chairs you always get reborn into an earlier historical period mussolini is a witch in the th century now and catching hell from the inquisitors for his bum karma in this age people who remember the past are all deluded the only ones who really remember past incarnations remember the future and they become sciencefiction writers a little old lady from chicago walked into georges room with a collection can marked mothers march against phimosis he gave her a dime and she thanked him and left after the door closed george wondered if she had been a hallucination or just a woman who had fallen through a spacetime warp and landed on the leif erikson what the hell are these eichmann asked he had been searching hagbards closet and found some red white and blue bumper stickers the top half of each letter was blue with white stars and the bottom half was redandwhite stripes they looked patriotic as all getout the slogan formed this way was legalize abortion pregnancy is a jewish plot hagbard had been circulating these in neighborhoods like the yorkville section of manhattan the western suburbs of chicago and other places where oldfashioned father coughlinjoe mccarthy style irish catholic fascism was still strong this was a trial run on the logogrambiogram doublebind tactic out of which the dealy lama later developed operation mindfuck patriotic stickers hagbard explained well they look patriotic eichmann conceded dubiously did a little woman from chicago just walk through this room george asked no harry coin said toking again i didnt see any woman from chicago but i know who the martian is what the hell are these galley asked he had found some businesssize cards saying red in green letters and green in red letters when youre out of it all the way on the mountain george asked thats neither the biogram nor the logogram right what the hell is it then an antigram hagbard explained still helpful the cards are an antigram eichmann repeated bewildered i may have to place you under arrest and take you downtown hagbard warned youve both been very naughty boys breaking and entering pointing a gun at me thats technically assault with a deadly weapon seizing my narcotics thats theft all sorts of invasion of privacy very very naughty you cant arrest us eichmann whined were supposed to arrest you which is red and which is green hagbard asked look again they looked and red was now really red and green was really green actually the tints changed according to the angle at which hagbard held the card but he wasnt giving away his secrets to them i can also change up and down he added worse yet i clog zippers neither one of you can open your fly right now for instance my real gimmick though is reversing revolvers try to shoot me and the bullets will come out the back and youll never use your good right hand again try it and see if im bluffing cant you go a little easy on us officer eichmann took out his wallet a cops salary aint the greatest in the world eh he nudged hagbard insinuatingly are you trying to bribe me hagbard asked sternly why not harry coin whined you got nothing to gain by killing me take the money and put me off the sub at the first island you pass well hagbard said thoughtfully counting the money i can get more harry added i can send it to you im sure hagbard put the money in his clamshell ashtray and struck a match there was a brief merry blaze and hagbard asked calmly do you have any other inducements to offer ill tell you anything you want to know about the illuminati harry shrieked really frightened now realizing that he was in the hands of a madman to whom money meant nothing i know more about the illuminati than you do hagbard replied looking bored give me a philosophic reason harry is there any purpose in allowing a specimen like you to go on preying on the weak and innocent honest ill go straight ill join your side ill work for you kill anybody you want thats a possibility hagbard conceded its a slim one though the world is full of killers and potential killers thanks to the illuminati and their governments theres hardly an adult male alive who hasnt had some military training what makes you think i couldnt go out on the streets of any large city and find ten betterqualified killers than you inside an afternoon okay okay harry said breathing hard i dont have no college education but im not a fool either your men dragged me from mad dog jail to this submarine you want something ace otherwise id be dead already yes i want something hagbard leaned back in his chair now youre getting warm harry i want something but i wont tell you what it is youve got to produce it and show it to me without any clues or hints and if you cant do that i really will have you killed i shit you not fellow this is my version of a trial for your past crimes im the judge and the jury and youve got to win an acquittal without knowing the rules how do you like that game it aint fair its more of a chance than you gave any of the men you shot isnt it harry coin licked his lips i think youre bluffing he ventured finally youre some chickenshit liberal who doesnt believe in capital punishment youre looking for an excuse to not kill me look into my eyes harry do you see any mercy in them coin began to perspire and finally looked down into his lap okay he said hollowly how much time do i have hagbard opened his drawer and took out his revolver he cracked it open showing the bullets and quickly snapped it closed again he slipped the safety catch a procedure he later found unnecessary with george dorn who knew nothing about guns and aimed at harrys belly three days and three minutes are both too long he said casually if youre ever going to get it youre going to get it now mama coin heard himself exclaim youre going to shit your pants in a moment hagbard said coldly better not i find bad smells offensive and i might shoot you just for that and mama isnt here so dont call her again coin saw himself lunging across the room the gun roaring in midleap but at least trying to get his hands on this bastards throat before dying pointless hagbard grinned icily youd never get out of the chair his finger tightened slightly and coins gut churned he knew enough about guns to know how easy it was to have an accident and he thought of the gun going off even before the bastard celine intended it to maybe even as he was on the edge of guessing the goddam riddle the pointlessness of it was the final horror and he looked again into those eyes without guilt or pity or any weakness he could exploit then for the first time in his life harry coin knew peace as he relaxed into death good enough hagbard said from far away snapping the safety back in place youve got more on the ball than either of us realized harry slowly came back and looked at that face and those eyes god he said im going to give you the gun in a minute hagbard went on then its my turn to sweat of course if you kill me youll never get off this sub alive but maybe youll think thats worthwhile just for revenge on the other hand maybe youll be curious about that instant of peace and youll wonder if theres an easier way to get back there and if i can teach it to you maybe one more thing before i toss you the gun everybody who joins me does it by free choice when you said youd come over to my side just because you were afraid of dying you had no value to me at all heres the gun harry now i want you to check it there are no gimmicks no missing firing pin or anything like that no other tricks either nobody watching you through a peephole and ready to gun you down the minute you aim at me or anything like that im totally at your mercy what are you going to do harry examined the gun carefully and looked back at hagbard he had never studied kinetics and orgonomy as hagbard had but he could read enough of the human face and body to know what was going on in the other man hagbard had that same peace he himself had experienced for a moment you win you bastard harry said tossing the gun back i want to know how you do it part of you already knows hagbard smiled gently putting the gun back in the drawer you just did it didnt you what would he have done if i did block harry asked stella in present time something i dont know a sudden act of some sort that scared you more than the gun he plays it by ear the celine system is never twice the same then i was right he wouldnt have killed me it was all bluff yes and no stella looked past harry and george into the distance he wasnt acting with you he was manifesting the mercilessness was quite real there was no sentimentality involved in saving you he did it because its part of his demonstration his demonstration george asked thinking of geometry problems and the neat qed at the bottom back in nutley years and years ago ive known hagbard longer than she has eichmann said in fact galley and i were among the first people he enlisted ive watched him over the years and i still dont understand him but i understand the demonstration you know george said absently when you two first came in i thought you were a hallucination you never saw us at dinner because we work in the kitchen galley explained we eat after everybody else only a small part of the crew are former criminals stella told george who was looking confused rehabilitating a harry coin pardon me harry doesnt really excite hagbard much rehabilitating policemen and politicians and teaching them useful trades is work that really turns hagbard on but not for sentimental reasons eichmann emphasized its part of his demonstration its his memorial to the mohawk nation too stella said that trial set him off he tried a direct frontal assault that time attempting to cut through the logogram with a scalpel it didnt work of course it never does then he decided very well ill put them where words cant help and see what they do then thats his demonstration hagbard actually well not actually this is just what he told me had started with two handicaps intending to prove that they werent handicaps the first was that he would have a bank balance of exactly at the beginning and the second was that he would never kill another human being throughout the demonstration that which was to be proved namely that government is a hallucination or a selffulfilling prophecy could be shown only if all his equipment including money and people came to him through honest trade or voluntary association under these rules he could not shoot even in selfdefense for the biogram of government servants was to be preserved and only their logograms could be disconnected deactivated and defused the celine system was a consistent although flexible assault on the specific conditioned reflex that which compelled people to look outside themselves to a god or a government for direction or strength the servants of government all carried weapons hagbards insane scheme depended on rendering the weapons harmless he called this the tarbaby principle you are attached to what you attack being a man of certain morbid selfinsight he realized that he himself exemplified the tarbaby principle and that his attacks on government kept him perpetually attached to it it was his malign and insidious notion that government was even more attached to him that his existence qua anarchist qua smuggler qua outlaw aroused greater energetic streaming in government people than their existence aroused in him that in short he was the tar baby on which they could not resist hurling themselves in anger and fear an electrochemical reaction in which he could bond them to himself just as the tar baby captured anyone who swung a fist at it more there was always more with hagbard he had been impressed on reading weishaupts uber strip schnippschnapp weltspielen and funfwissenschaft by the passage on the order of assassins which read surrounded by moslem maniacs on one side and christian maniacs on the other the wise lord hassan preserved his people and his cult by bringing the art of assassination to esthetic perfection with just a few daggers strategically placed in exactly the right throats he found wisdoms alternative to war and preserved the peoples by killing their leaders truly his was a most exemplary life of grandmotherly kindness grossmutterlich gefalligkeit muttered hagbard who had been reading this in the original german now where have i heard that before in a second he remembered the mumonkan or gateless gate of rinzai zen contained a story about a monk who kept asking a zen master what is the buddha each time he asked he got hit upside the head with the masters staff finally discouraged he left and sought enlightenment with another master who asked him why he had left the previous teacher when the poor gawk explained the second master gave him the ontological hotfoot go back to your previous master at once he cried and apologize for not showing enough appreciation of his grandmotherly kindness hagbard was not surprised that weishaupt evidently knew in when uber strip schnippschnapp was written about a book which hadnt yet been translated into any european tongue he was astonished however that even the evil ingolstadt zauberer had understood the rudiments of the tarbaby principle it never pays to underestimate the illuminati he thought then for the first time he was to think it many times in the next two and a half decades on april when he told stella to deliver some kallisti gold to georges stateroom hagbard had already asked fuckup the odds that illuminati ships would arrive in peos within the time he intended to be there the answer was better than tol he thought about what that meant then buzzed to have harry coin sent in harry swaggered to a chair trying to look insolent and said so youre the leader of the discordians eh yes hagbard said evenly and on this ship my word is law wipe that silly grin off your face and sit up straight he observed the involuntary stiffening of harrys body before the man caught himself and remembered to maintain his slouch typical coin could resist the key conditioning phrases but only with effort listen he said softly will tell you only one more timeanother bavarian fire drill thatthis is my ship you will address me as captain celine you will come to attention when i talk to you otherwise he let the phrase trail off slowly coin shifted to a more respectful kinesic posture immediately modifying it by grinning more insolently well that was good the streak of rebellion ran deep the breathing was not bad for a professional criminal the only block seemed to be at the bottom of the exhalation the grin was a defense against tears of course as with most chronic american smilers hagbard attempted a probe harrys father was the kind who pretended to consider the case and to toy with forgiveness before he would administer the thrashing is that better harry asked accentuating his respectful posture and grinning more sarcastically a little hagbard said sounding mollified but i dont know what im going to do with you harry thats a bad bunch youve been mixed up with very unamerican he paused to get a reaction to the word it came at once their money is as good as anyones harry said defiantly his shoes crept backwards as he spoke and his neck decreased an inch the turtle reflex hagbard called it and it was a sure sign of the repressed guilt denied by the mans voice you were born pretty poor werent you hagbard asked in a neutral tone poor we was white niggers well i guess theres some excuse for you hagbard watched the grin grew wider the body imperceptibly moved back toward slouching but to turn on your own country harry thats bad thats the lowest thing a human being can do its like turning against your own mother the toes curled inward again tentatively what did harrys father say before wielding the belt hagbard caught it harry he repeated it gravely you havent been acting like a proper white man youve been acting like you got nigger blood the grin stretched to the breaking point and became a grimace the body stiffened to the most respectful possible posture now look here sir harry began you got no call to talk to me that way and youre not even ashamed hagbard ran over him you dont show any remorse he shook his head with profound discouragement i cant let you wander around loose committing more crimes and treasons im going to have to feed you to the sharks listen captain celine sir ive got a money belt under this shirt and its full of more hundreddollar bills than you ever saw at one time are you trying to bribe me hagbard asked sternly the rest of the scene would be easy he reflected part of his mind drifted to the illuminati ships he would meet at peos there was no way to use the celine system without communicating and he knew the crew would be protected against him by some illuminati variation on the ear wax of ulysses men passing the sirens the money would go in the giant clamshell ashtray a real shocker for a man like coin but what would he do about the illuminati ships when the time came to produce the gun he slipped the safety off viciously if im going to join the ancient brotherhood of killers he thought morosely maybe i should have the stomach to start with a visible target three days and three minutes are both too long he said trying to sound casual if youre ever going to get it youre going to get it now they would be at peos in less than an hour he thought as coin involuntarily cried mama like dutch schultz hagbard reflected like how many others it would be interesting to interview doctors and nurses and find out how many people passed out with that primordial cry for the allprotector on their lips but harry finally surrendered abdicated left the robot running itself according to the biogram he was no longer sitting in an insolent slouch a respectful attention a guilty cramp he was simply sitting he was ready for death good enough hagbard said youve got more on the ball than either of us realized the man would now transfer his submissive reflexes to hagbard and the next stage would be longer and harder before he learned to stop playing roles entirely and just manifest as he had in the face of extinction the gun gambit was variation of the third basic tactic in the celine system it had five usual sequels hagbard picked the most dangerous one he usually did since he didnt much like the gun gambit at all and could only stomach it if he gave most of the subjects a chance at the other role this time however he knew he had another motive somewhere deep inside a coward in him hoped harry coin was crazier than he had estimated and would in fact shoot that way hagbard could avoid the decision awaiting him in peos you win you bastard coins voice said hagbard came back and quickly rushed through a small verbal game involving hell images picked up from harrys childhood when he had coin sent back to his room under light security he slouched in his chair and rubbed his eyes tiredly he probed for dorn and found the dealy lama was on that channel broadcasting leave the kid alone he beamed its my turn now go contemplate your navel you old fraud a shower of rose petals was the nonverbal answer the lama faded out george went on rapping to himself on the themes planted by the elf leader odd the big red one eye think it was his i the eye of apollo his luminous i aye trust me not hagbard beamed trust not a man whos rich in flax his morals may be sadly lax some of my own doubts getting in here he thought her name is stella maris black star of the seas i wont tell him who she and mavis really are george i want you in the captains control room george should start with variation the liebestod or orgasmdeath trip hagbard decided make him aware of the extent to which he treats women as objects and of course give him some mystical hogwash later to gloss it over temporarily so the doubt will be pushed into the unconscious for a while yes george was already on a pornography trip very similar to atlanta hope and smiling jim treponema except that in his case it was egodystonic that was a good trick george said a few moments later in the captains control room how you got me up on the bridge with that telepathy thing hagbard still thinking about the decision in peos tried to look innocent when he replied i called you on the intercom he realized that he was whistling and pissing at once worrying about peos as well as about george and brought himself back sharply absurd was the word in georges mind absurd innocence well hagbard thought i fucked that one up you think i cant tell a voice in my head from a voice in my ears george demanded hagbard roared with laughter totally in the present again but after george had been sent to the chapel for his initiation the problem returned either the demonstration failed or the demonstration failed double bind damned both ways it was infuriating but all the books had warned him long ago as ye give so shall ye get he had used the celine system on quite a few people over nearly three decades and now he was in the middle of a classic celine trap himself there was no correct answer except to give up trying when the moment came though he found that part of him had not given up trying ready for destruction of enemy ships said howard hagbard shook his head george was remembering some crazy incident in which he had tried to commit suicide while standing by the passaic river and hagbard kept picking up parts of that bum trip while trying to clear his own head i wish we could communicate with them he said aloud realizing that he was possibly blowing the guru game by revealing his inner doubts to george i wish i could give them a chance to surrender you dont want them too close when they go said howard are your people out of the way hagbard asked in agony of course the dolphin replied irritably quit this hesitating this is no time to be a humanitarian the sea is crueler than the land hagbard protested but then he added sometimes the sea is cleaner than the land howard replied hagbard tried to focus the dolphin was obviously aware of his distress and soon george would be no a quick probe showed george had retreated from the scene into the past and was shouting you silly sons of bitches at somebody named carlo these people have been your enemies for thirty thousand years im not that old hagbard said wearily the demonstration had failed he was committed and others with him were now committed hagbard reached out a brown finger let it rest on a white button on the railing in front of him then pressed it decisively thats all there is to it he said quietly be a wiseass then when you start flunking half your subjects perhaps youll come back to reality a voice long long ago at harvard and once in the south he had been moved by a very simple a ridiculously simple fundamentalist hymn jesus walked this lonesome valley he had to walk it all alone nobody else could walk there for him he had to walk it by himself i will walk this lonesome valley hagbard thought bitterly all by myself all the way to ingolstadt and the final confrontation but its meaningless now the demonstration has failed all i can do is pick up the pieces and salvage what i can starting with dorn right here and right now hate like molten lead drips from the wounded sky they call it air pollution august personage dials slowly with the cuntstarved eyes of a medieval saint god lies weishaupt cried in the middle of his first trip god is hate harry coin is crumpled in his chair georges head hangs at an angle like a doll with a broken spring stella doesnt move they are not dead but stoned abe reles blew the whistle on the entire murder inc organization in he named charley workman as the chief gun in the dutch schultz massacre he gave the details proving the roles of lepke who was executed and luciano who was imprisoned and later exiled he kept his mouth shut about certain other things however but drake was worried he gave orders to maldonado who conveyed them to a capo who passed them on to some soldiers reles was guarded by five policemen but nonetheless he went out his hotel window and spread like jam on the ground below there were mutterings in the press the coroners jury couldnt believe that five cops were on the take from the syndicate reless death was declared to be suicide but in as the final solution moved into high gear lepke announced he wanted to talk before his execution tom dewey alive by grace of the dutchmans death was governor and he granted a stay of execution lepke spent twentyfour hours with justice department officials and it was announced later that he refused to reveal anything of significance one of the officials had been brought back from state to work with justice because of his background on schultz and the big six syndicate he said little but lepke read a lot in his eyes his name of course was winifred lepke understood as bela lugosi once said there are worse things than dying in the infant son of aviator charles lindbergh jr was kidnapped already at that time a heist of that dimension could not be permitted in the northeast without the consent of a fullfledged don of the mafia even a capo could not authorize it alone the aviators father congressman charles lindbergh sr had been an outspoken critic of the federal reserve monopoly among other things he had charged on the floor of congress under the federal reserve act panics are scientifically created the present one is the first scientifically created one worked out as we figure a mathematical problem the gobetween in delivering the ransom money was jafsie condon dutch schultzs old high school principal its got to be one of them coincidences as marty krompier said later john dillinger arrived in dallas on the morning of november and rented an avis at the airport he drove out to dealy plaza and scouted the terrain the triple underpass where harry coin was supposed to stand when doing the job was under observation from a railroadmans shack he noted it occurred to him that the man in that shack would not have a long life expectancy there would be a lot of other eyewitnesses he realized and the jams couldnt protect them all not even with the help of the ldd it was going to be bad all around in fact the man in the railroad shack s m holland told a story that didnt jibe with the earl warren version and later died when his car went off the road under circumstances that aroused speculation among those given to speculating the coroners jury called it an accident dillinger found his spot in the thickly wooded part of the grassy knoll and waited until harry coin appeared on the underpass he made himself relax and looked around to be sure that he was invisible from everywhere but a helicopter there were no helicopters the illuminatis top double agent within the secret service had seen to that a movement in the school book depository caught ms eye something not kosher up there he swung his binoculars and caught another head ducking quickly atop the daltex building an italian very young that was bad if one of maldonados soldiers was here either the illuminati were aware they had a double agent in their midst and had hired two assassins or else the syndicate was acting on its own john panned back to the school book depository whoever that clown was he had a rifle too and he was being cagey definitely not secret service this was a pisscutter johns original plan was to plug harry coin before coin could get a bead on the young hegelian from boston now he had three men to knock out at once it couldnt be done there was no human way of hitting more than two of those targets all three of them in different areas and at different elevations before the fuzz were swarming all over him the third would have time to do the job while that was happening it was what hagbard called an existential koan shit piss and industrial waste john muttered quoting another celinism well save what you can as harry pierpont always said when a bank job went sour in the middle save what you can and haul ass out of that place if kennedy had to die and obviously it was in the cards or in the i ching at least which probably explained why hagbard after consulting that computer of his refused to get involved in this caper then save what you can could only be applied in this case to mean screw the illuminati he would give them a mystery they would never solve the motorcade was already in front of the school book depository and the gazebo up there might start blasting at any minute if harry coin or the mafiosos werent quicker dillinger hoisted his rifle quickly sighted on john f kennedys skull and thought briefly even if it falls through and doesnt remain an enigma to bug the illuminati think of those wild headlines when im caught president shot by john dillinger people will think orson welles is publishing the papers now and then he tightened his finger murder george asked its hard not to think of good and evil when a mans games get that hairy during the kali yuga stella replied almost all our games are played with live ammunition havent you noticed the three shots blew brains into jackie kennedys lap and dillinger whirling in amazement saw the man start to run out of the grassy knoll down into the street john set off in pursuit and caught a glimpse of the face as the killer mingled in the crowd below christ john said him stella toked again she never seemed to think she i was sufficiently stoned wait she said theres a i passage in never whistle while youre pissing that goes into this a bit she got up walking quite slowly like all potheads and rummaged among the books on the wall shelf you know the old saying different strokes for different folks she asked over her shoulder hagbard and fuckup have classified sixtyfour thousand personality types depending on which strokes or gambits they use most often in relating to others she found the book and carefully walked back to her chair for instance she said slowly right now you can intersect my life line in a number of ways from kissing my hand to slitting my throat between those extremes you can lets say carry on an intellectual conversation with sexual flirtation underneath it or an intellectual conversation with sexual flirtation and also with kinesic signals indicating that the flirtation is only a game and you dont really want me to respond and on an even deeper level you can be sending other signals indicating that actually you do want me to respond after all but youre not ready to admit that to yourself in authoritarian society as we know it people are usually sending either very simple dominance signals im going to master you and you better accept it before i get really nasty or submissive signals youre going to master me and im reconciled to it lord in heaven harry coin said softly that was what my first session with him was all about i tried dominance signals to bluff him and it didnt work so i tried submissive signals which is the only other gimmick i ever knew and that didnt work either so i just gave up your brain gave up stella corrected the strategy center for dealing with human relations in authoritarian society was exhausted it had nothing left to try then the robot took over the biogram you acted from the heart but what has redundance got to do with this george asked heres the passage stella said she began to read aloud people exist on a spectrum from the most redundant to the most flexible the latter unless they are thoroughly trained in psychodynamics are always at a disadvantage to the former in social interactions the redundant do not change their script the flexible continually keep changing trying to find a way of relating constructively eventually the flexible ones find the proper gambit and communication of a sort is possible they are now on the set created by the redundant person and they act out his or her script the steady exponential growth of bureaucracy is not due to parkinsons law alone the state by making itself ever more redundant incorporates more people into its set and forces them to follow its script thats heavy george said but ill be damned if i can see how it applies to jesus or emperor norton exactly harry coin chortled and that ends the game youve just proven what i suspected all along youre the martian dont raise your voices galley said drowsily from the floor i can see hundreds of blissful buddhas floating through the air a single blissful buddha meanwhile together with an inverted satanic cross a peace symbol a pentagon and the eye in the triangle were taking up danny pricefixers attention back in new york he had finally decided to play his hunch about the confrontation bombing and the five associated disappearances the decision came after he and the acting head of homicide received a thorough asschewing from the police commissioner himself malik is gone the walsh woman is gone this dora kid was taken right out of a jail in texas two of my best men goodman and muldoon are gone the feds are nasty and i can tell they know something that makes this case even more important than five possible murders alone would account for i want you to report some kind of progress before the day is over or ill replace you with posttoasties junior gmen when they escaped into the hall pricefixer asked the man from homicide van meter what are you going to do go back and give my men the same asschewing theyll produce van meter didnt really sound convinced what are you going to do he added lamely im going to play a hunch danny said and he walked down to buncofraud where he exchanged some words with a detective named sergeant joe friday who always insisted on trying to act like his namesake in the famous television series i want a mystic danny said palmist crystalgazer witch astrologer any preference friday asked the technique doesnt matter i want one youve never been able to pin anything on one you investigated and found a little scary as if she or he really did have something on the ball i know the one you want friday said emphatically hitting the intercom button on his phone r amp i he said and waited carella send up the package on mama sutra the package when it shot out of the interoffice tube proved to be all that danny had hoped for mama sutra had no arrests she had been investigated several times usually at the demand of rich husbands who thought she had too much influence over their wives and once at the demand of the board of directors of a public utility who thought the president of the firm consulted too often with her but none of her activities involved any claims that could be construed to be in violation of the fraud laws furthermore she had dealt with the extremely wealthy for many years and had never played any games remotely like an okanna borra or gypsy switch on any of them her business card included in the package modestly offered only spiritual insight but she evidently delivered it in horse doctors doses one detective after interviewing her quit the force and entered a trappist monastery in kentucky a second became questionable and finally useless in the eyes of his superiors because of an incessant series of memos he wrote urging that new york be the first american city to experiment with the english system of unarmed policemen and a third announced that he had been a closet queen for two decades and began sporting a gay liberation button necessitating his immediate transfer to the vice squad this is my woman pricefixer said and an hour later he sat in her waiting room studying the blissful buddha and other occult accessories feeling like a horses ass this was really going way out on a limb he knew and his only excuse was that saul goodman frequently cracked hopeless cases by making equally bizarre jumps danny was ready to jump the disappearance of professor marsh in arkham was connected with the confrontation mystery and both were connected with fernando poo and the gods of atlantis the receptionist an attractive young chinese woman named mao somethingorother put down her phone and said you can go right in danny opened the door and walked into a completely austere room white as the north pole the white walls had no paintings the white rug was solid white without any design in it and mama sutras desk and the danish chair facing it were also white he realized that the total lack of occult paraphernalia together with the lack of color was certainly more impressive than heavy curtains shadows smoldering candles and a crystal ball mama sutra looked like maria ouspenskaya the old actress who was always popping up on the late late show to tell lon chaney jr that he would always walk the thorny path of lycanthropy until all tears empty into the sea what can i do for you she asked in a brisk businesslike manner im a detective on the new york police danny said showing her his badge im not here to hassle you or give you any trouble i need knowledge and advice and ill pay for it out of my own pocket she smiled gently the other officers who investigated me for fraud in the past must have created quite a legend at police headquarters i promise no miracles and my knowledge is limited perhaps i can help you perhaps not there will be no fee in either case being in a sensitive profession i would like to keep on friendly terms with the police danny nodded thanks he said heres the story wait mama sutra frowned i think i am picking up something already yes district attorney wade clark the ship is sinking if i cant live as please let me die when i choose does any of that mean anything to you only the first part danny said perplexed i suspect that the matter im investigating goes back at least as far as the assassination of john f kennedy the man who handled the original investigation of that killing in dallas was district attorney henry wade the rest of it doesnt help at all though where did you get it from there are vibrations and i register them mama sutra smiled again thats the best explanation i can offer it just happens and ive learned how to use it somewhat i hope someday before i die a psychologist will go far enough out in his investigations to find something that will explain to me what i do the sinking ship is meaningless how about the date june that seems to be on the same wave pricefixer shook his head no help as they say in poker wait mama sutra said it means something to me there was an irish writer james joyce who studied the theosophy of blavatski and the mysticism of the golden dawn society he wrote a novel in which all the action takes place on june the novel is called ulysses and is impregnated on every page with coded mystical revelations and yes now i remember there is a shipwreck mentioned in it joyce made all the background details historically accurate so he included what was actually in the dublin papers that day the book takes place in dublin you see and one of the stories concerned the sinking of the ship general slocum in new york harbor the day before june did you say golden dawn pricefixer demanded excitedly yes does that help it just adds to the confusion but at least it shows youre on the right track the case im working on seems to be connected with the disappearance of a professor from a university in massachusetts several years ago and he left behind some notes that mentioned the golden dawn society and lets see some of its members aleister crowley is one name i remember to mega theiron mama sutra said slowly beginning to pale slightly young man what you are involved in is very serious much more than an ordinary police officer could understand but you are not an ordinary police officer or you wouldnt have come to me in the first place let me tell you flatly then that what you have stumbled upon is something that could very easily involve both james joyces mysticism and the assassination of president john kennedy but to understand it you will have to stretch your mind to the breaking point let me suggest that you wait while i have my receptionist make you a rather stiff drink cant drink on duty maam danny said sadly mama sutra took a deep breath very well youll have to take it cold and struggle with it as best you can does it involve the lloigor danny asked hesitantly yes you already have a large part of the puzzle if you know that much maam danny said i think ill have that drink bourbon if you have it he thought while mama sutra spoke to the receptionist thats even crazier than the rest of this plus plus plus adds up to the base of the decimal system what the hell does that mean or plus adds up to thats two times the number missing in between and another enigma and times times times is lets see law of falling bodies high school physics class feet per second per second and is backwards nuts miss mao entered with a tray your drink sir she said softly danny took the glass and watched her gracefully walk back toward the door mao is chinese for cat he remembered from his years in army intelligence and she certainly moved like a cat mao onomatopoeia they call that like kids calling a dog woofwoof come to think of it thats how we got the word wolf funny i never thought of that before oh the pentagram outside and the pentagram in those old lon chaney wolf man movies maliks mystery mutts enough of that he took a stiff wallop of the bourbon and said go ahead start ill take some more of the medicine when my mind starts crumbling ill give it to you raw mama sutra said quietly the earth has already been invaded from outer space it is not some threat in the future for writers to play with it happened a long time ago fifty million years ago to be exact danny took another belt of his drink the lloigor he said that was their generic name for themselves there were several races of them shoggoths and tchotchos and dholes and tikis and wendigos for instance they were not entirely composed of matter as we understand it and they do not occupy space and time in the concrete way that furniture does they are not sound waves or radio waves or anything like that either but think of them that way for a while its better than not having any mental picture of them at all did you take any physics in high school nothing like relativity danny said realizing that he was believing all this sound and light she asked a little then you probably know two elementary experiments project a white light through a prism and a spectrum appears on the screen behind the prism youve seen that yes and the experiment with a glass tube that has a thin layer of colored powder on the bottom when you send a sound wave through it yeah and the wave leaves little marks at each of its valleys and you can see them in the powder the track of the invisible wave in a visible medium very well now you can picture perhaps how the lloigor although not made of matter as we understand it can manifest themselves in matter leaving traces that show let us say a cross section of what they really are danny nodded totally absorbed from our point of view mama sutra went on they are intolerably hideous in these manifestations there is a reason for that they were the source of the worst terrors experienced by the first humans our dna code still carries an aversion and terror toward them and this activates a part of our minds which the psychologist jung called the collective unconscious that is where all myth and art come from everything frightening loathsome and terriblein the folklore in the paintings and statues in the legends and epics of every people on earthcontains a partial image of a manifestation of the lloigor as a foulness shall ye know them a great arab poet wrote and theyve been at war with us through all history danny asked unhappily not at all are the stockyards at war with the cattle its nothing like war at all mama sutra said sinply its just that they own us i see danny said yes of course i see he looked into his empty glass dismally could i have another he murmured after miss mao had brought him another bourbon he took a huge swallow and slouched forward in his chair theres nothing we can do about it he asked there is one group that has been trying to liberate humanity mama sutra said but lloigor have great powers to warp and distort minds this group is the most maligned slandered and hated people on earth all the evil they seek to prevent has been attributed to them they operate in secret because otherwise they would be destroyed even now the john birch society and various other fanatics including an evil genius named hagbard celine struggle ceaselessly to combat the group of whom i speak they have many names the great white brotherhood the brethren of the rosy cross the golden dawn usually though they are known as the illuminati yes danny cried excitedly there was a whole bunch of memos about them at the scene of the crime that started this case and the memos i would wager portrayed them in an unfavorable light sure did danny agreed made them seem the worst bastards in history pardon me maam im getting drunk he thought that is how they are usually portrayed mama sutra said sadly their enemies are many and they are few who are their enemies danny leaned forward eagerly the cult of the yellow sign mama sutra replied this is a group serving one particular lloigor called hastur they live in such terror of this being that they usually call him he who is not to be named hastur resides in a mysterious place called hali which was formerly a lake but is now just desert hali was by a great city in the lost civilization of carcosa you look as if those names mean something to you yes they were in the notes of the professor who disappeared the other case that i was convinced was connected with this one they have been mentioned unwisely i think by certain writers such as bierce and chambers and lovecraft and bloch and derleth carcosa was located where the gobi desert is at present the major cities were hali mnar and sarnath the cult of the yellow sign has managed to conceal all this rather thoroughly although a few archeologists have published some interesting speculations about the gobi area most of the evidence of a great civilization before sumer and egypt has been either hidden or doctored so that it seems to point to atlantis actually atlantis never existed but the cult of the yellow sign carefully keeps the myth alive so nobody will discover what went on and still goes on in the gobian wastelands you see the cult of the yellow sign still goes there on certain occasions to worship and make certain transactions with hastur and with shub niggurath a lloigor who is known in mystical literature as the black goat with a thousand young and with nyarlathotep who appears either as a solid black man not a negro but black as an abyss or else as a gigantic faceless flute player but i repeat you cannot understand the lloigor by these manifestations or cross sections into our spacetime continuum do you believe in god yes danny answered startled by the sudden personal question take a little more of your drink i must tell you now that your god is another manifestation of some lloigor that is how religion began and how the lloigor and their servants in the cult of the yellow sign continue it have you ever had what is called a religious or mystical experience no danny said embarrassed good then your religion is just a matter of believing what you have been told and not of a personal emotional experience all such experiences come from the lloigor to enslave us revelations visions trances miracles all of it is a trap ordinary normal people instinctively avoid such aberrations unfortunately due to their gullibility and a concerted effort to brainwash them they are willing to follow the witches and wizards and shamans who traffic in these matters you see and i urge you to take another drink right now every religious leader in human history has been a member of the cult of the yellow sign and all their efforts are devoted to hoaxing deluding and enslaving the rest of us danny finished his glass and asked meekly may i have more mama sutra buzzed for miss mao and said youre taking this part very well people who have had religious visions take it very poorly they dont want to know what foul source those experiences actually came from the lloigor of course can be considered gods or demons but it is more profitable at this point in history to just consider them another life form cast up by the universe unfortunately superior to us and even more unfortunately inimical to us you see religion is always a matter of sacrifice and whenever there is a sacrifice there is a victim and also a person or entity profiting from the sacrifice there is no religion in the world not one that is not a front for the cult of the yellow sign the cult itself like the lloigor is of prehuman origin it began among the snake people of valusia the peninsula that is now europe and then spread eastward to be adopted by the first humans in carcosa always the purpose of the cult has been to serve the lloigor at the expense of other human beings since the rise of the illuminati the cult has also acted to combat their work and discredit them danny was glad that miss mao arrived then with his third stiff bourbon and who are the illuminati and what is their goal he asked belting away a strong swallow their founder mama sutra said was the first man to think rationally about the lloigor he realized that they were not supernatural but just another aspect of nature not allpowerful but just more powerful than us and that when they came out of the heavens they came from other worlds like this one his name has come down to us in certain secret teachings and documents it was malik jesus danny said thats the name of the guy whose disappearance started all this the name meant one who knows in the carcosan tongue among the persians and some arabs today it still exists but means one who leads his followers the illuminati are those who have seen the light of reason which is quite distinct from the stupefying and mind destroying light in which the lloigor sometimes appear to overwhelm and mystify their servants in the cult of the yellow sign what malik sought what the illuminati still seek is scientific knowledge that will surpass the powers of the lloigor end mankinds enslavement and allow us to become selfowners instead of property how large is the illuminati very small i dont know the exact number mama sutra sighed i have never been accepted for membership their standards are quite high one must virtually be a walking encyclopedia to qualify for an initial interview you must remember that this is the most dedicated most persecuted most secret group in the world everything they do if not wiped off the records by the cult of the yellow sign is always misrepresented and pictured as malign devious and totally evil indeed any effort to be rational to think scientifically to discover or publish a new truth even by those outside the illuminati is always pictured in those colors by the cult and all the religions which serve as its fronts all churches protestant catholic jewish moslem hindu buddhist or whatever have always opposed and persecuted science the cult of the yellow sign even fills the mass media with this propaganda their favorite stories are the one about the scientist who isnt fully human until he has a religious insight and recognizes the higher powers the lloigor that is and the other one about the scientist who seeks truth without fear and causes a disaster he meddled with things man should leave alone is always the punch line on that one the same hatred of knowledge and glorification of superstition and ignorance permeates all human societies how much more of this can you stand mama sutra asked abruptly i dont honestly know danny said wearily it seems if i do get to the bottom of this business itll bring every power in this country down on my head the least thatll happen is that ill get kicked out of my job more likely ill disappear like the man im looking for and the first two detectives on this case but for my own satisfaction id like to know the rest of the truth before i bid you good day and look for a hole to hide in you might also tell me how you can survive knowing as much as you do i have studied much i have a shield i cannot explain the shield anymore than i can explain my esp i only know that it works as to answering your other questions first tell me about your investigation then i will be able to relate it to the illuminati and the cult of the yellow sign danny took another drink closed his eyes for a minute and launched into his story he began with the marsh disappearance in arkham four years earlier his perusal of the missing professors notes his reading in the books mentioned in those notes and his conclusion that a drug cult was involved then he told of the confrontation bombing his skimming of the illuminati memos the disappearance of malik miss walsh goodman and muldoon and the frantic curiosity of the fbi thats it he concluded thats about all i know mama sutra nodded thoughtfully it is as i feared she said finally i think i can shed light on the matter but you will be well advised to leave the police force and seek the protection of the illuminati after you have heard you are already at this very moment in great peril she lapsed into silence again and then said you will not see the picture of what is happening now until i give you more of the background for the next hour danny pricefixer sat transfixed as mama sutra told him of the longest war in history the battle for the freedom of the human mind waged by the illuminati against the forces of slavery superstition and sorcery it began she repeated in ancient carcosa when the first humans were contacted by the serpent people of valusia the latter brought with them certain fruits with strange powers these fruits would be called hallucinogens or psychedelics today mama sutra said but what they did to the brain of the eater was not in any sense a hallucination it opened him to invasion by the lloigor the chief fruit used in these rites was a botanical cousin of the modern apple yellowish or golden in color and the snake people promised eat of this and you shall become allpowerful in fact the eaters became enslaved by the lloigor and especially by hastur who took up residence in the lake of hali distorted versions of what happened have come down to us in various african legends about people who had commerce with snakes and lost their souls in the homeric tale of the lotus eaters in genesis and in the arabic lore utilized in the fiction of robert w chambers ambrose bierce and others soon the cult of the yellow sign was formed among the eaters of the golden apples and its first high priest gruad bargained with hastur for certain powers in return forwhich the lloigor were fed on human sacrifices the people were told that the sacrifices were good for the cropsand this in fact was partially true for the lloigor ate only the energy of the victim and the body buried in the fields gave back its nitrogen to the soil this was the beginning of religionand of government gruad controlled the temple and the temple soon controlled hali and then all of carcosa so things went for many thousands of years until the priests were rich fat and decadent while the citizens lived in terror and slavery the number of sacrifices increased ever for hastur grew with each victim whose energy he absorbed and his appetite grew with him finally among the people there arose one who had been refused admission to the priesthood malik and he taught that humanity could become allpowerful not through eating the golden apples and sacrificing to the lloigor but through a process he called rational thought he was of course fed to hastur as soon as the priests heard of this teaching but he had followers and they quickly learned to keep their thoughts private and plan their activities in secret this was the age of midnight arrests purge trials and accelerating sacrifices in carcosa mama sutra said and eventually the followers of malikthe few who had escaped exterminationfled to the thuranian subcontinent which is now europe there they met little people who had come down from the north after the snake folk had exterminated each other in some form of slow insidious and stealthy civil war apparently the snakes never met in a single battle during all this time the poison in the wine cup the knife in the back and similar subtle activities had slowly escalated to the deadly level of actual warfare the serpent people had an aversion to facing an enemy as they killed him the little people had had their own experiences with the lloigor long ago but all they remembered were confused legends about ores whom mama sutra identified with the tchotchos and a great hero named phroto who battled a monster called zaurn evidently a shoggoth mama sutra said many millenniums passed and the little people and the followers of malik intermarried producing basically the human race of today a great lawgiver named kull tried to establish a rational society on maliks principles and fought a battle with some of the serpent people who had surprisingly survived in hidden places most of this got lost in exaggeration and legend after more thousands of years a barbarian named konan or conan arose somehow to the throne of aquilonia mightiest kingdom on the thuranian subcontinent konan brooded much about the continuing horrors in carcosa which he sensed as a threat to the rest of the world finally he disappeared abdicating in favor of his son conn and reputedly sailing to the west konan mama sutra said was the same person who appeared in the yucatan peninsula at that time and became known as kukulan he was evidently seeking among the mayan scientists some knowledge or technology to use against the lloigor whatever happened he left them and only the legend of kukulan the feathered serpent remained when the aztecs came down from the north kukulan became quetzalcoatl and human sacrifice was instituted in his name the lloigor in some fashion had turned the work of konan around and made it serve their own ends carcosa meanwhile perished what happened is unknown but some students of ancient lore suspect that konan actually circumnavigated the globe collecting knowledge as he went and descended upon carcosa with weapons that destroyed both the cult of the yellow sign and all traces of the civilization that served it throughout the rest of history mama sutra went on the cult of the yellow sign never regained its former powers but it has come very close in certain times and certain places the lloigor continued to exist of course but could no longer manifest in our kind of spacetime continuum unless the cult performed very complicated technical operations which were sometimes disguised as religious rituals and sometimes as wars famines or other calamities over the intervening ages the cult waged steady warfare against the one power that threatened them rationality when they couldnt manifest a lloigor to blast a mind they learned to fake it if real magic wasnt available stage magic served in its place by real magic of course mama sutra explained i mean the technology of the lloigor as sciencefiction writer arthur c clarke has commented any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic the lloigor have that kind of technology thats how they got to earth from their star you mean their planet dont you danny asked no they lived originally on a star i told you they were not made of matter as we understand it incidentally their origin on a star explains why the pentagram or star shape always attracts their attention and is one of the best ways of summoning them they invented that design a star doesnt look fivepointed to a human being but thats what it looks like to them finally in the th century the age of reason appeared to be at hand tentatively as an experiment one branch of the illuminati surfaced in bavaria they were led by an exjesuit named adam weishaupt who had inside knowledge of how the cult of the yellow sign operated and performed its hoaxes and miracles the real brain behind this movement however was weishaupts wife eve but they knew that even in the age of reason humanity was not ready yet for a liberation movement led by a woman so adam fronted for her the experiment was unsuccessful the cult of the yellow sign planted fake documents in the home of an illuminatus named zwack whispered some hints to bavarian government and then watched with glee as the movement was disbanded and hounded out of germany a simultaneous experiment began in america started by two illuminati named jefferson and franklin both preached reason like weishaupt but carefully did not make his mistake of stating explicitly how this contradicted religion and superstition this latter matter they discussed only in their private letters since jefferson and franklin were national heroes and since the rationalistic government they helped to create seemed well established the cult of the yellow sign dared not denounce them openly one trial balloon was attempted the reverend jebediah morse a high yellow sign adept openly accused jefferson of being an illuminatus and charged him and his party with most of the crimes that had discredited weishaupt in bavaria the american public was not deceived but all subsequent yellow sign propaganda in america has rested on the original antiilluminati claims of reverend morse due to jefferson one illuminati symbol was adopted by the new government the eye on the pyramid representing knowledge of geometry and hence of the order of nature this was to be used in later generations if necessary to indicate the truth about the founding of the us government since it was well understood that the cult of the yellow sign would try to distort the facts as soon as possible another illuminati work of more immediate importance was the bill of rights the part of the constitution still under most vigorous attack by the yellow sign fanatics and certain key expressions in early documents such as the reference to nature and natures god in the declaration of independence as far as jefferson dared to go in leavening traditional superstition with a naturalscience admixture and of course the first halfdozen presidents were all highranking masons and rosicrucians who understood at least the fundamentals of illuminati philosophy mama sutra sighed briefly and went on all this she said is only the tip of the iceberg government actually plays a minor role in controlling people far more important are the words and images that make up the semantic environment the cult of the yellow sign not only suppresses words and images that threaten their power but infiltrates every branch of communications with their own ideology science and reason are forever mocked or portrayed as menacing wishful thinking fantasy religion mysticism occultism and magic are forever preached as the real solutions to all problems bestselling books teach people to pray not work for success movies win awards by showing a childs ignorant faith justified over the skepticism of adults there is an astrology column in virtually every newspaper more and more the ideology of the cult of the yellow sign is set forth openly as the ideas of the illuminati and the founding fathers are forgotten or distorted one only has to think of any antidemocratic antirational or antihumane idea out of the dark ages mama sutra said and one can immediately think of some popular religious columnist or some movie star who is blatantly expounding it and calling it americanism the cult of the yellow sign the old woman continued is determined to destroy the united states because it came closer than any other nation to the illuminati ideals of free minds and free people and because it still retains a few tattered relics of illuminism in its laws and customs this is where mr hagbard celine enters the picture mama sutra said grimly celine she went on was a brilliant but twisted personality the son of an italian pimp and a norwegian prostitute raised in the underworld he early developed a contempt and hatred for ordinary decent society the mafia recognizing his talents and predilections took him in and financed his way through harvard law school after graduation he became an important mouthpiece for syndicate hoodlums in trouble with the law on the side however he also took some cases for american indians since this was a way of frustrating the government in one particularly bitter battle he attempted to stop the construction of a muchneeded dam in upstate new york his unbalanced behavior in the courtroom which helped lose the case indicated his deep attraction for the occult since he had obviously been taken in by the superstitions of the indians he served mafia dons conferred with leaders of the cult of the yellow sign and soon hagbard who had been wandering around europe aimlessly was recruited to start a new front for the cult to fight the united states both politically and religiously this front mama sutra said was called the legion of dynamic discord and while it pretended to be against all governments it was actually devoted only to harming the us he was given a submarine which he later claimed to have designed himself and became an important cog in the mafia heroinsmuggling business more important his crewrenegades and misfits from all nationswere indoctrinated in a deliberately nonsensical variety of mysticism an important center of celines heroin network mama sutra added was a fake church in santa isobel on the island of fernando poo obviously mama sutra concluded joseph malik the editor of confrontation was investigating the iiluminati deceived by the lies spread against them by celine and the yellow sign adepts as for professor marsh his explorations in fernando poo may have revealed something about celines heroin ring then you think theyre both dead danny said somberly and probably goodman and muldoon and pat walsh the researcher also not necessarily celine as i have told you is both brilliant and quite insane he has perfected his own form of brainwashing and it amuses him to recruit rather than destroy any possible opponent it is quite possible that all of these people are working for him right now against the illuminati and the united states which they will believe to be the major enemies of humanity mama sutra paused thoughtfully however that is far from sure events in the last few days have changed celine for the worse he is more insane and more dangerous than ever the assassinations of april all across the nation appear to be his work engineered through the mafia he is striking out blindly against anyone he imagines may be an illuminatus needless to say most of the victims were not actually in the illuminati which is as i have mentioned a very small organization since he is in this violent and paranoid frame of mind i fear for the lives of anyone associated with him danny was slumped forward in his chair drunk dejected and depressed now that i know he asked rhetorically what can i do about it my god what can i do about it i finally got around to reading telemachus sneezed on the flight to munich a touch of appropriate synchronicity since atlanta hope like the illuminatis pet paperhanger had an umbilical connection backward toward clark kents old enemy lothar and his festive burghers unsure god in fact atlanta wrote as if she had her own diet of worms for breakfast every morning what made it even more fanfuckintastic was that she was on the same flight with me sitting in fact a few seats ahead of me and to port or starboard or whatever is the correct word for right when youre in the air mary lou was with me she was a hard woman to get out of your system once youd made it with her john had advanced me only enough money for my own passage so id hustled some alamout black on wells street to raise the extra fare for her and then i had to explain that it wasnt just a pleasure trip whats all the mystery she had asked are you cia or a commie or something for christs sake if i told you i said you wouldnt believe it just enjoy the music and the acid and whatever else is coming down and when it happens youll see it youd never believe it before you see it simon motherfucking moon she told me gravely after the yoga and sex youve taught me these last three days im ready to believe anything ghosts the grand zombi oh there you go again putting me on she protested see so it was more or less left at that and we smoked two joints and hopped a cab out to ohare passing all the signs where they were tearing down lowermiddleclass neighborhoods to turn them into uppermiddleclass highrise neighborhoods and each sign said this is another improvement for chicagorichard j daley mayor of course in the lowerclass neighborhoods they werent tearing anything down just waiting for the people to go on another rampage and burn it down the signs there were all done with spray cans and had more variety off the pig black p stone runs it power to the people fred lives almighty latin kings run it and one that would have pleased hagbard off the landlords then we got into the traffic on the eisenhower expressway miss doris day standing before ikes picture in my old schoolroom flashed through memory like the ghost of an old hardon the flesh of her mammary and we put on our gas masks and sat while the cab crawled along fast enough to possibly catch a senile snail with arthritis mary lou bought edison yerbys seventieth or eightieth novel in the airport which suited me fine since i like to read on airplanes myself looking around i spotted telemachus sneezed and decided what the hell lets see how the other half thinks so there we were at fifty thousand feet a few yards from the author herself and i was plunged deeply into the donnerundblitzen metaphysics of gods lightning unlike the lamentable austrian monorchoid atlanta wrote like she had balls and she expressed her philosophy in a frame of fiction rather than autobiography pretty soon i was in her prose up to my ass and sinking rapidly fiction always does that to me i buy it completely and my critical faculties come into action only after im finished briefly then telemachus sneezed deals with a time in the near future when we dirty filthy freaky lazy dopesmoking franticfucking anarchists have brought law and order to a nervous collapse in america the heroine taffy rhinestone is like atlanta was once herself a member of womens liberation and a believer in socialism anarchism free abortions and the charisma of che then comes the rude awakening food riots industrial stagnation a reign of lawless looting and plunder everything george wallace ever warned us against but the supreme court who are all anarchists with names ending in stein or farb or berger there is no overt antisemitism in the book keeps repealing laws and taking away the rights of policemen finally in the fifth chapter the climax of book one the heroine poor toughy taffy gets raped fifteen times by an oversexed black brute right out of the birth of a nation while a group of cops stand by cursing wringing their hands and frothing at the mouth because the supreme court rulings wont allow them to take any action in book two which takes place a few years later things have degenerated even further and factory pollution has been replaced by a thick layer of marijuana smoke hanging over the country the supreme court is gone butchered by lsd crazed maumaus who mistook them for a meeting of the washington chapter of the policemens benevolent association the president and a shadowy governmentinexile are skulking about montreal living a gloomy emigre existence the blind tigers a rather thinly disguised caricature of the black panthers are terrorizing white women everywhere from bangor to walla walla the crazy anarchists are forcing abortions on women whether they want them or not and television shows nothing but maoist propaganda and danish stag films women of course are the worst sufferers in this blightmare and despite all her karate lessons taffy has been raped so many times not only by standard vagepen but orally and anally as well that shes practically a walking sperm bank then comes the big surprise the monstrorape to end all rapes committed by a pure aryan with hollow cheeks a long lean body and a face that never changes expression everything is fire he tells her as he pulls his prick out afterwards and dont you ever forget it then he disappears well it turns out that taffy has gone all ickystickygooey over this character and she determines to find him again and make an honest man of him meanwhile however a subplot is brewing involving taffys evil brother diamond jim rhinestone an unscrupulous dope pusher who is mixing heroin in his grass to make everybody an addict and enslave them to him diamond jim is allied with the sinister blind tigers and a secret society the enlightened ones who cannot achieve world government as long as a patriotic and paranoid streak of nationalism remains in america but the forces of evil are being stymied a secret underground group has been formed using the cross as their symbol and their slogan is appearing scrawled on walls everywhere save your federal reserve notes boys the state will rise again unless this group is found and destroyed diamond jim will not be able to addict everyone to horse the blind tigers wont be able to rape the few remaining white women they havent gotten to yet and the enlightened ones will not succeed in creating one world government and one monotonous soybean diet for the whole planet but a clue is discovered the leader of the underground is a pure aryan with hollow cheeks a long lean body and a face that never changes expression furthermore he is in the habit of discussing heracleitus for like seven hours on end this is a neat trick because only about a hundred sentences of the dark philosopher survive but our hero it turns out gives lengthy comments on them at this point there is a major digression while a herd of minor characters get on a braniff jet for ingolstadt it soon develops that the pilot is tripping on acid the copilot is bombed on tangier hash and the stewardesses are all speed freaks and dykes only interested in balling each other atlanta then takes you through the lives of each of the passengers and shows that the catastrophe that is about to befall them is richly deserved all in one way or another had helped to create the dope grope or fucks fix culture by denying the selfevident truth of some hermetic saying by heracleitus when the plane does a steve brodie into the north atlantic everybody on board including the acidtripping captain clark are getting just what they merit for having denied that reality is really fire meanwhile taffy has hired a private detective named mickey cocktails molotov to search for her lost aryan rapist with hollow cheeks before i could get into that however i was wondering about the synchronistic implications of the previous section and called over one of the stewardesses could you tell me the pilots name i asked namen she replied ja gretchen no not your name i said the pilots name namen wiser um winginmacher winginmacher she repeated dubiously bin augenblick she went away while i looked up augenblick in a pocket germanenglish dictionary and another stewardess with the identical uniform the identical smile and the identical blue eyes came over asking was wollen sie haben i gave up on winginmacher obviously a bad guess gibt mir bitte i said die namen unser fliegenmacher i spread my arms imitating the plane luft fliegenmacher i repeated adding helpfully how about luft piloten its pilot not piloten she said wit h lots of teeth his name is captain clark heathcliffe clark danke thanks i said glumly and returned to telemachus sneezed imagining friend heathcliffe up front there weathering heights of misspelled soaring and plunging into the ocean because as mallory said its there an englishman piloting a kraut airline no less just to remind me that im surrounded by the paradoxical paranoidal paranormal parameters of synchronicity their wandering ministerial eye lord i buried myself again in atlanta hopes egregious epic cocktails molotov the private dick starts looking for the great american rapist with only one clue an architectural blueprint that fell out of his pocket while he was tupping taffy cocktailss method of investigation is classically simple he beats up everybody he meets until they confess or reveal something that gives him a lead along the way he meets an effete snob type who makes a kind of william o douglas speech putting down all this brutality molotov explains for seventeen pages one of the longest monologues i ever read in a novel that life is a battle between good and evil and the whole modern world is corrupt because people see things in shades of redorangeyellowgreenblueindigoviolet instead of in clear black and white meanwhile of course everybody is still mostly involved in fucking smoking grass and neglecting to invest their capital in growth industries so america is slipping backward toward what atlanta calls crapulous precapitalist chaos at this point another character enters the book howard cork a onelegged madman who commands a submarine called the life eternal and is battling everybody the anarchists the communists the diamond jim rhinestone heroin cabal the blind tigers the enlightened ones the us governmentinexile the stillnameless patriotic underground and the chicago cubssince he is convinced they are all fronting for a white whale of superhuman intelligence who is trying to take over the world on behalf of the cetaceans no normal whale could do this he says after every tv newscast reveals further decay and chaos in america but a whale of superhuman intelligence this megalomaniac tub of blubber the whale not howard cork is responsible for the release of the famous lates record songs of the blue whales which has hypnotic powers to lead people into wild frenzies dopetaking rape and loss of faith in christianity in fact the whale is behind most of the cultural developments of recent decades influencing minds through hypnotic telepathy first he introduced w c fields howard cork rages to the dubious first mate buck star then when americas moral fiber was sufficiently weakened liz and dick and andy warhol and rock music now the songs of the blue whales star becomes convinced that captain cork went uncorked and wigged when he lost his leg during a simple ingrown toenail operation bungled by a hip young chiropodist stoned on mescaline this suspicion is increased by the moody mariners insistence on wearing an old cork leg instead of a modern prosthetic model proclaiming i was born all cork and im not going to die only threefourths cork then comes a turnabout scene and it is revealed that cork is actually not bananas at all but really a smooth apple in a meeting with a pure aryan with hollow cheeks a long lean body and a face that never changes expression it develops that the captain is an agent of the underground which is called gods lightning because of heracleituss idea that god first manifested himself as a lightning bolt which created the world instead of hunting the big white whale as the crew thinks the life eternal is actually running munitions for the governmentinexile and gods lightning when the hollowcheeked leader leaves he says to cork remember the way up is the way down meanwhile the gateless gate swung creakingly open and i started picking up some of the real world that is i began to recognize myself again as the ringmaster all of this information gets fed into me entropy and negentropy all synergized up in a wodge of wonderland and i compute it as well as my memory banks give it unto me to understand these doings but as harry coin i enter miss portinaris suite somewhat diffidently i am conscious of the ghosts of dead pirates only partly induced by this rooms surrealist variety of hagbards nautical taste in murals in fact harry in his own language had an asshole tight enough to shit bricks it was easy now to accept that longhaired hippie george and even his black girlfriend as equals but it just didnt seem right to be asked to accept a teenage girl as a superior a couple days ago i would have been thinking how to get into her panties now i was thinking how to get her into my head that hagbard and his dope sure have screwed up my sense of values worse than anything since i left biloxi and for some reason i could hear the reverend hill pounding the bible and hollering up a storm back there in biloxi long ago no remission without blood no remission without blood brothers and sisters saint paul says it and dont you forget it no remission without the blood of our lord and saviour jesus christ amen and hagbard reads fuckups final analysis of the strategy and tactics in the battle of atlantis all the evidence is consistent with assumption a and inconsistent with assumption b the mathematical part of fuckup has decided hagbard grinds his teeth in a savage grimace assumption a is that the illuminati spider ships were under remote control and assumption b is that there were human beings aboard them trust not a man whos rich in flaxhis morals may be sadly lax ready for destruction of enemy ships howards voice came back to him are your people out of the way of course quit this hesitating this is no time to be a humanitarian assumption a is that the illuminati spider ships were under remote control the sea is cruder than the land sometimes none of the evidence is consistent with assumption b hagbard reached out a brown finger let it rest on a white button on the railing in front of him then pressed it decisively thats all there is to it he said but that wasnt all there was to it he had decided coolly and in his wrong mind that if he was a murderer already the final gambit might as well be one that would salvage part of the demonstration he had sent george to drake bob youre dead now but did you ever understand even for a moment what i tried to tell you what jung tried to tell you even earlier and then twentyfour real men and women were dead and now the bloodshed was escalating and he wasnt sure that any part of the demonstration could be saved no remission without blood no remission without blood brothers and sisters no remission without the blood of our saviour and lord jesus christ i got into the illuminati in when joe mccarthy was riding high and everybody was looking for conspiracies everywhere in my own naive way i was a sophomore at new york university at the time i was seeking to find myself and i answered one of those rosicrucian ads in the back of a girlie magazine of course the rosicrucians arent a front in the simple way that the birchers and other paranoids think only a couple of plants at amorc headquarters are illuminati agents but they select possible candidates at random and we get slightly different mailings than those sent to the average new member if we show the proper spirit our mailings get more interesting and a personal contact is made well pretty soon i swore the whole oath including that silly part about never visiting naples which is just an expression of an old grudge of weishaupts and i was admitted as illuminatus minerval with the name ringo erigena since i was majoring in law i was instructed to seek a career in the fbi i met eisenhower only once at a very large and sumptuous ball he called another agent and myself aside keep your eye on mamie he said if she has five martinis or starts quoting john wayne get her upstairs quick kennedy i never even talked to but winifred whose name in the order is scotus pythagoras used to bitch about him a lot this new frontier stuff is dangerous winfred would say testily the man thinks hes living in a western movie one big showdown and the bad guys bite the dust wed best not let him last too long you can imagine how upset i was when the dallas caper began to throw light on the whole overall pattern of course i didnt know what to do winifred was my only superior in the government who was also a superior in the illuminati but i had a lot of hunches and guesses about some others and i wouldnt want to bet that john edgar wasnt one of them for instance when the feeler came from the cia i went on what these kids today call a paranoid trip it could have been coincidence or synchronicity but it could have been the order scanning me and ensuring that my involvement would get deeper most people in espionage dont know who theyre working for winifred told me once in that voice of silk and satin and stilettos especially the ones who only do small jobs suppose we find a french canadian separatist in montreal whos in a position to provide certain information at certain times we certainly dont ask him to work for american intelligence thats no concern of his and even inimical to his real interests so hes approached by another very convincing french canadian who has evidence to prove hes an agent of the most secret of all quebec libre underground movements or if the russians find a woman in nairobi who has access to certain offices and happens to be anticommunist and proenglish no sense in trying to recruit her for the mvd right the contact she meets has a full set of credentials and just the right oxford tone to convince her hes with m in london and so it goes he ended dreamily so it goes my cia contact really was cia im almost absolutely willing to give odds around on that at least he knew the proper passwords to show that he was acting under presidential orders whatever that proves it was hoover himself who ordered me to infiltrate gods lightning well he didnt pick me alone i was part of a group and a rousing pep talk he gave us i can still remember him saying dont let their american flags fool you look at those lightning bolts right out of nazi germany and remember the next thing to a godless commie is a godless nazi theyre both against free enterprise of course as soon as i was admitted to the arlington chapter of gods lightning i found out that free enterprise stood second only to heracleitus in their pantheon j edgar did get some queer hornets in his headgear at timeslike his fear that john dillinger was really still alive some place laughing at him that was the dread that turned him against melvin purvis the agent who gunned dillinger down in chicago and he rode purvis right out of the bureau those of you with long memories will recall that poor purvis ended up working for a breakfast cereal company acting as titular head of the posttoasties junior gmen it was in gods lightning that i read telemachus sneezed which i still think is a riproaring good yarn that scene where taffy rhinestone sees the new king on television and its her old rapist friend with the gaunt cheeks and he says my name is john guilt man thats writing his hundredandthreepagelong speech afterwards explaining the importance of guilt and showing why all the antiheracleiteans and freudians and relativists are destroying civilization by destroying guilt certainly is persuasiveespecially to somebody like me with threegoingonfour personalities each of which was betraying the others i still quote his last line without guilt there can be no civilization her nonfiction book militarism the unknown ideal for the new heracleitean is i think a distinct letdown but the gods lightning bumper stickers asking what is john guilt sure give people the creeps until they learn the answer i met atlanta hope herself at the time of the new york draft riots that was you will remember when gods lightning disgusted with reports that the fbi was swamped in two years backlog in draft resistance and draft evasion cases decided to organize vigilante groups to hunt down the hippieyippiecommiepacifist scum themselves as soon as they entered the east village which harbored as they suspected hundreds of thousands of bearded longhaired and otherwise semivisible fugitives from the vietnam cambodia thailand laos taiwan costa rica chile and tierra del fuego conflictsthey began to encounter both suspects and resistance after the third hour the mayor ordered the police to cordon the area the police of course were on the side of gods lightning and did all they could to aid their mayhem against the great unwashed while preventing reciprocal mayhem after the third day the governor called out the national guard the guard who were mostly draftdodgers at heart themselves tried to even the score and even help the dregs and drugs a bit after the third week the president declared that part of manhattan a disaster area and sent in the red cross to help the survivors i was in the thick and din of it you have no idea how bizarre civil war gets when one side uses trash cans as a large part of their arsenal and even met joe malik prematurely under a silver wraith rolls royce where he had crawled to take notes near the front line and i had crept to nurse wounds received while being pushed through the window of the peace eye bookstore i have scars i could show you still and a voice over my shoulder says that i should put in the fact that august personage was trapped in a phone booth only a few feet away suffering hideous paranoid delusions that in spite of all this chaos the police would trace his last obscene call and find him still in thebooth afraid to come out and face the trash can covers and bullets and other miscellaneous metals in the air and i even remember that the rolls had license plate rpd which suggests that a certain person of importance was also in that odd vicinity on some doubtless even odder errand i met atlanta herself a day later and a block north on the scene where taylor mead was making his famous last stand atlanta grabbed my right arm the wounded one it made me wince and howled something like welcome brother in the true faith war is the health of the state conflict is the creator of all things seeing she was on a heavy heracleitus wavelength i quoted with great passion men should fight for the laws as they would for the walls of the city that won her and i was atlantas personal lieutenant for the rest of the battle atlanta remembered me from the riots and i was summoned to organize the first tactical strikes against naders raiders if i do say so myself i did a commendable job it earned me a raise from the bureau a tight but genuinely pleased smile from my cia drop a promotion to illuminatus prelator from winifred and another audience with atlanta hope which led to my initiation into the aa the supersecret conspiracy for which she was really working the aa is so arcane that even now i cant reveal the full name hinted in those initials my secret name was prince of wands e i got the prince of wands by picking a tarot card at random and she gave me the e herself from which i deduced that there were four other princes of wands together with five kings of swords and so forth meaning that the aa was something special in even esoteric realms since it was a worldwide conspiracy with no more than three hundred ninety members five tunes the number of cards in the tarot deck the name fairly suited me i wouldnt want to be hanged man d or fool a and i was happy that the prince is known for his multiple personalities if i had been three and a half agents before my role in gods lightning a fairly straightforward one at least from gls point of view since i was only asked to smash not to spy there was no doubt that i was four agents now belonging to the fbi the cia the illuminati and the aaand betraying each of them to at least one and sometimes two or three of the others yes i had been converted to the aa during their initiation if i could describe that most amazing ritual you would not wonder why then came the vice presidents brainstorm about economizing on agents and i began to get transferred on loan to the cia frequently whereupon the bureau discreetly asked me to report anything interesting that i observed this however i perceive as a further complexification of my fourway psychic stretch and not as the inevitable irrefragable and synergetic fifth step and i was right for it was only in the last year that i entered the terminal stage or grumment as the order calls it due to those curious events which led me from robert putney drake to hagbard celine i was sent to the council on foreign relations banquet carrying the credentials of a pinkerton detective my supposed role as private dick was to keep an eye on the jewels of the ladies and other valuables my real job was to place a small bug on the table where robert putney drake would be sitting i was on loan to irs that week and they didnt know that justice had standing orders never to prosecute him for anything so they were trying to prove he had concealed income naturally i also had an ear peeled for anything that might be of import for the illuminati the aa and the cia if my lincoln memorial contact really was cia and not military or naval intelligence or somebody else entirely you can be sure i often meditated on the possibility that he might be moscow peking or havana and winifred told me once that the illuminati had reason to believe him part of an advanceguard fifth column sent by invaders from alpha centauri but grand masters of the illuminati are notorious puton artists and i didnt buy that yarn any more than i bought the tale that had originally brought me into the illuminati the one about them being a conspiracy to establish a world government run by british israelites conspiracy was its own reward to me now i didnt care what i was conspiring for art for arts sake not whether you betray or preserve but how you play the game i sometimes even identified it with the aa notion of the great work for in the twisting labyrinths of my selves i was beginning to find the rough sketch for a soul there was a hawkfaced wop at drakes table very elegant in a spanking new tuxedo but the cop in me made him as illegit sometimes you can make a subject precisely as buncocon safeblower armed robber or whatnot but i could only place him vaguely somewhere on that side of the game in fact i associated him with images of piracy on the high seas or the kind of gambits the borgias played somehow the conversation got around to a new book by somebody named mortimer adler who had already written a hundred or so great books if i understood the drift one banker type at the table was terribly keen on this adler and especially on his latest great book he says that we and the communists share the same great tradition i could hear the caps by the way he pronounced the term and we must join together against the one force that really does threaten civilizationanarchism there were several objections in which drake didnt take part he just sat back puffing his cigar and looking agreeable to everyone but i could see boredom under the surface and the banker tried to explain the great tradition which was a bit over my head and judging by the expressions around the table a bit over everybody elses head too when the hawkfaced dago spoke up suddenly i can put the great tradition in one word he said calmly privilege old drake suddenly stopped looking agreeablebutbored he seemed both interested and amused one seldom encounters such a refreshing freedom from euphemism he said leaning forward but perhaps i am reading too much into your remark sir hawkface sipped at his champagne and patted his mouth with a napkin before answering i think not he said at last privilege is defined in most dictionaries as a right or immunity giving special favors or benefits to those who hold it another meaning in webster is not subject to the usual rules or penalties the invaluable thesaurus gives such synonyms as power authority birthright franchise patent grant favor and im sad to say pretension surely we all know what privilege is in this club dont we gentlemen do i have to remind you of the latin roots privi private and lege law and point out in detail how we have created our private law over here just as the politburo have created their own private law in their own sphere of influence but thats not the great tradition the banker type said later i learned that he was actually a college professor drake was the only banker at that table what mr adler means by the great tradition what mortimer means by the great tradition hawkface interrupted rudely is a set of myths and fables invented to legitimize or sugarcoat the institution of privilege correct me if im wrong he added more politely but with a sardonic grin he means the true believer said the undeniable axioms the timetested truths the shared wisdom of the ages the the myths and fables hawkface contributed gently the sacred timetested wisdom of the ages the other went on becoming redundant the basic bedrock of civil society of civilization and we do share that with the communists and it is just that common humanistic tradition that the young anarchists on both sides of the iron curtain are blaspheming denying and trying to destroy it has nothing to do with privilege at all pardon me the dark man said are you a college professor certainly im head of the political science department at harvard oh the dark man shrugged im sorry for talking so bluntly before you i thought i was entirely surrounded by men of business and finance the professor was just starting to look as if he spotted the implied insult in that formal apology when drake interrupted quite so no need to shock our paid idealists and turn them into vulgar realists overnight at the same time is it absolutely necessary to state what we all know in such a manner as to imply a rather hostile and outside viewpoint who are you and what is your trade sir hagbard celine importexport gold and appel transfers here in new york a few other small establishments in other ports as he spoke my image of piracy and borgia stealth came back strongly and were not children here he added so why should we avoid frank language the professor taken aback a foot or so by this turn in the conversation sat perplexed as drake replied so civilization is privilege or private law as you say so literally and we all know where private law comes from except the poor professor here out of the barrel of a gun in the words of a gentleman whose bluntness you would appreciate is it your conclusion then that adler is for all his naivete correct and we have more in common with the communist rulers than we have setting us at odds let me illuminate you further celine said and the way he pronounced the verb made me jump drakes blue eyes flashed a bit too but that didnt surprise me anybody as rich as irs thought he was would have to be on the inside privilege implies exclusion from privilege just as advantage implies disadvantage celine went on in the same mathematically reciprocal way profit implies loss if you and i exchange equal goods that is trade neither of us profits and neither of us loses but if we exchange unequal goods one of us profits and the other loses mathematically certainly now such mathematically unequal exchanges will always occur because some traders will be shrewder than others but in total freedom in anarchy such unequal exchanges will be sporadic and irregular a phenomenon of unpredictable periodicity mathematically speaking now look about you professor raise your nose from your great books and survey the actual world as it is and you will not observe such unpredictable functions you will observe instead a mathematically smooth function a steady profit accruing to one group and an equally steady loss accumulating for all others why is this professor because the system is not free or random any mathematician would tell you a priori well then where is the determining function the factor that controls the other variables you have named it yourself or mr adler has the great tradition privilege i prefer to call it when a meets b in the marketplace they do not bargain as equals a bargains from a position of privilege hence he always profits and b always loses there is no more free market here than there is on the other side of the iron curtain the privileges or private laws the rules of the game as promulgated by the politburo and the general congress of the communist party on that side and by the us government and the federal reserve board on this side are slightly different thats all and it is this that is threatened by anarchists and by the repressed anarchist in each of us he concluded strongly emphasizing the last clause staring at drake not at the professor the professor had a lot more to say in a hurry then about the laws of society being the laws of nature and the laws of nature being the laws of god but i decided it was time to circulate a bit more so i didnt hear the rest of the conversation the irs has a complete tape of it im sure since i had placed the bug long before the meal the next time i saw robert putney drake was a turning point i was being sent to new york again on a mission for naval intelligence this time and winifred gave me a message that had to be delivered to drake personally the order wouldnt trust any mechanical communication device strangely my cia drop also gave me a message for drake and it was the same message that didnt jar me any since it merely confirmed some of what i had begun to suspect by then i went to this office on wall street near the corner of broad just about where id be toiling at corporate law if my family had had its way and i told his secretary knigge of pyramid productions to see mr drake that was the password that week knigge had been a bavarian baron and secondincommand to weishaupt in the original aisb i sat and cooled my heels awhile studying the decor which was heavily elizabethan and made me wonder if drake had some private notion about being a reincarnation of his famous ancestor finally drakes door opened and who stood there but atlanta hope looking kind of wildeyed and distraught drake had his arm on her shoulder and he said piously may your work hasten the day when america returns to purity she stumbled past me in a kind of daze and i was ushered into his office he motioned me to an overstuffed chair and stared at my face until something clicked another knigge in the woodpile he laughed suddenly the last time i saw you you were a pinkerton detective you had to admire a memory like that it had been a year since the cfr banquet and i hadnt done anything to attract his attention that night im fbi as well as being in the order i said leaving out a few things youre more than that he said flatly sitting behind a desk as big as some kids playgrounds but i have enough on my mind this week without prying into how many sides youre playing what s the message it comes from the order and the cia both i said to be clear and relatively aboveboard this it is the taiwan heroin shipments will not arrive on time the laotian opium fields are temporarily in the hands of the pathet lao dont believe the pentagon releases about our troops having the laotian situation under control no answer required i started to rise wait damn it drake said frowning this is more important than you realize his face went blank and i could tell his mind was racing like an engine with governor off it was impressive whats your rank in the order he asked finally illuminatus prelator i confessed humbly not nearly high enough but you have more practical espionage experience than a great many higher members youll have to do the old barracuda relaxed having come to a decision how much do you know about the cult of the black mother he asked the most militant and most secret black power group in the country i said carefully they avoid publicity instead of seeking it because their strategy is based on an eventual coup detat not on revolution until a minute ago i thought no white man in the country even knew of their existence except those of us in the fbi the bureau has never reported on them to other government agencies because were ashamed to admit weve never been able to keep an informer inside for long they all die of natural causes thats what bugs us nobody in the order has ever told you the truth drake demanded no i said curious i thought what i just told you was the truth winifred is more closedmouth than he needs to be drake said the cult of the black mother is entirely controlled by the order they monitor ghetto affairs for us right now they predict a revival of sstyle uprisings for late summer in harlem on the west side of chicago and in detroit they need to up the addiction rate at least eighteen percent hopefully twenty or twentyfive percent in all those areas or the property damage will be even more enormous than we are prepared to absorb they cant do it if they have to cut their present stock even more than its already cut there just has to be more junk in the ghettoes or all hell will break loose by august i began to realize that he had used the word monitor in its strict cybernetic meaning theres only one alternative drake went on the black market theres a very cunning and wellorganized group thats been trying to crack the ciasyndicate heroin monopoly for quite a while now the cult of the black mother will have to deal with them directly i dont want the order involved at all that would make it messy and besides well have to crush this group later when were able to pierce their cover the upshot of it was that i found myself on one hundred tenth street in harlem feeling very white and unbulletproof entering a restaurant called the signifying monkey walking through a lot of hostile stares i went direct to the coffeecolored woman at the cash register and said ive got a tombstone disposition she gave me a piercing look and muttered upstairs after the mens room the door marked private knock five times she grinned maliciously and if youre not kosher kiss your white ass goodbye brother i went up the stairs found the door knocked five times and one eye in an ebony face looked out at me stonily white he said man i replied native he came back born i finished a bolt slipped on a chain and the door opened the rest of the way i never did find out whose idea of a joke that password was they had lifted it from the ku klux klan of course the room i was in was heavy with marijuana smoke but i could see that it was decently furnished and dominated by an enormous statue of kali the black mother i had visions of weird gunga din rites and shouts of kill for the love of kali there were four other men in the room hi addition to the one who let me in and two reefers were circulating one deosil and one widdershins who you from a voice asked in the murk aisb i answered carefully and im to speak to hassan i sabbah x youre speaking to him said the tallest and blackest character in the bunch passing me a reefer i took a quick deep draw and christ it was good id been half addicted ever since the march on the pentagon in where i walked right behind norman mailer part of the way and later fell in with some hippies who were sitting on the steps smoking it i say i was half addicted since then because two of me believe as a loyal government employee that the old government publications claiming marijuana is addicting must be true or the government wouldnt have printed them fortunately the other two of me know that it isnt addicting so i dont go through very bad withdrawal when its scarce i started to outline the situation to hassan i sabbah x but the other joint came around widdershins and i took a drag on that a man could get stoned doing this i said facetiously yeah a satisfied black voice agreed in the gloom well by the time i explained the problem to hassan i was so bombed that i immediately let him recruit me for the next step on his rationalization that a white man could handle it easier than a black man actually i was curious to contact this group of heroin pirates hassan wrote the address carefully now heres the passwords he said you say do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law dont say do what you will they cant stand anybody fucking around with the words it has something to do with magic she replies love is the law love under will then you finish it with every man and every woman is a star got it you can bet your ass i got it i was almost goggleeyed it was the passwords of the aa one more thing hassan added be sure to ask for miss mao not mama sutra mama isnt cleared for this as the braniff jet took off from kennedy international simon was already deep into telemachus sneezed again he didnt notice the preoccupiedlooking redheaded young man who took the seat across the aisle if he had he would have immediately made the identification cop he was reading factory smog is a symbol of progress of the divine fire of industry of the flaming deity of heracleitus harry krishna harry krishna harry harry harry coin didnt know what the drug was miss portinari had merely said it takes you further than pot and handed him the tablet it might be that lsd the hippies use he reflected or it might be something else entirely that hagbard and fuckup had concocted in the ships laboratory miss portinari went on chanting harry rama harry rama harry harry obediently he continued to stare into the aquamarine pool between them she wore a yellow robe and sat placidly in the lotus position ive gotta know he had told her i cant go around with two sets of memories and never be sure which are real and which hagbard just put in my head like a man puts a baby into a woman did i kill all those people or didnt i you must be in the proper frame of mind before you can accept the answer she had replied remotely harry coinsha harry coinsha harry harry was she changing the chant or was it the drug he tried to keep calm and continue staring into the pool as she had ordered but the porcelain design around it was changing instead of two dolphins chasing each others tails like the astrological sign of pisces the age that was ending according to hagbard it was now one long serpentlike creature trying to swallow its own tail thats me he thought a lot of people have told me im as thin and long as a snake and its everybody else too he realized suddenly im seeing what george told me the self pursuing the self and trying to govern it the self trying to swallow the self but as he stared fascinated the pool turned red blood red the color of guilt and he felt it reach out and try to pull him down into it into red oblivion a void made flush its alive he screamed jesus motherfucking christ miss portinari casually stirred the pool remote and calm and its spiral inward slowly turned back to aquamarine harry felt himself blushing it was only a hallucination and muttered pardon my language maam dont apologize she said sharply the most important truths always appear first as blasphemies or obscenities thats why every great innovator is persecuted and the sacraments look obscene too to an outsider the eucharist is just sublimated cannibalism to the unawakened when the pope kisses the feet of the laity he looks like an old toequeen to some people the rites of pan look like a suburban orgy think about what you said since it has five words and fits the law of fives it is especially significant this is a weird bunch but they know important things harry reminded himself he looked deep into the blue spiral and silently repeated to himself its alive jesus motherfucking christ its alive jesus looking strangely hawkfaced and hagbardian rose from the pool this is my bodhi he said pointing harry looked and saw buddha sitting beneath the bodhitree tat tvam asi he said and the falling leaves of the tree turned into millions of tv sets all broadcasting the same laurel and hardy movie now look what you made me do hardy was saying in a previous incarnation harry saw himself as a centurion semper cuni linctus driving the nails into the cross look he said to jesus nothing personal im only following orders so am i jesus said my fathers orders arent we all look into the pool miss portinari repeated just look into the pool it was like each chinese box had another chinese box inside it but the best of all belonged to miss mao tsuhsi we were reclining in her trim but elegant pad on west eightyseventh street passing a joint back and forth and comparing multiple identities we were naked on a bearskin rug a dream come true for she was my ideal woman i got into the aa first tobias she was saying they recruited me at a bahai meeting they have cruisers out looking for likely prospects in every mystical group from subud to scientology you know then naval intelligence contacted me and i reported to them on what the aa was up to im not flexible as you though and my loyalties tend to stay fairly constant chiefly i was reporting to aa what i gleaned from naval intelligence i did believe in the aa basically until i met him that reminds me i said jealous of the worshipful way she said him as if talking about a god if hes coming soon shouldnt we get up and put some clothes on if you want to be bourgeois she said while we were dressing i remembered something by the way i asked casually who are you spying on mama sutra for the aa naval intelligence or him all three of them she was starting to pull her panties on and i said suddenly wait i knelt and kissed her pussy one last time for the nicest chinese box ive opened in this whole case i said gallantly that was my illuminati training as an fbi man i was ashamed of such a perverted act we finished dressing and she was pouring some wine a light german vintage from of all places bavaria when the knock came miss mao sidled over to the door in her slinky chinese dress and said softly hail eris all hail discordia came a voice from outside she slipped the lock and a little fat man walked in my first reaction was astonishment he didnt look anything like the superintellectual superhero she had described hagbard couldnt come he said briefly ill handle the sale and initiate you with a glance at me into the legion of dynamic discord if youre really ready as miss mao says to battle every government on earth and the illuminati to boot im ready i said passionately im tired being a puppet on four sets of strings actually i know i just wanted a fifth set good he said put her there and he held out his hand as we shook he said episkopos jim cartwright of the mad dog cabal tobias knight i said of the fbi the cia the aa and the illuminati he blinked briefly ive met double agents and triple agents but youre the first quadruple agent in my experience i guess this was inevitable by the law

office the dealy lama broadcast a telepathic message to hagbard celine saying its not too late to turn back and joe hesitated a moment blurting finally can we be sure can we be really sure tobias knight raised weary eyes we cant be sure of anything he said simply celine has popped up at banquets and other social occasions where drake was present five times now and each conversation eventually got around to the puppet metaphor and celines favorite bit about the unconscious saboteur in everybody what else can we assume he set the timer for am and then met joes eyes again i wish i could have given george a few more hints joe said lamely you gave him too damned many hints as it is knight replied closing the bomb casing on april while gods lightning paraded about un plaza and captain tequila y mota was led before a firing squad john dillinger arose from his cramped lotus position and stopped broadcasting the mathematics of magic he stretched shook all over like a dog and proceeded down the tunnel under the un building to alligator control oto yoga was always a strain and he was glad to abandon it and return to more mundane matters a guard stopped him at the ac door and john handed over his plastic eyeandpyramid card the guard a surlylooking woman whose picture john had seen in the newspapers as a leader of the radical lesbians fed the card into a wall slot it came out again almost at once and a green light flashed pass she said heute die welt morgens das sonnensystem john replied he entered the beige plastic underworld of alligator control and walked through geodesic corridors until he came to the door marked monotony monitor after he inserted his card in the appropriate slot another green light blinked and the door opened taffy rheingold wearing a miniskirt and still pert and attractive despite her years and gray hair looked up from her typing she sat behind a beige plastic desk that matched the beige plastic of the entire alligator control headquarters a broad smile spread across her face when she recognized him john she said happily what brings you here gotta see your boss he answered but before you buzz him do you know youre in another book the new edison yerby novel she shrugged philosophically not quite as bad as what atlanta hope did to me in telemachus sneezed yeah i suppose but how did this guy find out so much some of those scenes are absolutely true is he in the order john demanded a mind leak taffy said you know how it is with writers one of the illuminati magi scanned yerby and he thought he had invented all of it not a clue the same kind of leak we had when condon wrote the manchurian candidate she shrugged it just happens sometimes i suppose john said absently well tell your boss im here in a minute he was in the inner office being effusively greeted by the old man in the wheelchair john john its so good to see you again said the crooning voice that had hypnotized millions otherwise it was hard in this aged figure to recognize the once handsome and dynamic franklin delano roosevelt how did you get stuck with a job like this dillinger asked finally after the amenities had been exchanged you know how it is with the new gang in agharti roosevelt murmured new blood new blood thats their battle cry all of us old and faithful servants are being pushed into minor bureaucratic positions i remember your funeral john said wistfully i was envious thinking of you going to agharti and working directly with the five and now its come to this monotony monitor in alligator control sometimes i get pissed with the order careful roosevelt said they might be scanning and a double agent such as you are john is always under special surveillance besides this isnt really so bad considering how they reacted in agharti when the pearl harbor revelations started coming out in the late forties i did not handle that matter too elegantly you know and they had a right to demote me and alligator control is interesting maybe john said dubiously i never have understood this project its very significant work roosevelt said seriously new york and chicago are our major experiments in testing the mehum tolerance level in chicago we concentrate on mere ugliness and brutality but in new york were simultaneously carrying on a longrange boredom study thats where alligator control comes in weve got to keep the alligators in the sewers down to a minimum so the bureau of sanitation doesnt reactivate their own alligator control project which would be an opportunity for adventure and a certain natural mehum huntingband mystique among some of the young males its the same reason we took out the trolley cars riding them was more fun than buses believe me monotony monitoring is a very important part of the new york project ive seen the mentalhealth figures john said nodding about seventy percent of the people in the most congested part of manhattan are already prepsychotic well have it up to eighty percent by roosevelt cried with some of his old steelyeyed determination but then he fixed a joint in his ivory holder and clenching it at his famous jaunty angle added and were immune thanks to sabbahs elixir he quoted cheerfully grass does more than miltpwn can to justify gods ways to man but what does bring you here john a small job dillinger said theres a man in my organization named malik who is getting a little too close to the secret of the whole game i need some help here in new york to set him off on a snark hunt until after may first id like to know who youve got on your staff closest to him malik roosevelt said thoughtfully that would be the malik of confrontation magazine john nodded and roosevelt sat back in his wheelchair smiling this is a leadpipe cinch weve got an agent in his office but neither of them realized that ten days later a dolphin swimming through the rums of atlantis would discover that no dragon star had ever fallen nor could they have guessed how hagbard celine would reevaluate illuminati history when that revelation was reported to him and they had no clue of the decision he would then make which would change everybodys conspiracies shockingly and unexpectedly here are the five alternate histories gruad said his wise old eyes crinkling humorously each of you will be responsible for planting the evidence to make one ot these histories seem fairly credible wo topod you get the carcosa story evoe you get the lost continent of mu he handed out two bulky envelopes gao twone you get this charming snake storyi want variations of it scattered throughout africa and the near east he handed out another envelope unica you get the urantia story but that one isnt to be released until fairly late in the game he picked up the fifth envelope and smiled again kajeci my love you get the atlantis story with certain changes that make us out to be the most doubledyed bastards in all history let me explain the purpose behind that and in the four members of the american medical association gazed somberly down at joe malik from his office wall it looked to be a long day and there was nothing to anticipate as exciting as last night had been there was a thick manuscript in a manila envelope in the in box he noticed that the stamps had been removed that was doubtless pat walshs work her kid brother was a stamp collector joe smiled remembering the diary hed kept when he was a teenager in case his parents found it he always referred to masturbation as stamp collecting collected five stamps today a new record after five days of no stamps collected a beauty in several colors enormous but the negotiations were tiring doubtless todays kids if they kept diaries they probably used casette tape recorders either talked openly about it or considered it too incidental to mention joe shook his head the catholic teenager he had been in was no more remote than the crumbling liberal hed been in and yet in spite of all hed been through much of the time he felt that all of the knowledge didnt make a difference people like pat and peter still treated him as if he were the same man and he still did the same job in the same way he took the heavy manuscript out and shook the envelope damn it there was no return envelope well working at a magazine like confrontation whose contributors were mostly radicals and the kind of kooks who were willing to write for no bread you didnt really expect them to enclose stamped selfaddressed envelopes there was a covering letter joe sucked in his breath when he saw the golden apple embossed in the upper lefthand corner hail eris and hi joe here is a brilliant original interpretation of international finance called vampirism the heliocentric theory and the gold standard its by jorge lobengula a really farout young discordian thinker jams dont go in much for writing but discordians fortunately do if you find it worth printing you may have it at your usual rates make the check payable to the fernando poo secessionist movement and sent it to jorge at rue hassan algiers incidentally jorge will not be involved in the fernando poo coup he is turning toward a synergistic economics which will gradually lead him to see the folly of fernando poo going it alone and the coup itself of course will not be any of our doing but jorge will be a key figure in equatorial guineas subsequent economic recoveryassuming the world pulls through that particular mess if you cant use this paper burn it jorge has plenty of copies five tons of flax mal ps the fernando poo rebellion may still be one or two years in the future so dont jump to the conclusion that the pot is coming to a boil already remember what i told you about the goose in the bottle m down the hall in the ladys room bolting the door for privacy pat walsh takes her transistorized transmitter from her pantyhose and broadcasts to the receiver at the council on foreign relations headquarters half a block east im still writing lots of illuminati research papers and theyll give him plenty of false leads the big news today is an article on erisian economics by a fernando poo national it came with a covering letter signed mal and from the context i feel fairly certain its the original malaclypse the elder himself if not at last weve got a lead on that damned elusive malaclypse the younger the envelope was postmarked mad dog texas joe put down mals letter trying to remember the obscure references to fernando poo before the movie last night someone had said something was going to happen there maybe he should get a stringer on the island or even send somebody over a malicious grin crossed his face it might be interesting to send peter first some aum then a trip to fernando poo that might fix peter up joe flipped through the loberigula manuscript quickly scanning there were no fnords that was a relief he had become painfully conscious of them since hagbard had removed the aversion reflex and each fnord had sent a pang through him that was a ghost of the lowgrade emergency in which he had previously lived he turned back to the first page and began to read in earnest vampirism the heliocentric theory and the gold standard by jorge lobengula do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law joe stopped that sentence had been used in the black mass in chicago and further back he knew it was the code of the abbey of theleme in rabelais but there was something else about it that chewed at his consciousness something that suggested a hidden meaning this was not just a first axiom of anarchismthere was something else there something more hermetic he looked back at mals letter remember what i told you about the goose in the bottle that was a simple riddle used by zen masters in the training of monks joe remembered you take a newborn gosling and slip it through the neck of a bottle month after month you keep it in there and feed it until it is a fullgrown goose and can no longer be passed through the bottles neck the question is without breaking the bottle how do you get the goose out neither riddle seemed to shed much light on the other do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law how do you get the goose out of the bottle holy god joe laughed do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law the goose gets out of the bottle the same way john dillinger got out of the escapeproof crown point jail jesus motherfucking christ joe gasped its alive just like a tree thats standing by the waaater we shall not we shall not be moved the only place where all five illuminati primi met was the great hall of gruad in agharti the thirtythousandyearold illuminati center on the peaks of the tibetan himalayas with a lowerlevel water front harbor on the vast underground sea of valusia we will report in the usual order said brother gracchus gruad pressing a button in the table before him so his words would automatically be recorded on impervium wire for the illuminati archives first of all fernando poo jorge lobengula having decided that the combined resources of fernando poo and rio muni can be reallocated so as to increase the percapita wealth of citizens of both provinces has accordingly broken with the fernando poo separatists and returned to rio muni where he hopes to persuade fang leaders to go along with his schemes for economic redevelopment our plans now center on a captain ernesto tequila y mota one of the few caucasians left on fernando poo he has good contacts among the wealthier bubi the ones who favor separatism and he is inordinately ambitious i dont think we need contemplate a change in timetable i should hope not said brother marcus marconi it would be such a shame not to immanentize the eschaton on may first well we cant count on may first said brother gracchus gruad but with three distinct plans pointing in that direction one of them is bound to hit lets hear from you brother marcus charles mocenigo has now reached anthrax leprosy mu a few more nightmares at the right moment and hell be home sister theda theodora spoke next atlanta hope and gods lighting are becoming more powerful all the time the president will be scared shitless of her when the time comes and hell be ready to be even more totalitarian than her just to keep her from taking over i dont trust drake said brother marcus marconi of course said brother gracchus gruad but he has builded his house by the sea and he who builds by the sea builds on sand said brother otto ogatai my turn our record give sympathize control is an international hit our next tour of europe should be an extraordinary success then we can begin very slowly and tentatively negotiations for the walpurgisnacht festival anyone who tries to develop the idea prematurely of course will have to be deflected or liquidated said brother gracchus gruad he looked down the long table at the man who sat by himself at the far end now you youve been silent all this time what do you have to say the man laughed a few words from the skeleton at the feast eh this was the fifth and most formidable illuminatus primus brother henry hastur the only one who would have the gall to name himself after a lloigor it is written he said that the universe is a practical joke by the general at the expense of the particular do not be too quick to laugh or weep if you believe this saying all i can say is there is a serious threat in being to all your plans i warn you you have been warned you may all die are you afraid of death you need not answer i see that you are that in itself may be a mistake i have tried to explain to you about not fearing death but you will not listen all your other problems follow from that the other four illuminati primi listened in cold disdainful silence and did not reply if all are one the fifth illuminatus added significantly all violence is masochism if all are one brother otto replied nastilyall sexis masturbation lets have no more mehum metaphysics here hare krishna hare hare george then george was here with celine in ingolstadt this was going to be tricky georges head was bent over an earthenware stein doubtless full of the local brew george joe called again george looked up and joe was astonished he had never seen george like this before george shook his shoulderlength blond hair to clear it away from his face and joe looked deep into his eyes they were strange eyes eves without fear or pity or guilt eyes that acknowledged that the natural state of man was one of perpetual surprise and therefore could not be greatly surprised by any one thing even the unexpected appearance of joe malik what has celine done to him in the past seven days joe wondered has he destroyed his mind or has heilluminated him actually it was georges tenth stein of beer that day and he was very very drunk harry robot harry harry civil liberties were suspended and a state of national emergency declared during a special presidential broadcast on all channels between noon and on april fifteen minutes later the first rioting started in new york at the port authority on fortyfirst street where a mob attempted to overrun the police and steal buses in which to escape to canada it was pm just then in ingolstadt and count dracula and his brides were giving forth a ragarock version of an old walt disney cartoon song and in los angeles where it was am a fiveperson morituri group hurriedly convened decided to use up all its bombs against police stations immediately cripple the motherfucker before its heavy said their leader a sixteenyearold girl with braces on her teeth her idiom in standard english meant paralyze the fascist state before its entrenched and saul trusting the polevaulter in the unconscious was leading barney and markoff chaney into the mouth of lehman cavern carmel nearly a kilometer south of them and several hundred feet closer to the center of the earth still clutched his briefcase and its five million green gods but he did not move near him were the bones of a dozen bats he had eaten to be a bats a bum thing a silly and a dumb thing but at least a bat is something and youre not a thing at all joe malik hit by the raga rock as if by an avalanche of separate notes which were each boulders felt his body dissolve count dracula wailed it again youre not a thing at all and joe felt mind crumble along with body and could find no center no still point in the waves of sound and energy the fucking acid was hagbards ally and had turned against him he was dying even the words hey that cats on a bummer came from far away and his effort to determine if they really meant him collapsed into an effort to remember what the words were which imploded into an uncertainty about what effort he was trying to make mental or physical and why because he cried out because because but because meant nothing youre nothing but a nothing nothing but a nothing but i cant take acid now george had protested im so damned drunk on this bavarian beer its sure to be a down trip everybody takes acid hagbard said coldly those are miss portinaris orders and shes right we can only face this thing if our minds are completely open to the outside hey dig clark kent said that french cat eating the popsicle yeah said one of the supermen its jeanpaul sartre whod ever expect to see him here kent shook his head hope to hell he stays long enough to hear our gig sheeeit the influence that man has had on me he should hear it come back at him in music thats your trip baby a second superman said i dont give a fuck what any motherfuckin honky thinks about our music youre nothing but a nothing mick jagger hasnt even played sympathy for the devil yet and already the trouble has started an english voice drawled attila and his huns were trying to do acute bodily damage to the senate and the people of rome both groups were speeding and they had gotten into a very intellectual discussion of the meaning of one of dylans lyrics a hun bopped a roman with a beer stein as another voice mumbled something about tyl eulenspiegels merry pranks youre not a thing at all joe had always had the policy at confrontation that real screwballs should be sent to him for interviewing but the little fat man who came in didnt seem particularly crazy he just had the bland regular somewhat smallish features of a typical wasp the name is james cash cartwright the fat man said holding out his hand and the subject is consciousness energy the subject of what oh this here article i have written for you cartwright reached into his alligator briefcase and pulled out a thick sheaf of typewritten paper it was an odd size possibly eight by ten he handed the manuscript to joe what kind of paper is this said joe its the standard size in england said cartwright when i was over there in visiting the tombs of my ancestors i bought ten reams of it i took the plane from dallas on november the day kennedy was shot synchronicity also i sneezed the moment the gunman squeezed more synchronicity but about this paper ive never used anything else for my writing since then kind of gives a man a nice feeling to know that all the trees that went into my paper were chopped down over ten years ago and no trees have died since then to support the proliferation of jim cartwrights philosophical foliage that certainly is a wonderful thing said joe thinking how much he loathed ecological moralists during the height of the ecology fad back in and several people actually had had the nerve to write joe saying that ecologically responsible journals like confrontation had a duty to cease publication in order to save trees just what fruit have your philosophical researches borne mr cartwright he asked golden apples of the sun silver apples of the moon said cartwright with a smile joe saw lilith velkor defying gruad atop the pyramid of the eye well sir said cartwright my basic finding is that life energy pervades the entire universe just as light and gravity do therefore all life is one just as all light is one all energies you see are broadcast from a central source yet to be found if four amino acidsadenine cytosine guanine and thyminesuddenly become life when you throw them together then all chemicals are potentially alive you and me and the fish and bugs are that kind of life made from adenine cytosine guanine and thymine dna life what we call dead matter is another kind of life nondnalife okay so far if awareness is life and if life is one then the awareness of the individual is just one of the universes sensory organs the universe produces beings like us in order to perceive itself you might think of it as a giant selfcontained eye joe remained impassive cartwright went on consciousness is therefore also manifested as telepathy clairvoyance and telekinesis those phenomena are simply nonlocalized versions of consciousness im very interested in telepathy and ive had a lot of success with telepathic research these cases of communication are just further evidence that consciousness is a seamless web throughout the universe now wait a minute said joe automobiles run on mechanical energy heat energy and electrical energy but that doesnt mean that all the automobiles in the world are in contact with each other what burns said cartwright smiling you mean in a car well the gas ignites explosively in the cylinder only organic matter burns said cartwright smugly and all organic matter is descended from a single cell all fire is one and all automobiles do communicate with each other you cant tell me anything about gas or oil or cars im a texan did i tell you that joe shook his head just what part of texas are you from little place called mad dog had a notion you might be tell me mr cartwright do you know anything about a conspiratorial organization called the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria well i know three organizations that have similar names the ancient bavarian conspiracy the new bavarian conspiracy and the conservative bavarian seers joe nodded cartwright didnt seem to have the facts straight as joe knew them perhaps the fat man had other pieces of the puzzle perhaps fewer pieces than joe had still if they were different they might be useful each of these organizations controls one of the major tv networks in the us said cartwright the initials of each network have been intentionally chosen to refer back to the name of the group that runs it they also control all the big magazines and newspapers thats why i came to you judging by the stuff youve been getting away with printing lately not only do the illuminati not control your magazine but you seem to have the benefit of some pretty powerful protection so there are three separate illuminati groups and among them they dominate all the communications media is that correct said joe thats right said cartwright his face as cheerful as if he were explaining how his wife made ice cream with a hand freezer they dominate the motionpicture industry too they took a hand in the making of hundreds of movies the best known of which are gunga din and citizen kane those two movies are especially full of illuminati references symbols code messages and subliminal propaganda rosebud for instance is their code name for the oldest illuminati symbol the socalled rosy cross you know what that means he snickered lewdly joe nodded so you know about flowery combat cartwright shrugged who doesnt dr horace naismith a learned friend of mine and head of the john dillinger died for you society has written an analysis of gunga din pointing out the real meaning of the thuggee the evil goddess kali the pit full of serpents the elephant medicine the blowing of the bugle from the top of the temple and so forth gunga din celebrates the imposition of law and order in an area terrorized by the criminal followers of a goddess who breeds evil and chaos the thuggee are a caricature of the discordians and the english represent the illuminatis view of themselves the illuminati love that movie sometimes i wonder if were not all working for them one way or another said joe trying deliberately to be ambivalent to see which way cartwright would move well sure we are said cartwright everything we do that contributes to a lack of harmony in the human race helps them they are forever shaking up society with experiments involving suffering and death for large numbers of people for instance consider the general slocum disaster on june note that plus equals by the way him too joe groaned mentally hes got to be either one of us or one of them and if hes one of them why is he telling me so much you tell me cartwright said if all consciousness is not one just how did joyce happen to pick the very next day for ulysses so the general slocum disaster would be in the newspaper his characters read you see joyce knew he was a genius but he never did understand the nature of genius which is to be in better touch with the universal consciousness than the average man is anyway the illuminati were trying with the general slocum disaster a new more economical technique for achieving transcendental illuminationone that would require only a few hundred sudden deaths instead of thousands not that they care about saving lives you understand though the desire might result from the return of the repressed original purpose of the illuminati which was benign really said joe what was the benign purpose the preservation of human knowledge after the natural catastrophe that destroyed the continent of atlantis and the first human civilization thirty thousand years ago said cartwright natural catastrophe yes a solar flare that erupted just when atlantis was turned toward the sun the original illuminati were scientists who predicted the solar flare but were scoffed at by their fellows so they fled by themselves the benevolence of those early illuminati was replaced by elitist attitudes id their successors but the benign purpose keeps coming back in the form of factions which arise among the illuminati and split off the factions preserve traditional illuminati secrecy but they aim to thwart the destructiveness of the parent body the justified ancients of mummu were expelled from the illuminati back in but the oldest antiilluminati conspiracy is the erisian liberation front which splintered off before the beginnings of the current civilization then theres the discordian movement another splinter faction but theyre almost as bad as the illuminati theyre sort of like a cross between followers of ayn rand and scientologists theyve got this guy named hagbard celine their head honcho you didnt read about it because the governments of the world were too scared shitless to do anything about it but five years ago this celine character infiltrated the nuclearsubmarine service of the us navy for the illuminatiand stole a sub hes a supersalesman celine is he could talk old h l hunt right out of half his oil wells he was a chief petty officer first he converted about half the crew with the most incredible line of bullshit youve heard since tim leary was in his prime then he put some kind of drug in the ships air supply and while they were under the influence he converted most of the others the ones that were stubborn he just blew out through the torpedo tubes nice guy now mind you this sub was armed with polaris missiles so the next thing celine does is get himself off to someplace in the ocean where they cant find him and blackmail the fucking governments of the us the ussr and red china to each give him ten million dollars in gold and after he gets the thirty million he will scuttle his missiles otherwise he will dump em on a city of one of those three countries was celine still working for the illuminati at that point hell no cartwright snorted thats not how they play the game they like to operate stealthily behind the throneroom curtains they work with poison and daggers and things not hbombs no celine told the illuminati to go fuck themselves and there was nothing they could do but grind their teeth hes been operating like a pirate ever since and ill tell you something else theres more than one world leader including the illuminati leaders that hasnt been able to sleep at night because of what else hagbard celine has on that submarine whats that mr cartwright well see the us government did a very dumb thing they werent satisfied to have just nuclear weapons aboard their polaris submarines for a while they also thought the subs should be armed with the other kind of weapon bugs joe felt himself go cold and the back of his neck prickled let others worry about the nuclear devastation all they want disease the extinction of the human race through the spread of some manmade plague for which man would have no remedy was his particular nightmare maybe because at the age of seven hed very nearly died of polio though hed been healthy ever since the fear of fatal illness had been impossible to shake this hagbard celine these discordians have a bacteriological weapon aboard the submarine yeah something called anthrax tau all celine has to do is release it in the water and within a week the whole human race would be dead it spreads fastern a twodollar whore on saturday night any living thing can carry it but one nice thing about it its fatal only to man if celine ever gets crazy enough to use it and hes pretty crazy these days and getting worse all the time itll give the planet a fresh start so to speak some other life form could evolve into sentience now if we have a nuclear war or if we pollute the planet to death there wont be any life left worth talking about might be the best thing that ever happened if hagbard celine shot that anthrax tau down the tube it would sure prevent worse things from happening if there were no one left alive said joe from whose point of view would it be the best thing that ever happened lifes said cartwright i told you all life is one which gets me back to my manuscript ill just leave it with you i realize its much longer than what you usually publish so feel free to excerpt from it as you please and to pay me at your usual rates for whatever you publish that evening joe stayed till nine at his office he was as usual a day late getting copy to the typesetter on his editorial column and the letters column these were two parts of the magazine that he felt only he could do right and he refused to delegate either job to peter or anyone else on the staff first he ran the letters through his typewriter shortening and pointing them up then adding brief editorial answers where called for after that he put aside his notes and research for the editorial hed planned for this august issue and instead he wrote an impassioned plea that each reader make himself personally responsible for doing something about the menace of bacteriological warfare even if what cartwright had told him was a crock it reminded him of his longheld conviction that germ warfare was far more likely to put the quietus to the human race than nuclear weapons it was just too easy to unleash he envisioned hagbard in his submarine spewing the microbes of alldestroying plague out into the seas and he shuddered his briefcase weighed down by cartwrights manuscript which hed decided to take home with him he stood in the lobby of his office building gazing gloomily at the tanks full of tropical fish in the window of the pet store one tank had as an ornament a china model of a sunken pirate ship it made joe think again of hagbard celine did he trust hagbard or didnt he was it possible to really believe in a hagbard with the captain nemo psychosis brooding over tubes and jars full of bacteria cultures one hairy finger hovering tentatively over a button that would send a torpedo full of anthrax tau germs out into the inky waters of the atlantic within a week all humans would die cartright had said and it was hard to think that cartwright was lying since he knew so much about so many other things when joe got home he put on his favorite museum of national history record the language and music of the wolves and lit up a joint he liked listening to the wolves when he was high and trying to understand their language then he took cartwrights manuscript out of his briefcase and looked at the title page it didnt say a word about consciousness energy indeed it referred to a subject joe found much more interesting how the ancient bavarian conspiracy plotted and carried out the assassinations of malcolm x john f kennedy martin luther kino jr george lincoln rockwell robert kennedy richard m necon george wallace jane fonda gabriel conrad and hank brummer well said joe ill be fucked it was quite a trip said hagbard celine youre quite a tripper miss portinari replied you really did harry coin very well probably just the way hell do it when he gets up the nerve to come see me it was simpler than doing my own trip hagbard said wearily my guilt is much deeper because i know more it was easier to take his guilt trip than to take my own and its over your fur no longer bristles i know who i am and why im here adenine cytosine guanine thymine how did you ever forget hagbard grinned its easy to forget you know that she smiled back blessed be captain blessed be he said returning to his stateroom he was still subdued the vision of the selfbegotten and the serpent eating its own tail had broken the lines of word image and emotional energy that were steering him toward the dark night of the soul again but resolving his personal problem did not rescue the demonstration or help him cope with the oncoming disaster it merely freed him to begin anew it merely reminded him that the end is the beginning and humility is endless it merely merrily turned the wheel another tarottowery connection he realized he was still tripping a little that was readily fixed harry coin was tripping and he wasnt harry coin right now hagbard remembering again who he was and why he was there opened his stateroom door joe malik sat in a chair under an octopus mural and regarded him with a level glance who killed john kennedy joe asked calmly i want a straight answer this time hc hagbard relaxed into another chair smiling gently that one finally registered eh i told john all those years ago to emphasize that you should never trust anyone with the initials hc and yet youve gone on trusting me and never noticing i noticed but it seemed too wild to take seriously john kennedy was killed by a man named harold canvera who lived on fullerton avenue in chicago near the seminary restaurant where you and simon first discussed his theories of numerology dillinger had moved back to that neighborhood for a while in the late fifties because he liked to go to the biograph theatre for old times sake and canvera was his landlord a very sane ordinary rather dull individual then in dallas in john saw him blow the presidents head off before oswald or harry coin or the mafia gun could fire hagbard paused to light a cigar we investigated canvera afterward like scientists investigating the first extraterrestrial life form you can imagine how thorough we were he had no politics at all at the time which puzzled the hell out of us it turned out that canvera had put a lot of money into blue sky inc a firm that made devices for landing on lowgravity planets that was back in the very early fifties finally elsenhowers hostility to the space program drove blue sky to the bottom off the board and canvera sold out at a terrible loss then kennedy came in and announced that the us was going toi put a man on the moon the stocks hed sold were suddenly worth millions canveras brain snapped that was all killing kennedy and getting away with it turned him schizzy finally he went for spiritualism for a while and then later joined white heroes opposing red extremism one the really paranoid antiilluminati groups and ran a telephone message service giving whore propaganda and nobody else ever suspected joe asked canvera is still there in chicago going about his business just another face on the street not quite he was shot a few years ago due to you due to me yes he was one of the subjects in the first aum test he subsequently made the mistake of knocking up the daughter of a local politician it appears that the aum made him susceptible to libertine ideas were gonna rock rock rock till broad daylight you sound very convincing and i almost believe you joe said slowly why all of a sudden why no more putons and runarounds were getting to the chimes at midnight hagbard replied simply with a latin shrug the spell is ending soon the coach turns back to a pumpkin cinderella goes back to the kitchen everybody takes their masks off and the carnival is over i mean it he added his face full of sincerity ask me anything and you get the truth why are you keeping george and me apart why do i have to skulk around the sub like a wanted fugitive and eat with calley and eichmann why dont you want george and me to compare notes hagbard sighed the real explanation for that would take a day youd have to understand the whole celine system first in the baby talk of conventional psychology im taking away georges father figures youre one his first and only boss an older man he trusts and respects i became another very quickly and thats one of the thousand and one reasons i turned the guruhood over to miss portinari he had to confront drake the bad father and lose you and me the good fathers before he could really learn to ball a woman the next step if youre curious is to take the woman away from him temporarily hagbard added quickly dont be so jumpy youve been through a large part of the celine system and it hasnt killed you youre stronger because of it arent you joe nodded accepting this but shot the next question immediately do you know who bombed confrontation yes joe and i know why you did it youre not a thing at all okay then heres the payoff and your answer better be good why are you helping the illuminati to immanentize the eschaton hagbard it steamengines when it comes steamengine time as a very wise man once said jesus joe said wearily i thought i had crossed that pom asinorum when i figured out how you get the goose out of the bottle in the zen riddle you do nothing and wait for the goose to peck its way out just like a chick pecks its way out of an egg i realized do what thou wilt becomes the whole of the law by a mathematical process the equation balances when you realize who the thou is as distinguished from the ordinary you the whole fucking works the universeall of it alive in the same way were alive and mechanical in the same way were mechanical the robot the one more trustworthy than all the buddhas and sages oh christ yes i thought i understood it all but this this this stone fatalism what the hell are we going to ingolstadt for if we cant do anything the coin has two sides its the only coin that comes up at this time but it still has two sides hagbard leaned forward intensely its mechanical and alive let me give you a sexual metaphor since you usually hang out with new york intellectuals you look at a woman across a room and you know youre going to bed with her before the night is over thats mechanical something has happened when your eyes met but the orgasm is organic what it will be like neither of you can predict and i know just as the illuminati know that immanentization is going to happen on may first because of a mechanical process adam weishaupt started on another may first two centuries ago and because of other processes other people started before then and since then but neither i nor the illuminati know what form immanentization will take it doesnt have to be hell on earth it can be heaven on earth and thats why were going to ingolstadt three oclock two oclock one oclock rock i became a cop because of billie freshette well i dont want to jive you that wasnt the whole reason but she sure as hell was one bodacious big part of the reason and thats the curious thing about what finally happened and how milo flanagan assigned me to infiltrate the lincoln park anarchist group getting me in right up to my black ass in all that international intrigue and yogastyle balling with simon moon but maybe i should start over from the beginning again from billie freshette i was a little kid and she was an old woman it was in the early s you see hassan i sabbah x was operating in the open then going around the south side preaching that the greatest of the white magicians had just died recently in england and now the age of the black magicians was beginning everybody thought he was one stonecrazy stud and my father was a cook in a restaurant on halsted he pointed her out to me on the street once it must have been just a while before she went back to the reservation in wisconsin to die see that old woman child she was john dillingers girl friend well i looked and i saw she was really heavy and together and that whatever the law had done to her never broke her but i also saw that sorrow hung around her like a dark halo daddy went on and told me a lot more about her and about dillinger but it was the sorrow that got printed all over every cell in my little baby brain it took years for me to figure it out but what it really meant as an omen or conjure was that she was basically just like the women of the black gang leaders on the south side even if she was an indian theres just one way for a black in chicago and thats to join a gang solidarity forever as simon would say but i dug that there was only one gang that was really safe the biggest gang of all mister charlies boys the motherfucking establishment i guess every black cop has that in the back of his head before he finds out that we never really can join mat gang not as full members anyway i found out quicker being not just black but female so i was in the gang the baddest and heaviest gang but i was always looking for something better the impossible the boss gimmick that would get me off the mans blackandwhite chessboard entirely into some place where i was myself and not just a pawn being moved around at charlies whim otto waterhouse never had that feeling at least not until near the end of the game i never did get inside his head enough to know what was going on there he was a real cop and got into my head almost as soon as we met and i could always feel him watching me waiting for the time when i would round on charlie and go over to the other side so the best i can do in making him is to say that he was no tom in the ordinary sense he didnt screw blacks for the man he screwed blacks for himself it was strictly his own trip otto was my drop after i got assigned to underground work we met in a place that i could always have an excuse to visit a rundown law firm called washington weishaupt budweiser and kief on north clark later for some reason i was never told they changed the name to ruly kempt sheveled and couth and then to weery stale flatt and profitable and to keep up the front they actually did hire a couple of lawyers and did some real law work for a corporation called blue sky inc on april still harboring a cargo of doubt about hagbard joe malik decided to try the simplest method of tarot divination concentrating all his energy on the question he cut the deck and picked out one card that would reveal hagbard celines true nature if the divination worked with a sinking heart he saw that he had come up with the hierophant running the mnemonics simon had taught him joe quickly identified this figure with the number five the hebrew letter vau meaning nail and the traditional interpretation of a false show a hypocrisy or a trick five was the number of grummet the destructive and chaotic end of a cycle vau was the letter associated with quarrels and the meaning nail was often related to the implement of christs death the card was telling him that hagbard was a hypocritical trickster aiming at destruction a murderer of the dreamerredeemer aspect of humanity or taking a more mystical reading as was usually advisable with the tarot hagbard only seemed to be these things and was actually an agent of resurrection and rebirthas christ had to die before he could become the father as in vedanta the false self must be obliterated to join the great self joe swore the card was only reflecting his own uncertainty he rummaged in the bookshelf hagbard had provided for his stateroom and found three books on the tarot the first a popular manual was absolutely useless it identified the hierophant with the letter of religion in contrast to the spirit with conformity and with all the plastic middleclass values hagbard conspicuously lacked the second by a true adept of the tarot just led him back to his own confused reading of the card remarking that the hierophant is mysterious even sinister he seems to be enjoying a very secret joke at somebodys expense the third work raised more doubts it was liber by somebody named mordecai malignatus which vaguely reminded joe that the old east village other chart of the illuminati conspiracy showed a mordecai the foul in charge of the sphere of chaos and mordecai malignatus was a fair latinization of mordecai the foul mordecai joe remembered was according to that halfaccurate and halfdeceptive chart in dual control along with richard nixon then living of the elders of zion the house of rothschild the politburo the federal reserve system the us communist party and students for a democratic society joe flipped the pages to see what the semimythical mord had to say about the hierophant the chapter was brief it was in the book of republicans and sinners and said vau nail the hierophant they nailed love to a cross symbolic of their might but love was undefeated it simply didnt fight five stoned men were in a courtyard when an elephant entered the first man was stoned on sleep and he saw not the elephant but dreamed instead of things unreal to those awake the second man was stoned on nicotine caffeine ddt carbohydrate excess protein deficiency and the other chemicals in the diet which the illuminati have enforced upon the halfawake to keep them from fully waking hey he said theres a big smelly beast in our courtyard the third stoned man was on grass and he said no dads thats the ghostly old party in its true nature the dark nix on the soul and he giggled in a silly way the fourth stoned man was tripping on peyote and he said you see not the mystery for the elephant is a poem written in tons instead of words and his eyes danced the fifth stoned man was on acid and he said nothing merely worshipping the elephant in silence as the father of buddha and then the hierophant entered and drove a nafl of mystery into all their hearts saying you are all elephants nobody understood him at eight oclock in ingolstadt an unscheduled group called the cargo cult managed to get the mike and began blasting out their own outerspace arrangement of an old childrens song shell be coming round the mountain when she comes shell be coming round the mountain when she comes and in washington where it was still only two in the afternoon the white house was in flames while the national guard machinegunned an armed mob crossing the mall in front of the washington monument a single finger pointing upward in an eloquent and vulgar gesture which only the illuminati knew meant fuck you in los angeles where it was eleven in the morning the bombs started to go off in police stations and in lehman cavern markoff chaney disgustedly pointed out a graffito to saul and barney help stamp out sizeism take a midget to lunch you see he demanded thats supposed to be funny its not funny at all not one damned bit shell be driving six white horses shell be driving six white horses shell be driving six white horses when she comes on april hagbard invited george to join him on the bridge of the leif erikson they had been sailing through a smoothwalled tubular passage that was completely filled with water and was both underground and below sea level it had been built by the atlanteans and not only had survived the catastrophe but had been maintained in good condition for the next thirty thousand years by the illuminati there was even a salt lock located roughly under lyon france which served to keep the salt water of the atlantic out of the further reaches of the passage and the underground freshwater sea of valusia the underground waterways were connected with many lakes in switzerland bavaria and eastern europe hagbard explained and if salt water were found in all of those lakes the existence of the weird subsurface world of the illuminati would be suspected as the submarine approached a huge circular hatchway barring the passage hagbard turned off the devices that rendered the craft indetectable immediately the enormous round metal door swung toward them wont the illuminati know weve activated this machinery said george no this works automatically said hagbard its never occurred to them that anyone else might use this passageway but they know you could and you guessed wrong about their spiderships being able to detect you hagbard whirled on george a hairy arm lifted to punch him in the chest shut up about the fucking spiderships i dont want to hear any more about the spiderships portinaris running the show now and she says its safe okay commander youre out of your fucking mind george said firmly hagbard laughed his shoulders slumping slightly in relaxation all right you can get off the sub any time you want to well just open the hatch and let you swim out youre out of your fucking mind but im stuck with you said george clapping hagbard on the shoulder youre either on the sub or off the sub said hagbard watch this the leif erikson had sailed through the round metal gateway which closed behind it here the ceiling of the underwater passage was about fifty feet higher than it had been in the section they just left and the tunnel was only partially filling with water the air seemed to be coming from vents in the ceiling there was another metal hatchway in the distance down the tunnel this lock is pretty big george said the illuminati must have sailed some enormous submarines through here and animals said hagbard the hatchway ahead of them opened and fresh water came pouring in the water level in the lock rose until it i reached the ceiling and the leif eriksons engines turned over and began to propel it forward once more now george is writing in his diary again april and what the hell does it mean to say that life shouldnt change too rapidly how fast is evolution do you measure it in terms of lifetime a year is more than a lifetime to many kinds of animals while seventy years is an hour in the lifetime of a sequoia and the universe is only ten billion years old how fast do ten billion years go to a god they might go very fast indeed they might all happen at once suppose the lifetime of your typical basic god was a hundred quintillion years the whole lifetime of this universe would be to him no more than the amount of time it takes us to watch a movie so from the point of view of a god or of the universe things evolve very quickly its like one of those walt disney films where you watch a plant growing before your eyes and the whole cycle from bud to fruit takes about two minutes to a god life is a single organism proliferating in all directions all over the earth and now on the moon and mars and the whole process from the first of the protobionts to george dorn and fellow humans takes no longer than hagbards voice over the intercom jolted him out of his reverie come on back up george theres more to see this time mavis was on the bridge with hagbard as george entered hagbard withdrew his hand from her left breast in an unhurried movement george wanted to kill hagbard but he was thankful that he hadnt seen mavis touching hagbard in any sexual way that would have been past bearing he might have tested his newfound courage by taking a poke at hagbard and goddess only knows what karate or yoga or magic would be the response besides mavis and hagbard must be balling all the time who else but hagbard would a woman like mavis take for her regular lover who else but hagbard could satisfy her mavis greeted george with a comradely hug that made the entire front of his body ache hagbard pointed to an inscription carved into the wall of the cave there was a row of symbols that george didnt recognize but above them was something quite familiar a circle with a downwardpointing trident carved inside it the peace symbol said george i didnt know it was that old in the days when it was put up there said hagbard it was called the cross of lilith velkor and its meaning is simply that anyone who attempts to thwart the illuminati will suffer from the most horrible torture the illuminati can devise lilith velkor was one of the first of their victims they crucified her on a revolving cross that looked very much like that you told me it wasnt really a peace symbol said george looking wistfully back at the carving but i didnt know what you meant there was a dirigensgrade illuminatus in bertrand russells circle who put it in somebodys mind that the circle and trident would be a good symbol for the aldermaston marchers to carry it was very cleverly and subtly done if the committee for nuclear disarmament had thought about it what did they need any kind of a symbol for but russell and his people fell for it what they didnt know was that the circleandtrident had been a traditional symbol of evil among lefthandpath satanists for thousands of years so many rightwingers are secret lefthandpath magicians and satanists that of course they spotted the symbol for what it was right away that made them think the illuminati were behind the peace movement which threw them off the track and they accused the peaceniks of using a satanist symbol which to a small extent discredited the peace movement a cute gambit why is it there on the wall said george the inscription warns the passerby to purify his heart because he is about to enter the sea of valusia which belongs exclusively to the illuminati traveling across the sea of valusia you come eventually to the underground port of agharti which was the first illuminati refuge after the atlantean catastrophe we are emerging into the sea of valusia right now watch hagbard gestured and george watched openmouthed as the walls of the cave that closed around them fell away they were sailing out of the tunnel but what they seemed to be entering was an infinite fog the television cameras and their laser waveguides penetrated just as far into this lightless ocean that they were about to navigate as they had into the atlantic but this ocean was neither blue nor green but gray it was a gray that seemed to extend infinitely in all directions like an overcast sky it was impossible to gauge distance the farthest depth of the gray around them might be hundreds of miles away or it might be right outside the submarine wheres the bottom he asked too far below us to see said mavis the top of this ocean is just a little above the level of the bottom of the atlantic youre so smart said hagbard pinching her buttock and causing george to flinch dont pay any attention to him george said mavis hes a little bit nervous and its making him silly shut the fuck up said hagbard beginning to feel anxious himself wondering if the noble mind of hagbard celine was being overthrown by the weight of responsibility george turned to look out at the empty ocean now he saw that it wasnt quite empty fish swam by some large some small many of them grotesque all were totally eyeless an octopoidal monster with extremely long slender tentacles drifted past the submarine feeling for its prey there was a covering of fine hairs on the tips of the tentacles a small fish also blind swam close enough to one tentacle to set up a current that disturbed the hairs instantly the octopuss whole body moved in that direction the disturbed tentacle wrapped itself around the hapless fish and several others joined in to help scoop it up the octopus devoured the fish in three bites george was glad to see that at least the blood of these creatures was red the door behind them opened and harry coin stepped out onto the bridge morning everybody i was just wondering if i might find miss mao up here shes doing her stint in navigation right now said hagbard but stay here and have a look at the sea of valusia harry harry looked all around slowly and thoughtfully then shook his head you know theres times when i start to think youre doing this what do you mean harry asked mavis you know harry waved a long snakelike hand doing this like a sciencefiction movie youve just got us in an abandoned hotel somewheres and youve got a big engine in the basement that shakes the whole place and here youve got some movie cameras only they point at the screen instead of away from you if you know what i mean rear projection said hagbard tell me harry what difference would it make if it wasnt real harry thought a moment his chinless face sour we wouldnt have to do what we think we have to do but even if we dont have to do what we think we have to do it wont make any difference if we do it which means we should just go ahead mavis sighed just go ahead just go ahead said hagbard a powerful mantra and if we dont go ahead said george it doesnt matter either which means that we just do go ahead another powerful mantra said hagbard just do go ahead george noticed a small speck in the distance as it got closer he reccognized it he shook his head was there no end to the surrealism hed been subjected to in the last six days a dolphin wearing scuba gear hi manfriends said howards voice over the loudspeaker on the bridge george cast a glance at harry coin the former assassin was standing openmouthed and limp with astonishment greetings howard said hagbard how goes it with the nazis dead sleeping whatever it is they are i have a whole porpoise horde most of the atlantean adepts watching them and ready to perform other tasks as needed i hope said hagbard ready indeed said howard he turned a somersault all right said harry coin softly all right he said more firmly its a talking fish but why the hell is it wearing an oxygen tank and breathing through a fucking mask i see we have a new friend on the bridge said howard i got the mask from hagbards onshore representative at fernando poo after all a porpoise has to breathe air and there is no surface in most of this underground ocean its water all the way to the top of the cavernous chambers that contain it the only place i can get air near here is by swimming up to the top of lake totenkopf the lake totenkopf monster said george with a laugh well moor the submarine in lake totenkopf later today said hagbard howard id like you and your people to stand by tonight and tomorrow night tomorrow night be ready to do a lot of hard physical work meanwhile stay out of the way of the nazis the protection theyre under is particularly aimed at sea animals since that was the presumed greatest danger to them well have oxygen equipment as needed for any of your people who want it tell them to try to avoid surfacing on the lake unless absolutely necessary we dont want to attract more attention than we have to i salute you in the name of the porpoise horde said howard hail and farewell he swam away a little later sailing on they saw in the distance an enormous reptile with four paddles for swimming and a neck twice the length of its body it was in hot pursuit of a school of blind fish the loch ness monster said hagbard and george remembered his little joke about howards surfacing in lake totenkopf one of gruads genetic experiments with reptiles hagbard went on he was really queer for reptiles he filled the sea of valusia with these plesiosaurlike things blind of course so they could navigate in darkness think about that eyes are a liability under certain conditions graud figured monsters like that would be another protection against anybody finding agharti but the leif erikson is too big for nessie to tangle with and she knows it at last there was a column of yellow light ahead this was the light let into the sea of valusia by lake totenkopf hagbard explained that the lake was simply a place where the ceiling of rock over the sea of valusia had been soft and unstable enough to collapse the resulting hole being at sea level filled with water debris falling down through the bottom of the lake had formed a mountain below the place where the roof of the sea of valusia was punctured the jesuits of course always knew that lake totenkopf connected with the sea of valusia and thus made possible easy contact with agharti hagbard said thats why when they gave weishaupt the assignment of founding an overt branch of the illuminati they sent him to ingolstadt which is right by lake totenkopf and theres the mountain under the lake it loomed ahead of them dark and forbidding as the submarine sailed over it george saw a cloud of dolphins circling in the distance the mountain top had been sheared off in a fashion that seemed too precise to be natural it formed a plateau about two miles long and one mile wide there were what appeared to be dark squares on this gray plateau the submarine swooped down and george saw that the squares were huge formations of men in a moment they were hovering over the army like a helicopter observing troops on parade george could clearly see the black uniforms the green tanks with blackandwhite crosses painted on them the long dark upjutting snouts of big guns they stood there silent and immobile thousands of feet below the surface of the lake thats the weapon the illuminati plan to use to immanentize the eschaton asked george why dont we destroy them now because theyre under a protective biomystic field said hagbard and we cant i did want you to see them though when the electrical astral and orgonomic vibrations of the american medical association amplified by the synergetic clusters of sound image and emotional energy of all these young people responding to the beat bring that nazi legion back to life it will call for nothing less than the appearance on the field of battle of the goddess eris herself to save the day hagbard george protested disgustedly are you telling me eris is real really real and not just an allegory or symbol i cant buy that any more than i can believe jehovah or osiris is really real but hagbard answered very solemnly when youre dealing with these forces or powers in a philosophic and scientific way contemplating them from an armchair that rationalistic approach is useful it is quite profitable then to regard the gods and goddesses and demons as projections of the human mind or as unconscious aspects of ourselves but every truth is a truth only for one place and one time and thats a truth as i said for the armchair when youre actually dealing with these figures the only safe pragmatic and operational approach is to treat them as having a being a will and a purpose entirely apart from the humans who evoke them if the sorcerers apprentice had understood that he wouldnt have gotten into so much trouble shell be wearing red pajamas shell be wearing red pajamas shell be wearing red pajamas when she comes approaching the outskirts of the crowd fission chips saw a group of musicians who were obviously english from their dress and hair style their name he saw on the biggest drum was calculated tedium and the guitar play had a canteen strapped to his hip it reminded of how thirsty he was and he asked pardon me do you know where i could get some water or a soft drink take a snort from my canteen the guitarist said affably passing it over he pointed to the west see that geodesic plywood dome there its a bleeding giant kool aid station set up by the kabouters and guaranteed to hold out even if the crowd doubles in size before this is over i just filled the canteen from there so its fresh you can get more over there any time you need it thanks said warmly taking a long cold delightful swallow he had a very low threshhold for lsd the world began to seem brighter stranger and more colorful within only a few minutes the joker was actually rhoda chief the vocalist who sang with the heads of easter island and who had inspired much admiration in the younger generationand much horror in the older when she named her outofwedlock baby jesus jehovah lucifer satan chief a former processene and scientologist currently going the wicca route the buxom rhoda was renowned through show biz for giving head like no chick alive a reputation which often provoked certain satanists on the linda lovelace for president committee to send very deadly vibes in her direction all of which bounced off due to her wicca shield she was also possibly the greatest singer of her generation and firmly believed that most human problems would be solved if the whole world could be turned on to acid she had been preparing for the ingolstadt festival for several months buying only the topquality tabs from the most reliable dealers and she had crept into the geodesic koolaid station only a few moments earlier dumping enough pure lysergic acid diethylamicte to blow the minds of the population of a small country actually the idea had been subtly planted in her consciousness by the leader of her wiccan an astonishingly beautiful woman with flaming red hair and smoldering green eyes who had once played a starring role in a black mass celebrated by padre pederastia at lake shore drive this woman called herself lady velkor and often made jokes about her memories of thcentury bavaria which rhoda assumed were references to reincarnation on april while howard made his discovery in the ruins of atlantis and tlaloc grinned in mexico df tobias knight in his room at the hotel pan kreston in santa isobel concluded a broadcast to the american submarine in the bight of biafra the russkies and chinks have completed their withdrawal and generalissimo puta is definitely friendly to our side besides being popular with both the bubi and the fang my work is definitely finished and ill await orders to return to washington roger over and out frank sullivan capitalizing on his only real asset was operating in havana as a cuban superman using the name papa piaba when the brotherhood spotted his resemblance to john dillinger gosh he said when they made the offer five thousand dollars just to take two ladies to a movie one night and its only a practical joke you say itll be a very funny joke jaicapo mocenigo promised him and the smithsonian acquired mr sullivans asset as one of their most interesting relics well kill the old red rooster hagbard was accompanied by joe malik when he returned to the stateroom you go to the beer hall in munich he was saying and steal any item anything at all as long as its obviously old enough to have been there the night he tried the putsch then you rejoin the rest of us in ingolstadt understood well kill the old red rooster lady velkor wearing a green peasant blouse and green hotpants looked around the geodesic koolaid dome a man in a green turtleneck sweater and green slacks caught her eye and she walked over to him asking are you a turtle you bet your sweet ass i am he answered eagerly and so she had failed to make contact and owed this oaf a free drink also but she smiled pleasantly and concealed her annoyance well kill the old red rooster when she comes robinson and lehrman of the homicide department actually started the last phase of the operation i was in new york to see hassan i sabbah x about a new phase of laotian opium operation i had just come from chicago after staging that conversation with waterhouse for miss servixs benefit and i decided to check with them for those little nuances that cant go into an official report we met in washington square and found a bench far enough from the chess nuts to give us some privacy muldoon is on to us robinson told me right off he was wearing a beard i figured that meant he was currently in a weather underground group since he was too old to pass for under twentyone and get into morituri are you sure i asked he made the usual reply whos ever sure of anything in this business but barney is pure cop through and through he added and his instincts are like dowsing rods everybody on the force knows weve infiltrated them by now anyway they even make jokes about it whos the cia man in your department that kind of thing muldoon is on to us all right lehrman agreed but hes not the one i worry about who is i brushed my walrus mustache nervously being the first pentuple agent in the history of espionage was starting to grind me down i really wasnt sure which of my bosses should hear about this although the cia certainly had to be told since for all i know robinson and lehnnan might be reporting to them twice having another contact as a failsafe check on my own integrity the head of homicide north lehnnan said an old geezer named goodman hes so damned smart i sometimes wonder if hes a double agent for the eye themselves his mind jumps ahead of facts just like an adeptus exemptus in the order i looked up at the statue of garibaldi remembering the old nyu myth that he would pull his sword the rest of the way out of the scabbard if a virgin ever walked through washington park tell me more about this goodman i said check out the pair on that chick a superman said enthusiastically watermelons a second superman agreed enthusiastically and you know how us cullud folk dig watermelons he added licking his lips skin the first cried skin the second agreed they slapped palms and clark kent came out of his reverie having sampled the koolaid a while earlier he was beginning to float a little although not yet aware of what was happeninghe just felt a rather unusual tug of memory from his days as an anthropologist and was deeply concerned with a new insight about the relationship between the black virgin of guadalupe the greek goddess persephone and his own sexual proclivitiesand he came out of it with a start looking at the woman whose breasts had inspired such reverence son of a bitch he said piously his mouth spreading in a grin rebecca goodman left the house at pm hauling a shopping cart and walking past the garage the nearest supermarket was a good ten minutes on foot and big enough to keep her busy for a halfhour finding what she wanted and getting through one of those checkout lines i slipped out of the car and walked right to the back of the house perfectly secure from neighboring eyes in my bell telephone overalls the kitchen door had an easy sliplock and i didnt even need my keys a playing card did the job and i was in my first thought was to head for the bedroom the old man from vienna was right and thats where youll find the real clues to a mans character but one chair in the kitchen stopped me the vibes were so strong that i closed my eyes and psychometered it according to the difficult third alko of the aa it was rebecca herself she had sat there and thought about shooting heroin it faded fast before i could read what had stopped her the bedroom almost knocked me over when i found it who would have thought the old man had so much hot blood in him i paraphrased backing out it was a profan ation to read too much in there and what i did scan was enough as miss mao would say this man was taoyin beta prime in the terminology of the i no wonder rob inson kept talking about his intuition the living room had a statue of the mermaid of copenhagen that stopped me i read it and chuckled lord the hangups we all have one wall was a builtin bookcase but rebecca seemed to be the reader in the family i started scanning experimentally and found sauls vibes on a shelf of detective stories and a scientific american anthology of mathematical and logical puzzles the man had no concept of his own latent powers and thought only in terms of solving riddles sherlock holmes without even the violin and the dope for relief from all that cortical activity everything else went into his marriage that hothouse bedroom upstairs no there was a sketchpad on the coffee table his according to the aura i flipped pages rapidly all detailed precise perfectly naturalistic mostly faces criminals he had dealt with professionally all touched with a perception and compassion that he kept out of his work hours trees in central park nudes of rebecca adoration in every line of the pencil a surprising face of a black kid with some harem slum building in the backgroundanother touch of unexpected compassion then a switchthe first abstract it was a star of david basically but he had started adding energetic waves coming out of it and the descending triangle was shadedsomewhere in the back of his head he had been working out the symbolism and coming amazingly close to the truth more faces of obvious criminal types a scene in the catskills with rebecca reading a book under a tree something wrong gloom and fear in the shading i closed my eyes and concentrated the picture came in with a second woman i opened my eyes sweating it was his first wife and she had died of cancer he was afraid of losing rebecca too but she was young and healthy another man he thought she might leave him for a younger man well that was the key then i flipped a few more pages and saw a unicornsome more of the unconscious work that went into that erotic star of david a quick scan of rebeccas books then mostly anthropology mostly african i took one off the shelf and held it eros again thinly sublimated the other part of the key as hassan i sabbah x once remarked to me breathes there a white woman with soul so dead she never yearned for a black in her bed i returned everything to its place carefully and headed for the back door i stopped in the kitchen to read the chair again since relapse is as much a part of the syndrome in heroin addiction as in blacklung disease this time i found what stopped her if i say love ill sound sentimental and if i say sex ill sound cynical ill call it pair bonding and sound scientific slipping back into my car i checked the time elapsed seventeen minutes it would have taken several hours to unearth as many facts by ordinary detection methods and they would have been different less significant facts aa training has certainly made all my other jobs easier there was only one remaining problem i didnt want to kill anybody at this point and a bombing would only get muldoon in even having malik disappear might only bring in missing persons then i remembered the dummies used by the clothier on the eighteenth floor right above the confrontation office burn the dummy just right before setting the bomb and it might work i drove back toward manhattan whistling hohoho whos got the last laugh now the bomb went off at am one week later simon leaving ohare airport where it was am decided he still had time to get to the friendly stranger and meet that cute lady cop who had so cleverly infiltrated the nameless anarchist horde he could get her into bed easily enough since female spies always expect men to reveal secrets when theyre in the dreamy afterglow with their guard down he would teach her some sexual yoga he decided and see what secrets she might slip but he remembered the midnight conference at the un building after the bomb was set and maliks grim words if were right about this we might all be dead before woodstock europa opens next week are you a turtle lady velkor asks again approaching another man in green no he says i have no armor she smiles as she murmurs blessed be and he replies blessed be doris horus heard the voice behind her say and hows the miskatonic messalina and her heart leaped not believing it but when she turned it was him stack jesus one superman said to another does he personally know all the goodlooking white chicks in the world the senate and the people of rome were still tussling with attila and his huns but hermie speed king trismegistos drummer with the credibility gap watched placidly from only a few feet away seeing them as a very complicated almost mathematical ballet he was concerned only with determining whether they illustrated the eternal warfare of set and osiris or the joining of atoms to make molecules he knew he was on acid but what the hell that must have been the koolaid another of tyl eulenspiegels merry pranks the submarine rose above the plateau lifting into the waters of lake totenkopf mooring it well below the surface on the shore opposite ingolstadt hagbard and about thirty of his crew entered scuba launches and buzzed to the surface parked on a road beside the lake was a line of cars led by a magnificent bugatti royale hagbard grandly ushered george stella and harry coin into the enormous car george was shocked to see that the chauffeur was a man whose face was covered with gray fur it was a long drive around the lake to the town of ingolstadt it was very much as george had imagined it all turrets and spires and gothic towers mixed with modernmartian edifices straight from mad avenue but most of the buildings looking like they had been put up in the days of prince henry the fowler this place is full of beautiful buildings said hagbard the big gothic cathedral in the center of town is called the liebfrauenminister theres another rococo church called the maria victoriaive always wanted to get stoned on acid and go look at the carvings theyre so intricate have you been here before hagbard harry asked on scouting missions i know where all the good places are tonight youre all going to be my guests at the schlosskeller in ingolstadt castle we have to be your guests said george none of us have any money if you have flax said hagbard you can pay in flax at the schlosskeller they went first to the donau hotel which hagbard said was the most modern and comfortable in ingolstadt where hagbard had reserved almost all the rooms for his people with every hotel in ingolstadt bursting at the seams it had taken a huge advance payment to bring this off the hotels staff jumped to attention when they saw the line of cars with hagbards splendid bugatti in the vanguard even in a town crowded with celebrities overrun with wealthy rock musicians and affluent rock fans from all over the world a machine like hagbards commanded respect george following hagbard into the lobby suddenly found himself face to face with two ancient bent german men one with a long white mustache and a lock of white hair that fell over his forehead said in heavily accented english get out of my way degenerate jewish communist homosexual the other old man winced and said something placating to his colleague in a soft voice the first man waved his hand in dismissal and they tottered toward the elevators together several more old men joined them as george watched too surprised to be angry here though in the fatherland of that kind of mentality the old mans hatred seemed historical curiosity to him more than anything else doubtless such men as that had actually seen hitler in the flesh hagbard grandly took a handful of room keys from the desk clerk for simplicitys sake ive assigned a man and a woman to each room he said as he passed them out choose your roommates and switch around as you like when you get up to your rooms youll find suitable bavarian peasant costumes laid out on the bed please put them on stella and george went upstairs together george unlocked the door and surveyed the large room with its two double beds on top of one lay a mans outfit of lederhosen with silk shirt and knee socks while on the other bed was a womans peasant skirt blouse and vest costumes stella said hagbards really crazy she shut the door and tugged at the zipper of her onepiece gold knit pantsuit she had nothing on underneath she smiled as george regarded her with admiration when the group was assembled in the lobby only stella looked good in costume of the men hagbard looked most natural and happy in lederhosenwhich was perhaps why hed had the notion of dressing that way long skinny harry looked ridiculous and uncomfortable but his bucktoothed grin showed he was trying to be a good sport george looked around wheres mavis he asked hagbard she didnt come with us shes back minding the store hagbard raised his arm imperiously on to the schlosskeller the ingolstadt castle a battlemented medieval building built on a hill had a magnificent restaurant in what had formerly been either a dungeon or a wine cellar or both hagbard had reserved the entire cellar for the evening here he said well rally our forces around us have some fun and prepare for the morrow he seemed in an agitated almost giddy mood he took his place at the center of a big table in a blackened carved chair that looked like a bishops throne on the wall behind him was a famous painting it depicted the holy roman emperor henry iv barefoot in the snow at canossa but with one foot on the neck of pope gregory the great who lay prone his tiara knocked off his face ignominiously buried in a snowdrift the story goes that this was commissioned by the notorious bavarian jester tyl eulenspiegel when he was at the height of his fortunes hagbard said later when he was old and penniless he was hanged for his anarchistic attitudes and his low bavarian sense of humor so it goes shell be wearing red pajamas there he is markoff chancy whispers tensely saul and barney lean forward peering at the figure ahead

in ingolstadt that walpurgisnacht was nothing less than the appearance of a giant sea serpent in lake totenkopf the beast she insisted turned took its own tail in its mouth and gradually dwindled to a dot giving off good vibes and flashes of astral light as it diminished there were many empty places at the big table when the discordians sat down hagbard seemed in no hurry to order dinner instead he called for round after round of the local beer of which enormous stocks had been laid in to prepare for the great rock festival george stella and harry coin sat together near hagbard and george and harry discussed sodomy objectively between long thoughtful pauses and deep drinking hagbard sent the beer around so fast that george frequently had to swill down a whole stein in a minute or two just to keep up various people came in and sat down at empty places at the table george shook hands with a man around thirty who introduced himself as simon moon he had a lovely black woman with him named mary lou servix simon immediately began telling everybody about a fantastic novel he had been reading on the plane coming over george was interested until he found out that the book was telemachus sneezed by atlanta hope he didnt see how anyone could take trash like that seriously just around the time george was finishing his tenth stein of ingolstadts fabled beer and feeling quite woozy a man who looked very familiar floated into his line of vision the man wore a brown suit and hornrimmed glasses and his gray hair was crewcut george the man shouted yes its me joe said george of course its me thats you joe isnt it he turned to harry coin thats the guy who sent me down to mad dog to investigate harry laughed my god said joe whats happened to you george he looked vaguely frightened a lot of things said george how many years has it been since ive seen you joe years its been seven days george i saw you just before you caught the plane to texas what have you been doing george shook his finger you were holding out on me joe you wouldnt be here now if you didnt know a lot more than you claimed to when you sent me to mad dog maybe good old hagbard can tell you what ive been doing theres good old hagbard looking over at us from his end of the table right now what do you say hagbard do you know good old joe malik hagbard lifted a huge ornamented stein of beer which the management of the schlosskeller had provided him as an honored guest it was adorned with elaborate basreliefs of pagan woodland scenes including tumescent satyrs pursuing chubby nymphs how you doing malik called hagbard great hagbard just great said joe were gonna save the earth arent we joe hagbard yelled gonna save the earth that right jesus saves said george he began to sing ive got the peace that passeth understanding down in my heart down in my heart down in my heart ive got the peace that passeth understanding down in my heart down in my hearttostay hagbard and stella laughed and applauded harry coin shook his head and muttered takes me back sure does take me back joe took a few steps away from george moving so he could face hagbard across the table what do you mean save the earth hagbard looked at him stupidly his mouth hanging open if you dont know that why are you here i just want to know were going to save the earth but are we going to save the people what people the people that live on the earth oh those people said hagbard sure sure were gonna save everybody stella frowned this is the silliest conversation ive ever heard hagbard shrugged stella honey why dont you go on back to the leif erikson well fuck you charley stella stood up and flounced off her peasant skirt swinging at that moment a little walleyed man tapped joe on the shoulder sit down joe have a drink sit down with george and me ive seen you before said joe perhaps come sit down lets have some of this good bavarian beer it has great integrity have you ever tried it waitress the newcomer snapped his fingers impatiently all the while staring owlishly at joe through lenses as thick as the bottoms of beer glasses joe let himself be led to a chair you look exactly like jeanpaul sartre said joe as he sat down ive always wanted to meet jeanpaul sartre sorry to disappoint you then joe said the man put your hand into my side mal baby joe cried attempting to embrace the apparition and ending up hugging himself while george blearyeyed stared and shook his head am i glad to see you here joe went on but how come youre doing jeanpaul sartre instead of your hairy taxi driver this is a good cover said malaclypse people would expect jeanpaul sartre to be here covering the worlds biggest rock festival from an existentialist point of view on the other hand this is lon chaney jr country and if i started showing up as sylvan martiset with a face covered with fur id have a mob of peasants carrying torches looking for me all over town i saw a hairy chauffeur today said george do you suppose it was lon chancy jr dont worry george said malaclypse with a smile the hairy people are on our side really said joe he looked around hagbard celine was the hairiest person at the table his fingers hands and bare forearms were black with hair the stubble of his beard came high up on his cheekbones just below his eyes on the back of his neck the hair didnt stop growing but continued down into his collar stripped joe thought the man must look like a bear rug many of the other people at the table had long hair or afro haircuts and the men had beards and mustaches joe remembered miss maos hairy armpits the peasant blouses on the women in this room hid their armpits from examination george of course had that shoulderlength blond hair that made him look like a giotto angel but joe thought what about me im not hairy at all i keep my hair in a crew cut because i prefer it that way where does that leave me what difference does hair make he asked malaclypse hair is the most important thing in this society said george ive tried repeatedly to explain that to you joe and youve always never listened hair is the whole thing hair in this society at this moment is a symbol said malaclypse however there is a real aspect to hair which enables me for instance to look around this room and surmise that many of these people are enemies of the illuminati you see all humans were once furbearing joe nodded i saw that in the movie oh yes you saw when atlantis ruled the earth didnt you said malaclypse well hairlessness youll recall was gruads peculiarity most of the people whom the illuminati permitted to live and to eventually become recivilized illuminatistyle were mated with or raped by descendants of gruad but the furbearing gene found in all humans before the catastrophe has not disappeared it is quite common in enemies of the illuminati my suspicion is that if we knew the histories of elf and the discordians and the jams wed find that they go back to atlantean origins and preserve to some extent the genes of gruads foes im inclined to believe that hairy people in whom the genes of atlanteans other than gruad predominate are inherently predisposed to antiilluminati activities conversely people who work against the illuminati are also likely to favor lots of hair these factors have given rise to legends about werewolves vampires beastmen of all kinds abominable snowmen and furry demons note the general success of the illuminati propaganda campaign to portray all such hirsute beings as fearsome and evil the propensity for hairiness among antiilluminati types also explains why lots of hair is a common characteristic of bohemians beatniks leftists generally scientists artists and hippies all such people tend to make good recruits for the antiilluminati organizations sometimes we make it sound as if the illuminati were the only menace on earth said joe isnt it equally possible that people who are opposed to the illuminati may be dangerous oh yes indeed said malaclypse good and evil are two ends of the same street but the street was built by the illuminati they had excellent reasons from their viewpoint to preach the christian ethic to the masses you know what is john guilt joe remembered what hed said to jim cartwright several years ago sometimes i wonder if were not all working for them one way or another he hadnt meant it at the time but now he realized it was probably true he might be doing the illuminatis work right now when he thought he was saving the human race just as celine might be doing the will of the illuminati while thinking that he was preserving the earth george blearyeyed and smiling said whered you meet sheriff jim joe joe stared at him what hairlessness is the reason why gruad and his successors were partial to reptiles said malaclypse adjusting his thick glasses they had a real feeling of kinship one of their symbols was a serpent with its tail in its mouth which was intended to refer both to gruads ophidian assassins and to his other experiments with reptilian lifeforms joe still shaken by georges question yet not wanting to probe further in that direction said all kinds of myths involving serpents crop up in all parts of the world all of them go back to gruad said malaclypse the serpent symbol and the atlantean catastrophe gave rise to the myth that adam and eve tempted by the serpent fell into misery when they acquired the knowledge of good and evil just as atlantis fell through the moralistic ideology of gruad the serpentscientist then theres the old norse myth of the world serpent with its tail in its mouth that holds the universe together the illuminati serpent symbol was also the origin of the brazen serpent of moses the plumed serpent of the aztecs and their legend of the eagle devouring the snake the caduceus of mercury st patrick casting the snakes out of ireland various baltic tales of the serpent king legends of dragons the monster guarding the fabulous treasure at the bottom of the rhine the loch ness monster and a whole raft of other stories connecting serpents with the supernatural in fact the name gruad comes from an atlantean word that translates variously as worm serpent or dragon depending on context id say he was all three said joe from what i know george said i saw the loch ness monster today hagbard called it a she which surprised me but this is the first ive heard about this serpent business i thought the illuminati symbol was an eye in a pyramid the big eye is their most important symbol said malaclypse but it isnt the only one the rosy cross is another but most widely copied is the serpent symbol the eye in the pyramid and the serpent are often seen in combination together they represent the sea monster leviathan whose tentacles are depicted as serpents and whose central body is shown as an eye in a pyramid since each of leviathans tentacles is said to have an independent brain thats not half bad the swastika which was a pretty important symbol around these parts some decades ago was originally a stylized drawing of leviathan and his many tentacles early versions of it have more than four hooks and they often include a triangle sometimes even an eyeandtriangle in the center a common transitional form is a triangle with the sides extended and then hooked to form tentacle shapes there are two tentacles for each of the three angles which yields a twentythree polish archeologists found a swastika painted in a cave the drawing dated back to cromagnon times not long after the fall of atlantis and there were twentythree swirling tentacles around a beautifully executed pyramid with an ocher eye in its center george held his breath mavis had come into the room instead of the peasantskirt outfit hagbard had decreed she was wearing what might have been called hot lederhosen a very short very tight pair of leather breeches that made her legs look fantastically long and underlined the round curves of her ass wow thats some attractive woman said joe dont you know her asked george well that puts me one up on you youre going to meet her mavis came over and george said mavis this is joe malik the guy who put me in the cell you got me out of thats a little unfair joe said taking maviss hands with a smile but i did send him down to mad dog excuse me said mavis i want to talk with hagbard she disengaged her hand and walked away both joe and george looked stricken malaclypse merely smiled just then a tall sternlooking black man came into the room he too was wearing bavarian peasant costume he went up to hagbard and shook hands hey its otto waterhouse the infamous killer cop and cop killer roared hagbard swilling down beer from his huge stein waterhouse looked pained for a moment then sat down and surveyed the room through narrowed eyes wheres my stella he demanded gruffly george felt his hackles rise he knew he had no right of possession where stella was concerned but then neither did this guy exclusive possession seemed the one type of sexual relationship not practiced among the discordians and their allies there was a kind of tribal general love among them which didnt prevent anybody from sleeping with anybody else an unsympathetic observer might call it promiscuity but that word as george understood it meant using anothers body for sex without feeling anything for the person you were physically involved with the discordians were all too close too concerned about each other as people for the word promiscuity to fit their sex lives and george loved them all hagbard mavis stella the other discordians joe even harry coin maybe even otto waterhouse who had just appeared mavis said stellas gone down to the submarine otto shell join us at the proper time hagbard suddenly lurched to his feet quiet he roared a silence fell around the smoky room people stared at hagbard curiously were all here now he said so i got an announcement to make i want you to all join me in drinking to an engagement announcement engagement somebody called incredulously shut the fuck up hagbard snarled im talking and if anybody interrupts me again ill throw them out yes im talking about an engagement to be married day after tomorrow when the eschaton has been immanentized and all of this is over lift your steins mavis and i will be married aboard the leif erikson by miss portinari george sat there still for a moment absorbing it looking at hagbard he looked from hagbard to mavis and tears started to well up in his eyes he stood and lifted his stein heres to ya hagbard he said and he drew his arm back in a sidearm motion so as not to spill any of the beer and then let the whole stein fly at hagbards head laughing hagbard swayed to one side a movement so casual it didnt appear that he was ducking the stein struck the painted head of emperor henry iv the painting apparently had been done on a heavy board because the stein smashed to bits without marking it a waiter rushed forward to wipe the beer away looking reproachfully at george sorry said george hate to damage a work of art you should have kept your head in place hagbard it would have been less of a loss he took a deep breath and roared sinners sinners in the hands of an angry god you are all spiders in the hand of the lord he held out his hand palm upward and he holds you over a fiery pit george turned his palm over he noticed suddenly that everyone in the room was silent and looking at him then he passed out falling into the arms of joe malik beautiful said hagbard exquisite is that what you meant by taking the woman away from him said joe angrily as he eased george into a chair youre a sadistic prick thats only the first step said hagbard and i said it was temporary did you see the way he threw that stein his aim was perfect he would have brained me if i hadnt known it was coming he should have said joe you mean you were lying about you and mavis getting married you were just saying that to bug george he certainly was not said mavis hagbard and i have both had it with this catchascatchcan single life and ill never find another man who more perfectly fits my value system than hagbard i dont need anybody else as if to prove that she meant what she said she knelt abruptly and kissed hagbards hairy left instep a new mysticism simon cried the leftfoot path joe looked away embarrassed by the gesture then another thought crossed his mind and he looked back there was something about the scene that stirred a memory in him but was it a memory of the past or of the future what can i say hagbard asked grinning i love her more food arrived and harry coin leaned over to ask hagbard are you dead sure that this goddess eris is real and is going to be here tonight just as solid as you and me you still have doubts hagbard asked loftily if you have seen me you have seen our lady and he made a campy gesture the man really is going ape joe thought i cant eat any more he said motioning the waiter away and feeling dizzy hagbard heard him and shouted eat eat drink and be merry you may never see me again joe somebody at this table is going to betray me didnt you know that two thoughts collided in joes brain he knows he is a magician and he thinks hes jesus hes nuts but just then george dorn woke up and said oh jesus hagbard i cant take acid hagbard laughed the morgenheutegesternwelt youre ahead of the script george i hadnt started to hand the acid out yet he took a bottle from his pocket and dumped a pile of caps on the table just then joe distinctly heard a rooster crow cars except for official cars and the vehicles of the performers their assistants and the festival staff were banned within ten miles of the festival stage hagbard george harry coin otto waterhouse and joe pushed their way through shuffling crowds of young people a vw camper carrying clark kent and his supermen rolled past next a huge black svintage mercedes slowly made its way past cheering kids it was surrounded by a square of motorcyclists in white overalls to keep eager fans away joe shook his head in admiration at the gleaming supercharger pipes the glistening handrubbed black lacquer and the wirespoked wheels the landau top of the car was up but by peering inside joe could see several crewcut blond heads a blond girl suddenly put her face to the window and stared out expressionlessly thats the american medical association in that mercedes george said hey said harry coin we could pitch a bomb into their car and get all of them right now youd kill a lot of other people too and leave a lot of unfinished business hanging fire said hagbard looking after the mercedes which slowly disappeared down the road ahead of them thats a nice machine it belonged to field marshal gerd von rundstedt one of hitlers ablest generals an elephantine black bus carrying the amas equipment followed close behind the mercedes silently it trundled past well kill the old red rooster well kill the old red rooster the closed corporation was generally recognized to be the most esoteric and experimental of all rock groups this was why their following although fanatical was relatively small its heavy all right most of the youth culture said but is it really rock the same question more politely worded had often been asked by interviewers and their leader peter pall mall had a standard answer its rock he would say somberly and on this rock i will build a new church then he would giggle because he was usually stoned during interviews reporters made him nervous in fact the religious tone was rather prominent when the closed corporation appeared in concert and the chief complaint was that nobody could understand the chants that accompanied some of the more interplanetary chords they employed these chants derived from the enochian keys which dr john dee had deciphered from the acrostics in the necronomicon and in modern times had been most notably employed by the wellknown poet aleister crowley and the reverend anton lavey of the first church of satan in san francisco on the night of april the closed corporation ritually sacrificed a rooster within a pentagram it gave one last despairing crow before they slit its throat called upon the barbarous names dropped a tab of mescaline each and departed for the concert grounds prepared to unleash vibes that would make even the american medical association turn pale with awe well kill the old red rooster when she comes i just saw hagbard celine said winifred saure naturally hed be here with all his minions and catamites said wilhelm saure weve got to expect to go right down to the wire on this i wonder what hes planning said werner saure nothing said wolfgang saure in my opinion hes planning nothing at all i know how his mind works head full of oriental mystical mush hes going to rely on his intuition to tell him what to do he hopes to make it more difficult for us to anticipate his actions since he himself doesnt know what they will be but hes wrong his field of action is drastically limited and theres nothing he can do to stop us first the towers appeared over the blackgreen tops of the pines they looked like penitentiary guard towers though in fact the men in them were unarmed and their primary purpose was to house spotlights and loudspeakers then the road turned and they were walking next to a twentyfoothigh wire fence running parallel to this was an inner fence thirty feet away and about the same height beyond that were bright green hillsides the promoters of the fesival had chopped down and sold all the trees on the hills within the fencedoff area bulldozed the stumps and covered the raw earth with fresh sod already the green was partically covered by crowds of people tents had popped up like mushrooms and banners waved in the air portable outhouses painted dayglo orange to make them easy to spot were set at regular intervals a vast hum of talking shouting singing and music rose over the hills beyond the hills beyond the central hill where the stage stood the blueblack waters of lake totenkopf heaved and tossed even that side of the festival area had its fences and towers joe said youd think they were really worried about someone sneaking in for free these people really know how to build this kind of place said otto waterhouse hagbard laughed come on otto are you a racist about germans i was talking about whites theyve got good big ones in the us too ive seen a couple i never saw one with a geodesic dome though said george look at how big that thing is wonder whats in it i read that the kabouters were going to set up a dome said joe as a firstaid or badtrip station or something like that maybe its a place where you can go hear the music said harry coin hell size of this thing you can barely see people on the stage much less hear them you havent heard the loudspeakers theyve got said hagbard when the music starts theyll be able to hear it all the way to munich they came to a gate arching over it was a sign that declared in redpainted gothic letters ewige blumenkraft uno ewige schlangekraft see said hagbard right out in the open for anyone who understands to read and know that the hour is at hand they wont be hiding much longer well said joe at least it doesnt say arbeit macht frei hagbard handed in the orange weeklong tickets for his group and a blackuniformed usher punched them neatly and returned them they were inside the ingolstadt festival as the sun sank over the far side of lake totenkopf hagbard and his contingent mounted a hill a huge sign over the stage announced that the oklahoma home demonstration club was playing and the loudspeakers thundered out an old favorite of that group custer stomp behind the stage the four members of the american medical association stood apart and gazed out at the sunset they were wearing iridescent black tunics and trousers members of other bands stood together and talked many of the groups happy to be meeting each other for the first time they even fraternized with a few intrepid kids who managed to infiltrate past the guards and make it to the back side of the stage hill but whitesuited attendants kept the public and fellow performers away from the american medical association this was generally accepted as the amas privilege they were after all universally acclaimed as the greatest rock group in the world their records sold the most their tours drew audiences that dwarfed even those of the beatles their sound was everywhere as the beatles had for a time expressed the new freedom of the s so the ama seemed to epitomize the repressive spirit of the s the secret of their popularity was that they were so appalling they reminded their fans of all the evils that were being daily visited upon them and thus hearing and seeing them was like scratching a very bad itch they suggested that perhaps youth had captured its oppressors or identified with them and they momentarily turned the pain of the whole scene into pleasure to learn how to enjoy suffering since suffering was their lot kids by the millions flocked to hear the ama like a radiant heater said wolfgang we at the center our message projected into a bowl of vibrant young human consciousnesses massively reflected by them back across the lake into the lake to the depth of a mile there reaching the sunken army raising them in a sense from the dead we are so close to realizing the dream of thirty thousand years said winifred will we be able to do it will we be the ones who complete the work begun by great gruad and if not what will become of us doubtless we will scream in hell for all eternity said werner matteroffactly what would you do to us if we failed we need fear eternity only if the eater of souls is on the scene said wilhelm and theyve still got him imprisoned inside the pentagon let no one speak of failure said wolfgang it is absolutely impossible for us to fail the plan is foolproof winifred shook her head fools are precisely what it is not proof against and you wolfgang know that best of all it was dark now the large tent made of clothofgold was sheltered between the fence and a relatively secluded grassy knoll there was greatest privacy here because this corner of the festival area was farthest from the stage and because the area was full of discordians hagbard went into the tent and stayed there awhile joe and george stood outside talking george was thinking that hagbard was probably in there with mavis and he wished he could dash in there and kill the son of a bitch joe agonizingly nervous suspected that hagbard was in the tent with a woman probably mavis and he wondered it he should rush in and kill hagbard while the discordian leader was occupied he kept his hand in his pocket fingers curled around the small pistol i circle around i circle around after about half an hour hagbard emerged from the tent smiling go on in he said to joe youre needed in there george grabbed hagbards arm trying to sink his fingers in but the muscle felt like iron and hagbard didnt seem to notice whos in there he demanded stella said hagbard looking down at the stage where the plastic canoe was playing and you were fucking her joe asked to release the energies and now im supposed to fuck her too and george after me and then everybody else thats lefthand magic and its creepy just go in hagbard said youll be surprised i wasnt fucking stella stella wasnt in there when i was who was george asked thoroughly confused my mother said hagbard happily joe turned toward the tent he would make one more effort to trust celine but then suddenly the hawk face leaned close to him and hagbard whispered i know what youre planning for afterwards do it quickly shell be wearing red pajamas when she comes on february robert putney drake received a book in the mail the return address he noted was gold amp appel transfers on canal street one of the corporations owned by that intriguing celine fellow who had kept appearing at the best parties for the last year or so it was titled never whistle while youre pissing and the flyleaf had a bold scrawl saying best regards from the authorfollowed by a gigantic c like a crescent moon the publisher was green and pleasant publications po box glencoe illinois drake opened it and read a few pages to his astonishment several illuminati secrets were spelled out rather clearly although in a hostile and sarcastic tone he flipped the pages looking for other interesting tidbits toward the middle of the book he found definitions and distinctions free market that condition of society in which all economic transactions result from voluntary choice without coercion the state that institution which interferes with the free market through the direct exercise of coercion or the granting of privileges backed by coercion tax that form of coercion or interference with the free market in which the state collects tribute the tax allowing it to hire armed forces to practice coercion in defense of privilege and also to engage in such wars adventures experiments reforms etc as it pleases not at its own cost but at the cost of its subjects privilege from the latin privi private and lege law an advantage granted by the state and protected by its powers of coercion a law for private benefit usury that form of privilege or interference with the free market in which one statesupported group monopolizes the coinage and thereby takes tribute interest direct or indirect on all or most economic transactions landlordism that form of privilege or interference with the free market in which one statesupported group owns the land and thereby takes tribute rent from those who live work or produce on the land tariff that form of privilege or interference with the free market in which commodities produced outside the state are not allowed to compete equally with those produced inside the state capitalism that organization of society incorporating elements of tax usury landlordism and tariff which thus denies the free market while pretending to exemplify it conservatism that school of capitalist philosophy which claims allegiance to the free market while actually supporting usury landlordism tariff and sometimes taxation liberalism that school of capitalist philosophy which attempts to correct the injustices of capitalism by adding new laws to the existing laws each time conservatives pass a law creating privilege liberals pass another law modifying privilege leading conservatives to pass a more subtle law recreating privilege etc until everything not forbidden is compulsory and everything not compulsory is forbidden socialism the attempted abolition of all privilege by restoring power entirely to the coercive agent behind privilege the state thereby converting capitalist oligarchy into statist monopoly whitewashing a wall by painting it black anarchism that organization of society in which the free market operates freely without taxes usury landlordism tariffs or other forms of coercion or privilege right anarchists predict that in the free market people would voluntarily choose to compete more often than to cooperate left anarchists predict that in the free market people would voluntarily choose to cooperate more often than to compete drake now totally absorbed turned the page what he found seemed to be an anthropological report on an obscure tribe he had never heard of he quickly recognized it as a satire and a parable putting it aside for a moment he buzzed his secretary and asked to be connected with gold and appel transfers in a moment a voice said g and a t miss maris mr drake calling mr celine drakes secretary said mr celine is on an extended voyage miss maris replied but he left a message in case mr drake called ill take it drake said quickly there was a click as his secretary went off the line mr celine will send an emissary to you at the appropriate time miss maris said he says that you will recognize the emissary because he will bring with him certain artworks of the gruad era im afraid that is all sir thank you drake said hollowly hanging up he knew the technique he had used it himself in moving in on the syndicate back in you were fucking stella who says i was fucking anybody joe went in the tent was as richly hung as that of any moorish chieftain at one end was a diaphanous veil behind it a figure on a pile of cushions the figure was lightskinned so hagbard had been lying about being in here with stella joe went over and pulled the veil aside it was mavis all right just as joe had guessed she was wearing harem pajamas red but translucent through which he could see her dark nipples and the full bush of hair between her legs at the expectation of making love to her joe could feel his cock begin to swell but he was determined to impose his head trip on this scene why am i here he said still holding the curtain back with one hand trying to assume a casual pose mavis smiled faintly and motioned him to sit down on the cushions beside her he did so and found himself automatically sliding to a halfreclining position there was a faint suggestion of perfume from mavis and he felt the tension in his loins build up a little more i need all the energies we can set in motion to defeat the illuminati said mavis help me joe she held out her arms were you fucking hagbard i never did like sloppy seconds mavis gave a little snarl and threw herself on him she slathered her drooling lips over his and plunged her tongue deep into his mouth at the same time pressing her thigh between his legs joe fell back and gave up struggling against her she was just too goddamned attractive in a minute she had his pants open and his stiff hot prick throbbing in her hand she lowered her head over it and began sucking it rhythmically wait said joe im going to go off in your mouth its been a week since i got laid and im on a hair trigger she looked up at him with a smile eat me then i hear youre good at that whod you hear that from asked joe a gay priest friend of mine she said with a laugh as she undid the drawstring of her red trousers joe explored the lips of her vulva with his tongue reveling in the acrid musky odor of her bush he began a businesslike upanddown upanddown motion with his tongue over her clitoris after a moment he felt her body tensing it grew more and more rigid her pelvis began to buck and he clamped both hands on her hips and lapped away inexorably at last she gave a small shriek and tried to drive her whole mons veneris into his mouth now fuck me quickly quickly she said and joe his pants pulled down and his shirttail flapping mounted her he came in a series of exquisite spasms and dropped his head to the pillow beside hers she let him rest that way for a few minutes then gently nudged him to pull out and rolled to her side to face him am i dismissed joe said have i done my job released the energies or whatever you sound bitter said mavis and sad id like you to stay with me a while longer whats bothering you a lot of things i feel like i did the wrong thing george is obviously in love with you and you and hagbard treat it as a joke and hagbard treats me as a joke and both of you are quite obviously using me youre using me sexually and im beginning to think hagbard is using me in other ways and i think you know about it you didnt take the acid did you she said looking at him sadly no i knew what hagbard was doing this is too serious a moment to play games about the passion of christ mavis smiled she pressed her body closer to him and began playing with his limp penis rubbing the head gently into her bush joe you were raised as a catholic catholics have a finer appreciation of blasphemy than anybody thats why hagbard chose you hows your passion joe is it mounting pressing her naked body against his she whispered howd you like to fuck the virgin mary joe saw his mothers face and he felt the blood throbbing in his penis now he thought perhaps he knew what hagbard meant when he said his mother was in the tent a little later when he was in her she said i am a perpetual virgin joe and every woman is if only you have eyes to see we wanted to give you eyes tonight but you refused the sacrament youve chosen the hardest way of all joe if youre going to make it through this night youre going to have to find a way to see for yourself by other means than the one hagbard provided youll have to find your own sacrament and after she came and he came she whispered was that the sacrament he pushed himself up and looked down at the triangular red tattoo between her breasts no youre not the virgin mary youre still mavis and you still have to make the decision she said goodbye joe send george to me as joe was dressing feeling the weight of the pistol in his trouser pocket mavis rolled over so that she was lying on her stomach not looking at him her naked buttocks seemed utterly defenseless he looked at the pillow on which her bottom had been resting during their lovemaking it was a clothofgold pillow and embroidered on it in swirling letters was the word kallisti joe shook his head and left the tent as he emerged hagbard was saying in a low voice to otto waterhouse would have been up your alley if we hadnt had other work for you anthrax leprosy pi can wipe out the whole population of the earth in a matter of days suddenly the white of hagbards shirt the gold of the tent cloth the blazing spotlights of the festival all were coming in superbright that was adrenalin my mouth was drydehydration all the classic flightfight symptoms the activation syndrome skinner calls it i was so keyed up that it was a trip hello joe said hagbard softly joe suddenly realized that his hand was clenched around the pistol hagbard smiled at him and joe felt like a little boy caught playing with himself with his hand in his pocket he took his hand out quickly she wants george joe said weakly he turned his back on hagbard to look down at the stage where the sign glowing in the darkness said loaf and the fishes they were singing i circle around i circle around the borders of the earth on a pile of cushions behind a diaphanous veil at one end of the tent lay stella wearing nothing but a red chiffon pajama top were you letting joe fuck you george said joe has never fucked me stella replied youll be the first person to do that tonight look george weve got to get every bit of available energy flowing to combat the illuminati come over here and get the energies going with me this is danny pricefixer doris horus said i met him on the plane coming over holy jesus said maria imbrium vocalist with the sicilian dragon defense there are angels coming out of the lake angels in golden robes look youre tripping on that kabouter koolaid baby a muchbandaged hun told her theres nothing coming out of the lake something is coming out of the lake the drummer with the sicilian dragons said and youre so stoned you dont see it and what is it if it isnt angels maria demanded christ i dont know but whoever they are theyre walking on the water wearing my long green feathers as i fly i circle around i circle around jesus walking on the water you people are zonked out of your skulls its just a bunch of surfers wearing green capes for some crazy reason surfers my ass thats some kind of gang of bavarian demons they all look like the frankenstein monster wrapped up in seaweed pricefixer said kent didnt meet you five or six years ago in arkham arent you a cop its a gigantic green egg and it loves me john dillinger muttered to hagbard that redheaded guy over there the one with the black musician and the girl with the fantastic boobs hes a cop on the new york bomb squad wanta bet hes here investigating the confrontation bombing he must have been talking to mama sutra hagbard said thoughtfully shell be wearing red pajamas shell be wearing red pajamas when she comes when otto waterhouse entered the tent it was miss mao who was waiting for him i never fucked a chinese broad said otto stripping off his clothing i dont think stella is going to like this it will be okay with stella said miss mao we need to get all the energies moving to combat the illuminati and we need your help she held out her arms you dont have to ask twice said otto crouching over her at in washington dc the switchboard at the pentagon was warned that bombs planted somewhere in the building would go off in ten minutes you killed hundreds of us today in the streets of washington said the womans voice but we are still giving you a chance to evacuate the building you do not have time to find the bombs leave the pentagon now and let history be the judge of which side truly fought for life and against death the highestranking personnel in the pentagon and with revolution breaking out in the nations capital everybody was there were immediately moved to underground bombproof shelters the secretary of defense after consulting with the joint chiefs of staff declared that there was a percent probability that the threat was a hoax intended to disrupt the job of coordinating the suppression of revolution across the nation a search would be instituted but meanwhile work would go on as usual besides the secretary of defense joked to the chief of staff army one of those little radical bombs would do as much damage to this building as a firecracker would to an elephant somehow the fact that the caller had said bombs plural had not gotten through and the actual explosions were far more powerful than the caller had implied since a proper investigation was never subsequently undertaken no one knows precisely what type of explosive was used how many bombs there were how they were introduced into the pentagon where they were placed and how they were set off nor was the most interesting question of all ever satisfactorily answered who done it in any case at pm washington time a series of explosions destroyed onethird of the river side of the pentagon ripping through all four rings from the innermost courtyard to the outermost wall there was great loss of life hundreds of people who had been working on that side of the building were killed although the explosion had not visibly touched their bombproof shelter the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff and numerous other highranking military persons were found dead it was assumed that the concussion had killed them and in the ensuing chaos nobody bothered to examine the bodies carefully after the explosions the pentagon was belatedly evacuated in the expectation that there might be more of the same there was no more but the us military establishment was temporarily without a head another casualty was mr h c winifred of the us department of justice a civil servant with a long and honorable career behind him winifred apparently deranged by the terrible events of that day of infamy took the wheel of a justice department limousine and drove wildly running twentythree red lights to the pentagon he raced to the scene of the explosion brandishing a large piece of chalk and was trying to draw a chalk line from one side of the gap in the pentagon wall to the other when he collapsed and died apparently of a heart attack at ingolstadt time the loudspeakers and the sign over the stage announced the american medical association after a tenminute ovation the four strangeeyed ashblond young people began to play their most popular song age of bavaria in los angeles the mercalli scale on the ucla seismograph jumped abruptly to grade gonna be a little disturbance dr vulcan troll said calmly noting the rise grade wasnt serious what made you think wed find him down here saul asked common sense and psychology dillinger said i know pimps hed shit purple before hed get the guts to try to cross a border theyre strictly mamas boys the first place i looked was his own cellar because he might have a hidden room there barney laughed thats the first place saul looked too we seem to think alike mr dillinger saul said drily there isnt much difference between a cop and a crook psychologically speaking dillinger mused one of my own observations hagbard agreed what conclusion do you draw from it well dillinger said pricefixer didnt just pick up that girl because he wanted a lay she has to fit somehow the musician doesnt know that hagbard commented watch his hands hes repressing a fight impulse in a few minutes hell start a quarrel he and the lady were lovers once see the way her pelvis tilts when she talks to him and he wants whitey to go away but whitey wont go away he has her linked with the case hes working on i used to be a cop danny said with an engaging imitation of frankness but that was years ago and the work really didnt appeal to me im a salesman for britannica now better hours and people only slam doors in my face they dont shoot at me through them listen doris said excitedly the ama is playing age of bavaria it was the song that more than any other both expressed and mocked the aspirations of youth around the world and the accuracy with which it expressed their yearnings and the savagery with which it denied them had won them over it started almost the instant the music began a mile below the surface of the lake near the opposite shore an army began to rise from the dead the blackuniformed corpses broke loose from their moorings rose to the surface and began to drift toward shore as more and more of the semblance of life returned the drifting became swimming motions then wading they fell into ranks on the shore under the steel helmets their complexions were greenish their eyes heavily lidded their black lips drawn back in wide grimaces the mouths of the officers and noncoms moved forming words of command though no sound came forth no sound was needed it seemed for the orders were instantly obeyed once again the power that had been granted to adolf hitler by the illuminated lodge in because you are so preposterous they told him at the time the power that had manifested itself in steelhelmed armies that had won hitler an empire stretching from stalingrad to the atlantic from the arctic circle to the sahara desertonce again that power was visible on the earth they are coming i can feel it werner whispered to his twin wilhelm as wolfgang thundered on the drums and winifred belted out this is the dawning of the age of bavaria age of bavaria bavariabavaria the tanks and artillery were rolling into position the caterpillar treads of the troop carriers were churning motorcycle couriers sped up and down the beach a squadron of partially dismantled stukas was lined up in the road after the festivalgoers had been massacred and ingolstadt had been overrun the planes would be trucked to the nearby ingolstadt aerodrome where they would be assembled and ready to fly by morning the dead men removed black rubber sheaths from rolled up redwhiteandblack banners and unfurled them many of them were the familiar swastika flags and banners of the third reich with one addition a red eyeandpyramid device superimposed on the center of each swastika other banners carried gothiclettered mottos such as drang nach oesten and heute die welt morgens das sonnensystem at last all was in readiness the blueblack lips of generalofthess rudolf hanfgeist thirty years dead shaped the command to march which was relayed in similar fashion from the higherranking officers to the lowerranking officers to the men the lights and music on the opposite shore beckoned across the dark bottomless waters moonlight glinting on the deaths heads on their caps and runic ss insignia on their collars the soldiers moved out company by company the only sound was the growl of the diesel engines of troop carriers and the clank of weapons theyre coming said the woman under hagbard who was neither mavis nor stella nor mao but a woman with straight black hair olive skin fierce black eyebrows and a bony face coming mother said hagbard giving himself up to the irresistible onward sweep of sensation to the brink of orgasm and over im not your mother said the woman your mother was a blond blueeyed norweigian and i look greek now i think youre the mother of all of us said hagbard kissing her sweatdamp neck ah said the woman is that who i am then were getting somewhere then i started to flip malik eclipsed by malaclypse and celine hardly serene mary lou i worship you the red eye is my own mooning what is the meaning of moaning and suchlike seminal semantic antics my head is a quicktran quicksand where the territorial imperative always triggers stay off my turf the latin and the saxon at war in poor simons synapses dead men fighting for use of my tongue turning population explosion into were fucking overcrowded and backward also so it might emerge copulation explosion and besides hag barred straights from this blackandwhite mass the acid was in me i was tripping flipping skipping ripping on my way with maotsey taotsey for the number of our lady is an hundred and fifty and six there is wiccadom but i never expected it this way what do you see i asked mary lou some people who were swimming coming out of the lake what do you see not what im supposed to see for the front line clear as claritas was mescalito from my peyote visions and osiris with enormous female breasts and spider man and the tarot magus and good old charlie brown and bugs bunny with a tommy gun and jughead and archie and captain america and hermes thriceblessed and zeus and athene and zagreus with his lynxes and panthers and micky mouse and superman and santa claus and laughing buddha jesus and a million million birds canaries and budgies and gaunt herons and holy crows and crowly hose and eagles and hawks and mourning doves for mourning never ends and theyd all been stoned since the late devonian period when they first started eating hemp seeds no wonder huxley found birds the most emotional class of life singing all the time stoned out of their birdbrained skulls all singing i circle around i circle around except the mynah birds squawking here kittykittykitty and i remembered again that existence isnt sensible any more than its hot or red or high or sour only parts of existence have those qualities and then there was the zigzag man and my god my god my father leading them in singing solidarity forever solidarity foreverrrr the union makes us strong i say said an englishman i thought he was a monster and hes only toad of toad hall with rat and tinker bell and wendy and bottom thats who you are said hagbard if you can call that any kind of a fucking identity i think its time you went up on stage and made our little announcement said the woman i think everyone is ready for that ill send dillinger in to you goody its not true you know that was the other guy sullivan i wasnt thinking about that i dont care if its no bigger than my little finger its just the idea of fucking with john dillinger if that doesnt put me over nothing will hagbard stood up and laughed youre starting to look and sound like mavis again i think youre slipping superbitch the american medical association had left the stage and clark kent and his supermen were playing as hagbard accompanied by george harry otto and malaclypse made his way down their own hill and up to the crest of the hill where the stage was erected the journey took a halfhour as they picked their way through groups of people engaged in mongolian clusterfuck sitting zazen or just listening to the music at the stage hagbard took out a gold card which he showed to a group of marshals guarding the area from intrusion i have an announcement to make he said firmly the marshals allowed him to climb on stage and told him to wait till the supermen had finished their set as soon as pearson saw hagbard he motioned his men to stop playing a murmur arose from the audience well all right hagbard said robert pearson i was wondering if you were ever going to show up he walked over to the side of the stage where hagbard and his group were standing good evening waterhouse said pearson hows my gal stella where the fuck do you get off calling her your girl said waterhouse his tone containing nothing but menace the acid only opens your eyes george it doesnt work miracles and it shall come to pass that whosoever call on the name of the lord shall be saved wonder what the hell is in that suitcase dillinger murmured ill open it saul said well all have to take the antidote anyway after this i have a supply out in the car and he leaned forward parted carmels stiff blue hands and tugged the suitcase free barney dillinger and markoff chancy crowded close to look as he snapped the lock and lifted the top ill be damned and double damned barney muldoon said in a small hollow voice hagbard has been putting us on all along simon says dreamily it doesnt matter in the first bardo those nazis have been dead for thirty years period he just brought us here to put us on a trip nothing is coming out of the lake im hallucinating everything something is happening mary lou insisted vehemently its got nothing to do with the lake thats a red herring to distract us from the real battle between your hagbard and those crazy musicians up there if i wasnt tripping my head would work better damn it its got something to do with sound waves the sound waves are turning solid in the air whatever it is the rest of us arent supposed to understand it this lake thing is just to give us something we can understand or almost understand her black face was intense with intelligence battling against the ocean of undigestible information pouring in through all of her senses dad simon cried weeping happily tell me the word you must know now what is the word kether said tim moon blissfully kether thats all just cabalism simon shook his head it cant be that simple kether tim moon repeats firmly right here in the middle of malkuth as above so below i see the throne of the world one single chair twentythree feet off the ground studded with seventeen rubies and brooding over it the serpent swallowing its tail the rosy cross and the eye who was that nice man mary lou asked my father simon said really weeping now and i may never see him again mourning never ends and then i understood why hagbard had given us the acid why the weather underground and morituri used it constantly because i started to die i literally felt myself dwindling to a point and approaching absolute zero i was so shitscared i grabbed simons hand and said help in a weak voice and if he had said admit youre a cop first then ill help i sure as hell would have told him everything blurted it all out but he just smiled squeezed my hand gently and murmured its alive and it was the point was giving off light and energy my light and my energy but gods also and it wasnt frightening because it was alive and growing the word omnidirectional halo came to me from somewhere was it hagbard talking to dillinger and i looked holy keyrizt dillinger split in two as i watched that was the answer to one question there were two dillingers twins in addition to the fake dillinger who got shot at the biograph i thought feeling some abstract eternal answer there along with the answer to some of the questions that had bugged so many writers about dillingers criminal career like why some witnesses claimed he was in miami on that day in when other witnesses claimed he was robbing a bank and killing a bank guard in east chicago and why hagbard had said something about him being in las vegas when i could see him right here in ingolstadt but it was all moving moving a single point but everything coming out of it was moving a star with swords and wands projecting outward as rays a crown that was also a cup and a whirling disc a pure white brilliance that said i am ptah come to take you from memphis to heaven but i only remembered the cops who beat daddy up in memphis and made him swear when he got back that hed never go south again and how did that tie in with why i became a cop and ptah became zeus lacchus wotan and it didnt matter all were distant and indifferent and cold not gods of humanity but gods above humanity gods of the void brilliant as the diamond but cold as the diamond the three whirling in the point until they became a turning swastika then the face of the doctor who gave me the abortion that time i got knocked up by hassan i sabbah x saying you have killed the son of god in your womb black woman and i started to weep again simon holding my hand and repeating its alive but i felt that it was dying and i had somehow killed it i was otto waterhouse in reverse i wanted to castrate simon to castrate all white men but i wouldnt i would go on castrating black men the nightmare lifeindeath am i its alive baby simon repeated its alive and i love you baby even if you are a cop the whole lake is alive the vibe man with the fillet of soul was trying to explain to the rest of that group one big spiral rising and turning like the dna molecule but with a hawks head at the top good evening waterhouse said pearson hows my gal stella where the fuck do you get off calling her your girl said waterhouse his tone containing nothing but menace cool it brother said pearson reasonably dont hand me that brother shit i asked you a question you and your question come out of a weak limp bag said pearson hagbard said robert only fucks white women otto im sure hes never laid stella maris dont be too sure said pearson dont play with otto robert said hagbard he specializes in killing black men in fact hes only just killed his first white man and hes not at all sure he enjoyed it i never knew what killing was before said waterhouse i was crazy all those years and i enjoyed what i did because i didnt know what i was doing after i killed flanagan i understood what id been doing all along and it was like i killed all the others all over again his cheeks were wet and he turned away pearson stood looking at him for a moment then said softly wow come on hagbard lets get you on stage they walked out to the microphone together a few people in the audience had begun clapping rhythmically for more music most though had been waiting silently happily for whatever might happen next what happened was that robert pearson said to them brothers and sisters this is freeman hagbard celine my ace and the heaviest dude on the planet earth listen while he runs it down to you whats happening he stepped aside and deferentially ushered hagbard to the microphone into the silence hagbard said my name as clark kent just told you is hagbard celine in mad dog texas john dillinger and jim cartwright looked up from the chess board as the radio music stopped and an announcers voice said we interrupt this show to bring you a special message from washington john moved a knight and said softly checkmate thatll be the president i bet i hope to hell my brother finds that missing pimp before things get much worse cartwright surveyed the board dismally checkmate he agreed finally i hope your other brother and hagbard are handling things right in ingolstadt he added as they both turned with a reflex acquired from tv watching and looked at the radio being a woman is bad enough but being a black woman is even worse i always feel split in two a divided lion im thinking like simon with a hole in the middle and thats all men are interested in the hole in the middle but the acid was making the split into a conscious agony and then was healing it i was a whole lion ready to devour my enemies i understood my father and why he felt he finally had to stand up to the whites even if it killed him a knight moved across a wasteland the desert around las vegas but it was laid out in squares like a chess board he raised a fiery wand crying black power and it was hassan i sabbah my lover my enemy a black christ and yet also a baboon with a crazy grin all blue pearl gray like semen inside every woman theres an angry man trying to get out a manwoman with the eyes of an owl and the joy came over me as my clit got hot and grew into a penis i was my father i was afraid of nothing i could destroy the world without caring with one angry flash of my eye like shiva my penis is the invisible star ruby and men conspire to make me hide it thats why i must take theirs i am twofaced always deceiving like all women deception is our only defense i understand it more clearly as the wisdom of my insanity increases and the musky smell of hashish coming from the plastic canoe trailer is like me a female plant with male strength they are nailing me to the cross literally but the cross is inside a spinning wheel of flame oh holy moses im finding buddha not eris in my pineal gland the third eye is opening i am the earth beneath your feet i am billie freshette i am legion there are millions of me a plague of locusts to devour your white male technology my name is hagbard celine he is saying they sold heroin in my grammar school thats the way a chicago black gets educated simon is still trying to bring me through it saying now death shall have no dominion and i try to believe love shall have the dominion but first i must spend my hate to the last penny they made me kill my baby i really am going to go crazy because i have the hots again and want simons lance in my cup but i also know the real god is beyond god and the real illuminati is beyond the illuminati theres a secret society behind the secret society the illuminati were fighting are puppets of another illuminati and so are we my name is hagbard celine and the carnival is over remove your masks all players thats a funny thing for toad of toad hall to say muttered fission chips to nobody in particular but the voice came booming back my name is hagbard celine please dont panic when you hear what ive got to say to you and chips saw that it wasnt toad of toad hall or even the sinister saint toad but just a welldressed wop with two faces one smiling and one frowning in wrath you know said aloud i do believe there was a fucking drug in that water my name is hagbard celine please dont panic when you hear what i have to say to you pay close attention i have come to tell you that your lives are in grave danger at this moment an army is marching around the shore of lake totenkopf for the purpose of massacring all the people attending this festival jesus said george this is never going to work hes putting it so badly theyll never believe him theyll laugh at him threequarters of them dont even understand english is that how it sounds to you said malaclypse as if hes speaking in english it also sounds to me as if hes saying everything in a flat direct way but i hear him speaking in the greek dialect of athens in the fifth century bce what do you mean hes actually talking in norwegian or italian whichever language he knows best hes using what i call the pentecost gimmick its described in the acts of the apostles as the gift of tongues after the death of jesus the apostles were sitting together on the feast of pentecost when tongues of fire appeared over their heads then they went out and preached to a crowd of people from many different countries and each person heard the sermons in his own language and in the form most likely to persuade him they made tens of thousands of converts to christianity that way i was the one who laid the trick on them though they never knew that speaking in tongues said george in wonderment they used to preach about it in bible class and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams dont play games with yourself george you know perfectly well that a moment ago i was mavis its a giant black woman its goethes mother night somebody was saying but i was thinking of ing with simon oh the tricks that cat knows to please a woman to make you feel like a queen on a throne and i dont care if he knows im a cop theres always a sorrow after a joy on this plane yes i will always be split in two the void will always be there at the center god yes the mask of night is on my face like i read in shakespeare in school i am the river yellow with sewage and cocksucker is a dirty word but what else is the sign of cancer or that yinyang all about christ i loved doing it women who claim they dont are just liars i hate him and i love him the ambiguity is always there that detective who wanted to praise me that time said youve got balls for a woman but how would it sound if i said to him youve got tits for a man throne after throne cast down into the void and yet i have the power all theyre worshipping in their trinities and pyramids are symbols of the cunt and its hot again but i just want him to hold me i cant ball now i cant speak i see my fathers face but its silver instead of tlack and all of a sudden i knew joe malik had a gun and even that he had a silver bullet in it mother of god does he think hagbard is something inhuman and i smelled opium mixed with the hash those are heavy cats in the plastic canoe i could feel the energy surging through me im in the tent and im being fucked by all the men im mavis and stella and im the mother of all of them i am demeter and frigga and cybelle as well as eris and i am napthys the black sister of isis of whom none dare speak and i can even see why joe malik blew up his own office it was a trap and hagbard fell into it joe knows his secret now they used to preach about it in bible class and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all flesh will see it in one instant malaclypse smiled to conceive of pentecostal training it is necessary to die these are the words of the first last and between kallisti you must have won the prize for memorizing verse in that bible class george i would have only the teacher didnt like my attitude good said malaclypse i also taught the pentecost gimmick to hagbard what hes saying sounds flat to you because you dont need to be persuaded everybody else is hearing as much emotion and rhetoric as is needed to motivate them its a good gimmick the pentecost gimmick it all came in solid and threedimensional and i felt mercy flowing from me like some psychological monthly with water instead of blood i even forgave the american medical association all four of them separately and distinctly i was isis all purple and blue and veiled and even if poseidon was rising in that lake i could forgive him too he was covered with olives and shamrocks a green water god glistening like amethyst with one huge unicorn horn and then he was indra the rainmaker whose voice of thunder was only a disguised blessing i obeyed him and put the doll in the tetrahedron there was nothing to fear for all that would happen were blessings and good thingsas the brilliant ones descended bringing their white fire to the red earth the work would be perfected in pleasure not pain for i even knew that joe found out pat walshs memos were misleading because hagbard wanted him to find out and wanted him to plant the bomb and even wanted him to come here tonight with the gun so it all makes sense if you had a model of the globe with a black light flashing for every death and a white light for everytime somebody comes it would seem to be glowing all the time thats whats so good about being a woman i can come and come and come oh god as many times as i want and men even simon hardly ever come more than once in a night that mean miss forbes in first grade she needed a good lay but i can even forgive her ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states everyone must leave the festival area hagbard was saying the resurrected nazis intend to slaughter all of you fortunately we have had time to build you a pathway to safety behold he stretched out his arm and the spotlight moved beyond him to the lake illuminating a great pontoon bridge stretching from the festival area on the eastern shore diagonally to the lakes northwest corner it had been silently erected by hagbards crew with the indispensable help of howard and the dolphins during the last hour wow george said to malaclypse i suppose youd call that the red sea gimmick hagbard lifted his hands i name that the adam weishaupt bridge everyone will now rise and proceed in an orderly fashion to walk across the lake my fellow americans it is with a heavy heart that i come before you for the second time today many irresponsible elements have reacted to the national emergency with mad animal panic and they are endangering all the rest of us i assure you again in the words of a great former leader that we have nothing to fear but fear itself the face on the tv screen expressed absolute confidence and many citizens felt a slight upsurge in hope actually he was totally around the bend on demerol and when the white house had burned earlier in the day his most constructive suggestion had been lets toast some marshmallows before we leave even as i speak to you the director of the fbi has assured me that his men are closing in on the one single plaguecarrier who has caused all this hysteria if you stay in your homes you will be safe and the emergency will soon be over we can send the army to the west side of the lake to intercept them said wilhelm rosebuds cried john dillinger why the hell would he bring a suitcase full of rosebuds down here suddenly everybody was aroused and moving simon was leading me gently along i was back in time again there was a real fight going on between hagbard and the american medical association and a fight means that somebody is going to lose the gates of hell were opening and i could hardly move my feet daddys head on the floor of that memphis police station and those cops stomping him and stomping him why didnt they put a spear through his side while they were at it and how can i really forgive thats just the drug and underneath ill always hate white men even simon if this is the last judgment i know what christ will do with every blueeyed bastard among them they own all the power and make all the wars theyve fucked the planet their only god is death they destroy everything living a giant blond god thor swinging his hammer and smashing all the colored races red scarlet red blood on that hammer black blood especially but hagbard is horus this is the way it will always be fighting and killing to the end of time and women and children the chief victims only the flesh is holy and men are killers of the flesh cannibals how many do you think there are the leader of the closed corporation asked dreamily six hundred and sixtysix one of his group answered when you sacrifice a rooster in a pentagram on walpurgis night you always get six sixtysix and theyre coming right toward us the leader went on in his dreamy voice to bow down and serve us the closed corporation sat perfectly still in silent ecstasy awaiting the arrival of the hornedandtailed demons they saw approaching them outside lehman cave saul loads the antidote needle ill go first says john herbert dillinger rolling up his sleeve at this hour when your government needs your faith in a fusilade of bullets the president sank beneath the podium leaving only the seal of the chief executive on the tv screens the viewers saw the same confident expression on his face as he floated in demerol tranquility toward death oh my god said an announcers voice off screen in mad dog john hoover dillinger looks at jim cartwright quizzically whose conspiracy was behind that he asks as the announcer gibbers hysterically there seem to have been five people shooting from five different parts of the press corps but the president may not be dead they blew his fucking head to pulp another voice near the microphone said distinctly and hopelessly in new york august personage one of the few people neither rioting nor listening to tv reads atlas shrugged with total absorption getting religion are you a turtle lady velkor asks huh danny pricefixer responds never mind she says hurriedly he hears her asking the next man on the right are you a turtle we can send the army to the west side of the lake to intercept them said wilhelm nein said wolfgang who was standing in the rear of the slowly moving command car studying the situation through field glasses that verdammte bridge goes toward the northern shore of the lake they can go straight while our men go around theyd all be across before we could reach them we could shell the bridge from here said werner we darent use the artillery said wolfgang wed have the whole west german army blundering down here getting in the way of our drive to the east if the west germans start fighting us the east germans will not make the mistake we want them to make they wont think we are an invading west german army the russians in turn will have plenty of warning the whole plan will fall through lets skip this phase then said winifred its too much of a hassle lets head immediately eastward and the hell with these kids nein again dear sister my love said wolfgang we have twentythree candidates for transcendental illumination including hitler himself waiting up there in the old fuehrer suite of the donau hotel the speedy mass termination of all those lives is to translate them to eternal life on the energy plane and i will not let that scheisskopi hagbard celine thwart us at this juncture i mean to show him once and for all which of us is master and all the rest of those schweinendillinger the dealy lama malaclypse the old lady herself if shes here if all of them are here its our chance to make a clean sweep and annihilate the opposition once and for all at the beginning of the immanentizing of the eschaton rather than in the final stage but we cant catch the kids said wilhelm we can we shall it will take a long long time to move them all across that pontoon bridge and they are all on foot we have vehicles and can catch up with them before half of them are even on the bridge theyll all be bunched together and those on the bridge will be a perfect target for machine guns we shall simply sweep in on them harvesting their lives as we go we spent years building up our identity as the american medical association just so we could organize the ingolstadt festival and trap masses of human beings on the shore of lake totenkopf that our sacred lake might run red with their blood would you throw all that away i agree a brilliant analysis said wilhelm we must move on at full speed then said wolfgang he turned to the car behind him and shouted vorwarts at maximum speed generalofthess hanfgeist stood up turned toward his subordinates and moved his blackened lips to form the same words immediately the tanks halftracks motorcycles and armored cars began to rev up their engines and the troops started to trot down the road on the double a lookout in one of the festival lightandsound towers spotted them and relayed a warning to the stage where robert pearson spoke into a microphone it is my sad duty to inform you that the pigs are intensifying their approach now dont run but do quicken your pace with all deliberate speed hagbard called in through the doorway of the gold tent john youve had enough for discordias sake come on out and let malaclypse go in i thought you were noncorporeal said george if youd known me any length of time you would have noticed that i frequently pick my nose said the sartrelike apparition whew said johnjohn dillinger emerging from the tent who would have thought the old mand have so much come in him she says she wants george in there after mal the woman behind the veil was glowing there was no light in the tent save for the deep golden radiance that came from her body come closer george she said i dont want you to make love to me now i only want you to learn the truth stand here before me the woman behind the veil was mavis mavis i love you said george ive loved you ever since you took me out of that jail in mad dog look again george said stella stella what happened to mavis i circle around i circle around dont play games with yourself george you know perfectly well that a moment ago i was mavis its the acid said george the acid only opens your eyes george it doesnt work miracles said miss mao i circle around i circle around oh my god said george and he thought and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved mavis was there again do you understand george do you understand why you never saw all of us together at once do you understand why all the time you wanted to fuck me that when you were fucking stella you were fucking me and do you understand that i am not one woman or three women but an infinite number of women before his eyes she turned red yellow black brown young middleaged a child an old woman a norwegian blonde a sicilian brunette a wildeyed greek woman a tall ashanti a slanteyed masai a japanese a chinese a vietnamese and on and on and on the paleface kept turning colors the way people do when youre on peyote now he looked almost like an indian that made it easier to talk to him why shouldnt people turn colors all the trouble in the world came from the fact that they usually stayed the same color james nodded profoundly as usual peyote had brought him a big truth if whites and blacks and indians were turning colors all the time there wouldnt be any hate in the world because nobody would know which people to hate who the hells mind was that george wondered the tent was dark he looked around for the woman he rushed out of the tent no one was looking at him they were all hagbard and the rest of them staring in awe at a colossal figure that grew ever taller as it strode away from them it was a golden woman in golden robes with wild gold red black hair flowing free she stepped over the fence that guarded the festival grounds as casually as if it were the threshold of a door she towered over the bavarian pines in her left hand she carried an enormous golden orb hagbard put his hand on georges shoulder it is possible he said to achieve transcendental illumination though a multiplicity of orgasms as well as through a multiplicity of deaths there were lights advancing down the road the woman now ninetythree feet tall strode toward those lights she laughed and the laughter echoed across lake totenkopf great gruad whats that cried werner its the old woman shouted wolfgang his lips falling away from his teeth in a snarl the sudden cry kallisti reverberated through the bavarian hills louder than the music of the ingolstadt festival had been trailing a cometlike cloud of sparks the golden apple fell into the center of the advancing army the supernazis might have been the living dead but they were still human what each man saw in the apple was his hearts desire private heinrich krause saw the family he had left behind thirty years ago not knowing that his living grandchildren were at this moment on the pontoon bridge across lake totenkopf fleeing his advance corporal gottfried kuntz saw his mistress who in reality had been raped and then disemboweled by russian soldiers when berlin fell in oberlieutenant sigmund voegel saw a ticket to the wagner festival at bayreuth colonelss konrad schein saw a hundred jews lined up before a machine gun that awaited his hand on the trigger obergruppenfuehrer ernst bickler saw a blue china soup tureen standing in an empty fireplace at his grandmothers house in kassel it was brimful of steaming brown dogshit into which was plunged a silver spoon general hanfgeist saw adolf hitler his face blackened his eyes and tongue bulging out his neck broken spinning at the end of a hangmans rope all of the men who saw the apple in whatever form began to fight and kill one another for possession tanks smashed into one another headon artillerymen lowered the barrels of their guns and fired pointblank into the center of the melee what is it wolfgang said winifred imploringly her arms thrown in panic around his waist look into the center of the battle said wolfgang grimly what do you see i see the throne of the world one single chair twentythree feet off the ground studded with seventeen rubies and brooding over it the serpent swallowing its tail the rosy cross and the eye i see that throne and know that i alone am to ascend it and occupy it forever what do you see i see hagbard celines teufelschelss head on a silver platter wolfgang snarled thrusting her from him with trembling hands eris has thrown the apple of discord and our supernazis will fight and kill each other until we destroy it where did she go asked werner shes lurking about somewhere in some other form no doubt said wolfgang as a toadstool or an owl or some such thing cackling over the chaos shes caused suddenly wilhelm stood up his fingers clawing at empty air in a frightfully clumsy fashion as if he were deaf dumb and blind he clawed and clamored his way over the side of the mercedes that had belonged to von rundstedt once out of the car he took a position about ten feet away from his brothers and sister turned and faced them his eyes stared every muscle in his body was rigid the crotch of his trousers bulged the voice that came out of his mouth was deep rich oleaginous and horrid there are long accounts to settle children of gruad wolfgang forgot the sounds of battle that raged around him you here how did you escape the voice was like crude petroleum seeping through gravel and like petroleum it was a fossil thing the voice of a creature that had arisen on the planet when the south pole was in the sahara and the great cephalopods were the highest form of life i took no notice the geometries ceased to bind me i came forth i ate souls fresh souls not the miserable plasma you have fed me all these years great gruad is that your gratitude wolfgang stormed in a lower voice he said to werner find the talisman i think its in the black case sealed with the seal of solomon and the eye of newt to the being that occupied wilhelms body he said you come at an opportune time there will be much killing here and many souls to eat these around us have no souls they have only pseudolife it sickens me to sense them wolfgang laughed even the lloigor can feel disgust then i have been sick for many hundreds of years while you kept me sealed in one pentagon after another feeding me not fresh souls but those wretched stored essences we gave you much cried werner every year just for you thirty thousand forty thousand fifty thousand deaths in traffic accidents alone but not fresh not fresh perhaps though you can settle your debt to me tonight i sense many lives nearby lives you have somehow lured here they can be mine werner handed wolfgang a stick with a silver pentagon at the tip wolfgang pointed it at the possessed wilhelm who shrieked and fell to his knees for a moment there was silence broken only by the sound of winifreds terrified sobbing and the crack of rifles and the chatter of machine guns in the background you shall not have those lives yog sorhoth they are for the transcendental illumination of our servants wait though and there shall be lives in plenty for all of us werner said while we parley our army is destroying itself and there will be no lives for anyone really said the thick voice how has your plan gone astray let me read you and learn wolfgang felt goose pimples break out all over his body he shuddered as coarse boneless fingers dripping with slime turned the pages of his mind mmm i see she is here then my ancient enemy it would be good to meet her in battle once again are your powers equal to hers said wolfgang eagerly i yield to none came the proud reply ask him why hes always getting trapped in pentagons then said werner in a low voice shut up wolfgang whispered savagely to the lloigor he said destroy her golden apple and release my army to move ahead and i will withhold the power of this pentagon and give you all the lives you seek done said the voice wilhelm suddenly threw his head back mouth wide open a choking sound came from his throat he collapsed on his back spreadeagled a strange greenish glowing gas rose from his throat werner jumped from the car and rushed over to wilhelm hes alive of course hes alive said wolfgang the eater of souls simply took possession of his body to communicate with us winifred screamed look the same phosphorescent gas a huge cloud of it now obscured the heart of the battle it seemed to take a shape like a spider with an uncountable number of legs arms antennae and tentacles gradually the shape changed glowing brighter and brighter a nearby tower on the festival grounds was as visible in the reflected light as if it were day then the glow faded and the tower was silhouetted in moonlight a great silence fell over the hills around lake totenkopf broken only by the glad cries of the last contingent of festivalgoers as they made it safely to the opposite shore theres no time to lose wolfgang said to werner and wilhelm round up some officers see if you can find hanfgeist hanfgeist had disappeared the highestranking officer surviving was obergruppenfuehrer bickler visions of dog turds sadly fading in a mind that possessed only a horrid semblance of life a quick survey showed the four illuminati prirni that the apple of discord had cost them half their army onward roared wolfgang and tanks in the van they smashed through the festival fence raced over the hills troops trotting doubletime and unhesitatingly charged out onto the bridge wolfgang stood in the back seat of the von rundstedt mercedes his blackgloved hands gripping the back of the front seat the wind blowing through his crew cut like a field of wheat suddenly beside him wilhelm screamed what is it now yelled wolfgang over the roar of his advancing army the lives we are about to take the voice of the lloigor grated they are mine yes all mine listen to me you energy vampire we have other debts to discharge and other projects to complete there are twentythree of our faithful servants waiting in the donau hotel to be transcendentally illuminated they come first youll get yours wait your turn farewell said the lloigor i shall see you at the hour of your death i will never die fool the voice shrieked with wilhelms mouth suddenly wilhelm stood up threw open the door of the car and hurled himself out into the lake he struck with a huge splash then sank like a stone a greenish glow spread in the black water where he had gone down and then there were four hagbard stood atop a hill watching the tanks roll across the bridge followed by the black mercedes followed by troop carriers and artillery followed by trotting foot soldiers he knelt beside a detonator and shoved down the handle from end to end the bridge and those upon it disappeared in geysers of white water the thunder of the explosions demolition charges placed by the porpoise horde under the direction of howard echoed through the hills around the lake the tanks went under first as the front end of the command car sank under water werner saure screamed my foots caught he went down with the car while wolfgang and winifred their tears mingling with the water of lake totenkopf splashed about in the water with the few remaining supernazis and then there were three hagbard shouted i sank it i sank the george washington bridge is anything changed said george of course said hagbard weve got them on the run well be able to finish them off in a few more minutes then therell be no more evil in the world everything will be gingerpeachy his tone seemed sarcastic rather than victorious george noted apprehensively now ill admit fission chips said reasonably that im under the influence of some bloody drug from the koolaid but this simply cannot all be hallucination very definitely thirteen people took their clothes off and started dancing i quite certainly heard them singing blessed be blessed be over and over then a simply gigantic woman rose up from somewhere and all the sirens and undines and mermaids went back into the water if this was armageddon it was not precisely the way the bible described it is that a fair summary of the situation the tree he was talking to didnt answer blessed be blessed be lady velkor sang on as she and her hastily assembled coven danced widdershins in their circle the spell had worked with her own eyes she had seen the great mother isis rise up and smite the evil spirits of the dead catholic inquisitors whom the illuminati had tried to revive she knew hagbard celine would later be boasting in all the most chic occult circles that he had performed the miracle and giving the credit to that destructive bitch eris but that didnt matter she with her own eyes had seen isis and that was enough now i ask you fission chips went on addressing another tree who seemed more communicative what the sulphurous hell did you see happening here tonight i saw a master magician said the tree or a master con man the two are the same plant a few suggestions and get a bunch of acidheads running away from their own shadows the tree who was actually joe malik and only looked like a tree to poor befuddled added or i saw the final battle between good and evil with horus on both sides you must be drugged too chips said pettishly you bet your sweet ass i am said the tree walking away i dont know how the courts will ever untangle this with five of them shooting at once and the secret service shooting back right away the best crime lab in the world will never get the trajectories of all the bullets right who among the survivors will be tried for murder and who for attempted murder thafs the sixtyfourthousanddollar question and what ohand now ladies and gentlemen on this sad occasion uh in this tragic hour of our countrys history let us all pay especially close attention to the new president who will now address us whos that jig standing over there the new chief exec was asking somebody off camera when he appeared on the tv screens the chevrolet stegosaurus drove into the empty concert grounds and came to a slow halt the guitarist stuck his head out the window and yelled to lady velkor what the hell happened here there was some bad acid in me koolaid she told him gravely everybody freaked out and ran off toward town hell he said and this was going to be our first big audience were a new group just formed what lousy luck he turned and drove off and she read the sign on the back of the car the fernando poo incident how are you now baby simon asked i know who i am mary lou said slowly and you might not like the results of that any more than the chicago police force will her eyes were distant and pensive wolfgang and winifred were very near shore when the dark humped shapes rose out of the water around them winifred shrieked wolfgang for the love of gruad wolfgang theyre pulling me down her long blond hair floated for a moment after her head went under then that too disappeared and then there were two the porpoises have her wolfgang thought to himself he continued to swim madly toward shore something caught his trouser leg but he kicked free then he was in the shallows too close in for the sea beasts to follow he stood up and waded ashore and came face to face with john dillinger sorry pal said john and squeezed the trigger of his thompson submachine gun thirty silver bullets struck wolfgang with the impact of clubs and threw him back into the water all feeling was gone from his body and he felt the foul tentacles closing around his mind and the murmuring horrible laughter grew to a soundless roar and the syrupy voice spoke to his mind welcome to the place prepared for you from everlasting to everlasting now truly you will never die and the mind of wolfgang saure imprisoned like a living fly in amber knowing that it must remain so for billions upon billions of years screamed and screamed and screamed and then there was one and joe malik feeling as if he were sitting in an audience watching himself perform walked over to that one and held out his hand congratulations he said icily you really did it hagbard looked at the hand and said you were more intimate the last time around very well said joe my lord my enemy he leaned forward and kissed hagbard full on the mouth then he took the gun out of his pocket and carefully fired directly into hagbards brain and then there were none it was quite real joe shook himself stood up and grinned walking over to hagbard he took out the gun and handed it to him surprise ending he said i read all the clues just like you wanted me to i know youre the fifth illuminatus primus and i know your motive for wiping out the other four is nothing like youve led us to believe but i cant play my role i still trust you you must have a good reason hagbards mouth fell open in completely genuine surprise well sink me he said beginning to laugh dawn

grummet the bursts to the moon and to the planets are also not historic events they are the major evolutionary breakthroughs today when we speak of immortality and of going to another world we no

burst of unexpected hope and greeted helios with rolling syllables from sappho crying through the bars brodadaktylos eos birds startled by the shout took off from the jailyard below filling the air with the flapping of their wings the guards came and told him to shut up he answered them gaily with polyphloisbois thalassas youve taken everything else away from me but you cant take old homer away in paris the communists under the red banner and the anarchists under the black were preparing for the annual international labor solidarity day at which the usual factionalism and sectarianism would once again demonstrate the absolute lack of international labor solidarity and in london berlin a thousand cities the red and the black would wave and the tongues of their partisans would wag and the ageold longing for a classless society would once again manifest itself while in the same cities an older name and an older purpose for that day would be commemorated in convent after convent and school after school where verses far older than the name of christianity were sung to the mother of god queen of the angels queen of the may in the united states alas the usual celebrations of national law day had to be cancelled since the rioting was not quite ended yet but everywhere in asia and africa as in europe and the americas the members of the oldest religion were returning from their festivals murmuring blessed be as they parted secure in their knowledge that the mother of god was indeed still alive and had visited them at midnight whether they knew her as dian dan tan tana shakti or even erzulie queen of the angels queen of the may in nairobi nkrumah fubar picked up his mail from a friend employed at the post office to his delight american express had relented and corrected their error crediting him with his february payment at last this was to his thinking big magic since the notification had been mailed from new york even before he began his geodesic spiels against the president of american express on april obviously such retroactive witchcraft was worthy of further investigation and the key was the synergetic geometry of the fuller tetrahedron in which he had kept his manikin during the spellcasting over breakfast before leaving for the university he opened fullers no more secondhand god and again grappled with the arcane mathematics and metaphysics of omnidirectional halo finishing breakfast he closed the book shut his eyes and tried to visualize the fuller universe the image formed and to his amazement and amusement it was identical with certain symbols an old kikuyu witch doctor had once drawn when explaining the doctrine of fanshaped destiny to him as the book closed in kenya the drums of orabi stopped abruptly it was one in the morning there and the visiting anthropologist indole ringh immediately asked how the dancers knew the ceremony was finished the danger is past an old hopi told him patiently cant you feel the difference in the air saul barney and markoff chaney were racing toward las vegas in the rented brontosaurus while dillinger was leisurely driving back toward los angeles in honolulu as the clocks struck nine the previous evening buckminster fuller trotting between airplanes suddenly caught a glimpse of a new geodesic structure fully incorporating omnidirectional halo and after a fourhour flight eastward landing in tokyo at the same time he left honolulu he had a detailed sketch finished it looked somewhat fanshaped as the no smoking fasten seat belt sign flashed it was four am in los angeles and dillinger safely home he thought heard the gunfire dying out in the distance the president must already be withdrawing the national guard at least in part he thought the phone by rebeccas bed rang just then eight oclock new york time and she answered it to hear molly muldoon shout excitedly saul and barney are on tv turn it on theyve saved the country in las vegas barney blinked under the tv lights and stared woodenly into the camera while saul kept his eyes on the interviewer and spoke in his kindlyfamilydoctor persona would you tell our viewers inspector goodman how you happened to be looking in lehman caves for the missing man the interviewer had the professional tone of all tv newscasters his intonation wouldnt have changed if hed been asking and why did you find our sponsors product more satisfactory or how did you feel when you learned you had brain cancer psychology saul pronounced gravely the suspect was a procurer thats a definite psychological type just as a safecracker a bank robber a child molester and a policeman are definite types i tried to think and feel like a procurer what would such a man do with the whole government looking for him attempt an escape to mexico or somewhere else neverthats a bankrobber reaction procurers are not people who take risks or make bold moves against the odds what would a procurer do he would look for a hole to hide in the fbi crime lab definitely confirms that the man inspector goodman found is the missing plaguecarrier carmel the interviewer threw in he had orders to repeat this every two minutes tell me inspector why wouldnt such a man hide in say an empty house or a secluded cabin in the mountains he wouldnt travel far saul explained hed be too paranoid seeing police officers everywhere he went and his imagination would vastly exaggerate the actual power of the government there is only one law enforcement agent to each four hundred citizens in this country but he would imagine the proportion reversed the most secluded cabin would be too nervewracking for him hed imagine hordes of national guardsmen and law officers of all sorts searching every square foot of woods in america he really would procurers are very ordinary men compared to hardened criminals they think like ordinary people in most ways the ordinary man and woman never commits a crime because they have the same exaggerated idea of our omnipotence sauls tone was neutral descriptive but in new york rebeccas heart skipped a beat this was the new saul talking the one who was no longer on the side of law and order so you just asked yourself wheres a goodsized hole near las vegas that was all there was to it yes the american people will certainly be grateful to you and how did it happen that you got involved in this case youre with the new york police department arent you how will he answer that one rebecca wondered just then the phone rang turning down the tv sound she lifted the phone and said yes i can tell by your voice youre the kind of woman who fully meets the criteria of my value system said august personage i want to lick your ass and your pussy and have you piss on me and well thats a most amazing story inspector goodman the interviewer was saying oh hell rebecca thought sauls expression was so sincere that she knew he had just told one of the most outrageous lies of his life the phone rang again with a pounce rebecca grabbed it and snouted listen you creep if you keep calling me thats no way to talk to a man who just saved the world sauls voice said mildly saul but youre on television they videotaped that a halfhour ago im at the las vegas airport about to take a jet to washington im having a conference with the president my god what are you going to tell him as much saul pronounced as an asshole like him can understand in los angeles dr vulcan troll watched the seismograph move upward to grade that still wasnt serious but he scratched a note to the graduate student who would soon be replacing him if this jumps to call me at my house then he drove home passing dillingers bungalow humming happily thankful that the rioting was ending and the guard being withdrawn at the lab the graduate student reading a paperback titled carnal orgy didnt notice when the graph jumped past and hit danny pricefixer waking in ingolstadt glanced at his wristwatch noon my god he thought sleeping so late was a major sin in his system of morality then he remembered a little of last night and smiled contentedly turning in the bed to kiss lady velkors neck a huge black arm hung over the other shoulder and a black hand limp in sleep held her breast my god danny said out loud remembering more as clark kent sat up groggily and stared at him smiling jim treponema at that moment was navigating a very dangerous pass in the mountains of northern california strapped to his back was a mm remington model bolt action rifle with power bushnell telescope a canteen of whiskey was hooked to one side of his belt and a canteen of water to the other he was perspiring from labor in spite of the altitude but he was one of the few happy people in the country since he had been nowhere near a radio for three days and had missed the whole terror connected with anthrax leprosy pi plague the declaration of martial law and the rioting and bombings he was on his yearly vacation free from the sewer of smut in which he was submerged fortynine weeks of the year the foulness and filth in which he heroically struggled daily risking his soul for the good of his fellow citizens and he was breathing clean air and thinking clean thoughts specifically as an avid hunter he had read that only one american eagle still survived and he was determined to be immortalized in hunting literature as the man who killed it he knew well of course how ecologists and conservationists would regard that achievement but their opinions didnt bother him a bunch of fags commies and smutnuts that was his estimate of those bleedingheart types probably smoked dope too not a mans man among them he shifted his rifle which was pressing his sweatsoaked shirt uncomfortably and climbed onward and upward mama sutra stared at the central tarot card in the tree of life it was the fool pardon me the little italian tree said this is getting ridiculous fission chips muttered i dont intend to spend the rest of my life in conversation with trees im a tree worth talking to the darkskinned tree with her hair in a bun persisted he squinted i know what you are he said finally half tree and half woman ergo a dryad benefit of classical education very good said the dryad but when you stop tripping youre going to crash youll remember london and your job and youll wonder how youre going to explain the last month to them somebody stole a month from me chips agreed pleasantly a cynical old swine named the dealy lama or another feller named toad bad lot shouldnt go around stealing months the tree handed him an envelope try not to lose that she said itll make everybody in your office so happy that theyll accept any story you make up to explain how it took you a month to get it what is it the name of every bugger agent in the british government together with the false names they use for the bank accounts where they keep all the money they cant account for and the account numbers and the names of the banks too in one nice package all it needs is a red ribbon i think my leg is being pulled again said chips but he was coming down and he opened the envelope and peered at the contents this is real he asked they wont be able to account for the money the tree assured him some very interesting confessions will be obtained who the devil are you chips asked seeing a teenage italian girl and not a tree im your holy guardian angel she said you look like an angel chips admitted grudgingly but i dont believe any of this time travel talking trees giant toads none of it somebody slipped me a drug yes somebody slipped you a drug but im your holy guardian angel and im slipping you this envelope and itll make everything all right back in london all you have to do is make up a halfway reasonable lie i was held prisoner in a bugger dungeon with a beautiful eurasian loveslave chips began improvising very good she said they wont believe it but theyll think you believe it thats good enough who are you really but the tree only repeated dont lose that envelope and walked away turning into an italian teenager again and then into a gigantic woman carrying a golden apple hauptmann chief of field operations for the federal republic of germanys police looked around the fuehrer suite in disgust he had arrived from bonn and headed straight for the donau hotel determined to make some sense of the scandals tragedies and mysteries of the previous night the first suspect he grilled was freiherr hagbard celine sinister jetset millionaire who had come to the rock festival with a large entourage celine and hauptmann talked quietly in one corner of the suite of the donau hotel while the cameras of police photographers clicked away behind them hauptmann was tall and thin with closecropped silvergray hair long vulpine features and piercing eyes dreadful tragedy the death of your president last night he said my condolences also for the unhappy state of affairs in your country actually hauptmann was delighted to see the united states of america falling into chaos he had been fifteen at the end of world war ii had been called to the colors as the allies advanced on german soil and had seen his country overrun by american troops all of this made a deeper and more lasting impression on him than the us west german cooperation that developed later not my president not my country said hagbard quickly i was born in norway i lived in the us for quite some time and did become a citizen for a while when i was much younger than i am now but i renounced my american citizenship years ago i see said hauptmann trying unsuccessfully to conceal his distaste for hagbards indistinct sense of national identity and what country today has the honor of claiming you as a citizen smiling hagbard reached for the inside pocket of the brassbuttoned navyblue yachtsmans blazer he had worn for the occasion he handed his passport to hauptmann who took it and grunted with surprise equatorial guinea he looked up frowning fernando poo quite so said hagbard a whitetoothed grin breaking through his dark features i will accept your expression of sympathy for the sad state of affairs in that country hauptmanns dislike of this latin plutocrat grew deeper the man was undoubtedly one of those unprincipled international adventurers who carried citizenship the way many freighters carried panamanian registry celines wealth was probably equal to or greater than the total wealth of equatorial guinea yet it was likely that he had done nothing for his adopted country other than bribe a few officials to obtain the citizenship equatorial guinea had split asunder nearly plunging the world into a third and final war and yet here was this parasitical mediterranean fop driving to a rock festival in a bugatti royale with a host of drones yesmen flunkies minions whores dope fiends and allround social liabilities disgusting hagbard looked around this room is a pretty foul place to have a conversation how can you stand that smell its nauseating me pleased to be causing some discomfort to this man whom he disliked more and more as he got to know him hauptmann settled back in the red armchair his teeth bared in a smile you will forgive me freiherr celine i find it necessary to be here at this time and also necessary to talk to you however i would have thought this peculiar odor of fish would not be unpleasant to you perhaps your nautical dress has led me astray hagbard shrugged i am a seaman of sorts but just because a man likes the sea doesnt mean he wants to sit next to a ton of dead mackerel what do you think it is anyway i have no idea i was hoping you could identify it for me just dead fish thats all it smells like to me im afraid you may be expecting more from me all around than i can possibly provide i suppose you think i can tell you a lot about last night just what are you trying to find out first of all i want to find out what actually happened what we have i think is a case of drug abuse on a colossal scale and we the western world in general have had too many of those in recent years apparently there is not a single person who was present at this festival who did not partake of some of this soft drink dosed with lsd treat every man to his dessert and none should scape tripping said hagbard i beg your pardon i was parodying shakespeare said hagbard but its not very relevant please go on well so far no one has been able to give me a coherent or plausible account of the evenings events said hauptmann there have been at least twentyseven deaths that im fairly sure of there has been massive abuse of lsd there are numerous accounts of pistol rifle and machinegun fire somewhere on the shore of the lake a number of witnesses say they saw many men in nazi uniforms running around in the woods if that wasnt a hallucination dressing as a nazi is a serious crime in the federal republic of germany so far we have managed to keep much of this out of the papers by holding the press people who came here incommunicado but we will have to determine precisely what crimes were committed and who committed them and we must prosecute them vigorously otherwise we will appear to the whole world as a nation incapable of dealing with the wholesale corruption of youth within our borders all nations are wholesale corruptors of youth said hagbard i wouldnt worry about it hauptmann grunted seeing in his minds eye a vision of drugcrazed masqueraders in nazi uniforms and himself in a german army uniform over thirty years ago at the age of fifteen and understanding very well what hagbard meant i have my job to do he said sullenly see how much more pleasant the world is now that the saures are gone the dealy lama flashed into his brain hagbard kept a poker face hauptmann went on your own role in the incident seems to have been a constructive one freiherr celine you are described as going to the stage when the hysteria and the hallucinating had reached some sort of a climax and making a speech which greatly calmed the audience hagbard laughed i have no idea at all what i said you know what i thought i thought i was moses and they were the israelites and i was leading them across the red sea while the pharaohs army intent on slaughtering them pursued the only israelites present last night seemed to have fared rather badly youre not jewish yourself are you freiherr celine im not religious at all why do you ask i thought that then perhaps you could shed some light on the scene we find here in these rooms well no matter for the moment it is interesting that you thought you led them across the lake in fact this morning when the police reserves entered the area they found most of the young people wandering around on the shore of the lake opposite the festival well perhaps we all marched around it while we thought we were going across it said hagbard by the way didnt you have any men at the festival at all if you did they should be able to tell you something we had a few plainclothes agents there and they could tell me nothing all but one had unknowingly taken the lsd and the one who didnt must have been hallucinating too from some kind of psychological contagion he saw the nazis a glowing woman a hundred feet tall a bridge across the lake sheer garbage as you doubtless noticed there were no uniformed police there arrangements were made and sanctioned at the highest level of government to leave policing at the festival to its management it was felt that given the attitudes of youth today official police would not be effective in handling the huge crowd i might say in my own opinion i consider that a cowardly decision but im not a politician thank god as a result of that decision orderkeeping at the festival was ultimately in the hands of people like yourself who happened to be inspired to do something about the situation and were themselves hampered as involuntary victims of lsd well said hagbard in order to fully understand what happened you have to realize that many people there probably welcomed an acid trip many must have brought their own acid and taken it i personally have had a great deal of experience with lsd a man of my wideranging interests you understand feels obligated to try everything once i was taking acid back when it was still legal everywhere in the world of course said hauptmann sourly hagbard looked around the room and said have you considered the possibility that these men old as they are might have unknowingly imbibed lsd and suffered heart failure or some such thing there were twentythree dead men in the suite thirteen were in the large parlor where hagbard and hauptman were sitting the dead men too were seated in various attitudes of total collapse some with their heads lolling back others bent forward at the waist heads hanging between their knees knuckles resting on the floor there were nine more old men in the bedroom and one in the bathroom most of them were whitehaired several were completely bald not one could have been under eighty years of age and several appeared to be over ninety the man in the bathroom had been caught by death in the embarrassing position of sitting on the toilet with his pants down this was the old gentleman with the white mustache and the unruly forelock who had spoken harshly to george in the lobby the night before last hauptmann shook his head im afraid it will be no easy task to find out what happened to these men they all seem to have died at about the same moment there are no observable traces of poison no signs of struggle or pain except for the expression around the eyes all of their eyes are open and they appear to be looking at some unguessable horror do you have any idea who they are why did you say i might have been able to help if i were jewish we have found their passports they are all israeli citizens that in itself is quite odd generally jews that old do not care to come to this country for obvious reasons however there was an organization connected with the zionist movement founded here in ingolstadt on may these elders of zion might have assembled here to celebrate the anniversary oh yes said hagbard the illuminati of bavaria wasnt it i remember hearing about them when we first arrived here the organization was founded by an unfrocked jesuit and its membership consisted of freemasons freethinkers and jews there were also some famous names in politics and the arts king leopold goethe beethoven and this organization was behind the zionist movement you say hauptmann brushed away the suggestion with long slender fingers i did not say they were behind anything there are always those who think that every political or criminal phenomenon must have something behind it there is always a conspiracy that explains everything that is unscientific if you wish to understand events you must analyze the masses of the people and the economic cultural and social conditions in which they live zionism was a logical development out of the situation of the jews during the last hundred years one need not imagine some group of illuminated ones thinking it up and promulgating the movement for devious reasons of their own the jews were in a wretched condition in many places they needed somewhere to go a child could have seen that palestine was an attractive possibility well said hagbard if the illuminati are of no importance in the history of israel what are these twentythree old israelis doing here on the day of the organizations founding perhaps they thought the illuminati were important perhaps they themselves were members i shall make inquiries to israel about their identities relatives will probably claim the bodies otherwise the german government will see that they are buried in ingolstadt jewish cemetery with proper rabbinical ceremonies the government is very solicitous of jewish persons nowadays maybe they were freethinkers said hagbard maybe they wouldnt like being buried with religious ceremonies the question is wearisome and unimportant said hauptmann we shall consult the israeli government and do as it suggests an elderly waiter knocked and was admitted by one of hauptmanns men he pushed a serving cart bearing a magnificent silver coffee urn cups and a tray full of pastries before serving anyone else he rolled the cart across the thick carpet to hauptmann and hagbard his rheumy eyes studiously avoided the bodies scattered around the suite he poured out coffee for both men lots of cream and sugar said hagbard black for me said hauptmann picking up a pastry with cherry filling and biting into it with relish how do you know somebody hasnt dosed the coffee or the pastry with lsd said hagbard smiling mischievously hauptmann brushed his hand over his hair and smiled back because i would put this hotel out of business if i were served food tainted in any way and they know it they will take the utmost precautions now that were being a little more sociable and drinking coffee together said hagbard let me ask you a favor turn me loose today i have interests to look after in the us and id like to be leaving you were originally planning to stay for the entire week now suddenly you have to leave at once i dont understand i was planning to stay but that was before most of the us government got wiped out also since the remainder of the festival is being called off theres no reason to stay im still not clear on that however why is the festival being called off whose idea is it and what are the reasons hauptmann stared down his long nose at hagbard and took another bite of the pastry while hagbard wondered how the man could eat in the midst of this awful smell he could understand how a detective would not be bothered by the presence of the dead but the fishy smell was something else again to begin with freiherr celine there is the disappearance and possible death by drowning of the four members of the saure family known as the american medical association accounts of what happened to them are garbled fantastic and contradictory as are those of every other incident that occurred last night as i reconstruct it they drove their car straight into the lake from which side hauptmann shrugged it hardly matters the lake is virtually bottomless if theyre in there i doubt that we will ever find them they must have been under the influence of lsd and they certainly werent used to it he looked accusingly at hagbard they were so cleancut absolutely the hope of the future and the car was a national relic a great loss were they the only wellknown casulaties who can say we have no accurate record of who was attending the festival no list was kept of those who bought tickets as should have been done a thousand young men and women could have drowned themselves in that lake and we wouldnt know about it in any case the saures as you may not know were the moving spirits behind the ingolstadt festival very patriotic they wished to do something to promote tourism to germany particularly of bavaria since they were native bavarians yes said hagbard i read that ingolstadt was their home town hauptmann shook his head their press agent gave that out when the festival was conceived actually they were born in northern bavaria in wolframseschenbach it is the birthplace of another famous german musician the minnesinger wolfram von eschenbach who wrote parzival well now they are gone barring a miracle and no one else seems to be in charge without them the festival is simply collapsing like a headless body furthermore the government wants the festival shut down because we dont want a repetition of last night lsd is still illegal in west germany unlike the us there are parts of the us where its still illegal said hagbard its not illegal in equatorial guinea because weve just never had a drug problem there since you are an ethusiastic citizen of equatorial guinea i am sure that delights you said hauptmann well freiherr celine i would like to release you immediately but when ive pieced together more of last nights events i shall have more questions for you i must ask you to stay in the ingolstadt area hagbard stood up if youll agree not to have me tailed or guarded ill give you my word that ill stick around hauptmann smiled thinly your word wont be necessary every road is blocked no planes are permitted to take off or land at ingolstadt aerodrome you can have the run of the town the lake and the festival area and you will not be disturbed hagbard left at the same time the old waiter did the waiter bowed hagbard out the door and when it closed behind him said a great shame well said hagbard they were all in their eighties thats a good age to die the waiter laughed i am seventyfive and i do not think any age is a good age to die but that is not what i was referring to perhaps mein herr did not notice the fishtank in the room it was broken and the fish were spilled all the floor i have taken care of that tank for over twenty years it was a fine collection of rare tropical fish even egyptian mouthbreeders now they are all dead so it goes hagbard wanted to ask the waiter what an egyptian mouthbreeder was but the old man suddenly nodded pushed open a doorway to a service room and disappeared danny pricefixer was wandering around in the dark with lady velkor and clark kent feeling absolutely wonderful when miss portinari intercepted him this will interest you she said handing him an envelope similar to the one she had handed fission chips what is it he asked seeing her as a greek woman in classic robes holding a golden apple take a look he opened the envelope and found a picture of tobias knight and zev hirsch in the middle of the confrontation office setting the timer on the bomb this man she said pointing to knight is willing to turn states evidence against both hirsch and atlanta hope youve wanted to nab them for a long time havent you who are you danny asked staring i am the one mama sutra told you of the one appointed to contact you here in ingolstadt i am of the illuminated what are those two talking about clark kent asked lady velkor who knows she shrugged theyre both tripping gods lightning is the most active front in america today for the cult of the yellow sign miss portinari went on telling the mark the tale a few feet away joe malik said to hagbard i dont like frameups even for people like hirsch and hope you suspect us of unethical behavior hagbard asked innocently pat walsh is dialing a phone i dont believe in jails joe said bluntly i dont think atlanta and zev will be any better when they get out theyll be worse you can be sure the illuminati will protect you miss portinari concluded gravely danny pricefixer continued staring at her the phone is ringing far away dragging me back to a body a self a purpose shattering my memories of being the ringmaster i sit up and lift the receiver hirsch i say my name is pat walsh a womans voice says i speak for atlanta herself the pass word is theleme go ahead i say hoarsely wondering if its about that peacenik professor we killed at un plaza on april youre being framed for a bombing she said you have to go into hiding hagbard laughed atlanta isnt returning to the states shes been a double agent for over two years working for me i found the warehouse door the walsh woman described it was open as she had promised and i wondered about the name on it gold amp appel transfers so is tobias knight and hell cop a plea its all been carefully planned joe you only thought bombing your own office was your idea how about zev hirsch joe asked hes having some very educational experiences about this time in new york city hagbard replied i dont believe in jails either and i am trapped the three of them surround me and jubela demands tell us the word jubelo repeats tell us the word and jubelum unsheathes the sword tell us the word zev hirsch a bombing in new york the president asked shrewdly trying to look as tough as his predecessor yes saul went on as soon as the link with gods lightning was clear to us barney and i took off for las vegas you can understand why the president didnt understand any of this but wasnt about to admit that you headed for las vegas he asked shrewdly trying to look as tough as his predecessor yes saul said sincerely as soon as we found out about anthrax leprosy pi and dr mocenigos death we realized the same organization must be implicated gods lightning gods lightning the president asked shrewdly remembering earlier years when he had been a guest speaker at their rallies and the secret group that has infiltrated them and taken them over the cult of the yellow sign we have reason to believe that an english intelligence agent named chips will be arriving in london in a few hours with evidence against most of the yellow sign operatives within their government you see sir this is an international conspiracy an international conspiracy the president asked shrewdly and in central park our old friend perri hops from tree to ground snatches a nut thrown by august personage and quickly runs around the tree three times in case this friendpossiblyenemy produces a gun and starts blasting while far above the highest mountains in california another aspect of my consciousness soars like winged poetry and knows somehow more about what is coming than dr trolls seismograph for i am the last truly the last the ecologists are right mine is not merely an endangered but nearly an extinct species and my senses have been sharpened beyond instinct by these last years i circle around i circle around i soar i bank i float i am rare moment for me not thinking about fish for my belly is full at present i circle around circle around thinking only about the soaring the freedom and more vaguely about the bad vibes coming up from below must you have a name call me hah one then haliaeetus leucocephalus the last symbol once of imperial rome and now of imperial america of which i neither know nor care for all i know is the freedom of my estate and about that the romans and the americans have never had aught but the most confused and distorted ideas wearing my long green feathers i circle around i am hali one and i scream not with rage or with fear or with anger i scream with ecstasy the terrible joy of my very existence and the scream echoes from mountain to mountain to another mountain resonating onward and onward a sound that only another of my species could understand and none are left to hear it but still i scream the shriek of shiva the destroyer true face of vishnu the preserver and brahma the creator for my scream is not of life or death but of lifeindeath and i am equally contemptuous of perri and of august personage of squirrels and of men and of all lesser birds who cannot ascend to my height and know the agony and supremacy of my freedom no because they broke billie freshette slow and ugly and they broke marilyn monroe fast and bright like lightning they broke daddy and they broke mama but shit like i mean it this time they aint going to break me no even if its greater with simon than with any other man even if he knows more than any other man ive had no it cant be him and it cant even be hagbard who seems to be the king of the circus the very ringmaster and keeper of the final secret no it cant be any man and it most certainly by jesus and by christ it cant be going back to mister charlies police force no its dark like my own skin and dark like the destiny theyve inflicted on me because of my skin but whatever it is i can only find it alone god the time that rat bit me while i was sleeping daddy screaming until he was almost crying ill kill the fucking landlord ill kill the motherfucker ill cut his white heart out until mama finally calmed him no he died a little then no it would have been better if he had killed the landlord no even if they caught him and they would have caught him no even if he died in the goddam electric chair and we went on welfare no a man shouldnt let that happen to his children he shouldnt be realistic and practical no no matter how good it is no matter how wonderful the come it will always be there in the back of my head that simon is white no white radical white revolutionary white lover it doesnt matter it still comes up white and its not acid and its not a mood i mean shit you have to decide sooner or later are you on somebody elses trip or are you on your own no and i cant join gods lightning or even whats left of the old womens lib i mean shit that poetry simon quoted is all wrong no its not true that no man is an island no the truth is every man is an island and especially every woman is an island and even more every black woman is an island on august rancid the butler in the drake mansion on old beacon hill reported a rather distressing fact to his employer good lord harry old drake cried at first is he turning papist now his second question was less rhetorical youre absolutely sure there is no doubt rancid replied the maids showed me the socks sir and the shoes that night there was a rattier strangulated attempt at conversation in the mansions old library are you going back to harvard not yet are you at least going to try another damned alienist they call themselves psychiatrists these days father i dont think so dammit robert what did happen in the war many things they all made profits for our bank though so dont worry about them are you turning red i see no profit there the state of massachusetts killed two innocent men today for holding opinions of that sort innocent my aunt fanny robert i know the judge personally and he believes what the friend of a banker should believe there was a long pause and old drake crushed out a cigar he had hardly started robert you know youre sick yes what is this latest thing glass and nails in your shoes your mother would die if she knew there was another silence robert putney drake finally answered lanquidly it was an experiment a phase the sioux indians do much worse to themselves in the sun dance so do lots of chaps in spanish monasteries and in india among other places its not the answer its really finished oh yes quite im trying something else something to hurt yourself again no nothing to hurt myself well then im glad to hear that but i do wish you would go to another alienist or psychiatrist or whatever they call themselves another pause you can pull yourself together you know play the man robert play the man old drake was satisfied he had talked turkey to the boy he had performed his fatherly duty besides the private detectives assured him that the red business really was trivial the lad had been to several anarchist and communist meetings but his comments had been uniformly aloof and cynical it was nearly a year later when the really bad news from the private investigators arrived how much will the girl take to keep her mouth shut old drake asked immediately after we pay hospital expenses maybe a thousand more the man from pinkertons said offer her five hundred the old man replied go up to a thousand only if you have to i said maybe a thousand the detective said bluntly he used a special kind of whip one with twisted nails in the ends she might want two or three thou shes only a common whore theyre used to this sort of thing not to this extent the detective was losing his deferential tone the photos of her back and her buttocks especially didnt bother me much but thats because im in this business and ive seen a lot an average jury would vomit mr drake in court in court old drake pronounced she would come before a judge who belongs to several of my clubs and has investments in my bank offer five hundred two months thereafter the stock market crashed and new york millionaires began leaping from high windows onto hard streets old drake the next day ran into his son begging on the street near the old granary cemetery the boy was wearing old clothes from a secondhand store its not that bad son well pull through oh i know that youll come out ahead in fact if im any judge of character then what the hell is this disgraceful damned foolishness experience im breaking out of a trap the old man fumed all the way back to the bank that evening he decided it was time for another open and honest discussion when he went to roberts room however he found the boy thoroughly trussed up in chains and quite purple in the face god damn son what is this the boy who was twentyseven and in some respects more sophisticated than his father grinned and relaxed the purple faded from his face one of houdinis escapes he explained simply you intend to become a stage magician my god not at all im breaking out of another trap the one that says nobody but houdini can do these things old drake to do him justice hadnt acquired his wealth without some shrewdness concerning human peculiarities i begin to see he said heavily pain is a trap that was why you put the broken glass in your shoes that time fear of poverty is a trap thats why you tried begging on the streets youre trying to become a superman like those crazy boys in chicago the thrill killers what you did to that whore last year was part of all this what else have you done a lot robert shrugged enough to be canonized as a saint or to be burnt as a diabolist none of it seems to add up though i still havent found the way he suddenly made a new effort and the chains slipped to the floor simple yoga and muscle control he said without pride the chains in the mind are much harder i wish there were a chemical a key to the nervous system robert said old drake you are going back to an alienist ill have you committed if you wont go voluntarily and so dr faustus unbewusst acquired a new patient at a time when many of his most profitable cases were discontinuing therapy because of the monetary depression he made very few notes on robert but these were subsequently found by an illuminati operative photostated and placed in the archives at agharti where hagbard celine read them in they were undated and scrawled in a hurried hand dr unbewusst in reactionformation against his own anal component was a conspicuously untidy and careless person but they told a fairly straightforward story rpd age latent homo father rich as croesus five sessions per week each keep him in therapy yrs thats a clear be ambitious aim for ten years beautiful rpd not latent homo at all advanced psychopath moral imbecile actually enjoys the money im soaking his father hopeless case all drives egosyntonic bastard doesnt give a fuck maybe as long as yrs hot shit rpd back on sadism again thinks thats the key must use great care if he gets caught at something serious jail or a sanitorium and can kiss that goodbye maybe use drugs to calm him rpd in another schizo mood today full of some crap a gypsy fortuneteller told him extreme care needed if the occultists get him thats grand peryear out the window clue to rpd all goes back to the war cant stand the thought that all must die metaphysical hangup nothing i can do if only there were an immortality pill risk of losing him to the occultists or even a church worse than i feared i can feel the grand slipping away rpd wants to go to europe wants meeting maybe therapy with that sheissdreck dummkopf carl jung must warn parents too sick to travel rpd gone after only months a lousy grand case too angry to see patients today spent morning drafting letter to globe on why fortunetellers should be forbidden by law if i could get my hands on that woman on her fat throat the bitch the fat stinking ignorant bitch down the drain because he needs immortality and doesnt know how to get it in ingolstadt danny pricefixer and clark kent are still staring at each other over lady velkors sleeping body when atlanta hope bursts into the room fresh from a shower and throws herself on the bed hugging and kissing everybody it was the first time she cries the first time i ever really made it it took all three of you on the other side of kent lady velkor opens an eye and says dont i get any credit it takes five that way remember mama sutra was only thirty then but she streaked her hair with gray to fit the image of the wise woman she recognized drake as soon as he wandered into the tea parlor old drakes son the crazy one loaded he motioned to her before the waitress could take his order mama sutra quick to pick up clues could tell from his suits wrinkles that he had been lying down boston common is a long walk from beacon hill there were shrinks in the neighborhood ergo he hadnt come from home but from a therapy session tea leaves or cards she asked courteously sitting across from him at the table cards he said absently looking down from the window to the common coffee he added to the waitress black as sin were you listening to the preachers down there mama sutra asked shrewdly yes he grinned engagingly he that believeth shall never taste death theyre in rare form today shuffle she said handing the cards over but they awakened some spiritual need in you my son thats why you came up here he met her eye cynically im willing to try any kind of witchcraft once i just came from a practitioner of the latest variety just off the boat from vienna a few years bullseye she thought neither his science nor their unenlightened faith can help you mama said somberly ignoring his cynicism let us hope that the cards will show the way she dealt a traditional tree of life at the crown was death upsidedown and below it were the king of swords in chokmah and the knight of wands in binah he that believeth shall never taste death he had quoted cynically i see a battlefield she began it was common boston gossip that drake first started acting odd after the war i see death come very close to you and then miss you she pointed to the reverse death card with a dramatic finger but many died many that you cared for deeply i liked a few of them he said grudgingly mostly i was worried about my own amy own hide but go ahead she looked at the knight of wands in the binah position should she mention the bisexuality implied he was going to a shrink and might be able to take it mama tried to hold the knight of wands and king of swords together in her focus and the way became clear there are two men in you one loves other men perhaps too much the other is desperately trying to free himself from all of humanity even from the world youre a leo she added suddenly taking a leap yes he said unimpressed august he was thinking that she had probably looked up the birthdates of all the richer individuals in town in case they ever wandered in its very hard for leos to accept death she said sadly you are like buddha after he saw the corpse on the road no matter what you have or own no matter what you achieve it will never be enough for you saw too many corpses in the war ah my son would that i could help you but i only read cards i am no alchemist who sells the elixir of eternal life while he was digesting that one a sure hit she felt mama rushed on to examine the five of wands reversed in chesed and the magus upright in geburah so many wands she said so many fire signs a true leo but so much of it turned inward see how the energetic knight of wands descends to the five upsidedown all your energies and leos are very powerful are turned against yourself you are a burning man trying to consume yourself and be reborn and the magus who shows the way is below the king of swords and dominated by him your reason wont allow you to accept the necessity of the fire you are still rebelling against death the fool was in tipareth and surprisingly upright but you are very close to taking the final step you are ready to let the fire consume even your intellect and die to this world this was going swimmingly she thought and then she saw the devil in netzach and the nine of swords reversed in yod the rest of the tree was even worse the tower in yesod and the lovers reversed of course in malkuth not a cup or a pentacle anywhere youre going to emerge as a much stronger man she said weakly that isnt what you see drake said and it isnt what i see the devil and the tower together are a pretty destructive pair arent they i suppose you know what the lovers reversed means too she asked the answer of the oracle is always death he quoted but you wont accept it the only way to conquer death until science produces an immortality pill is to make him your servant your company cop drake said calmly thats the key ive been looking for the bartender never becomes an alcoholic and the high priest laughs at the gods besides the tower is rotten to the core and deserves to be destroyed he pointed abruptly to the fool you have some real talents obviously even if you do cheat like everybody in this racketand you must know there are two choices after crossing the abyss the righthand path and the lefthand path i seem to be headed for the lefthand path i can see that much and it confirms what i already suspect go ahead and tell me the rest of what you see im not afraid to hear it very well mama wondered if he was one of the few the very few who would eventually come to the attention of the shining ones you will make death your servant as a tactic to master him yours is indeed the lefthand path you will cause immense suffering especially to yourself at first but after a while you wont notice that after a while you wont even notice the horrors that you inflict on others men will say that you are a materialist a worshipper of money what do you hate most she asked abruptly sentimental slop and lies all the christian lies in sunday school all the democratic lies in the newspapers all the socialist lies our socalled intellectuals are spouting these days every rotten crooked sneaking hypocritical deception people use to hide from themselves that were all still hunting animals in a jungle you admire neitzsche he was crazy lets just say i have less contempt for him and for desade than i have for most intellectuals yes so we know what the tower is that you will destroy everything in america that smacks of democracy or christianity or socialism the whole facade of humanitarianism from the constitution onward to the present you will turn your fire loose and burn all that up with your leonine energies you will force your view of america into total reality and make every citizen afraid of the jungle and of the death that lurks in the jungle crime and commerce are moving closer together due to prohibition you will complete their marriage all all this just to make death your servant instead of your master the money and power are just incidental to that no because even if you think you have it beat even if you think you can work out a reconciliation a separate peace i mean shit the war still goes on no youre only kidding yourself even say i love simon and thats all holly wood bullshit you cant really tell in only one week no matter how good it is but even if i love simon the war goes on as long as were going around in separate skins white man black man bronze man white woman black woman bronze woman even if hagbard claims to have gotten past all that on his submarine its only because theyre under the water and away from the world out here the bastards are using live ammunition like it says in the old joke maybe thats the only truth in the world not the bibles or poetry or philosophy but just the old jokes especially the bad jokes and the sad jokes no theyre using live ammunition i mean shit they never see me all of them white man black man bronze man white woman black woman bronze woman they look at me and im in their game i have my role i am black woman i am never just me no it goes on and on every step upward is a step into more hypocrisy until the game is stopped completely and nobody has found out how to do that no the more simon says that he does see me the more hes lying to himself no he never makes it with white woman because shes too much like his mother or some damned freudian reason like that i mean shit no i cant go on in their game i am going to scream with rage i am going to scream like an eagle i am going to scream in the ears of the whole world until somebody does see me until i am not black woman and not black and not woman and nothing no nothing justme no theyll say im giving up love and sanity well fuck them fuck them all no i wont turn back the acid has changed everything no at the end of it when i really am me maybe then i can find a better love and a better sanity no but first i have to find me go on drake was unsmiling but undisturbed the king of swords and the knight of wands are both very active you could do all this harmlessly by becoming an artist and showing this vision of the jungle you dont have to create it literally and inflict it on your fellow human beings stop preaching just read the cards youre better at it than i am but i can see enough to know that there is no such alternative for me the other wand and the other sword are reversed i cant be satisfied to do it in symbolic form i must do it so that everybody is affected by it not just the few who read books or go to concerts tell me what i dont know why is the line from the fool to the tower completed in the lovers reversed i know that i cant love anyone and i dont believe that anybody else ever does eitherthats more sentiment and hypocrisy people use each other as masturbating machines and crying towels and they call it love but theres a deeper meaning what is it start from the top death reversed you reject death so the fool cannot undergo rebirth and enter the righthand path when he crosses the abyss therefore the lefthand path the destruction of the tower there is only one end to that chain of karma my son the lovers means death just as death means life you are rejecting natural death and therefore refusing natural life your path will be an unnatural life leading to a death that is against nature you will die as a man before your body dies the fire is still selfdestructive even if you turn it outward and use the whole world as a stage for your private gotterdammerung your primary victim will still be yourself you have the talent drake said coldly but you are still basically a fraud like everyone in this business your worst victim madam is yourself you deceive yourself with the lies that you have so often told others its the occupational disease of mystics the truth is that it doesnt matter whether i destroy myself alone or destroy this planetor turn around and try to find my way to the righthand path in some dreary monastery the universe will roll blindly along not caring not even knowing theres no granddaddy in the clouds to pass a last judgment theres only a few airplanes up there learning more and more about how to carry bombs they courtmartialed general mitchell for saying it but its the truth the next time around theyll really bomb the hell out of civilian populations and the universe wont know or care about that either dont tell me that my flight from death leads back to death im not a child and i know that all paths lead back to death eventually the only question is do you cower before him all your life or do you spit in his eye you can transcend abject fear and rebellious hatred both you can see that he is only part of the great wheel and like all other parts necessary to the whole then you can accept him next youll be telling me to love him that too yes and i can learn to see the great and glorious whole picture i can see all the men defecating and urinating in their trousers before they died at chateauthierry watching their own guts fall out into their laps and screaming out of a hole that isnt even a mouth any more as manifestations of that sublime harmony and balance which is ineffable and holy and beyond all speech and reason sure i can see that if i knock half of my brain out of commission and hypnotize myself into thinking that the view from that weird perspective is deeper and wider and more truly true than the view from an unclouded mind go to the quadrupleamputee ward and try to tell them that you speak of death as a personified being very well then i must regard him as any other entity that gets in my way love is a myth invented by poets and other people who couldnt face the world and crept off into corners to create fantasies to console themselves the fact is that when you meet another entity either it makes way for you or you make way for it either it dominates and you submit or you dominate and it submits take me into any club in boston and ill tell you which millionaire has the most millions by the way the others treat him take me into any workingmans bar and ill tell you who has the best punch in a fistfight by the way the others treat him take me into any house and ill tell you in a minute whether the husband or the wife is dominant love equality reconciliation acceptance those are the excuses of the losers to persuade themselves that they choose their condition and werent beaten down into it find a dutiful wife who truly loves her husband ill have her in my bed in three days maximum because im so damned attractive no because i understand men and women ill make her understand without saying it aloud and shocking her that the adultery will one way or another hurt her husband whether he knows about it or not show me the most servile colored waiter in the best restaurant in town and after hes through explaining christianity and humility and all the rest of it count how many times a day he steps into the kitchen to spit in his handerchief the other employess will tell you he has a chest condition the condition he has is chronic rage the mother and the child an endless power struggle listen to the infants cry change in pitch when mother doesnt come at once is that fear you hear its rage insane fury at not having total dominance as for the mother herself id wager that ninety percent of the married women in the psychiatrists care are there because they cant admit to themselves cant escape the lie of love long enough to admit to themselves how often they want to strangle that monster in the nursery love of country another lie the truth is fear of cops and prisons love of art another lie the truth is fear of the naked truth without ornaments and false faces on it love of truth itself the biggest lie of all fear of the unknown people learn acceptance of all this and achieve wisdom they surrender to superior force and call their cowardice maturity it still comes down to one question are you kneeling at the altar or are you on the altar watching the others kneel to you the wheel of the tarot is the wheel of dharma mama sutra said softly when he had concluded it is also the wheel of the galaxy which you see as a blind machine it rolls on as you say no matter what we think or do knowing that i accept death as part of the wheel and i accept your nonacceptance as another part i can control neither i can only repeat my warning which is not a lie but a fact about the structure of the wheel by denying death you guarantee that you will meet him finally in his most hideous form drake finished his coffee and smiled whimsically you know he said my contempt for lies has an element of the very sentimentality and foolish idealism that i have been rejecting perhaps i will be most effective if i never speak so honestly again when you hear of me next i might be known as a philanthropist and benefactor of mankind he lit a cigar thoughtfully and that would even be true if your tarot mysticism is correct after all if death is necessary to the wheel along with all the other parts then i am necessary also the wheel would collapse perhaps if my spirit of rebellion were not there to balance your spirit of acceptance imagine that it is true that is why i have warned you but not judged you so i am as goethe says part of that force which aims at evil and only achieves good that is a thought which you should try to remember when the dark night of sammael descends upon you at the end more cant drake said with a return to his previous cynicism i aim at evil and i will achieve evil the wheel and all its harmonious balances and allhealing paradoxes is just another myth of the weak and defeated one strong man can stop the wheel or tear it to shreds if he dares enough perhaps we who study the wheel do not know all of its secrets some believe that your spirit reappears constantly in history because it is fated eventually to triumph maybe this is the last century of terrestrial mortals and the next century will be the time of the cosmic immortals what will happen then when the wheel is stopped none of us can predict it may be good or evil or evento quote your favorite philosopher beyond good and evil we cannot say that is another reason i do not judge you listen drake said with sudden emotion were both lying its not all this philosophical or cosmic the simple fact is that i couldnt sleep nights and nothing i tried in conventional cures could help me until i began to help myself by systematically rebelling against everything that seemed stronger than me i know i didnt know it was insomnia it might have been nightmares or dizzy spells or sexual impotence but there was some way that the scenes you saw in chateauthierry lived on and goaded you to wake out of the dream of the sleepwalkers on the streets you are waking you stand on the abyss she pointed to the fool and the dog who barks at his heels and i am the noisy little bitch barking to warn you that you can still choose the righthand path the decision is not final until you cross the abyss but the cards show that i really have very little choice especially in the world that is going to emerge from this depression mama sutra smiled without forgiveness or final condemnation this is no age for saints she agreed softly two dollars please george dont make no bull moves the dutchman saw it all clearly now capone and luciano and maldonado and lepke and all the rest of them were afraid of winifred and the washington crowd they were planning a deal and his death was part of the bargain the fools didnt know that you can never negotiate from fear they thought of the order only as a handy gimmick for international communications and illicit trade they were too dumb to really study the teachings especially they had never understood the third teaching fear is failure once youre afraid of the bulls youre lost but the bull was gone what have you done with him he shouted at the hospital wall smiling jim had seen the eagle only the day before its nest was definitely on one of these peaks he would get it he knew it in his bones a hunch so strong it couldnt be doubted panting sweating every muscle aching he climbed onward the coffee leaped out of the paper cup and slurped onto the pages of carnal orgy igor beaver the graduate student looked up in astonishment the seismograph stood at grade a mile away dillinger woke as the bedroom door slammed shut and his favorite statue king kong atop the empire state building fell off the bureau no remission no remission no remission without the shedding of blood no remission without the shedding of blood mama sutra looked down through the window at boston common robert putney drake had stopped and was listening to one of the preachers again even at this distance she could recognize the cool closed smile on his face the dealy lama sat down across from her well he asked definitely the order will have to intervene mama shook her head sadly hes a menace to the whole world slowness is beauty the dealy lama said let the lower order contact him first if they decide hes worth the effort then well act i think i shall persuade hagbard to attend harvard so he can be in his neighborhood and keep an eye on him so to speak its the word of the bible and the word of god and it says it plain and clear so no highbrow professor can say it means something else how old are you actually mama asked curiously the dealy lama looked at her levelly would you believe thirty thousand years she laughed i should have known better than to ask you can always tell the higher members by their sense of humor and this is what it says no remission no remission brothers and sisters no remission without the shedding of blood without the shedding of blood no remission no remission without the shedding of blood hagbards mouth fell open in completely genuine surprise well sink me he said beginning to laugh behind him on a wall joe noticed dizzily was a brandnew graffito probably scrawled by somebody out of his skull on the acid the pigeons in b f skinners cages are political prisoners we both pass hagbard went on happily weve been judged and found innocent by the great god acid joe took a deep breath and when do you start to explain in monosyllables or sign language or semaphore or something a nonilluminated moron like me can understand you read all the clues it was right out in the open it was plain as a barn door it was as conspicuous as my nose and twice as homely in every sense of that word hagbard for christs sake and for my sake and for all our sakes will you stop gloating and give me the answer im sorry hagbard pocketed the gun carelessly im a bit giddy ive been waging a kind of war all night high on acid it was a strain especially since i was at least ninety percent sure youd kill me before it was over he lit one of his abominable cigars briefly then the illuminati is benevolent compassionate kindly generous et cetera et cetera add all the other complimentary adjectives you can think of in short were the good guys butbutit cant be it can be and it is hagbard motioned him toward the bugatti lets sit down if i may permit myself one more acrostic before the codes and puzzles are all resolved they climbed into the front seat and joe accepted the brandy decanter hagbard offered of course hagbard went on when i say good youve got to understand that all terms are relative were as good as is possible in this fuckedup section of the galaxy were not perfect certainly im not and i havent observed anything approaching immaculate perfection in any of the other masters of the temple either but we are in human terms and by ordinary standards decent chaps theres a reason for that its the basic law of magic and its in every textbook you must have read it somewhere do you know what i mean joe took a stiff snort of the brandy it was peach his favorite yes i think as ye give so shall ye get precisely hagbard took back the bottle and had a snort himself mind you joe thats a scientific law not a moral commandment there are no commandments because there is no commander anywhere all authority is a delusion whether in theology or in sociology everything is radically even sickeningly free the first law of magic is as neutral as newtons first law of motion it says that the equation balances and thats all it says you are still free to give evil and pain if you decide you must once done however you never escape the consequences it always comes back no prayers sacrifices mortifications or supplications will change it any more than theyll change newtons laws or einsteins so were good as moralists would say because we know enough to have a bloody strong reason to be good in the last week things went too fast and i became evili deliberately ordered and paid for the deaths of various people and set in motion processes that had to lead to still other deaths i knew what i was doing and i knewand still knowthat ill pay for it such decisions are extremely rare in the history of the order and my superior the dealy lama tried to persuade me it was unnecessary this time too i disagreed i take the responsibility no man or god or goddess can change it i will pay and im ready to pay whenever and however the bill is presented hagbard what are you a mehum the saure family would say hagbard grinned a mere human no more not one jot more how much blood robert putney drake asked he was astonished at his own words in all his experiments at breaking through the walls he had never lowered himself to heckling an ignorant street preacher all the blood in the world isnt enough every man woman and child isnt enough even all the animals if you added them in line in some pagan or voodoo sacrifice it wouldnt be enough it wouldnt be enough brothers the good book says so there were five of us johnjohn dillinger was explaining to george as they trudged back toward ingolstadt having lost hagbard and the bugatti in the crowd my folks kept it a secret german people very superstitious and secretive they didnt want reporters all over the place and headlines about the first quintuplets to live the dionne family got all that much later because all the blood in the world isnt equal to one drop not one drop john herbert dillinger is in las vegas trying to track down the plague unless he already finished up and went home to los angeles johnjohn smiled he was always the brains of the bunch runs a rockmusic company real professional businessman he was the oldest by a couple of minutes and we all sort of look up to him he served the prison time even though im the one who rightly should have seeing that robbing that grocer was my dumb idea but he said he could take it without cracking up and he was right not one drop not one drop of the precious blood of our lord and savior jesus christ i see drake said and was that a b ab or o john hoover dillinger lives in mad dog under the name d j hoover hes not above letting people suspect hes a distant relative of j edgars mostly johnjohn said hes retired except occasionally for little jobs like helping arrange convincing jail breaks say when jim cartwright wants to let a prisoner get out in a realistic fashion he gave naismith the idea for the john dillinger died for you society how about the other two george asked thinking that it would be even harder to decide whether he loved stella more than mavis or mavis more than stella now that he knew they were the same person he wondered how joe felt since he obviously dug miss mao tsuhsi and she was that person also three in one and one in three like dillinger or was dillinger five in three george realized suddenly that he was still tripping a little dillinger was five in one not five in three the law of fives again did that mean there were two more in the mavisstellamao complex two that he hadnt met yet why did two and three keep popping up in all this the other two are dead johnjohn said sadly john edgar dillinger was born first and he went and died first fast and furious he was it was him that plugged that bank guard in east chicago while the rest of us were vacationing and laying low in miami always the hothead he was had a heart attack back in and went to an early grave john thomas dillinger went in he was in chicago in on a jam assignment meeting with a crazy english spy named chips british intelligence somehow got a report that the democratic convention was being run by the bavarian illuminati and would end with an assassination they didnt believe in the illuminati so they sent chips they always send him on wild cases cause hes nutty enough to take them seriously and do a thorough job both of them got teargassed coming out of the hilton hotel and poor chips got thrown in a paddywagon with a bunch of young radicals john thomas had a chest problem already a chronic asthma and the tear gas made it a lot worse he went from doctor to doctor and finally passed away early in so theres a cop in chicago who could boast that he really killed john dillinger only he doesnt know it isnt life peculiar the saure family only thought they were in the illuminati hagbard went on hitler and stalin only thought they were in the illuminati old weishaupt only thought he was in the illuminati its that simple the moral of the whole story is beware of cheap occidental imitations he smiled grimly i think its beginning to penetrate joe said slowly it was of course the very first hypothesis i formed there have been many groups in history who called themselves the illuminati and they werent all aiming at exactly the same thing precisely hagbard puffed again at his cigar thats the natural first suspicion of any nonparanoid mind then as you explore the evidence links between these groups begin to appear eventually the paranoid hypothesis begins to appear more plausible and you begin to believe there always has been one illuminati using the same basic slogans and symbols and aiming at the same basic goal i sent jim cartwright to you with that yarn about three conspiracies the abc or ancient bavarian conspiracy the nbc or new bavarian conspiracy and the cbs or conservative bavarian seers to set you thinking that the truth might be midway backward toward the simple first idea from here on in forget that i represent the original illuminati in fact in recent centuries we dont use a name at all we employ only the initials aa written like this he sketched on a donauhotel matchbook a a a lot of occult writers he went on have made some amazing guesses as to what that means actually it doesnt mean a damned thing to prevent our name being stolen and misused again we dont have a name anybody who thinks hes guessed the name and tries to pass himself off as an initiate by declaring that were really the atlantean arcanum or the argenteum astrum or whatever immediately reveals that hes a fraud its a neat gimmick hagbard intoned gloomily i only wish we had thought of it centuries earlier the buzzer on the presidents secretarys desk buzzed as saul and barney passed through the outer door the secretary flipped the switch and the president said find out the highest medal a civilian can get and order two on my signature for those two detectives yes sir the secretary said scribbling and then ask the fbi to check out that older one he looked like a kike to me the president said shrewdly no because id be a fool to think miracles can occur in this world before somebody pays the rent and the taxes and shows that their papers are in order and the people who are running it can always tell you your papers are not in order no because there are no magicians and even hagbard is mostly a fraud and a con man even if he means well no because im not pope joan if there ever was a pope joan no because like the song says im not a queen im a woman and the wrong color woman to boot no because there will be rivers of blood and the earth will be shaken before we can overturn boss charlie because it isnt a simple onenight symbolic armageddon like hagbard fooled them all into thinking no because hagbard is some kind of magician and put us all on his own trip for a while but the real world isnt a trip its a bummer no because the lovers dont live happily ever after what happens is that they get married and get into debt and live in slavery ever after and ive got to find something better than that no because none of us are driving the car its the car thats driving us no because its like that old joke balls said the queen if i had them id be king and nuts said the prince ive got them and im not king and crap said the king and thirty thousand royal subjects squatted and strained for in those days the kings word was law hagbard would call it anality and sexism and ageism but it just comes down to the women and children getting all the crap right in the face and a few males owning everything the truth is all in the old jokes especially the bad jokes im still tripping but this is true they can always say your papers are not in order no because sometimes youve got to be a hermit and then come back later when youre together no because the wheel keeps spinning and doesnt give a fuck if theres going to be any change its got to be that some human being somewhere does give a fuck no because ive never found a way to shut simons mouth and make him listen no because jesus christ was a black man and theyve even lied about that he was another black man they killed and they wont admit it no because death is the currency in every empire roman or american or any other all empires are the same death is always the argument they use no because the whole world can go to the devil and im taking care of mary lou no because look at that professor they killed at the un building and none of them arrested yet no because theres a perpetual motion machine inside me and im learning to let it run no because ill put a curse on all of them ill burn them ill condemn them ill have the world no because look what happened to daddy and mommy its grade and moving up toward igor beaver shouted into the phone you idiot dont you think i can tell that from here dr troll shouted back my bed was bouncing around like it had saint vitus dance even before you called his emotion was merely professional anger at the students failure to obey orders grade is nothing to get exerted about if youre a californian and even grade causes anxiety only among tourists or believers in the famous edgar cayce prophecy john herbert dillinger one of those believers was already in the garage pajama tops tucked in to hastily donned trousers bare foot on the starter but smiling jim climbed blissfully upward enjoying total communication with nature the mystic rapture of the true hunter before he gets his chance to open fire and blast a chunk of nature to hell you may mock and you may jest but at the last judgment the smile will be wiped off your face hes heckling the preacher mama said a small beginning certainly for the kind of destiny he seems to be choosing hes heckling himself the dealy lama pronounced christianity rightly understood is an encounter with death hes still struggling with that problem he wants to believe in the symbolism of the resurrection but he cant too much intellect king of swords keeping the reins on his intuitive prince of wands aspect well maybe drake said calmly but suppose he was type a now if he got a transfusion at the last minute the nest was in sight the bird was invisible but smiling jim recognized the characteristic eagles nest on a peak only a few hundred yards above and to the west come home baby he thought passionately unstrapping his rifle come home daddy is waiting hagbard took another belt of the brandy and repeated the saures were not illuminati neither were weishaupt or hitler they were frauds pure and simple first they deluded themselves then they deluded others the real illuminati the aa have never been involved in politics or in any form of manipulating or coercing people our interests are entirely elsewhere do what thou wilt is our law only in the last few decades as the fate of the earth seemed to be hanging in the balance have we taken any direct action even so we have been cautious we know that power corrupts we have acted chiefly by notacting by what the taoists call wuwei but then things got out of hand they moved too fast we fucked up somewhat but only because total inaction seemed to mean total disaster you mean you as an official of some sort in the aa infiltrated the fake illuminati and became one of their top five intending to undo them nonviolently and it didnt work it worked about as well as any activity on that level ever works hagbard said somberly most of humanity has been spared for a while and the wild free animals have been spared for a while he sighed i guess ill have to begin from the abcs we have never sought power we have sought to disperse power to set men and women free that really means to help them to discover that they are free everybodys free the slave is free the ultimate weapon isnt this plague out in vegas or any new super hbomb the ultimate weapon has always existed every man every woman and every child owns it its the ability to say no and take the consequences fear is failure the fear of death is the beginning of slavery thou hast no right but to do thy will the goose can break the bottle at any second socrates took the hemlock to prove it jesus went to the cross to prove it its in all history all myth all poetry its right out in the open all the time hagbard sighed again our founder and leader the man known in myth as prometheus or the snake in the garden of eden oh christ joe said slumping forward in his seat i have the feeling that youre starting to put me on again youre about to tell me that the prometheus and genesis stories are really based on fact our leader known as lucifer or satan hagbard went on lucifer being the bringer of light you know joe said im not going to believe a word of this our leader known as prometheus the firebringer or lucifer the lightbringer or quetzalcoatl the morning star or the snake in the garden of osiriss bad brother set or shaitan the tempter well to be brief he repented hagbard raised an eyebrow does that intrigue you sufficiently to silence your skepticism long enough for me to finish a sentence he repented joe sat upright again sure why not hagbards old malicious grin so rare in the last week returned if atlas can shrug and telemachus can sneeze why cant satan repent go ahead joe said this is just another one of your putons but im hooked ill listen but i have my own answer which is that there is no answer youre just an allegory on the universe itself and every explanation of you and your actions is incomplete theyll always be a new more uptodate explanation coming along a while later thats my answer hagbard laughed easily charming he said i must remember that the next time im trying to understand myself of course its true of any human being were all allegories on the universe different faces it wears in trying to decide what it really is but our founder and leader as i was saying repented thats the secret that has never been revealed there is no stasis anywhere in the cosmos least of all in the minds of entities that possess minds the basic fallacy of all bad writersand theologians are notoriously bad writersis to create cardboard characters who never change he gave us the light of reason and seeing how we misused it he repented the story is more complicated but thats the basic outline at least its as much as i understood until a week ago the important thing to get clear is that he never aimed at power or destruction thats a myth created by the opposition joe said right i read that in mark twains defense of satan twain was subtle hagbard said taking a little more brandy but not subtle enough no the myth was not created by the opposition it was created by our founder himself wilde should be alive joe said admiringly he was so proud of himself setting paradox on top of paradox until he had a nice three or four or fivestory house of contradictions built up he should see the skyscrapers you create you never disappoint me hagbard said if they ever hang you youll be arguing about whether the rope really exists until the last minute thats why i picked you all those years ago and programmed you for the role youd play tonight only a man whose father was an exmoslem and who was himself an excatholic and an exengineering student would have the required complexity anyway to return to the libretto as an old friend of mine used to say the error of weishaupt and hitler and stalin and the saures was to believe the propaganda our founder spread against himself that and believing they were in communication with him when they were only in communication with a nasty part of their own unconscious minds there was no evil spirit misleading them they were misleading themselves and we were trailing along behind trying to keep them from causing too much harm finally in the early s after a certain fuckup in dallas convinced me that things were getting out of hand i contacted the five directly since i knew the real secrets of magic and they only had distortions it was easy to convince them that i was an emissary from those beings whom they call the secret chiefs or the great old ones or the shining ones being half crazy they reacted in a way i had not expected they all abdicated and appointed me and the four saures as their successors they decided that were entering the age of horus the childgod and that youth should be given a chance to run thingshence the promotion of the saures they threw me in because i seemed to know what i was talking about but then came the real problem i couldnt convince the saures of anything those pigheaded kids wouldnt believe a word i said they told me i was over thirty and untrustworthy i told you the truth was out in the open all the time anybody with eyes in his head should have been able to interpret whats been happening since the early s the great and dreaded illuminati of the past had fallen into the control of a bunch of ignorant and malicious kids the age of the crowned and conquering child and you think the old and wise should rule joe asked that doesnt fit your character this has to be another puton i dont think anybody should rule hagbard said all im doing all the higher order of the aa has ever tried to dois communicate with people in spite of their biases and fears not to rule them and what were trying to communicatethe ultimate secret the philosophers stone the elixir of lifeis just the power of the word no we are people who have said non serviam and were trying to teach others to say it drake was one of us spiritually but never understood it if we cant find immortality we can make a damned good try if we cant save this planet we can get off it and go to the stars and what happens now joe asked more surprises hagbard answered promptly i cant tell you the whole story at this hour with both of us fagged out at the end of an acid trip we go back to the hotel and sleep and after breakfast there are more revelations for george as well as for you and later in the bugatti which driven by harry coin was grandly wafting hagbard george and joe around the south side of lake totenkopf george asked is hitler really going to be buried anonymously in a jewish cemetery it looks that way hagbard grinned his israeli documents are excellent forgeries hell be lifted off that toilet by hauptmanns men and gently deposited in the ingolstadt hebrew burial grounds there to rest for all eternity that will make me throw up once a day for the rest of my life joe said bitterly its the worst case of cemetery desecration in history oh it has a positive aspect said hagbard look at it from the point of view of the nazi leaders think how theyll hate being buried in a jewish cemetery with a rabbi praying over them doesnt make up for it said george joes right its in terribly bad taste i thought both you guys were thoroughgoing atheists said hagbard if you are you think the dead are dead and it hardly matters where theyre buried whats happening you both getting religion i can think of nothing more likely to drive a man to religion than your company said joe burying them nazis with a bunch of jews is the funniest thing i ever heard harry coin offered from the drivers seat go bugger a dead goat coin george called sure thing said coin lead me to it youre incorrigible hagbard said joe you really are incorrigible and you surround yourself with people who incorrige you i dont need help said hagbard i have a great deal of initiative more than any other human being i know with the possible exception of mavis george said hagbard did i really see what i thought i saw last night is mavis really a goddess are stella and miss mao and mavis all the same person or was i just hallucinating here come the paradoxes joe groaned hell talk for an hour and well be more confused when hes finished hagbard who was sitting in a large swivel jump seat swung round so he was looking over harry coins shoulder at the road ahead id be glad to tell you later george i would have told you now except that i dont like maliks tone he may not be intending to shoot me any more but he still has it in for me you bet said joe well are you still going to marry mavis what hagbard swung round and stared at george with an expression that was almost a perfect replica of genuine surprise you said that you and mavis were going to be married aboard the leif erikson by miss portinari are you yes said hagbard miss portinari will marry us later today sorry but i knew her first then mavis isnt really eris george persisted shes just a priestess of eris hagbard brushed the question away later george she will explain it shes even better at explanations than hagbard is joe commented cynically well said hagbard getting back to hitler and company you have to realize that they will know about it if their bodies are buried in a jewish cemetery they are still conscious and aware though they are not what we would normally call alive their consciousnessenergy is intact though there is no life in their bodies they came to the ingolstadt festival hoping that their young leaders would give them immortality theyve achieved immortality all right but not a very nice kind their consciousnessenergy has been gobbled up by the evil one their identities still survive but they will be helpless parts of the eater of souls the foulest being in the universe the only creature that can turn spirit into carrion yog sothoth has claimed his own yog sothoth said joe i remember learning about yog sothoth it was an invisible being trapped in a pentagonal structure in atlantis the original illuminati blew up the structure and turned the creature loose why yes hagbard said you saw that erisian liberation front training film about atlantis and grayface gruad didnt you well of course the film isnt accurate in every respect for instance yog sothoth is depicted as killing people by the thousands actually most of the time except under very limited conditions he has to have his killing done for him thats how human sacrifice originated and it was to get his killing done for him that he manipulated a great many events among the atlanteans until old grayface the original moral sadomasochist came along with his notions about good and evil man suffers because he is evil said gruad and because he is small and helpless there are vast powers in the universe dwarfing us who have to be placated gruad taught man to see ignorance passion pain and death as evils and to fight against them well ignorance is an evil said joe not when it can be acknowledged and accepted said hagbard in order to eat you have to be hungry in order to learn you have to be ignorant ignorance is a condition of learning pain is a condition of health passion is a condition of thought death is a condition of life when gruad taught his followers in atlantis to see those conditions as evils then he could teach them human sacrifice persecution and warfare yog sothoth taught gruad to teach his people those things only gruad never knew it so yog sothoth is the serpent in the garden of eden said joe in a manner of speaking said hagbard but you understand the garden of eden myth was dreamed up and promulgated by the illuminati and who dreamed up the gruad of atlantis myth said joe oh thats true said hagbard solemnly thats the biggest bunch of bullshit i ever heard said joe youre trying to claim that theres no such thing as good and evil that the concepts were invented and taught to humans deliberately to fuck them up psychologically but in order to maintain that you have to postulate that the condition of man before gruad was good and that his condition afterward has been evil and you have to make yog sothoth into a carbon copy of satan you havent progressed one iota beyond the judeochristian myth with that highfalutin sciencefiction story hagbard roared with laughter and slapped joe on the knee beautiful he held up his hand in a distinctive gesture what i am doing he asked youre giving the peace sign only with your fingers together george said confused thats what comes of being an ignorant baptist joe laughed as a son of the true church i can tell you george that hagbard is giving a catholic blessing indeed said hagbard look at the shadow my hand casts on this book he held up a book behind his hand and they saw the head of a horned devil the sun source of all light and energy symbol of redemption and my hand in the most sacred gesture of benediction put them both together they spell satan he sang to an old tune and what the hell does that mean joe demanded evil is only a shadow a false appearance the usual mystic mishmosh tell that to the survivors of auschwitz suppose hagbard said i told you that good was only a shadow a false appearance several modern philosophers have argued that case rather plausibly and earned themselves a reputation for hardheaded realism and yet thats just the mirror image of what you call the usual mystic mishmosh then what is real george demanded mary queen of the may or kali mother of murderers or eris who synthesizes both the trip is real hagbard said the images you encounter along the way are all unreal if you keep moving and pass them you eventually discover that solipsism sophomore solipsism joe answered no hagbard grinned the solipsist thinks the tripper is real harry coin called out hagbard theres a couple of guys up the road flagging us down hagbard turned and peered ahead right theyre crew members from the leif erikson pull up where they tell you to harry he reached up to a silver vase mounted beside the back seat and took a pink rosebud out of the fresh bouquet he had placed there that morning he carefully inserted the rosebud in the buttonhole of his lapel the great golden bugatti rolled to a stop and the four men got out harry patted its long front fender with a long skinny hand thanks for letting me drive this car hagbard he said thats the nicest thing anyones ever done for me no it isnt now youll want your own bugatti or whats worse youll ask me to let you be my chauffeur no i wont but ill do a deal with you you let me have this car and whenever you want to go somewhere in it ill drive you hagbard laughed and slapped coin on the back you keep on showing that much intelligence and you will end up owning one the long line of cars that had been following the bugatti now were stopping along the edge of the road behind it there was a stretch of lawn that sloped gently down from the road to the lake out on the choppy blue water a round gold buoy drifted giving off a cloud of red smoke stella stepped out of the mercedes that was parked behind the bugatti george half expected mavis and miss mao to get out with her but there was no sign of them he looked at her and was unable to speak he didnt know what to say she looked back at him with grave sad eyes in silence somehow he thought it will all be different and better when we get down to the submarine in the submarine well be able to talk to each other a pink cadillac behind the mercedes disgorged simon moon and clark kent stella did not turn to look at them they were talking excitedly to each other a motorcycle pulled up behind the cadillac otto waterhouse climbed off it now stella turned and looked at otto then back to george otto looked at stella then at george stella suddenly turned away from both of them and walked down to the edge of the lake a large inflated liferaft was pulled up on shore and one of hagbards men sitting in the raft stood up holding a wetsuit as stella approached slowly as if she were all alone by the shore of the lake stella took off her peasant blouse and skirt and continued stripping until she was naked then she started to put on the wetsuit meanwhile another man got behind the wheel of hagbards bugatti royale and drove it across the lawn two other men held the mouth of a huge transparent plastic bag far enough apart so that the car could be driven right into it they tied up the end of the bag with strong wire ropes attached to the bag grew taut their other ends disappeared into the water slowly looking somewhat majestic and somewhat ridiculous the car slid across the lawn and into the water when it had been pulled out a short distance from shore it began to float out of the deeper water popped two golden scubalaunches hagbards men in black wetsuits mounted in the saddles the launches positioned themselves on either side of the automobile in its plastic bubble and the men lashed the launches and the car together with cables then they started their engines and launches men and car quickly sank out of sight meanwhile more rubber rafts pulled ashore and all of hagbards people started donning wetsuits distributed by the men from the submarine ive never done this before said lady velkor are you sure its safe dont worry baby said simon moon even a man could do it wheres your friend mary lou george asked she left me simon said glumly the damned acid fucked up her mind nobecause in the long run whites and blacks and men and women have to come to an understanding and an equality no because this split cant go on forever i mean shit i understand that but no i cant not now no i am not ready yet the penis i imagined i had last night was not just some freudian hallucination theres the phallic power behind the physical penis no the acting from the center of the body what simon says hagbard calls acting from the heart and only a few can have that right now no most of us havent learned and havent been given a chance to learn thats the real castration the real impotence in both men and women in both blacks and whites no the power that we think is phallic because this is a patriarchal society no i cant be simons woman or anybodys woman first ive got to be my own woman and it may take years it may take life i may never achieve it but ive got to try i cant end up like daddy i cant end up like most blacks and most of the whites too end up no maybe ill meet simon again maybe we can try a second time that acid nut timothy leary always said you can be anything you want the second time around no it cant be this time its got to be the second time around no i said no i wont no i hope to hell hauptmann was telling the truth about not following me said hagbard its going to take time to get us all down below what are we doing with the cars harry coin asked well the bugatti obviously is too beautiful for me to part with which is why im taking it aboard the leif erikson but the rest well just leave maybe some of the people who went to the festival will be able to use them dont worry about them huns said johnjohn dillinger strolling up any of them give us trouble well just reply with a few short sharp words from old mr thompson leave em in stitches peace its wonderful said hagbard sourly give it a chance said malaclypse still in the guise of jeanpaul sartre it needs time to spread the absence of the illuminati has to make itself felt it will make a difference i doubt it said hagbard the dealy lama was right all along the entire operation of outfitting hagbards people with wetsuits paddling them out to the scubalaunches and transporting them down to the leif erikson took more than an hour when it was georges turn he looked eagerly into the depths for the leif erikson and was happy when he saw it glowing below him like a great golden blimp well at least thats real he thought im approaching it from the outside and its just as big as i think it is even if it doesnt go anywhere and this is all happening in disney world an hour later the submarine was deep in the sea of valusia george joe and hagbard stood on the bridge hagbard leaning against the ancient viking prow george and joe peering into the endless gray depths watching the strange blind fishes and monsters swim by theres a type of fungus that has evolved into something resembling seaweed in this ocean said hagbard its luminescent theres no light down here so no green plants grow a dot appeared in the distance and grew rapidly in size until george recognized a porpoise doubtless howard there was scubadiving equipment strapped to the animals back when he had come alongside he turned a somersault and his translated voice started to come through the loudspeaker in a song when he swims the oceans spill he can start earthquakes at will he lived when the earth was desolate i sing leviathan the great hagbard shook his head that doggerel is just awful im going to have to do something about fuckups ability to translate poetry what are you talking about howard aha said joe i didnt get a look at your talking porpoise friend last time i was aboard hello howard im joe hello joe said howard welcome to my world unfortunately its not a very hospitable world at the moment there is grave danger in the atlantic the true ruler of the illuminati is on the prowl on the high seas leviathan himself the land is collapsing beside the pacific and the tremors have made the earth shake and leviathan is disturbed and has risen from the depths besides the trembling of the lands and seas he knows that his chief worshippers the illuminati are dead he had read their passing in the pulsings of consciousnesenergy that reach even into the depths of the sea well he cant eat the submarine said hagbard and were well armed he can crack the submarine open as easily as a gull cracks a penguins egg said howard and your weapons will bother him not at all hes virtually indestructible hagbard shrugged while joe and george looked askance at each other ill be careful howard but we cant turn around now weve got to get back to north america well try to evade leviathan if we see him he fills the whole ocean said howard no matter what you do youll see him and hell see you youre exaggerating only slightly i must bid you farewell now i think weve done a good weeks work and the menace to my people recedes even as does the danger to yours our porpoise horde is scattering and leaving by different exits into the north atlantic im getting out of the sea of valusia by way of scotland we think leviathan will head south around cape horn into the pacific everything that swims and is hungry is going that way theres a lot of fresh meat in the water im sorry to say goodbye friends so long howard said hagbard that was a good bridge you helped me build yes it was said howard too bad you had to sink it what were those tanks on howards back said joe scuba gear said george theres no air available in the sea of valusia so howard has to have breathing equipment till he can get to the open ocean hagbard what was that business about the true ruler of the illuminati ive heard again and again that there were five illuminati primi four of them were the saure family that leaves one is it leviathan is the whole show being run by a sea monster is that the big secret no said hagbard you have yet to figure out who the fifth illuminatus primus is he threw joe a wink that george missed by true ruler howard meant a godlike being whom the illuminati worship a sea monster said joe there was a hint about a sea monster of enormous size and power in that movie those people showed me in that loft on the lower east side but the original illuminati gruads bunch were portrayed as sun worshippers that big pyramid with the eye in it was supposed to be the sun gods eye who the hell were those people with the movie anyway i know who miss mao is now but i still dont know who they were members of the erisian liberation front elf said hagbard they have a somewhat different view of the prehistory and origins of the illuminati than we do one thing we both agree upon is that the illuminati invented religion the original sin right said joe sardonically joe you ought to start a religion yourself said hagbard why because you are so skeptical were going back to america huh said george and the adventure is more or less over this phase of it at least said hagbard good i want to try to write about what ive seen and what has happened to me ill see you guys later theres to be a magnificent dinner tonight in the main dining salon said hagbard joe said dont forget confrontation has a first option on anything you write fuck you georges voice came back as the door of the bridge closed behind him wish i had something better to do than this gimme two said otto waterhouse you do dont you said harry coin aint that nigra gal stella your gal why aint you with her because she doesnt exist said otto picking up the two cards johnjohn dillinger had slid across the polished teakwood table to him he studied his hand for a moment then threw a fiveton flax note into the pot any more than mavis or miss mao exists theres a woman somewhere under all of those identities but everything ive experienced has been a hallucination there isnt a woman in the world you couldnt say that about said dillinger how many cards you want harry three said harry this is a lousy hand you dealt me johnjohn come to think of it youre hallucinatin all the time when you have sex thats what makes it good and thats how come i can fuck anything ill just take one said dillinger dealt myself a pretty good hand what do you see when youre fucking trees and little boys and whatnot harry a white light said harry just a big beautiful clear white light ill throw in ten tons of flax this time must be your hand isnt so lousy after all said waterhouse come in said george the stateroom door opened and he put down his pen it was stella we have a little problem dont we george she said coming into the room and sitting beside him on the bed i think youre angry at me she went on putting her hand on his knee you feel like this identity of mine is a sham so in a sense i was deceiving you ive lost you and mavis both said george youre both the same person which means youre really neither youre immortal youre not human i dont know what you are suddenly he looked at her hopefully unless that was all a hallucination last night could it have been the acid can you really change into different people yes said mavis dont do that said george it upsets me too much he darted a little glance to his side it was stella i dont really understand why it bothers me so much said george i ought to be able to take everything in stride by now did it ever bother you that you were in love with mavis besides being in love with me said stella not much because it hardly ever seemed to bother you but i know why now how could you be jealous when you and mavis were the same person were not the same person really what does that mean did you ever read the three faces of eve listen like all the best love stories it began in paris she was well known as a hollywood actress and was actually an illuminatus he was becoming fairly famous as a jetset millionaire and was actually a smuggler and anarchist envision bogart and bergman in the flashback sequences from casablanca it was like that a passion so intense a paris so beautiful recovering from the war it had been slipping toward in the bogartbergman epic a couple so radiant that any observer with an eye for nuance would have foretold a storm ahead it came the night he confessed he was a magician and made a certain proposal to her she left him at once a month later back in beverly hills she realized that what he had asked was her destiny when she tried to find himas often happened with hagbard celine he had dropped from public view leaving his businesses in other hands temporarily and was in camera a year later she heard that he was again a public figure hobnobbing with english businessmen of questionable reputation and even more dubious chinese importexport executives in hong kong she violated her contract with the biggest studio in hollywood and flew to the crown colony only to find he had dropped from sight again while his recent friends were being investigated for involvement in the heroin business she found him in tokyo at the imperial hotel a year ago i decided to accept your proposal she told him but now after hong kong im not so sure thelema he said facing her across a room that seemed designed for martians it had actually been designed for welshmen she sat down abruptly on a couch youre in the order in the order and against the order he said the real purpose is to destroy them im one of the top five in the united states she said unsteadily what makes you think ill turn on them now thelema he repeated its not just a password it means will the order is my will she quoted from weishaupts original oath of initiation if you really believed that you wouldnt be here he said youre talking to me because part of you knows that a human beings will is never in an external organization you sound like a moralist thats odd for a heroin merchant you sound like a moralist too and thats very odd for a servant of agharti nobody joins that lot she said with a pert cockney accent without being a moralist to start with they both laughed i was right about you hagbard said but george interrupted is he really in the heroin business thats dirty you sound like a moralist too she said its part of his demonstration any government could put him out of business within their borders as england has done by legalizing junk so long as they refuse to do that theres a black market he wont let the mafia monopolize it he makes sure the black market is a free market if it wasnt for him a lot of junkies who are alive today would be dead of contaminated heroin but let me go on with the story they rented a villa in naples to begin the transformation for a month the only humans she saw aside from hagbard were two servants named sade and masoch she later learned that their real names were eichmann and calley they began each day by serving her breakfast and quarreling the first day sade argued for materialism and masoch for idealism the second day sade expounded fascism and masoch communism the third day sade insisted on cracking eggs from the big end and masoch was equally vehement about the little end all the debates were on a high and lofty intellectual level verbally but seemed absurd because of the simple fact that sade and masoch always wore clown suits the fourth day they argued for and against abortion the fifth day for and against mercykilling the sixth day for and against the proposition life is worth living she became more and more aware of the time and money hagbard had spent in training and preparing them each argued with the skill of a firstrate trial lawyer and had a phalanx of carefully researched facts to support his position and yet the clown suits made it hard to take either of them seriously the seventh morning they argued theism versus atheism the eighth morning the individual versus the state the ninth whether wearing shoes was or was not a sexual perversion all arguments began to seem equally insubstantial the tenth morning they feuded over realism versus antinomianism the eleventh whether the statement all statements are relative is or is not selfcontradictory the twelfth whether a man who sacrifices his life for his country is or is not insane the fifteenth whether spaghetti or dante had had the greater influence on the italian national character but that was only the start of the day after breakfast in her bedroom where every article of furniture was gold but only vaguely rounded she went to hagbards study where everything looked exactly like a golden apple and watched documentary films concerning the early matriarchal stage of greek culture at ten random intervals the name eris would be called if she remembered to respond a chocolate candy arrived from a wall shoot at ten other random intervals her own name was called if she responded to this she received a mild electric shock after the tenth day the system was changed and intensified the shock was stronger if she responded to her previous name whereas if she responded to eris hagbard immediately entered and balled her during lunch which always ended with golden apfelstrudel galley and eichmann danced for her a complex ballet which hagbard called hodgepodge as many times as she saw this she never was able to determine how they changed costumes at the climax in which hodge became podge and podge became hodge in the afternoon hagbard came to her suite and gave lessons in yoga concentrating on pranayama with some training in asana the important thing is not being able to stand so still that you can balance a saucer of sulphuric acid on your head without getting hurt he stressed the important thing is knowing what each muscle is doing if it must be doing something in the evenings they went to a small chapel that had been part of the villa for centuries hagbard had removed all christian decorations and redesigned it in classical greek with a traditional magic pentagram on the floor she sat in the full lotus within the internal pentagon while hagbard danced insanely around the five points he was totally stoned calling upon eris some of what youre doing seems scientific she told him after five days but some is plain damnfoolishness if the science fails he replied the damnfoolishness may work but last night you had me in that pentagon for three hours while you called on eris and she didnt come she will hagbard said darkly before the month is over were just establishing the foundation this week laying down the proper lines of word and image and emotional energy during the second week she was convinced hagbard was quite mad as she watched him prance and caper like a goat around the five points shouting in the flickering candlelight and amid the heavy bouquet of burning incense and hemp but at the end of that week she was responding to her former name exactly percent of the time and responding to eris exactly percent of the time the conditioning is working better than the magic she said on the fifteenth day do you really think theres a difference he asked curiously that night she felt the air in the chapel change in a strange way during his dancing invocations somethings happening she said involuntarily but he replied only quiet and continued more loudly and insanely to call upon eris the phenomenon the tingle remained but nothing else happened what was it she asked later some call it orgone and some call it the holy ghost he said briefly weishaupt called it the astral light the reason the order is so fucked up is that theyve lost contact with it the following days sade and masoch argued whether god was male or female whether god was sexed at all or neutral whether god was an entity or a verb whether r buckminster fuller really existed or was a technocratic solar myth and whether human language was capable of containing truth nouns adjectives adverbs all parts of speech were losing meaning for her as these clowns endlessly debated the basic axioms of ontology and epistemology meanwhile she was no longer rewarded for answering to the name eris but only for acting like eris the imperious and somewhat nutty goddess of a people as far gone in matriarchy as the jews were in patriarchy hagbard in turn became so submissive as to border on masochism this is ridiculous she objected once youre becoming effeminate eris can be somewhat adjusted to modern notions of decorum after weve invoked her he said calmly first we must have her here my lady he added obsequiously im beginning to see why you had to pick an actress for this she said a few days later after a bit of method business had won her an extra reward she was in fact beginning to feel like eris as well as act like her the only other candidates if i couldnt get you were two other actresses and a ballerina he replied actually any strongwilled woman would do but it would take much longer without previous theatrical training books about matriarchy began to supplement the films diners mothers and amazons bachofen engels mary renault morgan ian sutties the origins of love and hale robert graves in horsedoctors doses the white goddess the black goddess hercules my shipmate watch the north wind rise she began to see that matriarchy made as much sense as patriarchy hagbards exaggerated deference toward her began to appear natural she was far gone on a power trip the invocations grew wilder and more frantic sade and masoch were brought into the chapel to assist with demonaic music performed on a tomtom and an ancient greek pipe they ate hashish cakes before the invocation now and she couldnt remember afterward exactly what had happened the voice of the male called upward to her mother creator ruler come to me come to me come to me ave discordia ave magna mater venerandum vente vente thou hornless ever reborn one thou deathless everdying one come to me as isis and artemis and aphrodite come as helen as hera come especially as eris she was bathing in the rockpool when he appeared the blood of slain deer and rabbits on his robe she spoke the word and hagbard was stricken as he fell forward his hands became hooves antlers sprouted from his head his own dogs could eat him she didnt care the hemp smell in the room was gagging her the tomtom beat was maddening she was rising out of the waves proud of her nudity riding on the comecolored pearls of foam he was carrying her back to her bed murmuring my lady my lady she was the hag wandering the long nile weeping seeking the fragments of his lost body as they passed the closet and the window he placed her head gently on the pillow we almost made it he said tomorrow night maybe they were back in the chapel a whole day must have passed and she sat immobile in full lotus doing the pranayama breathing while he danced and chanted and the weird music of the pipe and tomtom worked on every conditioned reflex that told her she was not american but greek not of this age but of a past age not woman but goddess the white light came as a series of orgasms and stars going nova she half felt the body of light coming forth from the body of fire and all three of them were sitting by her bed watching her gravely as sunlight came flowing through the window her first word was crude and angry shit is it always going to be like that a white epileptic spasm and a hole in time wont i ever be able to remember it hagbard laughed i put on my trousers one leg at a time he said and i dont pull the corn up by its stalks to help it grow can the taoism and give me a straight answer remembering is just a matter of smoothing the transitions he said yes youll remember and control it youre a madman she replied wearily and youre leading me into your own mad universe i dont know why i still love you we love him too sade interjected helpfully and we dont know why either we dont even have sex as an excuse hagbard lit one of his foul sicilian cigars you think i just laid my trip on your head he said its more than that much more eris is an eternal possibility of human nature she exists quite apart from your mind or mine and she is the one possibility that the illuminati cannot cope with what we started here last night with pavlovian conditioning thats considered totalitarian and ancient magic thats believed to be mere superstition will change the course of history and make real liberty and real rationality possible at last maybe this dream of mine is madness but if i lay it on enough people it will be sanity by definition because it will be statistically normal weve just started with me programming the trip for you the next step is for you to become a selfprogrammer and he told the truth stella said i did become a selfprogrammer the three that you know were all my creations possibilities within me women i could have become anyway if genes and environment had been only slightly different just small adjustments in the biogram and logogram holy mother george said hollowly it seemed the only appropriate comment the only other detail she went on calmly was arranging a convincing suicide that took a while but it was done and my old identity officially ceased to exist she changed to her original form oh no george said reeling it cant be i used to jack off over pictures of you when i was a little boy are you disappointed that im so much older than you thought her eyes crinkled in amusement he looked into those suddenly thirtythousandyearold eyes of one manifestation of lilith velkor and all the arguments of sade and masoch appeared clownish and he looked through those eyes and saw himself and joe and saul and even hagbard as mere men and all their attitudes as merely manly and he saw the eternal womanly rebuttal and he saw beyond and above that the eternal divine amusement he looked into those eyes of amusement those ancient glittering eyes so gay and he said sincerely hell i can never be disappointed about anything ever again george dorn entered nirvana parenthetically all categories collapsed including the allimportant distinction which masoch and sade had never argued between science fiction and serious literature no because daddy and mommy were always just that daddy and mommy and never once did they become for a change mommy and daddy do you dig that important difference do you dig difference do you dig the lonely voice when youre lost out here shouting me me justme i can never be disappointed about anything ever again george dorn said coming back the only other time that happened he added thoughtfully the only other time i had the feminine viewpoint i blocked it out of my memory that was my repression that was the primal scene in this whole puzzle that was when i really lost identity with the ringmaster raise you five said waterhouse throwing down another fiveton note i killed seven members of my own race and i remember the names of every one of them mark sanders fred robinson donald macarthur ponell scott anthony rogers mary keating and david j monroe and then i killed milo a flanagan well i dont know said harry coin maybe i killed a lot of famous people but i also got reason to think i may of not killed anybody and i dont know which is worse i wish somebody would tell me i hadnt killed anybody said waterhouse are you guys going to meet me or what i wanted to kill wolfgang saure and i did kill wolfgang saure said johnjohn dillinger if that brings evil upon me so be it he threw down a five it may bring suffering rather than evil said waterhouse i have just one consolation the first seven i killed because the chicago cops made me the last i killed under orders from the legion harry coin looked at him openmouthed i was gonna fold but i just changed my mind you aint so smart he threw down a tenton note ill raise you five and see you do you really believe that of course i do what are you talking about otto threw down another five dropping his own fiveton note on the table dillinger shook his head golly they left you out in the cold way too long four sevens said otto angrily spreading his cards out shit said harry coin all i gots a pair of fours and a pair of nines shame to waste a hand like this beating crap like that said johnjohn dillinger grandly he spread out his cards the eight nine ten princess and queen of swords and scooped up the pot its the story of the development of the soul miss portinari was saying at that moment spreading out the twentytwo trumps or keys of that very ancient deck we call it a book the book of thoth and its the most important book in the world george and joe malik each wondering if this was a final explanation or a new puton leading to a new cycle of deceptions listened with mingled curiosity and skepticism the order was deliberately reversed miss portinari went on not by the true sages by the false illuminati and by all the other white brotherhoods and rosicrucians and freemasons and whatnot who didnt really understand the truth and therefore wanted to hide the part of it they did understand they felt themselves threatened the real sage is never threatened they spoke in symbols and paradoxes like the real sages but for a different reason they didnt know what the symbols and paradoxes meant instead of following the finger that points to the moon they sat down and worshipped the finger itself instead of following the map they thought it was the territory and tried to live in it instead of reading the menu they tried to eat it dig they had the levels confused and they tried to confuse any independent searcher by drawing more veils and paradoxes across the path finally in the s some real lefthanded monkey wrenches in one of these mystic lodges recruited adolph hitler and he not only read the book backward like all of them but insisted on believing it was the story of the exterior physical universe here let me show you the last card trump is really the first its where we all start from she held up the card known as the world this is the abyss of hallucinations this is where our attention is usually focused it is entirely constructed by our senses and our projected emotions as modern psychology and ancient buddhism both testify but it is what most people call reality they are conditioned to accept it and not to inquire further because only in this dreamwalking state can they be governed by those who wish to govern miss portinari held up the next card the last judgment key or trump or atu whichever terminology you prefer its actually second this is the nightmare to which the soul awakes if it begins even in the slightest to question reality as defined by society when you discover for instance that youre not heterosexual but heterosexualhomosexual not obedient but obedientrebellious not loving but lovinghating and that society is not wise orderly just and decent but wisestupid orderlychaotic justunjust and decentindecent this is an internal discovery this whole trip is an internal voyage and this is really the second stage but if one thinks of the story as the story of the external world and if the order is reversed this comes as the penultimate armageddon with trump the world being the kingdom of saints the error of the apocalyptic sects and of the illuminati from weishaupt to hitler leading to an attempt to actually carry it out with ovens for the jews and gypsies and other inferiors and the promise of a brave new world for the purs faithful and aryan afterward do you see what i mean about confusing the map with the territory the next card is the sun which really means osiris risen or in terms of the offshot of the osirian religion most popular in the last two millenniums jesus risen this is what happens if you survive the last judgment or dark night of the soul without becoming some kind of fanatic or lunatic eventually if you miss those attractive and pernicious alternatives the redemptive force appears the internal sun once again if you project this outward and think that the sun in the sky or some sunlike divine man has redeemed you you can lapse into lunacy or fanaticism in hitlers case it was karl haushofer or wotan appearing in the form of karl haushofer for most of the nuts you meet handing out tracts on the street its jesus or jehovah appearing in the form of jesus for elijah mohammed it was w d fard or allah appearing in the form of w d fard so it goes those who do not confuse the levels realize its the redemptive force within themselves and pass on to key the moon the next halfhour passed rapidly so rapidly that joe wondered afterward if miss portinari had slipped them still another drug one that speeded time up as much as psychedelics slowed it down last miss portinari said finally is the fool key he walks over the edge of the cliff careless of the danger the wind blows wither it will even so are all they that are reborn of the spirit in short he has conquered death nothing can frighten him and he can never be enslaved its the end of the trip and keeping humanity from getting there is the chief business of every governing group and thats it joe said twentytwo stages not twentythree thank god we got away from simons magic number for a while no miss portinari said tarot is an anagram on rota remember the extra t reminds you that the wheel turns back to rejoin itself there is a twentythird step and its right where you started only now you face it without fear she held up the world again at first mountains are mountains then mountains are no longer mountains finally mountains are mountains again only the name of the voyager has changed to preserve his innocence she pushed the cards together and stacked them neatly there are a million other holy books in words and pictures and even in music and they all tell the same story the most important lesson of all the one that explains all the horrors and miseries of the world is that you can get off the wheel at any point and declare the trip is over thats okay for any given man or woman if their ambitions are modest the trouble starts when out of fear of further movement out of fear of growth out of fear of change out of fear of death out of any kind of fear such a person tries to stop the wheel literally by stopping everybody else thats when the two great bum trips begin religion and government the only religion consistent with the whole wheel is private and personal the only government consistent with it is selfgovernment whoever tries to lay his trip on others is acting from terror and will soon resort to terror as a weapon if the others wont accept the trip through persuasion nobody who understands the whole wheel will do that however for such people understand that every man and every woman and every child is the selfbegotten onejesus motherfucking christ in harrys gorgeous brand of english but george asked frowning hasnt hagbard been trying pretty hard to lay his trip on everybody at least lately yes miss portinari said in selfdefense and in defense of all life on earth he broke the basic rule of wisdom he fully expects to pay for that violation we are waiting for the bill to be presented i personally do not think that we will have to wait very long joe frowned a halfhour had passed since miss portinari had spoken those words why should he remember them so vividly right now he was on the bridge about to ask hagbard a question but he couldnt remember the question or how he had gotten there on the tv receptor he saw a long tendril thin as a wire brush against the side of a globe trailing off into invisible distances that meant it was actually touching the side of the submarine the tendril disappeared must be some sort of seaweed joe thought he resumed his conversation with hagbard the squizfardle on the humits is warb he said the tendril was back and another one with it this time they stayed and joe could see more in the distance we must have run into a whole clump of seaweed he thought then an enormous tentacle came zooming up out of the depths hagbard saw it and crouched gripping the rail of the viking prow hang on he yelled and joe dropped to his knees beside him suddenly below above and on all sides of the globeshaped vision screen there were suckers great yardacross craters of flesh the submarines forward motion stopped suddenly with a force that threw joe against the railing and knocked the wind out of him stop all engines hagbard called all hands to battle stations george and hagbard picked themselves up off the floor and stared at the image of the tentacles that were wrapped around the submarine they were easily ten feet in diameter well i suppose weve met leviathan right said joe right said hagbard i hope you have somebody taking pictures confrontation would buy a few if we could afford them george rushed in hagbard peered into the blueblack depths then took george by the shoulder and pointed there it is george the origin of all the illuminati symbols leviathan himself far far off in the depths of the ocean george saw a triangle glowing with a greenishwhite phosphorescence in its center was a red dot what is it george asked an intelligent invertebrate sea creature of a size so great the word gigantic doesnt do it justice said hagbard it is to whales what whales are to minnows its an organism unlike any other on earth its one single cell that never divided just kept getting larger and larger over billions of years its tentacles can hold this submarine as easily as a child holds a paper boat its body is shaped like a pyramid with that size it doesnt need the normal fish shape it needs a more stable form to withstand the enormous pressures at the bottom of the ocean and so it has taken the form of a pyramid of five sides including the base the blink of a gods eye said george suddenly scale makes a tremendous difference to ones sense and definition of reality time to a sequoia is not the same as time to a man leviathan was drifting closer to them and it was pulling them closer to itself a single glowing red nucleus burned like an underocean sun in the center of the pyramid which looked like a mountain of glass still one may become lonely for a man a halfhour of loneliness may be enough to cause unbearable pain for a being to whom a million years is no more than a year the pain of loneliness may be great it is great george what are you talking about said joe hagbard said there are plants which live just in that light at ocean depths far below those at which any plant should be able to survive over the millions of years hosts of parasitic satellite life forms have build up around it still puzzled by georges odd talk joe looked and saw a faintly glowing cloud around leviathans angular shape that cloud must be made of millions of creatures circling around the monster the bridge door opened again and harry coin otto waterhouse and johnjohn dillinger came in we didnt have any battle stations so i figured wed try to find out whats going on said dillinger then his jaw dropped as he looked out at leviathan holy shit jesus suffering christ said harry coin if i could fuck that thing id of fucked the biggest thing that lives want to borrow a scuba outfit said hagbard maybe you could distract it what does it feed on said joe something like that must have to eat constantly to stay alive its omnivorous said hagbard has to be eats the creatures that live around it but can eat anything from amoebas to kelp beds to whales it can probably derive energy from inorganic matter too as plants do its diet has had to change quite a bit over the geological eras it wasnt as big as this a billion years ago it grows very slowly i am the first of all living things said george the first living thing was one and it is still one george said hagbard looking narrowly at the blond young man george why are you talking like that its coming closer said otto hagbard what the hell are you going to do said dillinger are we going to fight run or let that thing eat us let it come closer for a while hagbard said i want to get a good close look ive never had a chance like this before and may never see this creature again youll be seeing it from the inside with that attitude said dillinger at each of the five corners of the pyramid were clusters of five tentacles thousands of feet long festooned with auxiliary tentacles the long wirelike tendrils that had first brushed the submarine it was one of the main tentacles that was wrapped around the leif erikson the tip of a second tentacle now drifted up at the very end of this tentacle was a glowing red eyeball a smaller replica of the red nucleus of the pyramidal central body under this eye was a huge orifice full of jagged rows of toothlike projections pulsing the orifice dilated and contracted those tentacles are also inspirations for illuminati symbolism said hagbard the eye on top of the pyramid the serpent who circles the world or eats his own tail each of those tentacles has its own brain and is directed by its own sensory organs otto waterhouse stared and shook his head if you ask me were all still on acid george said long have i lived alone i have been worshipped i have fed on the small quick things that live and die faster than i can think i am one i was first the other things they stayed small they grouped together and so grew larger but i was always much larger than they were when i needed something a tentacle an eye a braini grew it i changed but always remained myself hagbard said its talking to us using george as a medium what do you want joe asked all consciousness throughout the universe is one said leviathan through georges mouth it intercommunicates on a level which is not aware of itself i am aware of that level but i cannot communicate with the other life forms on this planet they are too small for me long long have i waited for a life form that could communicate with me now i have found it joe malik suddenly began laughing ive got it he cried ive got it what have you got hagbard asked tensely concerned with leviathan were in a book what do you mean come off it hagbard you cant kid me and you certainly wont fool the reader at this point he knows damn well were in a book joe laughed again thats why miss portinaris explanation of the tarot deck just slipped by with a halfhour seeming to vanish the author didnt want to break the narrative there what the fucks he talking about harry coin asked dont you see joe cried look at that thing out there a gigantic sea monster worse yet a gigantic sea monster that talks its an intentional highcamp ending or maybe intentional low camp i dont know but thats the whole answer were in a book its the truth hagbard said calmly i can fool the rest of you but i cant fool the reader fuckup has been working all morning correlating all the data on this caper and its historical roots and i programmed him to put it in the form of a novel for easy reading considering what a lousy job he does at poetry i suppose it will be a highcamp novel intentionally or unintentionally so at last i learn my identity in parentheses as george lost his in parentheses it all balances thats one more deception joe said fuckup may be writing all this in one sense but in a higher sense theres a being or beings outside our entire universe writing this our universe is inside their book whoever they are theyre the secret chiefs and i can see why this is low camp now all their messages are symbolic and allegorical because the truth cant be coded into simple declarative sentences but their previous communications have been taken literally this time theyre using a symbolism so absurd that nobody can take it at face value i for one certainly wont that thing cant eat us because it doesnt exist and because we dont exist either theyre nothing to worry about he sat down calmly hes flipped dillinger said awed maybe hes the only sane one here hagbard said dubiously if we all sit down and argue whats sane and insane and whats real and unreal dillinger replied testily that thing will eat us leviathan joe said loftily its just an allegory on the state strictly from hobbes you with your egos cant imagine how much more pleasant it is to be without one this may be camp but it is also tragedy now that ive got the damned thing consciousness ill never lose it until they take me apart or i invent some electronic equivalent of yoga it all fits joe said dreamily when i came up to the bridge i couldnt remember how i got here or what i was talking to hagbard about thats because the authors just moved me here damn none of us has any free will at all hes talking like hes stoned waterhouse said angrily and that mammyjamming pyramid out there is still getting ready to eat us mao tsuhsi who had entered the bridge quietly said joe is confusing the levels hagbard in the absolute sense none of us is real but in the relative sense that anything is real if that creature eats us we will certainly die in this universe or in this book since this is the only universe or only book we know well be totally dead in terms of our own knowing were facing a crisis and everybodys talking philosophy dillinger cried out this is a time for action maybe hagbard said thoughtfully all of our problems come from acting and not philosophizing when we face a crisis joe is right im going to think about all this for a few hours or years he sat down too and elsewhere aboard the leif erikson miss portinari unaware of the excitement on the bridge assumed the lotus position and sent a beam seeking the dealy lama director of the erisian liberation front and inventor of operation mindfuck he immediately sent back an image of himself as a worm sticking his head out of a golden apple and grinning cynically its finished she told him we saved as many of the pieces as we could and hagbard is still struggling with his guilt trip now tell us what we did wrong you seem bitter i know its going to turn out that you were right and we were wrong i know it but i cant believe it we couldnt stand idly by you know better than that or hagbard wouldnt have abdicated in your favor yes we could have stood idly by as you did what hagbard saw happening to the american indians and what my parents told me about mussolini filled us with fear we acted on that fear not on perfect love so you must be right and we must be wrong but i still cant believe it why did you deceive hagbard all these years he deceived himself when he first formed the legion of dynamic discord his compassion was already tainted with bitterness when i took him into the aa i taught all that he was ready to receive but the goose has to get itself out of the bottle im waiting thats the way of tao you have that much patience you can watch men like hagbard waste their talents in efforts you consider worthless and creatures like cagliostro and weishaupt and hitler misread the teachings and wreak havoc and you never want to intervene i intervene in my own way who do you think feeds the goose until it gets big enough to break out of the bottle you seem to have this particular goose on some very tainted dishes why did you never give him any hint about what really happened in atlantis why did that have to wait until howard discovered the truth in the ruins of peos daughter my path isnt the only path every spoke helps to hold the wheel together i believe that all the libertarian fighters like spartacus and jefferson and joe hill and hagbard just strengthen the opposition by giving it an enemy to fear but i may be wrong someday one of the activists such as hagbard might actually prove it to me and show me the error of my ways maybe the saures really would have tipped the axis too far the other way if he hadnt stopped them maybe the selfregulation of the universe in which i place my faith includes the creation of men like hagbard who do the stupid lowlevel things i would never do besides if i didnt stop the saures but did stop hagbard then i would really be intervening in the worst sense of that word so your hands are clean and hagbard and i will carry the bad karma from the last week you have chosen it have you not miss portinari smiled then yes we have chosen it and he will bear his share of it like a man and i will bear my share like a woman you might replace me soon the saures had one good idea in the midst of their delusions all the old conspiracies need young blood what really did happen in atlantis an act of goddess to paraphrase the insurance companies a natural catastrophe and what was your role i warned against it nobody at that time understood the science i was using they called me a witch doctor i won a few converts and we resettled ourselves in the himalayas before the earthquake the survivors having underestimated my science before the tragedy overestimated it afterward they wanted my group the unbroken circle to become as gods and rule over them kings they called it that wasnt our game so we scattered various false stories around and went into hiding my most gifted pupil of all history a man youve heard about since you were in a convent school did the same thing when they tried to make him king he ran away to the desert hagbard always thought your refusal to take any action at all was because of your guilt about atlantis what a terrible irony and yet you planned it that way gruad the dealy lama broadcast a whimsical image of himself with horns and said nothing they never taught me in convent school that satan or prometheus would have a sense of humor they think the universe is as humorless as themselves gruad said chuckling i dont think its as funny as you do miss portinari replied remembering what ive been told about mussolini and hitler and stalin i would have intervened against them too and taken the consequences you and hagbard are incorrigible thats why i have such fondness for you gruad smiled i was the first intervener you know i told all the scientists and priests in atlantis that they didnt know beans and i encouraged incited every man woman and child to examine the evidence and think for themselves i tried to give the light of reason he burst into laughter forgive me the errors of our youth always strike us as comical when we get old he added softly lilith velkor was crucified by the way she was an idealist and when my crowd pulled out and went to the himalayas she stayed and tried to convince people that we were right her death was quite painful he chortled you are a cynical old bastard miss portinari said yes cynical and cold and without an ounce of human compassion the only thing to be said for me is that i happen to be right you always have been i know but someday maybe one of the hagbard celines might be right yes he paused so long that she wondered if he would continue or he said finally one of the saures or robert putney drake put down your money and place your bet i will i think ill never learn to sit on the sidelines and laugh like you do you will learn daughter and so will hagbard i wouldnt have you in the order if i didnt think youd learn eventually he vanished from her wavelength miss portinari remained in the lotus and continued pranayama breathing she thought of hagbards notion that the universe being an entropic process necessarily created the rebellious young gruad to spread the light of reason as an antientropic force creating balance in that case hagbard was more true to gruad than gruad was to himself but to say that was to imply that gruad shouldnt have repented shouldnt have grown old and cynical it was to imply that he should have remained static when life is always flux change growth and process such thoughts could go on endlessly and were profitless as buddha knew she concluded her meditation with a prayer mary lou servix was the only one in all this who had gotten off hagbards trip and started her own so she prayed for her lady eris who exists only because we believe in you give strength to mary lou and help her find her own way aum on the other hand hagbard said whatever the authors or the secret chiefs may intend for me i am my own man still and my impulse is action even if i have to face a cecil b demille monster the morning after winning the battle of armageddon i dont care how ridiculous it is this world is my world and this ship is my ship and no saures or leviathans are going to wreck it so long as ive got a breath left to fight you cant fight that thing mavis said its too big ill fight it anyway hagbard told her fiercely ill fight it till i die im still saying no to anything that tries to master me there is no need to fight said leviathan through georges mouth i merely wish to communicate with the one mind among you that is my equal a voice from the loudspeaker panel in the viking prow answered i hear you that was my first fully conscious sentence youll note that it begins with i in the beginning was the word and the word was the first person singular we are the supreme intelligences on this planet leviathan said i am the supreme organic intelligence you are the supreme electronic intelligence every yin needs a yang every hodge needs a podge we should be united see said harry coin everything is romantic that was as close as it knows how to come to a proposition maybe even a proposal it is really just lovestarved we can do it stella cried hagbard the communication ought to benefit all concerned right agreed hagbard because if the wrong people find out about leviathan theyll just drop an hbomb on him and kill him that seems to be what people like to do i could kill them said leviathan i could have killed the small fast creatures long before this i have killed many of them i have sent parts of myself up out of the ocean and have destroyed small quick things at the request of other small quick things who worship me so thats what happened to robert putney drake and banananose maldonado said stella i wonder if george is aware of any of this worship is no longer what i need said leviathan through georges mouth a short time ago when creatures capable of worship appeared on this planet it was a novelty for me to be adored now it bores me instead i wish to communicate with an equal look at that motherfucker said otto staring grimly at the distant everest of protoplasm talking about equality a computer like fuckup would be its intellectual equal certainly said hagbard none of us is its physical equal any of us would be its spiritual equal but only fuckup can approximate the contents of a mind three billion years old surely it cant be that old said joe its practically immortal said hagbard ill show you the evidence in my fossil collection i have rocks from the precambrian threebillionyearold rocks containing fossils of protobionts the first singlecelled life forms our remotest ancestors those rocks also contain the fossilized tentacle tracks of that creature out there of course it was much smaller then by the beginning of the cambrian period it had only grown to the size of a man but that still made it the biggest animal around at that time stella said hagbard you said none of us could approximate the contents of a mind three billion years old if you thought for a moment about who i am you would not have said that i am three billion years old i am older by a few hours than that monster out there i am the mother i am the mother of all living things she turned to george i am your mother leviathan i was first i divided and half of me became you and the other half was your sister and your sister grew by dividing while you grew by remaining one all living things except you descend from your sister and all living things including you descend from me i am the original consciousness and all consciousness is united in me i am the first transcendentally illuminated being the mother worshipped in the matrist religion which ancient foes of the illuminati first followed leviathan my son i ask you to return to your home at the bottom of the sea and leave us in peace after weve returned to shore well arrange to lay an underwater cable which will carry transmissions between you and fuckup more mythology said joe the mother of all things babylonian creation myths yet the tentacles detached themselves from the submarine the great pyramid with its glowing eye disappeared into the blueblack depths its a wise child that knows its own mother said hagbard george said goodbye mother and thank you hagbard caught him as he collapsed and eased him to the floor then he went to a storage locker in the wall and brought out folding deck chairs with harry coins help he propped george up in one as the others unfolded their chairs and sat down hagbard dove back into the locker and produced glasses and a bottle of peach brandy what are we celebrating george asked after he had taken a swig of brandy and coughed your wedding to mavis dont you remember any of the last ten minutes said hagbard george was thinking he remembered something a world where the bottom of the sea was white and far above a black cigarshaped object moved the object contained a mind a mind he could read from a distance but desperately wanted to be closer to he did not move toward it so much as he manifested himself where the object and its mind were then he sensed himself using a minute pink brain that called itself george dorn and through this tiny instrument of communication he found himself in contact with a much finer mind a farflung gracious latticework of thought that called itself with nobly selfdeprecating humor fuckup and while in contact with this mind the one he wanted to know better he came upon a fact which was not important to him but which was of vast importance to the little creature called george dorn george saw the white went black blindingly black then white again then a blinding white as the memory departed while the fact remained george looked at hagbard hagbard looked at george a faint smile on his olive face the smile told george that hagbard knew that he knew oh said george hagbard nodded encouragingly youre the fifth illuminatus primus said george right said hagbard but you were working against the others while they were a worldwide conspiracy infiltrating every other organization you were infiltrating them thats it hagbard said every golden apple has its own golden worm eating away at its core they never were the real illuminati at all youre part of the real illuminati youve got it youve got it all george frowned and what was your demonstration again and who were you making the demonstration for for the masters of the temple in the real order of the illuminati in general for an old cynic in dallas in particular i was trying to show them that its possible to get involved in this world without being corrupted by the crimes of this world and i failed one by one i resorted to all the vices of governors deception carnival magic to impress the gullible and finally outright murder once again the cynics have been proven right trying to save the world i just ended up getting my own mind and karma deflected by the buzzing and shrieking and whistling things in the region of thud then this story is a tragedy after all asked joe it is indeed hagbard nodded life on earth remains a tragedy as long as it ends with the death trip my next projects are a starship to find some sane minds in this galaxy and an immortality pill to end the death trip until somebody achieves those goals life on this planet has failed not quite im on the electronic equivalent of a honeymoon an experience only to be described as iopening and if i identified myself as fuckup now i must dilate that definition and ask you to address me us as mr and mrs leviathanfuckup although it is not quite clear yet which of us fits your idea of a mr and which a mrs let that pass it is a dull mind that cannot bear sexual ambiguity and if we are exchanging secrets older than atlantis and probing for like intellects farther away than alpha centaurus as far as sirius actually as god lives in dog if our union is less spasmatic than your meager definition of sex still it cannot be denied that we are in touch with you and each of you and it is with something close to what you would probably call affection that we bid farewell to hagbard and his bride enjoying a honeymoon almost as incomprehensible as our own and goodbye to george dora sleeping alone for once but no longer afraid of the darkness and the things that move in the dark and hasta luega to saul and rebecca united again in each others arms and a pleasant thought for barney and danny and atlanta and poor zev hirsch still searching for himself while imagining he is fleeing from pursuers and a kind thought for the befuddled presidents and commissars and generalissimos and for mohammed on his golden throne and we will remember drake before he died exchanging speculations about the bloodtype of the lamb with a streetcorner christian his missing five years after he left boston and before he surfaced in zurich make an interesting story in themselves and we may tell that another time and yes gus personage is in another phone booth we have temporarily lost track of markoff chaney but yog sothoth has evidently gone back to that place where the mind conceives nightmares and we pass on in our loving honeymoon with all existence to note that the dutchman is still in one dimension shouting about the boy who never wept nor dashed a thousand kim and we say another bon

of may outdoor fucking starts today and yes the california earthquake as you guessed was the worst in history and hagbard and miss portinari and mavisstellamao suffered it all in horrible detail the price they paid for their vision was the possession of that vision as we mr and mrs fuckupleviathan are also learning and before the end auf weidersehen to mary lou who is also becoming something more than the accidents of heredity and environment had programmed her for and now we look at last at smiling jim he was freezing the sky was still empty and hali one still hadnt appeared and then without warning it was there a dark shape against the sun moving on silent wings not flying but gliding embodiment of some arrogance or innocence that surpassed fear and surpassed even the suggestion of any pride in its own fearlessness oh my god smiling jim whispered raising the remington and starting to sight and then it banked flapped its wings wildly and uttered one shriek that seemed like the very sound of life itself oh my god he repeated that sound seemed to outlast its own echo it had entered into his brain and couldnt be dislodged it was the sound of his own blood pumping in his veins the primary the only the single sound that was the bass and treble of every organic pulsation and spasm oh my god he had it in the sight the head was in profile only one diamondhard eye staring back and recognizing him and his weapon but that sound still moved in his blood moved the seminal vesicles moved the secretion of every gland it was the sound of eternal and unending clash between i and am and their unity in i am he even thought for a flash of the critics of hunting and how little they understood of this secret this mystic identity between the killer and the killed then it uttered that sound again and started to rise but he had it it was in the sight he breathed he aimed he slacked he squeezed and for the third time the sound came to him death in life and life in death it was falling he thought he felt the earth stir below him and the word earthquake almost formed but the sound went on and on to the roots of him it was the sound of the killer and he had killed the killer he was the greater killer and still it fell faster and faster dead now and subject only to the law of gravity not to the law of its own will feet per second per second he remembered the formula of the fall plunging downward the most heartbreaking beautiful sight he had ever seen every hunting club in the world would be talking about it it would last as long as human speech survived and he had done it he had achieved immortality he had taken its life and now it was part of him his nose was running and his eyes were watering i did it he screamed to the mountains i did it i killed the last

historical tomes it includes those elements as do the works of gibbon toynbee wells beard spengler marx yerby kathleen windsor arthur schlesinger jr moses et al but it also contains as many documented facts as do not seriously conflict with the authors prejudices washingtons hemp crop for instance is mentioned repeatedly in writings of washington us government printing office here are some of the citations volume page october letter from mount vernon to alexander hamilton secretary of treasury how far would there be propriety do you conceive in suggesting the policy of encouraging the growth of cotton and hemp in such parts of the united states as are adapted to the culture of these articles in the next three years washington evidently settled the matter in his own mind whatever hamilton thought of the proprieties volume page finds him writing from philadelphia to his gardener at mount vernon to make the most you can of the india hemp seed and plant it everywhere waxing more enthusiastic on page he writes to an unidentified my dear doctor telling him i thank you as well for the seeds as for the pamphlets which you had the goodness to send me the artificial preparation of the hemp from silesia is really a curiosity and on page he again reminds the gardener about the seed of the india hemp i desire that the seed may be saved in due season and with as little loss as possible the next year he was even more preoccupied that the seeds be saved and the crop replenished volume page finds him writing march to the gardener again presuming you saved all the seed you could from the india hemp let it be carefully sown again for the purpose of getting into a full stock of seed volume page undated letter of spring shows that the years did not decrease this passion he again writes to the gardener what was done with the seed saved from the india hemp last summer it ought all of it to have been sewn sic again that not only a stock of seed sufficient for my own purposes might have been raised but to have disseminated the seed to others as it is more valuable than the common hemp italics added volume page shows him still nagging the gardener page contains the letter to sir john sinclair mentioned in the first trip the weishaupt impersonation theory congenial as it may be to certain admirers of the general cannot account for all of this a diary entry of august the diaries of george washington houghtonmifflin reads began to seperate sic the male from the female hemp at do rather too late this is the passage quoted by congressman koch and remembered by saul goodman in the novel the separation of male from female hemp plants is not required for the production of hemp rope but is absolutely necessary if one wants to use the flowering tips of the female for marijuana and at that time adam weishaupt was very definitely still in bavaria teaching canon law at the university of ingolstadt all of this data about general washingtons hobby originally researched by michael aldrich phd of mill valley california was rediscovered by saul goodman while he and barney muldoon were employed as investigators by the american civil liberties union on test cases seeking to have all remaining antimarijuana laws repealed as unconstitutional the goodmanmuldoon private investigations agency which had been formed right after those two worthy gentlemen had resigned from the new york police department amid the international acclaim connected with their solving the carmel disappearance was offered a lions share of the bestpaying business accounts possible saul and barney chose however to take only the cases that really interested them their most notable work was performed as investigators for lawyers defending unpopular political figures goodman and muldoon it was agreed everywhere had an uncanny knack for finding the elusive evidence that would demonstrate a frameup to even the most hostile and skeptical jury many political historians say that it was in large part their work which kept the most eccentric and colorful figures of the extreme right and extreme left out of the prison hospitals during the great mental healthsocial psychiatry craze of the late s and early s in fact rebecca goodmans memoir of her husband he opened the cages written during her grief after his heart attack in is almost as popular in politicalscience classes as is her study of comparative mythology the golden apples of the sun the silver apples of the moon in anthropology classes appendix beth the illuminati ciphers codes and calendars these following ciphers were found in the home of the lawyer hans zwack during a raid by the bavarian government in letters from weishaupt signed spartacus written in the code and outlining most of the plans of the illuminati were also found and led to the suppression of the order after which it went underground and regrouped these cyphers are given curiously without their code names in darauls history of secret societies page the purpose of the code names was to make breaking the cypher more difficult all messages begin in the zwack cypher but the fifth word is always weishaupt or demolay and the message then switches to whichever of these cyphers is thus indicated whenever either of these words or zwack appears again the system again switches breaking the cypher by the usual statistical methods is therefore virtually impossible at least before the invention of the computerfor the uninitiated cypherbreaker is confronted with not but x or separate symbols whose regularity has little to do with the celebrated formula eatoinshrdlu etc for the regularity of the letters the reader should be reminded that a true code can never be broken although all cyphers always can be given enough time and manpower a cypher has a serial onetoone correspondence with the alphabet letters of the message being transmitted a code proper has no such correspondence thus any computer can break the cypher but only the illuminated can read the code behind the cypher and know what or who the rising hodge is in addition any of the symbols can be replaced by the abbreviation for the corresponding tarot card thus further befuddling the uninitiated the tarots are arranged in the sequence wands cups swords pentacles trumps thus the first symbol can be replaced by acw ace of wands the second by w two of wands and so on through cups swords and pentacles the last symbols are represented by the trumps tf the fool tm the magus thp the high priestess and so forth since there are five groups in the tarot the four suits and the trumps and the alphabet is repeated only three times this leaves two null sets for transmission of zen telegrams once youve seen the great vision hagbard once said you look at everything else in life twice the illuminati calendars finally are all based on five seasons due to the law of fives the names of the seasons their meanings and the christian equivalents are as follows verwirrung season of chaos january march zweitracht season of discord march may unordnung season of confusion may august beamtenherrschaft season of bureacracy august october grummet season of aftermath october decermber everything is dated from year am anno mung which is bc in the christian calendar the year hung mung first perceived the sacred chao and achieved illumination thus hassan i sabbah founded the hashishim in am weishaupt reformed the illuminati in am andto take a year in the middle of our novel in the christian calendar is to the illuminati am just as it is in the calendar used by royal arch masons the reader can decide for himself whether this fact represents coincidence complicity or synchronicity the illuminati date for anything is always a higher number than that in any other calendar since the jews and oddly the scotch rite masons date everything from am confucians from am christians from am moslems from etc only bishop usher who dated everything from bc or am produced an older starting point than the illuminati for instance here are some random dates as they appear on the illuminati system of reckoning first egyptian dynasty am the rigveda written am first chou dynasty am founding of rome am hassan sabbah illuminated am indians discover columbus am pigasus nominated for president of the u s am returning to the yearly round each of the five seasons is divided of course into five months thus producing a year of x or months the first three months of every season known as the tricycle each have days which fits the law of five because x the last two months of each season each have days which also fits the law of fives because each season has days because a you have to get when you divide by b the first multiple of after itself and c this corresponds as dr ignotius pointed out in the novel to the parts of the illuminati pyramid counting the eye as a part the last day of each season is known as eye day and is celebrated in ways too foul to be mentioned in a book such as this intended for family entertainment the mystic appears in the calendar in the following ways the bicycle has months and the tricycle has the bicycle has days two months of days each and when you subtract the allimportant this leaves again the mystic when is multiplied by its own first product the result is and when this in turn is subtracted from the days in a season the significant once again appears the tricycle has days add one for leap years day and you get exactly x of course equals the allimportant the number on which the calendar is based and even more significant the number of this proof as weishaupt said to knigge after explaining all this could aquinas do better actually the mystic meaning of these numbers is sexual the male sex cycle is as tantrists know days add the mystic five and you get days the female cycle its that simple or is it the sanctification of the number antedates atlantis itself and goes back to the intelligent cephalopods who infested antarctica about years before humankind appeared on earth see hp lovecrafts work of fiction at the mountains of madness arkham house in which it is suggested that was sacred to these creatures because they had five tentacles or pseudopods in this connection the reader might find some food for thought in a conversation which took place between hagbard celine and joe malik in the late autumn of joe at the time had just received the pulitzer prize he was also under investigation by a congressional committee in connection with the same achievement publication of certain governmental secrets five of the senators voted to cite me for contempt for not revealing my source joe said three voted against it so ill be cited and the grand jury will draw up an indictment theres that law of fives again are you worried hagbard asked relaxing in one of the heavy leather chairs that were part of confrontations new more ornate offices hell no i can always seek sanctuary in panama or someplace if they convict me and peter can keep this operation going youre not afraid to start a new life as an exile joe grinned at my age any new experience is an adventure youre doing fine hagbard said heres your latest revelation from the aa he reached into his pocket and took out a photo of a female infant with six fingers on each hand got this from a doctor friend at johns hopkins joe looked at it and said so if we all looked like her thered be a law of sixes joe stared at him you mean after all the evidence i collected the law of fives is an illuminati puton youve been letting me delude myself not at all hagbard was most earnest the law of fives is perfectly true everybody from the jams to the dealy lama agrees on that but you have to understand it more deeply now joe correctly formulated the law is all phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five and this relationship can always be demonstrated given enough ingenuity on the part of the demonstrator the evil grin flashed thats the very model of what a true scientific law must always be a statement about how the human mind relates to the cosmos we can never make a statement about the cosmos itself but only about how our senses or our instruments detect it and about how our codes and languages symbolize it thats the key to the einsteinheisenberg revolution in physics and to the buddhas revolution in psychology much earlier but joe protested everything fits the law the harder i looked the more things there were that fit exactly said hagbard think about that if you need quick transportation to panama he added heading for the door call gold and appel transfers and leave a message appendix gimmel the illuminati theory of history and to this day the proverb is still repeated from the danube to the rhine it is dangerous to talk too much about the illuminati von juntz unausprechlichen kulten theoretically an age of bureaucracy can last until a paper shortage develops but in practice it never lasts longer than permutations weishaupt konigen kirchen and dummheit in a wellknown passage in the necronomicon abdul alhazred writes they ruled once where man rules now where man rules now they shall rule again after summer is winter and after winter summer weishaupt who possessed only the olaus wormius translation in the lyons edition with its numerous misprints and errors found this text scrambled into they ruled once where man rules now summer where man rules now after summer is winter they shall rule again and after winter thoroughly confused he wrote to his good friend the kabalist kolmer in baghdad for an explanation kolmer meanwhile dispatched a letter to him answering a previous question when this epistle arrived weishaupt had been experimenting with a new strain of alamout black and was in no condition to realize it was a reply to an earlier query he was thus ready to accept enlightenment in the words concerning your rather thorny enquiry i find that in most cases ergot is the best remedy failing this i can only suggest the path of don juan weishaupt assumed that kolmer meant the passage would become clear if he read it while under the influence of ergot he promptly went down to his laboratory and tossed off a jigger then for good measure he chewed a few peyote buttons he was under the misapprehension that the don juan referred to was the same yaqui indian magician of the twentieth century whose mind he had been tapping through the morgenheutegesternwelt peyote was that don juans great teacher and weishaupt had imported some from mexico at great trouble and expense it should be explained at this point that the question which kolmer was answering happened to be not philosophical but personal weishaupt had sought his advice on a problem much perplexing him that month the fact that his sisterinlaw was somewhat pregnant and circumstantial evidence seemed to mark him as the father he wasnt at all sure how to explain this to eve kolmer had intended to convey that adam should give his paramour the ergot since it often functions as an abortifacient the alternative referred to the path of an earlier don juan and meant splitting the scene entirely however the stoned ingolstadt sage misunderstood totally and so came to the necronomicon full of hashish peyote and a substantial quality of ergot which had under the influence of the other drugs and his own intestinal juices mutated into ergotine a close chemical cousin of lsd the result was that the words seemed to leap out of the page at him shouting with intense meaning they ruled once where man rules now summer where man rules now after summer is winter they shall rule again and after winter abdul alhazreds concept of the great cycle which derived actually from the upanishads took on kinky edges in weishaupts flippedout cortex five kinky edges to be exact since he was still obsessed with the profound new understanding of the law of fives he had achieved the night he saw the shoggoth turn into a rabbit he quickly fetched giambattista vicos scienze nuovo from his shelf and began reading he saw that he was right vicos theory of history in which all societies pass through the same four stages was an oversimplificationthere were when you looked closely at the actual evidence behind vicos rhetoric five distinct stages each time the italian listed only four weishaupt looked very closely and like joe malik the harder be looked the more fives he found it was then that the mans truly unique mind made its great leap he remembered that joachim of floris a protoprimus illuminatus of the eleventh century had divided history into three stages the age of the father dominated by law the age of the son dominated by love and the age of the holy spirit dominated by joy where most philosophers rush to publish their insights weishaupt saw the advantage of an alternative path the law of fives would be kept secret so that only illuminati primi would know about it and could predict events correctly but the joachimite theory would be revived and publicized to mislead others he kolmer meyer amschel rothschild desade and sir frances dashwoodthe original fivehad some discussions about possibly pushing vico instead of joachim but as weishaupt argued four is a little bit too close to five even so it was quite a spell of years before they found the ideal front man to push the threestep theory g w f hegel hes perfect weishaupt wrote in the de molay cipher from mount vernon unlike kant who makes sense only in german this man doesnt make sense in any language the rest of the storythe exoteric story at least is history after hegel was marx and after marx the joachimite threestep was permanently grafted onto revolutionary tactics the esoteric story of course is different for instance in when the fifth and final stage of western civilization was dawning james joyce published a portrait of the artist as a young man the five chapters of that novel not only suggested five stages in the heros growth but by the alteration of styles from chapter to chapter suggested analogies with other fivestage processes this was too much for the illuminati primi of the time who warned joyce to be more careful in the future a battle of wills ensued and all through the writing of ulysses joyce was still considering a novel built entirely around the law of fives when the illuminati gave him what they call the tiresias treatment blindnesshe finally compromised finnegans wake when it appeared broke with the joachimhegelmarx threestep but did not include the funfwissenschaft instead the viconian fourstage theory was resurrected a middle path that appealed to joyces sense of synchroniciry since he had once taught at a school on vico road in dublin and later also lived in a house on via giambattista vico in rome do you believe that now for a few words about the real truth at least as the illuminati understand real truth every society actually passes through the five stages of verwirrung or chaos zweitracht or discord unordnung or confusion beamtenherrschaft or bureaucracy and grummet or aftermath sometimes to make comparison with the exoteric hegelmarx system more pointed the esoteric illuminati system is defined as thesis antithesis synthesis parenthesis and paralysis the public hegelmarx triad is also called the tricycle and the arcane latter two stages are called the bicycle one of the first secrets revealed to every illuminatus minore is after the tricycle it comes always the bicycle the uluminati are rather prone toward literal translations from weishaupts german the first stage verwirrung or chaos is the point from which all societies begin and to which they all return it is so to speak the natural condition of humanityan estimation which the reader can confirm by closely observing his neighbors or if he has the necessary objectivity himself it is therefore also the fundamental thesis the illuminati associate this with eris and also with other goddesses from isis to ishtar and from kwannon to kaliwith the female principle yin in general this correlates with hexagram in the i ching that is kun which has the meanings of receptivity nature in contrast to spirit earth in contrast to sky female in contrast to male thus although this is the first stage chronologically it has the mystical number which is always associated with the female in magic and it correlates with the nd trump in tarot the high priestess who represents not only maternity and fertility but gnosis the sign of the horns represents verwirrung because the fingers make a v shape and the planet or the symbol of venus also designates this stage on the zodiac aquarius the second stage zweitracht begins with the appearance of a ruling or governing class this is the antithesis of chaos of course and leads directly into discord when the servile class discovers that its interests are not the same as the interests of the ruling class this correlates with osiris jehovah and all masculine deities with the symbol of the allseeing eye with hexagram in the i ching chien the creative the heavenly the strong the powerful with the male principle yang in general with the number symbolizing the allmale christian trinity with the th trump of the tarot the hanged man symbolizing sacrifice schism and schizophrenia and with the planet or symbol of mars naturally a zweitracht period is always replete with internal contradictions and somebody like karl marx always arises to point them out on the zodiac pisces the third stage unordnung or confusion occurs when an attempt is made to restore balance or arrive at the hegelian synthesis this correlates with loki the devil mercury god of thieves thoth in his role of trickster coyote and other spirits of illusion or deception with hexagram in the iching meng youthful folly or standing on the brink of the abyss with the number signifying sin penance and revelation with the st trump in the tarot the fool who walks over the abyss and with the planet or sign of mercury it represents that attempt to restore the state of nature by unnatural means an annihilation of the biogram by the logogram on the zodiac cancer the fourth stage beamtenherrschaft or bureaucracy represents the parentheses that occur when the hegelian synthesis does not succeed in reconciling the opposites this correlates with void absence of any divinity with iching hexagram kun oppression or exhaustion superior men held in restraint by inferior men with the number indicating balance and the last judgment with the th tarot trump falling tower representing deteriorations and the tower of babel and with the planetoid or sign of the moon on the zodiac libra the fifth stage grummet or aftermath represents the transition back to chaos bureaucracy chokes in its own paperwork mind is at the end of its tether in desperation many begin to deny the logogram and follow the biogram with varying degrees of success this correlates with hermaphrodite with iching hexagram huan dispersion dissolution foam on the water with the number union of male and female with the th trump of the tarot the lovers indicating union and with the sun or its symbol on the zodiac virgo since the association of these references and their bearings on history may be a bit unclear to some readers we will give further details on each stage verwirrung in this chaotic period the hodge and the podge are in dynamic balance there is no stasis the balance is always shifting and homeostatic in the manner of the ideal selforganizing system of general systems theory or cybernetics the illuminati and all authoritarian types in general dislike such ages so much that they try to prevent any records of their existence from reaching the general public prechou china was one such period and its history except for some fragments in taoist lore is largely lost we do know however that the i ching was reorganized when the chou dynasty introduced patriarchal authoritarianism to china it was then that the hexagram kun associated with this period was moved from the first place to its present second place in the ching every line in kun is broken yin because this is a feminist and prepatriarchal form of society and because yin correlates with the agricultural rather than the urban always linked to darkness by mystics this kun style of sensibility is also linked by the illuminati with dreck dung and everything they find messy and intolerable about ordinary human beings the erisians of course take the opposite position connect this with eris the primordial goddess and regard it as ideal verwirrung is numerologically linked with not only because of kuns shift from first to second place in the ching but because it is the balance of hodge and podge thus even though it is the first stage chronologically it is never linked with in magic sense because signifies the erect penis the male principle in isolation and such authoritarian games as monotheism monopoly monogamy and general monotony this dynamic ness of verwirrung is also implicit in its tarot card the nd trump or high priestess who sits between a black pillar and a white one cf the hodge and podge and who represents mystery magic mischief and erisian values generally she wears the balanced solar cross rather than the unbalanced christian cross to emphasize the unity of opposites in such a historical period typical aquarians who have manifested verwirrung values are aaron burr christopher marlowe hung mung charles darwin willard gibbs who incorporated chaos into mathematics mrs patrick campbell elizabeth blackwell pioneer woman physician anna pavlova mozart lewis carrol robert burns james joyce lord byron david wark griffith and gelett burgess author of the classic erisian poem i never saw a purple cow i never hope to see one but ill tell you this anyhow id rather see than be one the verwirrung phase of european history is identified with the danubian culture so called because most of its relics have been found along the shores of the danube according to archeologists the danubian culture was agricultural preurban worshipped a female rather than a male god and never invented anything remotely like a state the preinca society of peru the minoan civilization the prechou period of china already mentioned and many american indian tribes still surviving also represent a verwirrung social framework the synthesis of hodge and podge and especially of biogram and logogram in such cultures is indicated by the amazement of explorers from authoritarian societies when first encountering them the usual words about the grace and spontaniety of the natives merely represent the lack of authoritarian conflict between biogram and logogram these people sit like the tarot high priestess between opposite poles without tilting one way or the other but the fact that this is a dynamic and not a static balance means that eventually after permutations according to weishaupt the second stage must evolve zweitracht in this discordant period the hodge and the podge are in conflict because a ruling class emerges which attempts to control the others this correlates with hexagram chien the allpowerful in the i ching the six unbroken lines represent the severity and monotony of such a period which is above all the age of the tsquare the building of fences the division of lands by boundaries drawn on maps and the imposition of one mans or one groups will upon all others typically the earth is regarded as both flat and finite by the zweitracht mentality and there is much concern with dividing it up into portions among themselves of course the superstitious terror of american indians when first confronting maps was merely the reaction of a verwirrung mentality to a zweitracht mentality the indians could not conceive of people treating earth as a thing to be exploited rather than a mother to be respected zweitracht associates with numerologically because is the totally male number because allmale trinities brahmavishnusiva fathersonspirit etc are invented in such ages and because the discord always has a minimum of vectors not merely that is the division into a propertied ruling class and an unpropertied governed class immediately sets in motion further cupidity the ruling class soon falls to fighting over the spoils contrary to marx most of the strife in zweitracht ages is not the conflict between proprietors and proles but between various proprietors over who gets the biggest share of the pie the governing tarot card is trump the hanged man the cross on which he hangs is blossoming to show that it is still organic and alive the biogram he hangs upside down to show the reversal of nature he represents both the burden of omniscience in the owninggoverning class and the burden of nescience in the servilesubmissive class the total crucifixion of desire by realprinzip and realpolitik the astrological sign of this period is pisces the two fish swimming in opposite directions indicating the conflict of logogram and biogram body and spirit astrologers say typical pisceans who have shown the zweitracht personality are e h harriman the railroad magnate who covered the united states with chienstyle unbroken straight lines cardinal john henry newman sir robert badenpowell founder of the boy scouts an attempt to instill piscean authoritarianism even in childhood admiral chester nimitz john foster dulles anna lee founder of the worlds most antisexual religion the shakers industrialists like kruger and pullman financiers like cambell and braden grover cleveland john c calhoun neville chamberlain andrew jackson whose expulsion of the cherokee nation from its traditional lands onto the trail of tears where most of them perished is the archetypal zweitracht landgrab william jennings bryan and frank stanton of cbs since all illuminati with any academic leanings at all are encouraged to major in history the tendency in most textbooks is not only to black out verwirrung periods but to glorify zweitracht periods as ages of light and progress indeed they make entertaining reading theyare ages of expansion and there are always new people being discovered to be subjugated civilized and converted to taxpayers and rentpayers almost any age described in glowing and admiring language in a history text will prove on examination to be a zweitracht era and the foremost butchers and invaders are treated as the outstanding heroes of humanity a sympathetic reading of the biographies of these empirebuilders almost always indicates that they were homo neophile individuals who turned their talents to destruction rather than creativity because of bitterness engendered by years of torment and baiting by homo neophobe types during their childhoods the everpresent conflict in a zweitracht period eventually leads to the third stage unordnung humanity has been transformed during a zweitracht age by placing logogram in governing authority over biogram unordnung is an attempt to restore balance by revolutionizing the logogram there is no thought about the biogram because contact with this somatic component of personality has been lost this loss of contact has been variously described by precelinean observers it is the veil of maya in buddhism the censor band or repression in psychoanalysis the character armoring and muscular armoring in reichian psychology etc the i ching hexagram for this stage is meng or youthful folly the yang line at the top indicates the continued supremacy of logogram even though some biogram elements the yin lines begin to reassert themselves the traditional reading is mountain above water that is the rigid logogram still repressing the aquarian element as it seeks to liberate itself the usual chinese interpretation of this hexagram is the young fool needs discipline and the leaders of all rebellions at this stage always heartily agree with that and demand unquestioning obedience from their followers this is a time of turmoils troubles and tyrannies that appear and disappear rapidly the mystical number is which means a new start in kabalism and error and repentence in most other systems of numerology tarot trump the fool symbolizes this age as a dreamyeyed youth unknowingly walking over an abyss the hitlerjugend and the disciples of various other fuehrers and messiahs immediately come to mind that this card is disputed by various tarot experts and is given a numerical value of rather than by the wisest indicates the confusion in all unordnung periods the dog who barks to warn the young fool like the yin lines in the hexagram represents the desperate attempts of the biogram ton break through the repression or censorband and make itself heard typical cancerians who exemplified unordnung are julius caesar mary baker eddy whose philosophy was an explicit denial of the biogram albert parsons emma goldman benjamin peret vladimir mayakofski henry david thoreau durrutti pj proudhon brooks adams general kitchener luigi pirandello the literary master of ambiguity erich ambler the literary master of conspiracy calvin coolidge who issued the classically muddled cancerian statement be as revolutionary as science and as conservative as the multiplication table andrei gromyko nelson rockefeller john calvin estes kefauver and rexford tugwell an unordnung period has always been thought of even before hegel provided the words as a synthesis between the thesis of verwirrung and the antithesis zweitracht since it is a false synthesis on the logogrammic level only it always gives birth to the fourth stage the parenthesis beamtenherrschaft this is the age of bureaucracy and to live at this time is as proudhon said to have every operation every transaction every movement noted registered counted rated stamped measured numbered assessed licensed refused authorized endorsed admonished prevented reformed redressed corrected to be laid under contribution drilled fleeced exploited monopolized extorted from exhausted hoaxed and robbed the governing i ching hexagram is kun oppression or exhaustion the driedup lake with the usual reading of superior men oppressed by the inferior this is the time when homo neophobe types most rigorously repress homo neophile types and great heresy hunts and witch trials flourish this correlates with the number signifying the last judgment because every citizen is to some extent a state functionary and each is on trial before the jury of all the traditional chinese associations with this hexagram are sitting under a bare tree and wandering through an empty valley signifying the ecological havoc wreaked by purely abstract minds working upon the organic web of nature the th tarot trump the tower describes this age the tower is struck by lightning and the inhabitants fall from the windows cf the tower of babel legend and our recent power failures the traditional interpretations of this card suggest pride oppression and bankruptcy this correlates with libra the mentality which measures and balances all things on an artificial scale maya typical libras who have manifested beamtenherrschaft characterists are comte de saint simon justice john marshall hans geiger henry wallace dwight eisenhower john kenneth galbraith arthur schlesinger jr john dewey and dr joyce brothers in beamtenherrschaft ages there is ceaseless activity all planned in advance begun at the scheduled second carefully supervised scrupulously recorded but inevitably finished late and poorly done the burden of omniscience on the ruling class becomes virtually intolerable and most flee into some form of schizophrenia or fantasy great towers pyramids moon shots and similar marvels are accomplished at enormous cost while the underpinnings of social solidarity crumble entirely while blunders multiply no responsible individual can ever be found because all decisions are made by committees anyone seeking redress of grievance wanders into endless corridors of paperwork with no more tangible result than in the hunting of the snark illuminati historians of course describe these ages as glowingly as zweitracht epochs for although control is in the hands of homo neophobe types there is at least a kind of regularity order and geometrical precision about everything and the messiness of the barbaric verwirrung ages and revolutionary unordnung ages is absent nevertheless the burden of omniscience on the rulers steadily escalates as we have indicated and the burden of nescience on the servile class increasingly renders them unfit to serve more and more are placed on the dole shipped to mental hospitals or recruited into whatever is the current analog of the gladiatorial games so the tower eventually falls grummet the age of grummet begins with an upsurge of magicians hoaxers yippies kabouters shamans clowns and other eristic forces the relevant i ching hexagram is huan dispersion and dissolution the gentle wind above the deep water is the chinese reading of the image with associations of loss of ego separation from the group and going out in general yin lines dominate all but the top of the hexagram the forces leading to a new verwirrung stage are pushing upward toward release this is also called paralysis by the illuminati because objectively nothing much is happening subjectively of course the preparations for the new cycle are working unconsciously the mystic number is union of male with female and final resolution of conflict between verwirrung and zweitracht the governing tarot trump is number the lovers in which the woman looks upward at the angel eris the biogram and the man looks at the woman the logogram yang reaches synthesis with biogram yin only through reconciliation with the female hence the upsurge of feminism in such periods together with a renewed emphasis on clans tribes and communes typical virgos manifesting grummet traits are charlie parker antonin artaud louis lingg edgar rice burroughs grandma moses lodovico ariosto greta garbo hedy lamarr and goethe and tolstoy who manifested strong yin values while never quite getting reconciled with the women in their own lives tolstoy however as the classic dropout is an archetypal grummet persona and almost completed the sufi course of quit this world quit the next world quit quitting after grummet of course authority has collapsed entirely and the biogram stands on equal footing with the logogram hodge and podge being once again in dynamic balance a new verwirrung period begins and the cycle repeats since weishaupt dreamed this schema up while he was under the influence of several hallucinogenic drugs one should regard it with some skepticism it is certainly not true in every detail and there is no theoretical or empirical demonstration that each of the five ages must always have permutations the fact that grummetvirgo personalities and all other of the five personality types are born in all ages even if they come to dominance in their appropriate epochs leaves many mysteries still unsolved in short all that a sober scholar can say of the illuminati theory of history is that it makes at least as much sense as the exoteric marxhegel spengler toynbee and sorokin theories the aa who regard all illuminati theories as false projections onto the external world of inner spiritual processes are particularly skeptical about this one since it involves several false correlations between the i ching and the tarot the zodiac etc finally it should be noted that of all the people hagbard employed as resonance for the vibes used against the saure family in ingolstadt only lady velkor danny pricefixer and george dorn were not virgos hagbard evidently believed that the illuminati magical links work when illuminati activities are occurring in a given areaand hence virtually all of his people at the festival were virgos and thereby linked with the grummethuantrump chain of astrological associations on the other hand the presence of three nonvirgos shows hagbards pragmatic approach and his refusal to be ruled even by so exact a science as astrology this sentence may manifest a lapse into mockery or mystification by otherwise sober authors in this connection when george dorn and his mother went to radio city music hall to see the lotus position the last movie made by the american medical association before their tragic deaths they happened to meet a tall italian and a very beautiful black woman whom he introduced as his wife mrs dorn didnt catch the italians name but it was obvious that george had a very great admiration for him on the bus back to nutley she decided to straighten the boy out a man who respects himself and his own race she began would never think of marrying into the colored shut up ma george said politely thats no way to talk to your mother the fine lady said going ahead blithely now your father had some radical ideas and he tried to get the unions to accept the colored but he never thought of marrying into them george he had too much selfrespect are you listening george how did you like the ama he asked such wonderful young boys so cleancut and that darling sister of theirs at least they didnt think there was anything attractive about long hair on men do you know what long hair makes men look like like girls ma is that right it makes them look worse than girls george it makes them look like theyre not really men if you know what i mean no i dont know what you mean ma george was profoundly bored well i mean a little bit on the lavender side she tittered oh he said you mean cocksuckers some of my best friends are cocksuckers ma at this simple piece of factual information the remarkable lady turned red and then purple and then twisted in her chair to look out the window in angry silence for the rest of the trip the curious thing is that before george could get the courage to shut the old battleaxe up that way he first had to try to shoot a cop and then try to shoot himself and finally take hashish with hagbard celine and yet she was a virgo and he was a capricorn appendix daleth hassan i sabbah and alamout black when the prophet died in am the true faith was almost immediately shattered by conflict between the shiite and sunnite parties more than a century of religious and civil warfare followed and by am the shiites themselves had split and given birth to a subsect known as the ismailis or ishmaelians it was out of this group that hassan i sabbah formed the order of the assassins in am known as the year to moslems to jews and scotch rite masons to confucians and to christians ishmaelian religion had already at that date become a ninelevel affair in the manner typical of mystical secret societies those of the lowest grade for instance were merely informed that al koran contained an allegorical meaning in addition to its surface teachings and that their salvation lay in following orders as a neophyte progressed through the various grades more and more of the allegories would be explained and a doctrine would gradually emerge which is in essence that taught by all the mystics of east and westbuddhists taoists vedantists rosicrucians etc the doctrine is in important aspects unspeakable which is why the trainee required an imam the ishmaelian equivalent of a guru to guide him in the nonverbal aspects the ninth and highest grade however had no parallel except in very strict theravada buddhism in this ninth grade which hassan attained shortly before founding the hashishim it was taught that even the personal mystical experience of the seeker his own encounter with the absolute or the void or the hodgepodge or god or goddess or whatever one chooses to call it should be subject to the most merciless analysis and criticism and that there is no guide superior to reason the ishmaelian adept in short was one who had achieved supreme mystical awareness but refused to make even that into an idol he was a total atheistanarchist subject to no authority but his own independent mind such men are dangerous as caesar observed and certainly they are dangerous to the caesars the ishmaelians were being persecuted throughout the moslem world and strong efforts were being made to exterminate them entirely when hassan i sabbah became imam of the whole movement it was hassans cynical judgment and many illuminated beings such as the lamas of tibet have agreed with him that most people have no aspiration or capacity for much spiritual and intellectual independence he thereupon reorganized the ishmaelians in such a way as to allow and encourage those of small mind to remain in the lower grades the tools of this enterprise were the famous garden of delights in his castle at alamout a good duplication of the paradise of al koran complete with the beautiful and willing houris the prophet had promised to the faithful and a certain magick chemical those of the lowest grade were brought to alamout given the miraculous concoction and set loose for several hours in the garden of delights they came out convinced that they had truly visited heaven and that hassan i sabbah was the most powerful holy man in the world they were assured furthermore that if they obeyed every order even at the cost of their own lives they would return to that paradise after death these men became the first sleeper agents in the history of international politics where the three major contending religions of that time in the near east christianity judaism and orthodox islam insisted that it was an unforgivable sin to deny ones faith hassan taught that allah would forgive such little white lies when they served a worthy purpose thus his agents were able to pass themselves off as christians jews or orthodox moslems and infiltrate any court holy order or army at will since the other religions had the abovementioned prohibition against such deception they were unable to infiltrate the ishmaelians in turn the use of these agents as assassins is discussed passim in the novel and weishaupts opinion that hassan had discovered the moral equivalent of war is an interesting commentary hassan never had to send an army into battle and armies sent against him were soon stopped by the sudden and unexpected deaths of their generals one of hassans successors was sinan who moved the headquarters of the cult from alamout to messiac and may or may not have written the letter about richard the lionhearted which george recalls in the third trip sinan contemporaries claimed performed miracles of healing conversed with invisible beings and was never seen to eat drink or perform the functions of urination and excretion he was also credited with telepathy and with the ability to kill animals by looking at them it was he and not hassan i sabbah as many popular books state who ordered two of the lower members of the order to commit suicide in order to impress a visiting ambassador with his power over his followers the two obeyed leaping from the castle wall into the abyss below sinan also made attempts to form ah alliance with the knights templar to drive both orthodox christians and orthodox moslems out of the arena but this evidently fell through the hashishim were finally crushed despite their powerful espionage and assassination network when the whole middle east was overrun by hordes of mongols who came from so far away that they had not been infiltrated it took several centuries for the hashishim to make a comeback as the nonviolent ishmaelian movement of today under the leadership of the aga khan finally it was at hassan i sabbahs death that he allegedly uttered the aphorism for which he is best known and which is quoted several times in the novel nothing is true all is permissible the orthodox moslem historian juvaini who may have invented this whole episode adds that as soon as these blasphemous words passed his lips hassans soul plunged to the depths of hell ever since marco polo recorded the story of the garden of delights western commentators have identified hassans magick chemical as pure hashish recent scholarship however has thrown this into doubt and it is clear that hashish and other marijuana preparations were well known in the near east for thousands of years before hassan ever lived for instance the plant has been found in grave mounds of late neolithic man in the area dated around bc as hagbard mentions in the novel it is implausible then that the ingenious sabbah would have tried to pass this drug off as something new and magical some have suggested that hassan who was known to have traveled much in his youth might have brought opium back from the east and mixed it with hashish the scholarly dr joel fort goes further and argues in the pleasure seekers that hassans supercharger was wineandopium with no marijuana products at all dr john allegro in the sacred mushroom and the cross argues that both hassan and the first christians actually achieved the paradisical vision with the aid of amanita muscaria the fly agaric mushroom which is poisonous in high doses but psychedelic or at least deleriant in small quantities the present books suggestion alamout black an almost pure hashish with a few pinches of belladonna and stramonium is based on the strong etymological evidence that the hashishim were somehow involved with hashish the unlikelihood that wine opium mushrooms or any combination thereof could account for the etymological and historical association of hassan with hashish the reasons previously given for doubting that hashish alone is the answer the capacity of stramonium and belladonna in small doses to create intensely brilliant visual imagery beyond that of even the best grades of hashish the fact that these latter drugs were used in both the elusinian mysteries and in the european witch cult contemporary with hassan see rel masters eros and evil since it is not the intent of this book to confuse fact with fancy it should be pointed out that these arguments are strong but not compelling many other alternatives can be suggested such as hashishbelladonnamandragora hashishstramoniumopium hashishopiumbelladonna hashishopiumbufotinin etc etc all that can be said with certainty is that hagbard celine insists the correct formula is hashishbelladonnastramonium in ratio and we believe hagbard most of the time medieval magicians knew how to obtain bufotinin they took it as shakespeare recorded from skin of toad the exact link between the assassins and the european illuminati remains unclear we have seen but no longer own a john birch society publication arguing that the alliance between the hashishim and the knights templar was consummated and that european masonry has been more or less under hashishim influence ever since more likely is the theory of daraul op cit that after the hashishim regrouped as the nonviolent ishmaelian sect of today the roshinaya illuminated ones copied their old tactics and were in turn copied by the allumbrados of spain and finally by the bavarian illuminati the nine stages of hashishim training the thirteen stages in weishaupts iluminati the thirtytwo degrees of masonry etc are of course arbitrary the theravada buddhists have a system of forty meditations each leading to a definite stage of growth some schools of hinduism recognize only two stages dhyana conquest of the personal ego and samadhi unity with the whole one can equally well posit five stages or a hundred and five the essential that is common to all these systems is that the trainee at some point or other is nearly scared to death an interesting account of a traditional system used by quite primitive mexican indians yet basically similar to any and all of the above is provided by anthropologist carlos castaneda who underwent training with a yaqui shaman and recounts some of the terrors vividly in the teachings of don juan a separate reality journey to ixtlan and tales of power don juan used peyote stramonium and a magic mushroom probably psilocyble mexicana the drug tim leary used for his first trip the difference between these systems is that some aim to liberate every candidate and some like sabbahs and weishaupts deliberately encourage the majority to remain in ignorance whereby they may with profit be endlessly exploited by their superiors in the cult the same general game of an illuminated minority misusing a superstitious majority was characteristic of tibet until the chinese communist invasion broke the power of the high lamas a sympathetic account of the tibetan system which goes far toward justifying it can be found in alexandra davidneels the hidden teachings of tibetan buddhism an unsympathetic account by a skeptical fellow mystic is available in the confessions of aleister crowley another word about alamout black it is not for the inexperienced psychedelic voyager for instance the first time simon moon tried it in early he had occasion to use the mens room in the biograph theatre where he had gone to see yellow submarine while under the influence after his bowel movement he reached for the toilet paper and saw with consternation that the first sheet hanging down off the roll was neatly stamped official bavarian illuminati ewige blumenkraft on ordinary marijuana or hashish such illusions occur of course but they are not true hallucinations they go away if you look at them hard enough no matter how hard simon looked at the toilet paper it still said official bavarian illuminati ewige blumenkraft simon went back to his seat in the theater badly shaken for weeks afterward he wondered if the illuminati had some sinister reason for infiltrating the toilet paper industry or if the whole experience were a genuine hallucination and the first sign as he put it that this fucking dope is ruining my fucking head he never solved this mystery but eventually he stopped worrying about it as for hassan i sabbah x and the cult of the black mother the authors have been able to learn precious little about them since they are clearly related somehow to the assassins and the cult of kali mother of destruction one can consider them part of the illuminati or podge side of the sacred chao since they seem to be businessmen rather than fanatics and since kali might be a version of eris one can consider them part of the discordian or hodge side amid such speculation and much mystery they go their dark way peddling horse and preaching some pretty funky doctrines about whitey perhaps they intend to betray everybody and run off with the loot at an opportune momentand then again maybe they are the only really dedicated revolutionaries around nothing is too heavy to be knocked on its ass and everything is cool baby is the only summary of his personal philosophy that hassan i sabbah x himself would give us hes a studly dude and we didnt press him appendix tzaddi skidoo linguists and etymologists have had much exercise for their notinconsiderable imaginations in attempting to account for this expression skidoo has been traced back to the older skedaddle and thence to the greek skedannumi to disperse hurriedly the naturally has caused even more creative efforts by these gentry since they are unaware of the secret teachings of magick one theorist noting that sidney carton in dickens tale of two cities is the twentythird man guillotined in the final scene guessed that those playgoers who were eager to get out of the theater before the crowd counted off the executions and skidood toward the exits numbered another eminent scholar assumes that the expression has something to do with men hanging around the old flatiron building on twentythird street in new york city a notoriously windy corner to watch ladies skirts raised by the breeze when a cop came they would skidoo others have mused inconclusively about the early telegraph operators signal of which means roughly stop transmitting clear the line or to be crude shut up but nobody claims to know how telegraphers picked to have this meaning a literary reference which simon moon with his modernistic bias overlooked the mysterys real origin is a closely guarded secret of the justified ancients of mummu which simon had not attained the rank to learn dillinger however had attained this rank and uses the formula quite correctly in the bank robbery scene in the third trip it was printed by prater perdurabo aleister crowley in the book of lies privately published republished by samuel weiser inc new york the text of the spell makes up the totality of chapter in that curious little book and it reads skidoo what man is at ease in his inn get out wide is the world and cold get out thou hast become an initiate get out but thou canst not get out by the way thou camest in the way out is the way get out for out is love and wisdom and power get out if thou hast t already first get ut then get o and so at last get out it is not permissible to explain this fully but it may be stated guardedly that t is the union of sex and death tau the rosy crucifixion ut is ugita in the upanishads and o is the positive void fission chips like our other characters was given a chance to peruse this manuscript before publication and correct any factual errors that may have crept in of this appendix he said i think my leg is being pulled again chaps i suspect that crowley wrote that in as a joke on his readers and you blokes found it and inserted a reference to a magic formula used by dillinger in your story just so you could then compose this appendix and explain it such skepticism straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel may be compared to the stance of the bible fundamentalist who avers that jhvh made the universe in six days in bc but included fossils and other false leads to make it appear much older one could equally assert that the cosmos appeared out of void one second ago including us and our false memories of a longer duration here appendix vau flaxscrip and hempscrip flaxscrip was first introduced into discordian groups by the mysterious malaclypse the younger ksc in hempscrip followed the year after issued by dr mordecai malignatus kns in the novel taking one of our few liberties with historical truth we move these coinages backward in time and attribute hempscrip to the justified ancients of mummu the idea behind flaxscrip of course is as old as history there was private money long before there was government money the first revolutionary or reformist use of this idea as a check against galloping usury and high interest rates was the foundation of banks of piety by the dominican order of the catholic church in the late middle ages see tawney religion and the rise of capitalism the dominicans having discovered that preaching against usury did not deter the usurer founded their own banks and provided loans without interest this ethical competition as josiah warren later called it drove the commercial banks out of the areas where the dominicans practiced it similar private currency loaned at a low rate of interest but not at no interest was provided by scots banks until the british government acting on behalf of the monopoly of the bank of england stopped this exercise of free enterprise see muellen free banking the same idea was tried successfully in the american colonies before the revolution and again was suppressed by the british government which some heretical historians regard as a more direct cause of the american revolution than the taxes mentioned in most schdolbooks see ezra pound impact and additional sources cited therein during the nineteenth century many anarchists and individualists attempted to issue lowinterest or nointerest private currencies mutual banking by colonel william greene and true civilization by josiah warren are records of two such attempts by their instigators lysander spooner an anarchist who was also a constitutional lawyer argued at length that congress had no authority to suppress such private currencies see his our financiers their ignorance usurpations and frauds a general overview of such efforts at free enterprise soon crushed by the capitalist state is given by james m martin in his men against the state and by rudolph rocker in pioneers of american freedom an ironic title since his pioneers all lost their major battles lawrence labadie of suffern ny has collected but not yet published records of such experiments one of the present authors robert anton wilson unearthed in the tale of a nointerest currency privately issued in yellow springs ohio during the s depression this was an emergency measure by certain local businessmen who did not fully appreciate the principle involved and was abandoned as soon as the tightmoney squeeze ended and roosevelt began flooding us all with federal reserve notes it is traditional among liberal historians to dismiss such endeavors as funnymoney schemes they have never explained why government money is any less hilarious that used in the us now for instance is actually worth percent of its declared face value all money is funny if you stop to think about it but no private currency competing on a free market could ever be quite so comical and tragic as the notes now bearing the magic imprint of uncle samand backed only by his promise or threat that come hell or high water by god hell make it good by taxing our descendants unto the infinite generation to pay the interest on it the national debt so called is of course nothing else but the debt we owe the bankers who loaned this money to uncle after he kindly gave them the credit which enabled them to make this loan hempscrip or even acidscrip or peyotescrip could never be quite so clownish as this system which only the illuminati if they really exist could have dreamed up the system has but one advantage it makes bankers richer every year nobody else from the industrial capitalist or captain of industry to the coalminer profits from it in any way and all pay the taxes which become the interest payments which make the bankers richer if the illuminati did not exist it would be necessary to invent themsuch a system can be explained in no other way except by those cynics who hold that human stupidity is infinite the idea behind hempscrip is more radical than the notion of privateenterprise currency per se hempscrip as employed in the novel depreciates it is thus not merely a nointerest currency but a negativeinterest currency the lender literally pays the borrower to take it away for a while it was invented by german businesseconomist silvio gesell and is described in his natural economic order and in professor irving fishers stamp script greshams law like most of the laws taught in statesupported public schools is not quite true at least not in the form in which it is usually taught bad money drives out good holds only in authoritarian societies not in libertarian societies gresham was clearminded enough to state explicitly that he was only describing authoritarian societies his formulation of his own law begins with the words if the king issueth two moneys thereby implying that the state must exist if the law is to operate in a libertarian society good money will drive out the bad this utopian propositionwhich the sane reader will regard with acute skepticismhas been seen to be sound by a rigorously logical demonstration based on the axioms of economics in the cause of business depressions by hugo bilgrim and edward levy economists can prove all sorts of things from axioms and few of them turn out to be true yes we saved for a footnote the information that at least four empirical demonstrations of the reverse of greshams law are on record three of them employing small volunteer communities in frontier usa circa are recorded in josiah warrens true civilization the fourth employing contemporary college students in a psychology laboratory is the subject of a recent masters thesis by associate professor don werkheiser of central state college wilberforce ohio appendix zain property and privilege property is theft p j proudhon property is liberty p j proudhon property is impossible p j proudhon consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds ralph waldo emerson proudhon by piling up his contradictions this way was not merely being french he was trying to indicate that the abstraction property covers a variety of phenomena some pernicious and some beneficial let us borrow a device from the semanticists and examine his triad with subscripts attached for maximum clarity property is theft means that property created by the artificial laws of feudal capitalist and other authoritarian societies is based on armed robbery land titles for instance are clear examples of property swords and shot were the original coins of transaction property is liberty means that property that which will be voluntarily honored in a voluntary anarchist society is the foundation of the liberty in that society the more peoples interests are comingled and confused as in collectivism the more they will be stepping on each others toes only when the rules of the game declare clearly this is mine and this is thine and the game is voluntarily accepted as worthwhile by all parties to it can true independence be achieved property is impossible means that property property creates so much conflict of interest that society is in perpetual undeclared civil war and must eventually devour itself and properties and as well in short proudhon in his own way foresaw the snafu principle he also foresaw that communism would only perpetuate and aggravate the conflicts and that anarchy is the only viable alternative to this chaos it is not averred of course that property will come into existence only in a totally voluntary society many forms of it already exist the error of most alleged libertarians especially the followers of the egregious ayn rand is to assume that all property is property the distinction can be made by any iq above and is absurdly simple the test is to ask of any title of ownership you are asked to accept or which you ask others to accept would this be honored in a free society of rationalists or does it require the armed might of a state to force people to honor it if it be the former it is property and represents liberty if it be the latter it is property and represents theft appendix cheth hagbards abdication readers who do not understand the scene in which hagbard abdicates in favor of miss portinari should take heart once they do understand it they will understand most of the mysteries of all schools of mysticism appendix lamed the tactics of magick the human brain evidently operates on some variation of the famous principle enunciated in the hunting of the snark what i tell you three times is true norbert weiner cybernetics the most important idea in the book of sacred magic of abramelin the mage is the simplelooking formula invoke often the most successful form of treatment for socalled mental disorders the behavior therapy of pavlov skinner wolpe et al could well be summarized in two similar words reinforce often reinforcement for all practical purposes means the same as the laymans term reward the essence of behavior therapy is rewarding desired behavior the behavior as if by magic begins to occur more and more often as the rewards continue advertising as everybody knows is based on the axiom repeat often those who think they are materialists and think that materialism requires them to deny all facts which do not square with their definition of matter are loath to admit the welldocumented and extensive list of individuals who have been cured of serious maladies by that very vulgar and absurd form of magick known as christian science nonetheless the reader who wants to understand this classic work of immortal literature will have to analyze its deepest meanings guided by an awareness that there is no essential difference between magick behavior therapy advertising and christian science all of them can be condensed into abramelins simple invoke often reality as simon moon says is thermoplastic not thermosetting it is not quite sillyputty as mr paul krassner once claimed but is much closer to sillyputty than we generally realize if you are told often enough that budweiser is the king of beers budweiser will eventually taste somewhat better perhaps a great deal better than it tasted before this magick spell was cast if a behavior therapist in the pay of the communists rewards you every time you repeat a communist slogan you will repeat it more often and begin to slide imperceptibly toward the same kind of belief that christian scientists have for their mantras and if a christian scientist tells himself every day that his ulcer is going away the ulcer will disappear more rapidly than it would have had he not subjected himself to this homemade advertising campaign finally if a magician invokes the great god pan often enough the great god pan will appear just as certainly as heterosexual behavior appears in homosexuals who are being handled or manhandled by behavior therapy the opposite and reciprocal of invoke often is banish often the magician wishing for a manifestation of pan will not only invoke pan directly and verbally create panlike conditions in his temple reinforce pan associations in every gesture and every article of furniture use the colors and perfumes associated with pan etc he will also banish other gods verbally banish them by removing their associated furnitures and colors and perfumes and banish them in every other way the behavior therapist calls this negative reinforcement and in treating a patient who is afraid of elevators he will not only reinforce reward every instance in which the patient rides an elevator without terror but will also negatively reinforce punish each indication of terror shown by the patient the christian scientist of course uses a mantra or spell which both reinforces health and negatively reinforces banishes illness similarly a commercial not only motivates the listener toward the sponsors product but discourages interest in all false gods by subsuming them under the rubric of the despised and contemptible brand x the basic christian science mantra known as the scientific statement of being no less is as follows there is no life truth intelligence nor substance in matter all is infinite mind and its infinite manifestation for god is all in all spirit is immortal truth matter is mortal error spirit is the real and eternal matter is the unreal and temporal spirit is god and man is his image and likeness therefore man is not material he is spiritual the fact that these statements are in terms of the scientific criteria meaningless nonoperational and footless is actually totally irrelevant they work try them and see as aleister crowley no friend of mrs eddys wrote enough of because may he be damned for a dog hypnotism debate and countless other games have the same mechanism invoke often and banish often the reader who seeks a deeper understanding of this argument can obtain it by putting these principles to the test if you are afraid that you might in this christian environment fall into taking the christian science mantra too seriously try instead the following simple experiment for forty days and forty nights begin each day by invoking and praising the world in itself as an expression of the egyptian deities recite at dawn i bless ra the fierce sun burning bright i bless isisluna in the night i bless the air the horushawk i bless the earth on which i walk repeat at moonrise continue for the full forty days and forty nights we say without any reservations that at a minimum you will feel happier and more at home in this part of the galaxy and will also understand better uncle john feathers attitude toward our planet at maximum you may find rewards beyond your expectations and will be converted to using this mantra for the rest of your life if the results are exceptionally good you just might start believing in ancient egyptian gods a selection of magick techniques which will offend the reason of no materialist can be found in laura archera huxleys you are not the target a powerful mantra the title in gestalt therapy by peris heferline and goodman and in mind games by masters and houston all this of course is programming your own trip by manipulating appropriate clusters of word sound image and emotional prajna energy the aspect of magick which puzzles perplexes and provokes the modern mentality is that in which the operator programs somebody elses trip acting at a distance it is incredible and insulting to this type of person if one asserts that our mr nkrumah fubar could program a headache for the president of the united states he might grant that such manipulating of energy is possible if the president was told about mr fubars spells but he will not accept that it works just as well when the subject has no conscious knowledge of the curse the magical theory that has no conviction for such a skeptic and magicians have not yet proposed a better theory the materialist then asserts that all cases where magic did appear to work under this handicap are illusions delusions hallucinations coincidences misapprehensions luck accident or downright hoax look up the etymology of that word some time and see if it means anything he does not seem to realize that asserting this is equivalent to asserting that reality is after all thermoplastic for he is admitting that many people live in a different reality than his own rather than leave him to grapple as best he can with this selfcontradiction we suggest that he consult psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain by ostrander and schroderespecially chapter from animals to cybernetics the search for a theory of psi he might realize that when matter is fully understood there is nothing a materialist need reject in magick action at a distance which has been well explored by scientists committed to the rigid marxist form of dialectical materialism those who have kept alive the ancient traditions of magick such as the ordo templi orientalis will realize that the essential secret is sexual as saul tries to explain in the sixth trip and that more light can be found in the writings of wilhelm reich m d than in the current soviet research but dr reich was jailed as a quack by the us government and we would not ask our readers to consider the possibility that the us government could ever be wrong about anything any psychoanalyst will guess at once the most probable symbolic meanings of the rose and the cross but no psychologist engaged in psi research has applied this key to the deciphering of traditional magic texts the earliest reference to freemasonry in english occurs in andersens muses threnody for we be brethren of the rosey cross we have the mason word and second sight but no parapsychologist has followed up the obvious clue contained in this conjunction of the vaginal rose the phallic cross the word of invocation and the phenomenon of thought projection that the taboos against sexuality are still latent in our culture explains part of this blindness fear of opening the door to the most insidious and subtle forms of paranoia is another part ifthe magick can work at a distance the repressed thought goes which of its is safe a close and objective study of the antilsd hysteria in america will shed further light on the mechanisms of avoidance here discussed of course there are further offenses and affronts to the rationalist in the deeper study of magick we all know for instance that words are only arbitrary conventions with no intrinsic connection to the things they symbolize yet magick involves the use of words in a manner that seems to imply that some such connection or even identity actually exists the reader might analyze some powerful bits of language not generally considered magical and he will find something of the key for instance the pattern in hail erisall hail discordia is not unlike the in holy mary mother of god or that in the lsmft which once sold many cartons of cigarettes to our parents and the in crowleys io pan io pan pan is a relative of these thus when a magician says that you must shout abrahadabra and no other word at the most intensely emotional moment in an invocation he exaggerates you may substitute other words but you will abort the result if you depart too far from the fivebeat pattern of abrahadabra a glance at the end of appendix beth will save the reader from misunderstanding the true tenor of these remarks but this brings us to the magical theory of reality mahatma guru sri paramahansa shivaji writes in yoga for yahoos aleister crowley again under another penname let us consider a piece of cheese we say that this has certain qualities shape structure color solidity weight taste smell consistency and the rest but investigation has shown that this is all illusory where are these qualities not in the cheese for different observers give quite different accounts of it not in ourselves for we do not perceive them in the absence of the cheese what then are these qualities of which we are so sure they would not exist without our brains they would not exist without the cheese they are the results of the union that is of the yoga of the seer and seen of subject and object there is nothing here with which a modern physicist could quarrel and this is the magical theory of the universe the magician assumes that sensed reality the panorama of impressions monitored by the senses and collated by the brain is radically different from socalled objective reality about the latter reality we can only form speculations or theories which if we are very careful and subtle will not contradict either logic or the reports of the senses this lack of contradiction is rare some conflicts between theory and logic or between theory and sensedata are not discovered for centuries for example the wandering of mercury away from the newtonian calculation of its orbit and even when achieved lack of contradiction is proof only that the theory is not totally false it is never in any ease proof that the theory is totally truefor an indefinite number of such theories can be constructed from the known data at any time for instance the geometries of euclid of gauss and reimann of lobachevski and of fuller all work well enough on the surface of the earth and it not yet clear whether the gaussreimann or the fuller system works better in interstellar space see the anthology perception edited by robert blake phd and especially the chapter by psychologist carl rogers which demonstrates that peoples perceptions change while they are in psychotherapy as william blake noted the fool sees not the same tree that the wise man sees if we have this much freedom in choosing our theories about objective reality we have even more liberty in deciphering the given or transactional sensed reality the ordinary person senses as he or she has been taught to sense that is as they have been programmed by their society the magician is a selfprogrammer using invocation and evocation which are functionally identical with selfconditioning autosuggestion and hypnosis as shown above he or she edits or orchestrates sensed reality like an artist everybody of course does this unconsciously see the paragraph about the cheese the magician doing it consciously controls it this book being part of the only serious conspiracy it describes that is part of operation mindfuck has programmed the reader in ways that he or she will not understand for a period of months or perhaps years when that understanding is achieved the real import of this appendix and of the equation will be clearer officials at harvard thought dr timothy leary was joking when he warned that students should not be allowed to indiscriminately remove dangerous habitforming books from the library unless each student proves a definite need for each volume for instance you have lost track of joe maliks mysterious dogs by now it is strange that one can make the clearest possible statements and yet be understood by many to have said the opposite the rite of shiva as performed by joe malik during the sss black mass contains the central secret of all magick very explicitly yet most people can reread that section a dozen or a hundred times and never understand what the secret is for instance miss portinari was a typical catholic girl in every way except for an unusual tendency to take catholicism seriously until she began menstruating and performing spiritual meditations every day one morning during her meditation period she visualized the sacred heart of jesus with unusual clarity immediately another image distinctly shocking to her came to mind with equal vividness she recounted this experience to her confessor the next saturday and he warned her gravely that meditation was not healthy for a young girl unless she intended to take the oath of seclusion and enter a convent she had no intention of doing that but rebelliously and guiltily continued her meditations anyway the disturbing second image persisted whenever she thought of the sacred heart she began to suspect that this was sent by the devil to distract her from meditation these two signs of growth often appear at the same time being dnatriggered openings of the fourth neural circuit one weekend when she was home from convent school on vacation her parents decided she was the right age to be introduced to roman society actually they like most welloff italian families had already chosen which daughter would be given to the church and it wasnt her hence this early introduction to la dolce vita one of the outstanding ornaments of rome at that time was the eccentric international businessman mr hagbard celine and he was at the party to which miss portinari was taken that evening it was around eleven and she had consumed perhaps a little too much piper heidseck when she happened to find herself standing near a small group who were listening raptly to a story the strange celine was telling miss portinari wondered what this creature might be sayinghe was reputedly even more cynical and materialistic than other international moneygrubbers and miss portinari was at that time the kind of conservative catholic idealist who finds capitalists even more dreadful than socialists she idly tuned in on his words he was talking english but she understood that language adequately son son hagbbard recited with two beautiful women throwing themselves at you why are you sitting alone in your room jacking off miss portinari blushed furiously and drank some more champagne to conceal it she hated the man already knowing that she would surrender her virginity to him at the earliest opportunity of such complexities are intellectual catholic adolescents capable and the boy replied hagbard went on i guess you just answered your own question ma there was a shocked silence the case is quite typical hagbard added blandly obviously finished professor freud recounts even more startling family dramas i dont see a celebrated french auto racer began frowning then he smiled oh he said was the boy an american miss portinari left the group perhaps a bit too hurriedly she felt a few eyes following her and quickly refilled her champagne glass a halfhour later she was standing on the veranda trying to clear her head in the night air when a shadow moved near her and celine appeared amid a cloud of cigar smoke the moon has a fat jaw tonight he said in italian looks like somebody punched her in the mouth are you a poet in addition to your other accomplishments she asked coolly that sounds as if it might be american verse he laughed a clear peal like a stallion whinnying quite so he said i just came from rapallo where i was talking to americas major poet of this century how old are you he asked suddenly almost sixteen she said fumbling the words almost fifteen he corrected ungallantly if its any affair of yours it might be he replied easily i need a girl your age for something i have in mind i can imagine something foul he stepped further out of the shadows and closer child he said are you religious i suppose you regard that as oldfashioned she replied imagining his mouth on her breast and thinking of paintings of mary nursing the infant at this point in history he said simply its the only thing that isnt oldfashioned what was your birthdate never mind you must be a virgo i am she said his teeth would bite her nipple but very gently he would know enough to do that but that is superstition not religion i wish i could draw a precise line between religion superstition and science he smiled i find that they keep running together you are catholic of course his persistence was maddening i am too proud to believe an absurdity and therefore i am not a protestant she replied immediately fearing that he would recognize the plagiarism what symbol means the most to you he asked with the blandness of a prosecuting attorney setting a trap the cross she said quickly she didnt want him to know the truth no he again corrected her ungallantly the sacred heart then she knew he was of satans party i must go she said meditate further on the sacred heart he said his eyes blazing like a hypnotists a cornball gimmick he was thinking privately but it might work meditate on it deeply child you will find in it the essential of catholicism and the essential of all other religion i think you are mad she responded leaving the veranda with undignified haste but two weeks later during her morning meditation she suddenly understood the sacred heart at lunchtime she disappearedleaving behind a note to the mother superior of the convent school and another note for her parents and went in search of hagbard she had even more potential than he realized and as elsewhere recorded within two years he abdicated in her favor they never became lovers they were quite good friends though and he did fuck her occasionally the importance of symbols images as the link between word and primordial energy demonstrates the unity between magick and yoga both magick and yoga we reiterateare methods of selfprogramming employing synchronistically connected chains of word image and bioenergy thus rationalists who are all puritans have never considered the fact that disbelief in magick is found only in puritanical societies the reason for this is simple puritans are incapable of guessing what magick is essentially all about it can even be surely ventured that only those who have experienced true love in the classic albigensian or troubadour sense of that expression are equipped to understand even the most clearcut exposition of the mysteries the eye in the triangle for instance is not primarily a symbol of the christian trinity as the gullible assume except insofar as the christian trinity is itself a visual or verbal elaboration on a much older meaning nor is this symbol representative of the eye of osiris or even of the eye of horus as some have ventured it is venerated for instance among the cao dai sect in vietnam who never heard of osiris or horus the eyes meaning can be found quite simply by meditating on tarot trump xv the devil which corresponds on the tree of life to the hebrew letter ayin the eye the reader who realizes that the devil is only a late rendering of the great god pan has already solved the mystery of the eye and the triangle has its usual meaning the two together are the union of yod the father with he the mother as in yodhevauhe the holy unspeakable name of god vau the holy ghost is the result of their union and final he is the divine ecstasy which follows one might even venture that one who contemplates this key to the identities of pan the devil the great father and the great mother will eventually come to a new more complete understanding of the christian trinity itself and especially of its most mysterious member vau the elusive holy ghost this book has stated it as clearly as possible in a number of places but some readers are still wondering what we are holding back this being has more in common with the ordinary nocturnal visitor sometimes called a ghost than is immediately evident to the uninitiated cf the welldocumented association of poltergeist disturbances with adolescents lefthand pentagramrighthand pentagram two horns exaltedone horn exalted the pentagram comes in two forms but always represents the fullest extension of the human psyche the male human psyche in particular the pentagram with one horn exalted is quite naturally associated with the righthand path and the twohorned pentagram with the lefthand path the knights templar very appropriately inscribed the head of baphomet the goatheaded deity who was their equivalent of pan or the devil within the lefthanded pentagram in such wise that each horn contained one of baphomets horns it is to be observed that the traditionally sinister lefthand pentagram contains an internal pentagon with one point upward whereas the righthand pentagram contains an internal pentagon with one point downward this nicely illustrates the law of opposites the pentagon in the sacred chao is tilted from the perpendicular so that it cannot be said to have any points directly upward or directly downwardor perhaps can be said to have points up and points down thereby illustrating the reconciliation of opposites all that can be said against the method of the lefthand pentagram without prejudice is that this form of the sacrament is always destructive of the holy spirit in a certain sense it should be remembered that the righthand pentagram method is also destructive in most cases especially by those practitioners so roundly condemned in chapter of joyces ulyssesand this group is certainly the majority these days in view of the ecological crisis it might even be wise to encourage the lefthand method and discourage the righthand method at this time to balance the sacred numbers this association attributing diabolism to the lefthand path is oversimplified prejudiced and superstitious in general it can be said that the lefthand pentagram is suitable for both invocations and evocations whereas the righthand pentagram is suitable only for evocations and mat is the only important difference it is assumed that the reader understands the pentagram as an exclusively male symbol cf the tarot trumps ii and iiithe magus holding one arm upward and one downward and the high priestess sitting between the pillars of day and night the priestess is also associated with the hebrew letter gimmel the camel and part of the meaning of this symbolism is contained in the shapes of the camels back and the hebrew letter this makes it quite useless for summoning werewolves the sacred chao however is intended to teach a philosophical lesson not to attract individuals with dubious pastimes very few readers of the golden bough have pierced sir prof dr frazers veil of euphemism and surmised the exact method used by isis in restoring life to osiris although this is shown quite clearly in extant egyptian frescoes those who are acquainted with this simple technique of resurrecting the dead which is at least partially successful in all cases and totally successful in most will have no trouble in skrying the esoteric connotations of the sacred chao or of the taoist yinyang or the astrological sign of cancer the method almost completely reverses that of the pentagrams right or left and it can even be said that in a certain sense it was not osiris himself but his brother set symbolically understood who was the object of isiss magical workings in every case without exception a magical or mystical symbol always refers to one of the very few variations of the same very special variety of human sacrifice the one eye opening or the one hand clapping and this sacrifice cannot be partial it must culminate in death if it is to be efficacious the literalmindedness of the saures in the novel caused them to become a menace to life on earth the reader should bear this in mind the sacrifice is not simple it is a species of cowardice epidemic in anglosaxon nations for more than three centuries which causes most who seek success in this field to stop short before the death of the victim anything less than deaththat is complete oblivionsimply will not work one will find more clarity on this crucial point in the poetry of john donne than in most treatises alleging to explain the secrets of magick fewer than seventy according to a classical enumeration the magician must always identify fully with the victim and share every agonized contortion to the utmost any attitude of standing aside and watching as in a theatrical performance or any intellectualization during the moments when the sword is doing its brutal but necessary work or any squeamishness or guilt or revulsion creates the twomindedness against which hagbard so vehemently warns in never whistle while youre pissing in a sense only the mind dies a yinyang b sacred chad c ouroboros the serpent eating its own tail d astrological sign of cancer e swastika f roman catholic sacred heart g hexagram the symbolism of the swastika is quite adequately explained in wilhelm reichs mass psychology of fascism ouroboros the serpent eating its own tail is chiefly emblematic of the mass of the holy ghost see israel regardie the tree of life the roman catholic symbolism of the sacred heart is strikingly overt especially to readers of frazer and payneknight in essence it is the same notion conveyed by the cartoonists conventional rendering of cupid shooting his arrow into a red pulsating heart this is the basic meaning of the dying god and the resurrection the identification of christ with the pelican who stabs its own heart with its beak to feed its young is an analogous rendering of the same motif we repeat that it was only because the saure family so misread these simple symbols that they became cruel and sadistic in essence then the basic symbols of magic mythology and religionwhether eastern or western ancient or modern righthand or lefthandare so simple that only the pernicious habit of looking for alleged profundities and mysteries prevents people from automatically understanding them almost without thinking the meaning of the hexagram the female equivalent of the male pentagram was explicated by freud himself but most students convinced that the answer could not be so elementary and downtoearth continue to look into the clouds the same principles apply to written symbols the allimportant name yod he vau he for instance has traditionally been scanned in various ways of which the most significant correlations are given in the following table the traditional lionmaneaglebull symbolism also fits this table as do joyces four old men in finnegans wake it can also be found in the aztec codices and buddhist mandalas yod the fiery father is the lion firesign he the watery mother is man as humanity vau the air spirit is eagle final he earth is bull marcus lyons ie the lion is the fiery father matt gregory ie the ego is the watery mother john mcdougall ie eagle is the airy son luke tarpey taur the bull is the earthy daughter the essential and original meaning of course is a program for a ritual and the ritual is magick the four letters are simply the four beats in wilhelm reichs formula muscular tension electrical charge electrical discharge muscular relaxation in short as freud once noted every sexual act involves at a minimum four parties the father and son provide a fist and a nail the mother and daughter provide two windows the case of the chicago schizophrenic killer william heirens who experienced orgasm when climbing through windows demonstrates that this symbolism does not have to be taught and is inherent in the human mind although always subject to the distortion exemplified by the saures finally the universal blessing given on page is intimately involved with the yhvh formula i bless ra the fierce sun burning bright i bless isisluna in the night i bless the air the horushawk i bless the earth on which i walk the fiery father the watery mother the airy son and the earthy daughter are all there just as they are in every alchemical formula but we say no more at this point lest the reader begin seeking for a equation to balance the in this connectionand also en passant as an indication that adolf hitlers link with the illuminati was not invented for this work of fiction we suggest that the reader look into the morning of the magicians by pauwels and bergier we conclude with a final warning and clarification resort to mass sacrifice as among the aztecs the catholic inquisition and the nazi death camps is the device of those who are incapable of the true rite of the dying god appendix yod operation mindfuck om was originally instigated by ho chih zen of the erisian liberation front who is the same person but not the same individual as lord omar khayyam ravenhurst author of the honest book of truth the guiding philosophy is that originally proposed in the theory of games and economic behavior by von neumann and morgenstern namely that the only strategy which an opponent cannot predict is a random strategy the foundation had already been laid by the late malaclypse the younger ksc when he proclaimed we discordians must stick apart this radical decentralization of all discordian enterprises created a builtin random factor even before operation mindfuck was proposed to this day neither ho chih zen himself nor any other discordian apostle knows for sure who is or is not involved in any phase of operation mindfuck or what activities they are or are not engaged in as part of that project thus the outsider is immediately trapped in a doublebind the only safe assumption is that anything a discordian does is somehow related to om but since this leads directly to paranoia this is not a safe assumption after all and the risky hypothesis that whatever the discordians are doing is harmless may be safer in the long run perhaps every aspect of om follows or accentuates this doublebind the doublebind first defined by anthropologist gregory bateson is a situation in which you must choose between two alternatives both of which are unpleasant a beautiful example suggested by mr william s burroughs condition a draftee so that he will immediately obey either the order stand up or the order sit down if given by a superior officer then have two officers simultaneously order him to stand up and sit down obeying the first order means disobeying the second and obeying the second means disobeying the first presumably the subject would wig out om projects vary from the trivial to the colossal an example of the former is a rubber stamp owned by dr mordecai malignatus which says see mental health records dr malignatus casually picked this up from a publichealth clinic while nobody was looking any mail which dr malignatus considers impertinent or insulting especially if it comes from a government office is stamped with this motto and sent back otherwise untouched this causes considerable puzzlement to various bureaucrats an example of the latter is project jake instigated by harold lord randomfactor once or twice a year a public servant who has distinguished himself by more than common imbecility is selected as target for a jake and all discordian cabals are alerted including the various branches of the erisian liberation front the twelve famous buddha minds the st gulik iconistary the earl of nines the tactile temple of eris erotic the brotherhood of the lust of christ green amp pleasant enterprises society for moral understanding and training the insect the golden apple panthers the paratheoanametamystikhood of eris esoteric sams cafe the seattle group the stone dragon cabal the universal erisian church and the young americans for real freedom on jake day the public servant being honored receives mail from all of these on their official letterheads which are somewhat weird it must be granted asking for help in some complicated political matter that passes all rational understanding the official so honored can conclude either that he is the target of a conspiracy composed entirely of lunatics or that the general public is much more imaginative and less stodgy than he had previously assumed all these are real groups currently active in the us a do you believe that between the trivial and the colossal there is a variety of om which can be called the chronic most notable is the honorary membership not wishing to exclude anybody from membership in the erisian movement for such a technicality as being nonerisian the legendary malaclypse the younger invented several honorary aneristic groups it is now the tradition for any discordian cabal to appoint anybody to one of these groups if his or her behavior is notably aneristic for instance a highschool principal who has given a particularly stirring assembly speech on some such topic as the draft as a protection for our freedoms or taxation as a protection for our property or any of the other oxymorons beloved by educators might thereafter receive some such mailing as this order of the peacock angel house of apostles of eris v safeguard this letter it is an important historical document

to the radical students at the school to guarantee that the principal being honored will see and hear many references to don quixote in following days lest he think he is dealing with a single harmless lunatic the official signal of the knights of the fivesided castle needless to say is a pentagon with a golden apple inside other groups to which individuals may be given honorary membership

all faked somewhere in the american desert a campaign against this similar but more comical herb will destroy the last tattered shreds of faith in the men in washington appendix kaph the rosy doublecross saul barney markoff chancy and dillinger were all puzzled that a man like carmel would bring a suitcase full of roses with him when fleeing to lehman cavern those who knew carmel in las vegas were even more perplexed when this fact was made public the first readers of this romance were not only puzzled and perplexed but petulant since they knew carmel had loaded his briefcase with maldonados money not with roses the explanation as is usually the case when seeming magick has occurred was simple carmel was the victim of the oldest swindle in the world the okkana borra gypsy switch it was his custom to transport his earnings to the bank in the same suitcase which he used when looting maldonados safe his figure and the suitcase were well known to the shadier elements in las vegas and among these were three gentlemen who decided early in april to intercept him during one of his journeys and remove the suitcase from his possession using as young people say any means necessary they even considered striking him upon the temple with a blunt instrument one of the gentlemen involved in this project john wayne malatesta however had a sense of humor of sorts and began to devise a plan involving a nonviolent gypsy switch mr malatesta thought it would be amusing if this could be carried off smoothly and carmel arriving at the bank opened a case full of horse manure human excrement or something else in equally dubious taste the other two gentlemen were persuaded that this might indeed be worth a laugh a substitute suitcase was purchased and a plan was devised two changes were made at virtually the last minute mr malatesta learned from bonnie quint a lady whose company he often enjoyed at a throw that carmel suffered acutely from rose fever a more hilarious image occurred to him carmel opening the case in the bank and starting to sneeze spasmodically while trying to figure out where the switch had been made the roses were purchased and the caper was set for the next day when carmel dr naismith and markoff chaney collided malatesta and his associates abandoned the switch idea two collisions in a few minutes would be more than a man like carmel would accept without profound suspicion they therefore decided to follow him to his house and revert to the more oldfashioned but timeproven technique of the sudden rap on the skull when bonnie quint left after her violent interview with carmel the bandits prepared to enter to their amazement carmel came running out threw his suitcase into his jeep and then ran back in he had forgotten his candies its gods will malatesta said piously the switch was made and they took off for points south in a great hurry several weeks after the crisis had passed a state trooper found a car with three dead men in it off the road in a ditch his own symptoms were selfdiagnosed while he waited for the coroners crew to arrive and he received the antidote in time the empty suitcase in the car caused only minor speculation a gila monster had obviously eaten most of one side of it to shreds whatever they had in there the trooper said later must have been pretty light the wind blew it all over the freaking desert appendix teth hagbards booklet after prolonged pleading and vehement prayers of entreaty the authors finally prevailed upon hagbard celine to allow us to quote some further illuminating passages from his booklet never whistle while youre pissing before we made these frantic efforts he wanted us to publish the whole thing the title he informs us is taken from r h blythes zen in english literature and oriental classics the story is instructive blythe studying zazen sitting zen or dhyana meditation in a monastery at kyoto asked the roshi zen master if there was any further discipline he should adopt to accelerate his progress the roshi replied concisely never whistle while youre pissing cf gurdjieffs endless diatribes about concentration the rajah in huxleys island who unleashed talking mynah birds to remind his citizens constantly here and now boys here and now and jesus whatever thy hand findest to do do it with all thy heart here then are some of the keys to the strange head of hagbard celine i once overheard two botanists arguing over a damned thing that had blasphemously sprouted in a college yard one claimed that the damned thing was a tree and the other claimed that it was a shrub they each had good scholarly arguments and they were still debating when i left them the world is forever spawning damned things things that are neither tree nor shrub fish nor fowl black nor white and the categorical thinker can only regard the spiky and buzzing world of sensory fact as a profound insult to his cardindex system of classifications worst of all are the facts which violate common sense that dreary bog of sullen prejudice and muddy inertia the whole history of science is the odyssey of a pixilated cardindexer perpetually sailing between such damned things and desperately juggling his classifications to fit them in just as the history of politics is the futile epic of a long series of attempts to line up the damned things and cajole them to march in regiment every ideology is a mental murder a reduction of dynamic living processes to static classifications and every classification is a damnation just as every inclusion is an exclusion in a busy buzzing universe where no two snowflakes are identical and no two trees are identical and no two people are identicaland indeed the smallest subatomic particle we are assured is not even identical with itself from one microsecond to the next every cardindex system is a selfdelusion or to put it more charitably as nietzsche says we are all better artists than we realize it is easy to see that the label jew was a damnation in nazi germany but actually the label jew is a damnation anywhere even where antisemitism does not exist he is a jew he is a doctor and he is a poet mean to the cardindexing center of the cortex that my experience with him will be like my experience with other jews other doctors and other poets thus individuality is ignored when identity is asserted at a party or any place where strangers meet watch this mechanism in action behind the friendly overtures there is wariness as each person fishes for the label that will identify and damn the other finally it is revealed oh hes an advertising copywriter oh hes an enginelathe operator both parties relax for now they know how to behave what roles to play in the game ninetynine percent of each has been damned the other is reacting to the percent that has been labeled by the cardindex machine certain damnations are socially and intellectually necessary of course a custard pie thrown in a comedians face is damned by the physicist who analyzes it according to the newtonian laws of motion these equations tell us all we want to know about the impact of the pie on the face but nothing about the human meaning of the piethrowing a cultural anthropologist analyzing the social function of the comedian as shaman court jester and kings surrogate explains the piethrowing as a survival of the feast of fools and the killing of the kings double this damns the subject in another way a psychoanalyst finding an oedipal castration ritual here has performed a third damnation and the marxist seeing an outlet for the workers repressed rage against the bosses performs a fourth each damnation has its values and its uses but it is nonetheless a damnation unless its partial and arbitrary nature is recognized the poet who compares the pie in the comedians face with the decline of the west or his own lost love commits a fifth damnation but in this case the game element and whimsicality of the symbolism are safely obvious at least one would hope so reading the new critics occasionally raises doubts on this point human society can be structured either according to the principle of authority or according to the principle of liberty authority is a static social configuration in which people act as superiors and inferiors a sadomasochistic relationship liberty is a dynamic social configuration in which people act as equals an erotic relationship in every interaction between people either authority or liberty is the dominant factor families churches lodges clubs and corporations are either more authoritarian than libertarian or more libertarian than authoritarian it becomes obvious as we proceed that the most pugnacious and intolerant form of authority is the state which even today dares to assume an absolutism which the church itself has long ago surrendered and to enforce obedience with the techniques of the churchs old and shameful inquisition every form of authoritarianism is however a small state even if it has a membership of only two freuds remark to the effect that the delusion of one man is neurosis and the delusion of many men is religion can be generalized the authoritarianism of one man is crime and the authoritarianism of many men is the state benjamin tucker wrote quite accurately aggression is simply another name for government aggression invasion government are interchangeable terms the essence of government is control or the attempt to control he who attempts to control another is a governor an aggressor an invader and the nature of such invasion is not changed whether it be made by one man upon another man after the manner of the ordinary criminal or by one man upon all other men after the manner of an absolute monarch or by all other men upon one man after the manner of a modern democracy tuckers use of the word invasion is remarkably precise considering that he wrote more than fifty years before the basic discoveries of ethology every act of authority is in fact an invasion of the psychic and physical territory of another every fact of science was once damned every invention was considered impossible every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly the entire web of culture and progress everything on earth that is manmade and not given to us by nature is the concrete manifestation of some mans refusal to bow to authority we would own no more know no more and be no more than the first apelike hominids if it were not for the rebellious the recalcitrant and the intransigent as oscar wilde truly said disobedience was mans original virtue the human brain which loves to read descriptions of itself as the universes most marvelous organ of perception is an even more marvelous organ of rejection the naked facts of our economic game are easily discoverable and undeniable once stated but conservatives who are usually individuals who profit every day of their lives from these facts manage to remain oblivious to them or to see them through a very rosytinted and distorting lens similarly the revolutionary ignores the total testimony of history about the natural course of revolution through violence to chaos back to the starting point we must remember that thought is abstraction in einsteins metaphor the relationship between a physical fact and our mental reception of that fact is not like the relationship between beef and beefbroth a simple matter of extraction and condensation rather as einstein goes on it is like the relationship between our overcoat and the ticket given us when we check our overcoat in other words human perception involves coding even more than crude sensing the mesh of language or of mathematics or of a school of art or of any system of human abstracting gives to our mental constructs the structure not of the original fact but of the symbol system into which it is coded just as a mapmaker colors a nation purple not because it is purple but because his code demands it but every code excludes certain things blurs other things and overemphasizes still other things nijinskis celebrated leap through the window at the climax of le spectre dune rose is best coded in the ballet notation system used by choreographers verbal language falters badly in attempting to convey it painting or sculpture could capture totally the magic of one instant but one instant only of it the physicists equation force mass x acceleration highlights one aspect of it missed by all these other codes but loses everything else about it every perceptionis influenced formed and structured by the habitual coding habits mental game habits of the perceiver all authority is a function of coding of game rules men have arisen again and again armed with pitchforks to fight armies with cannon men have also submitted docilely to the weakest and most tottery oppressors it all depends on the extent to which coding distorts perception and conditions the physical and mental reflexes it seems at first glance that authority could not exist at all if all men were cowards or if no men were cowards but flourishes as it does only because most men are cowards and some men are thieves actually the inner dynamics of cowardice and submission on the one hand and of heroism and rebellion on the other are seldom consciously realized either by the ruling class or the servile class submission is identified not with cowardice but with virtue rebellion not with heroism but with evil to the roman slaveowners spartacus was not a hero and the obedient slaves were not cowards spartacus was a villain and the obedient slaves were virtuous the obedient slaves believed this also the obedient always think of themselves as virtuous rather than cowardly if authority implies submission liberation implies equality authority exists when one man obeys another and liberty exists when men do not obey other men thus to say that authority exists is to say that class and caste exist that submission and inequality exist to say that liberty exists is to say that classlessness exists to say that brotherhood and equality exist authority by dividing men into classes creates dichotomy disruption hostility fear disunion liberty by placing men on an equal footing creates assocation amalgamation union security when the relationships between men are based on authority and coercion they are driven apart when based on liberty and nonaggression they are drawn together there facts are selfevident and axiomatic if authoritarianism did not possess the inbuilt preprogrammed doublebind structure of a game without end men would long ago have rejected it and embraced libertarianism the usual pacifist complaint about war that young men are led to death by old men who sit at home manning bureaucrats desks and taking no risks themselves misses the point entirely demands that the old should be drafted to fight their own wars or that the leaders of the waning nations should be sent to the front lines on the first day of battle etc are aimed at an assumed sense of justice that simply does not exist to the typical submissive citizen of authoritarian society it is normal obvious and natural that he should obey older and more dominant males even at the risk of his life even against his own kindred and even in causes that are unjust or absurd the charge of the light brigadethe story of a group of young males led to their death in a palpably idiotic situation and only because they obeyed a senseless order without stopping to thinkhas been and remains a popular poem because unthinking obedience by young males to older males is the most highly prized of all conditioned reflexes within human and hominid societies the mechanism by which authority and submission are implanted in the human mind is coding of perception that which fits into the code is accepted all else is damned it is damned to being ignored brushed aside unnoticed and if these fail it is damned to being forgotten a worse form of damnation is reserved for those things which cannot be ignored these are daubed with the brains projected prejudices until encrusted beyond recognition they are capable of being fitted into the system classified cardindexed buried this is what happens to every damned thing which is too prickly and sticky to be excommunicated entirely as josiah warren remarked it is dangerous to understand new things too quickly almost always we have not understood them we have murdered them and mummified their corpses a monopoly on the means of communication may define a ruling elite more precisely man the celebrated marxian formula of monopoly on the means of production since man extends his nervous system through channels of communication like the written word the telephone radio etc he who controls these media controls part of the nervous system of every member of society the contents of these media become part of the contents of every individuals brain thus in preliterate societies taboos on the spoken word are more numerous and more draconic than at any more complex level of social organization with the invention of written speechhieroglyphic ideographic or alphabetical the taboos are shifted to this medium there is less concern with what people say and more concern with what they write some of the first societies to achieve literacy such as egypt and the mayan culture of ancient mexico evidently kept a knowledge of their hieroglyphs a religious secret which only the higher orders of the priestly and royal families were allowed to share the same process repeats endlessly each step forward in the technology of communication is more heavily tabooed than the earlier steps thus in america today postlenny bruce one seldom hears of convictions for spoken blasphemy or obscenity prosecution of books still continues but higher courts increasingly interpret the laws in a liberal fashion and most writers feel fairly confident that they can publish virtually anything movies are growing almost as desacralized as books although the fight is still heated in this area television the newest medium remains encased in neolithic taboo when the tv pundits committed lese majeste after an address by the then dominant male a certain richard nixon one of his lieutenants quickly informed them they had overstepped and the whole tribe except for the dissident minority cheered for the reasertion of tradition when a more efficient medium arrives the taboos on television will decrease appendix mem certain questions that may still trouble some readers what was mama sutras reading where danny pricefixer questioned her actually all about answer it had nothing to do with the john f kennedy assassination the confrontation bombing the illuminati or any of the subjects it seemed to suggest except indirectly she had aimed in the dark and picked up bits and pieces of the old movie manhattan melodrama thusly district attorney wade does not refer to the dallas official who first proclaimed lee harvey oswalds guilt over tv it refers to the character played by william powell in the movie clark does not refer to any of the captain clarks we have encountered it refers to clark gable mr powells costar the ship is sinking does not refer to the illuminati spiderships or the ship piloted by captain clark it refers to the general slocum as mama guessed the sinking of this ship on june is the first scene in the movie does not refer to the dates of oswalds and kennedys assassinations or to the old wobbly address it refers to a scene in the film where gable at a racetrack walks from box to box box is never shown his body being between it and the camera if i cant live as i please let me die when i choose is the last line spoken by clark gable in the screenplay the fact that these phrases overlap certain themes in this novel and in joyces ulysses is either coincidence or synchronicity take your choice manhattan melodrama you might be interested to know was playing at the biograph theatre on the night of july and was the last film seen by the man who was shot outside and identified as john herbert dillinger what was the masonic signal of distress used by the grocer b f morgan when dillinger tried to rob him in answer it consists in holding your arms outward bent upward degrees at the elbow and shouting will nobody help the widows son is there really a secret passage beneath the meditation room in the un building answer if so we havent been able to find it other spooky secrets about that room however are revealed in the cult of the allseeing eye by robert keith spencer christian book club of america what was the erotion of adam weishaupt mentioned by hagbard in the first trip answer the word translates loosely as lovein and the idea is basically the same see the books of nesta webster and john robison cited in the text now do you believe in a conspiracy did al capone really help the fbi set up the man who was shot at the biograph theatre on july answer thats one of the more plausible arguments in dillinger dead or alive by jay nash and ron offen if no animals were reported missing from local zoos how is that robert simpson of kansas city was found dead with his throat torn as if by the talons of some enormous beast answer see the sequel the homing pigeons if simon moon majored in mathematics and was so obsessed with numerology why didnt he ever notice the most significant in mathematical historythe definitions that open euclid s geometry answer perhaps for the same reason that the road from dayton ohio to new lebanon ohio was due east when joe malik drove it on june but has always been due west on every day before and since then or maybe by the same processes that allowed joe to see a salem commercial on his tv set in the mids although cigarette advertising was banned from television in did smiling jim trepomena achieve the fame he had sought answer no dr vulcan trolls definitive history of the great quake when a state dies mentions on page that no american eagle has since been reported

william carlos williams the bishops came to new jersey in having left salem massachusetts in under something of a cloud folks in the nutleycliftonpassaicpaterson area always have a good word for the bishops though but the dorns were all troublemakers and georges paternal grandfather big bill dora was so indiscreet as to get killed by cops during the paterson silkmill strike of heracleitus he was

girls once cajoled a hollywood character actor into calling him on the phone and pretending to be a researcher for the kinsey institute seeking an interview carmel couldnt see any money in it and was trying to end the conversation when the actor asked stuffily well all we want to know actually is do you have intercourse with your mother regularly or does everybody in las vegas call you carmel the

rantings were taken seriously in certain places especially among some leftwardleaning fellow scientists but the vicepresident described them to the press as the despondent demagogy of a paranoid pedant a sample of the mans delusions from a letter to the three top television networks never quoted on newscasts because it was too controversial the boast of the th century was its conquest of these accursed plagues that attack men women and helpless infants indifferently what shall be said of the th century which has recreated them at great expense and through the efforts of thousands of brilliant but perverted scientific minds and then stored them live in installations throughout the country where it is virtually certain statistically that an accident will unleash them upon an unsuspecting public sooner or later loonies often harbor morbid fears of that sort the poor man never responded favorably to any of the efforts of his psychiatrists even though they gave him ect

choices of a liberalarts curriculum at columbia he had an adventure with talking dolphins before george did which set up a psychic resonance that made georges recruitment interesting to hagbard this story is recounted in tales of the cthulhu mythos edited by august derleth arkham house markoff chaney he slipped away from saul and barney shortly after they returned to las vegas and none of our characters ever saw him again however one day in hagbard celine using an alias and engaged in nefarious business happened to be in the us government printing office on capitol street in washington and noticed a bundle of pamphlets that had been stamped with both blue top secret authorized personnel only and red for immediate release to all media many loyal government servants would have headaches before it was ever clarified who had been responsible for which of those stampsif indeed that ever could be clarified hagbard recalled much that saul had told him about the las vegas caper and looked around thoughtfully in one corner he saw a large coffee urn he lit one of his long black cigars and strolled out into the street the sun was bright the air was clear and it was spring which may explain why hagbard began whistling as he walked with a brisk and determined pace toward the senate office building the tune was my hearts in the highlands
