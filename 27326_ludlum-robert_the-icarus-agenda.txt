the icarus agenda prologue the silhouetted figure in the doorway rushed into the dark windowless room he closed the door and by rote quickly made his way across the spotless black vinyl floor to a brass table lamp on his left he switched on the light the lowwattage bulb creating shadows throughout the confined panelled study the room was small and confining but not without ornamentation the objets dart however were neither from antiquity nor from the progressive stages of historical artistry instead they represented the most contemporary equipment of high technology the right wall glistened with the reflection of stainless steel and the quiet whirr of a dustinhibiting dustremoving airconditioning unit ensured pristine cleanliness the owner and sole occupant of this room crossed to a chair in front of a computerdriven word processor and sat down he turned on a switch the screen came alive and he typed in a code instantly the bright green letters responded ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the figure hunched over the keyboard his anxiety at fever pitch and proceeded to enter his data i start this journal now for the events that follow i believe will alter the course of a nation a man has come from seemingly nowhere like an artless messiah without an inkling of his calling or his destiny he is marked for things beyond his understanding and if my projections are accurate this will be a record of his journey i can only imagine how it began but i know it began in chaos the icarus agenda chapter masqat oman southwest asia tuesday august pm the angry waters of the oman gulf were a prelude to the storm racing down through the strait of hormuz into the arabian sea it was sundown marked by the strident prayers nasally intoned by bearded muezzins in the minarets of the port citys mosques the sky was darkening under the black thunderheads that swirled ominously across the lesser darkness of evening like roving behemoths blankets of heat lightning sporadically fired the eastern horizon over the makran mountains of turbat two hundred miles across the sea in pakistan to the north beyond the borders of afghanistan a senseless brutal war continued to the west an even more senseless war raged fought by children led to their deaths by the diseased madman in iran intent on spreading his malignancy and to the south there was lebanon where men killed without compunction each faction with religious fervour calling the others terrorists when allwithout exceptionindulged in barbaric terrorism the middle east especially southwest asia was on fire and where the fires had previously been repelled they were no longer as the waters of the gulf of oman furiously churned this early evening and the skies promised a sweep of ravage the streets of masqat the capital of the sultanate of oman matched the approaching storm the prayers over the crowds again converged with flaming torches streaming out of side streets and alleyways a column of hysterical protest the target the floodlit iron gates of the american embassy the facade of pink stucco beyond was patrolled by scrubby longhaired children awkwardly gripping automatic weapons the trigger meant death but in their wildeyed zealotry they could not make the connection with that finality they were told there was no such thing as death no matter what their eyes might tell them the rewards of martyrdom where everything the more painful the sacrifice the more glorious the martyrthe pain of their enemies meant nothing blindness madness it was the twentysecond day of this insanity twentyone days since the civilized world had been forced once again to accept the dreary fact of incoherent fury masqats fanatical ground swell had burst from nowhere and now was suddenly everywhere and no one knew why no one except the analysts of the darker arts of brush fire insurrections those men and women who spent their days and nights probing dissecting finally perceiving the roots of orchestrated revolt for the key was orchestrated who why what do they really want and how do we stop them facts two hundred and fortyseven americans had been rounded up under guns and taken hostage eleven had been killed their corpses thrown out of the embassy windows each body accompanied by shattering glass each death via a different window someone had told these children how to emphasize each execution with a jolting surprise wagers were excitedly made beyond the iron gates by shrieking maniacal betters mesmerized by blood which window was next would the corpse be a man or a woman how much is your judgment worth how much bet above on the open roof was the luxurious embassy pool behind an arabic latticework not meant for protection against bullets it was around that pool that the hostages knelt in rows as wandering groups of killers aimed machine pistols at their heads two hundred and thirtysix frightened exhausted americans awaiting execution madness decisions despite wellintentioned israeli offers keep them out this was not entebbe and all their expertise notwithstanding the blood israel had shed in lebanon would in arab eyes label any attempt an abomination the united states had financed terrorists to fight terrorists unacceptable a rapid deployment strike force who could scale four storeys or drop down from helicopters to the roof and stop the executions when the executioners were only too willing to die as martyrs a naval blockade with a battalion of marines prepared for an invasion of oman beyond a show of overpowering might to what purpose the sultan and his ruling ministers were the last people on earth who wanted this violence at the embassy the peacefullyoriented royal police tried to contain the hysteria but they were no match for the roving wild bands of agitators years of quiescence in the city had not prepared them for such chaos and to recall the royal military from the yemenite borders could lead to unthinkable problems the armed forces patrolling that festering sanctuary for international killers were as savage as their enemies beyond the inevitable fact that with their return to the capital the borders would collapse in carnage blood would surely flow through the streets of masqat and the gutters choke with the innocent and the guilty checkmate solutions give in to the stated demands impossible and well understood by those responsible though not by their puppets the children who believed what they chanted what they screamed there was no way governments throughout europe and the middle east would release over terrorists from such organizations as the brigate rosse and the plo the baader meinhof the ira and scores of their squabbling sordid offspring continue to tolerate the endless coverage the probing cameras and reams of copy that riveted the worlds attention on the publicityhungry fanatics why not the constant exposure no doubt kept additional hostages from being killed since the executions had been temporarily suspended so that the oppressor nations could ponder their choices to end the news coverage would only inflame the wildeyed seekers of martyrdom silence would create the need for shock shock was newsworthy and killing was the ultimate shock who what how who that was the essential question whose answer would lead to a solutiona solution that had to be found within five days the executions had been suspended for a week and two days had passed frantically chewed up as the most knowledgeable leaders of the intelligence services from six nations gathered in london all had arrived on supersonic aircraft within hours of the decision to pool resources for each knew its own embassy might be next somewhere they had worked without rest for fortyeight hours results oman remained an enigma it had been considered a rock of stability in southwest asia a sultanate with educated enlightened leadership as close to representative government as a divine family of islam could permit the rulers were from a privileged household that apparently respected what allah had given themnot merely as a birthright but as a responsibility in the last half of the twentieth century conclusions the insurrection had been externally programmed no more than twenty of the two hundredodd unkempt shrieking youngsters had been specifically identified as omanis therefore covert operations officers with sources in every extremist faction in the mediterraneanarabian axis went instantly to work pulling in contacts bribing threatening who are they aziz theres only a spitful from oman and most of those are considered simpleminded come on aziz live like a sultan name an outrageous price try me six seconds mahmet six seconds and your right hand is on the floor without a wrist next goes your left were on countdown thief give me the information six five four blood nothing zero madness and then a breakthrough it came from an ancient muezzin a holy man whose words and memory were as shaky as his gaunt frame might be in the winds now racing down from hormuz do not look where you would logically expect to look search elsewhere where where grievances are not born of poverty or abandonment where allah has bestowed favour in this world although perhaps not in the after one be clearer please most revered muezzin allah does not will such clarificationhis will be done perhaps he does not take sidesso be it but surely you must have a reason for saying what youre saying as allah has given me that reasonhis will be done hows that again quiet rumours heard in the corners of the mosque whispers these old ears were meant to hear i hear so little i should not have heard them had allah not willed it so there must be more the whispers speak of those who will benefit from the bloodshed who no names are spoken of no men of consequence mentioned any group or organization please a sect a country a people the shiites the saudis iraqi irani the soviets no neither believers nor unbelievers are talked of only they they that is what i hear whispered in the dark corners of the mosque what allah wants me to hearmay his will be done only the word they can you identify any of those you heard i am nearly blind and there is always very little light when these few among so many worshippers speak i can identify no one i only know that i must convey what i hear for it is the will of allah why muezzin murdenis why is it allahs will the bloodshed must stop the koran says that when blood is spilled and justified by impassioned youth the passions must be examined for youth forget it well send a couple of men back into the mosque with you signal us when you hear something in a month ya shaikh i am about to undertake my final pilgrimage to mecca you are merely part of my journey it is the will of goddamn it it is your god ya shaikh not mine not ours the icarus agenda chapter washington dc wednesday august am the noonday sun beat down on the capitals pavement the midsummers air was still with the oppressive heat pedestrians walked with uncomfortable determination mens collars open ties loosened briefcases and bags hung like dead weights while their owners stood impassively at intersections waiting for the lights to change although scores of men and womenby and large servants of the government and therefore of the peoplemay have had urgent matters on their minds urgency was difficult to summon in the streets a torpid blanket had descended over the city numbing those who ventured outside airconditioned rooms and offices and cars a traffic accident had taken place at the corner of twentythird street and virginia avenue it was not major in terms of damage or injury but it was far from minor where tempers were concerned a taxi had collided with a government car emerging from an underground parking ramp of the state department both driversrighteous hot and fearing their superiorsstood by their vehicles accusing each other yelling in the blistering heat while awaiting the police who had been summoned by a passing government employee within moments the traffic was congested horns blared and angry shouts came from reluctantly opened windows the passenger in the cab climbed impatiently out of the back seat he was a tall slender man in his early forties and seemed out of place in surroundings that included summer suits neat print dresses and attaché cases he wore a pair of rumpled khaki trousers boots and a soiled cotton safari jacket that took the place of a shirt the effect was of a man who did not belong in the city a professional guide perhaps who had strayed out of the higher and wilder mountains yet his face belied his clothes it was cleanshaven his features sharp and clearly defined his light blue eyes aware squinting darting about and assessing the situation as he made his decision he put his hand on the argumentative drivers shoulder the man whipped around and the passenger gave him two bills i have to leave said the fare hey come on mister you saw that son of a bitch pulled out with no horn no nothing im sorry i wouldnt be able to help you i didnt see or hear anything until the collision oh boy big john q he dont see and he dont hear dont get involved huh im involved replied the passenger quietly taking a third bill and shoving it into the drivers top jacket pocket but not here the oddlydressed man dodged through the gathering crowd and started down the block towards third streettowards the imposing glass doors of the state department he was the only person running on the pavement the designated situation room in the underground complex at the department of state was labelled ohiofourzero translated it meant oman maximum alert beyond the metal door rows of computers clacked incessantly and every now and then a machinehaving instantaneously crosschecked with the central data bankemitted a short highpitched signal announcing new or previously unreported information intense men and women studied the printouts trying to evaluate what they read nothing zero madness inside that large energized room was another metal door smaller than the entrance and with no access to the corridor it was the office of the senior official in charge of the masqat crisis at arms length was a telephone console with links to every seat of power and every source of information in washington the current proprietor was a middleaged deputy director of consular operations the state departments little known arm of covert activities his name was frank swann and at the momenta high noon that held no sunlight for himhis head with its prematurely grey hair lay on his folded arms on the top of the desk he had not had a nights sleep for nearly a week making do with only such naps as this one the consoles sharp hum jarred him awake his right hand shot out he punched the lighted button and picked up the phone yes what is it swann shook his head and swallowed air only partially relieved that the caller was his secretary five storeys above he listened then spoke wearily who congressman a congressman the last thing i need is a congressman how the hell did he get my name never mind spare me tell him im in conferencewith god if you likeor go one better and say with the secretary ive prepared him for something like that its why im calling from your office i told him i could only reach you on this phone swann blinked thats going some distance for my praetorian guard ivytheterrible why so far ivy its what he said frank and also what i had to write down because i couldnt understand him lets have both he said his business concerned the problem youre involved with nobody knows what imforget it what else i wrote it down phonetically he asked me to say the following ma efham zain does that make any sense to you frank stunned deputy director swann again shook his head trying to clear his mind further but needing no further clearance for the visitor five floors above the unknown congressman had just implied in arabic that he might be of help get a guard and send him down here swann said seven minutes later the door of the office in the underground complex was opened by a marine sergeant the visitor walked in nodding to his escort as the guard closed the door swann rose from his desk apprehensively the congressman hardly lived up to the image of any member of the house of representatives he had ever seenat least in washington he was dressed in boots khaki trousers and a summer hunting jacket that had taken too much abuse from the spattering of campfire frying pans was he an illtimed joke congressman said the deputy director his voice trailing off for want of a name as he extended his hand evan kendrick mr swann replied the visitor approaching the desk and shaking hands im the first term man from colorados ninth district yes of course colorados ninth im sorry i didnt no apologies are necessary except perhaps from mefor the way i look theres no reason for you to know who i am let me add something here interrupted swann pointedly theres also no reason for you to know who i am congressman i understand that but it wasnt very difficult even newlyarrived representatives have accessat least the secretary i inherited does i knew where to look over here i just needed to refine the prospects someone in states consular operations thats not a household name mr kendrick interrupted swann again again with emphasis in my house it was oncebriefly anyway i wasnt just looking for a middle east hand but an expert in southwest arab affairs someone who knew the language and a dozen dialects fluently the man i wanted would have to be someone like that you were there mr swann youve been busy so have you said the congressman nodding his head at the door and the huge outer office with the banks of computers i assume you understood my message or else i wouldnt be here yes agreed the deputy director you said you might be able to help is that true i dont know i only knew i had to offer offer on what basis may i sit down please im not trying to be rude im just tired kendrick sat down swann did the same looking strangely at the freshman politician go ahead congressman times valuable every minute and weve been concerned with this problem as you described it to my secretary for a few long hairy weeks now i dont know what youve got to say or whether its relevant or not but if it is id like to know why its taken you so long to get here i hadnt heard anything about the events over in oman about whats happenedwhats happening thats damn near impossible to believe is the congressman from colorados ninth district spending the house recess at a benedictine retreat not exactly or is it possible that a new ambitious congressman who speaks some arabic went on swann rapidly quietly unpleasantly elaborates on a few cloakroom rumours about a certain section over here and decides to insert himself for a little political mileage down the road it wouldnt be the first time kendrick sat motionless in the chair his face without expression but not his eyes they were at once observant and angry thats offensive he said im easily offended under the circumstances eleven of our people have been killed mister including three women two hundred and thirtysix others are waiting to get their heads blown off and i ask you if you can really help and you tell me you dont know but you have to offer to me that has the sound of a hissing snake so i watch my step you walk in here with a language you probably learned making big bucks with some oil company and figure that entitles you to special considerationmaybe youre a consultant it has a nice ring to it a freshman pol is suddenly a consultant to the state department during a national crisis whichever way it goes you win thatd lift a few hats in colorados ninth district wouldnt it i imagine it would if anyone knew about it what once again the deputy director stared at the congressman not so much in irritation now but because of something else did he know him youre under a lot of stress so i wont add to it but if what youre thinking is a barrier lets get over it if you decide i might be of some value to you the only way id agree is with a written guarantee of anonymity no other way no ones to know ive been here i never talked to you or anyone else nonplussed swann leaned back in his chair and brought his hand to his chin i do know you he said softly weve never met say what you want to say congressman start somewhere ill start eight hours ago began kendrick ive been riding the colorado white water into arizona for almost a monththats the benedictine retreat you conjured up for the congressional recess i passed through lava falls and reached a base camp there were people there of course and it was the first time id heard a radio in nearly four weeks four weeks repeated swann youve been out of touch all that time do you do this sort of thing often pretty much every year answered kendrick its become kind of a ritual he added quietly i go alone its not pertinent some politician said the deputy absently picking up a pencil you can forget the world congressman but you still have a constituency no politician replied evan kendrick permitting himself a slight smile and my constituencys an accident believe me anyway i heard the news and moved as fast as i could i hired a river plane to fly me to flagstaff and tried to charter a jet to washington it was too late at night too late to clear a flight plan so i flew on to phoenix and caught the earliest plane here those inflight phones are a marvel im afraid i monopolized one talking to a very experienced secretary and a number of other people i apologize for the way i look the airline provided a razor but i didnt want to take the time to go home and change clothes im here mr swann and youre the man i want to see i may be of absolutely no help to you and im sure youll tell me if im not but to repeat i had to offer while his visitor spoke the deputy had written the name kendrick on the pad in front of him actually he had written it several times underlining the name kendrick kendrick kendrick offer what he asked frowning and looking up at the odd intruder what congressman whatever i know about the area and the various factions operating over there oman the emirates bahrain qatarmasqat dubai abu dhabiup to kuwait and down to riyadh i lived in those places i worked there i know them very well you livedworkedall over the southwest map yes i spent eighteen months in masqat alone under contract to the family the sultan the late sultan he died two or three years ago i think but yes under contract to him and his ministers they were a tough group and good you had to know your business then you worked for a company said swann making a statement not asking a question yes which one mine answered the new congressman yours thats right the deputy stared at his visitor then lowered his eyes to the name he had written repeatedly on the pad in front of him good lord he said softly the kendrick group thats the connection but i didnt see it i havent heard your name in four or five yearsmaybe six you were right the first time four to be exact i knew there was something i said so yes you did but we never met you people built everything from water systems to bridgesrace tracks housing projects country clubs airfieldsthe whole thing we built what we were contracted to build i remember it was ten or twelve years ago you were the american wonder boys in the emiratesand i do mean boys dozens of you in your twenties and thirties and filled with high tech piss and vinegar not all of us were that young no interrupted swann frowning in thought you had a lateblooming secret weapon an old israeli a whiz of an architect an israeli for heavens sake who could design things in the islamic style and broke bread with every rich arab in the neighbourhood his name was emmanuel weingrassis manny weingrassand hes from garden street in the bronx in new york he went to israel to avoid legal entanglements with his second or third wife hes close to eighty now and living in paris pretty well i gather from his phone calls thats right said the deputy director you sold out to bechtel or somebody for thirty or forty million not to bechtel it was transinternational and it wasnt thirty or forty it was twentyfive they got a bargain and i got out everything was fine swann studied kendricks face especially the light blue eyes that held within them circles of enigmatic reserve the longer one stared at them no it wasnt he said softly even gently his hostility gone i do remember now there was an accident at one of your sites outside riyadha cavein caused when a faulty gas line explodedmore than seventy people were killed including your partners all your employees and some kids their kids added evan quietly all of them all their wives and children we were celebrating the completion of the third phase we were all there the crew my partnerseveryones wife and child the whole shell collapsed while they were inside and manny and i were outsideputting on some ridiculous clown costumes but there was an investigation that cleared the kendrick group completely the utility firm that serviced the site had installed inferior conduit falsely labelled as certified essentially yes thats when you packed it all in wasnt it this isnt pertinent said the congressman simply were wasting time since you know who i am or at least who i was is there anything i can do do you mind if i ask you a question i dont think its a waste of time and i think it is pertinent clearances are part of the territory and judgments have to be made i meant what i said before a lot of people on the hill continuously try to make political mileage out of us over here whats the question why are you a congressman mr kendrick with your money and professional reputation you dont need it and i cant imagine how youd benefit certainly not compared to what you could do in the private sector do all people seeking elective office do so solely for personal gain no of course not swann paused then shook his head sorry thats too glib its a stock answer to a loaded stock question yes congressman in my biased opinion most ambitious menand womenwho run for such offices do so because of the exposure and if they win the clout combined it all makes them very marketable sorry again this is a cynic talking but then ive been in this city for a long time and i see no reason to alter that judgment and you confuse me i know where you come from and ive never heard of colorados ninth district it sure as hell isnt denver its barely on the map said kendrick his voice noncommittal its at the base of the southwest rockies doing pretty much its own thing thats why i built there its off the beaten track but why why politics did the boywonder of the arab emirates find a district he could carve out for his own base a political launching pad maybe nothing could have been farther from my mind thats a statement congressman not an answer evan kendrick was momentarily silent returning swanns gaze then he shrugged his shoulders swann sensed a certain embarrassment all right he said firmly lets call it an aberration that wont happen again there was a vacuous overbearing incumbent who was lining his pockets in a district that wasnt paying attention i had time on my hands and a big mouth i also had the money to bury him im not necessarily proud of what i did or how i did it but hes gone and ill be out in two years or less by then ill have found someone better qualified to take my place two years asked swann come november itll be a year since your election correct thats right and you started serving last january so well i hate to disabuse you but your term of office is for two years youve either got one more year or three but not two or less theres no real opposition party in the ninth but to make sure the seat doesnt go to the old political machine i agreed to stand for reelectionthen resign thats some agreement its binding as far as im concerned i want out thats blunt enough but it doesnt take into account a possible side effect i dont understand you suppose during the next twentyodd months you decide you like it here what happens then its not possible and it couldnt happen mr swann lets get back to masqat its a goddamned mess or do i have sufficient clearance to make that observation youre cleared because im the one who clears the deputy director shook his grey head a goddamned mess congressman and were convinced its externally programmed i dont think theres any question about it agreed kendrick do you have any ideas a few answered the visitor wholesale destabilizations at the top of the list shut the country down and dont let anyone in a takeover asked swann a khomeinistyle putsch it wouldnt work the situations different theres no peacock no festering resentments no savak swann paused adding pensively no shah with an army of thieves and no ayatollah with an army of fanatics its not the same i didnt mean to imply that it was omans only the beginning whoever it is doesnt want to take over the country heor theysimply want to stop others from taking the money what what money billions longrange projects that are on drafting boards everywhere in the persian gulf saudi arabia and all of southwest asia the only stable areas in that part of the world whats happening over there now isnt much different from tying up the transport and the construction trades over here or shutting down the piers in new york and new orleans los angeles and san francisco nothings legitimized by strikes or collective bargainingtheres just terror and the threats of more terror provided by whippedup fanatics and everything stops the people at the drafting boards and those in the field on surveying teams and in equipment compounds just want to get out as fast as they can and once theyre out added swann quickly those behind the terrorists move in and the terror stops it just goes away christ it sounds like a waterfront mafia operation arabic style said kendrick to use your words it wouldnt be the first time you know that for a fact yes our company was threatened a number of times but to quote you again we had a secret weapon emmanuel weingrass weingrass what the hell could he do lie with extraordinary conviction one moment he was a reserve general in the israeli army who could call an air strike on any arab group who harassed or replaced us and the next he was a highranking member of the mossad who would send out death squads eliminating even those who warned us like many ageing men of genius manny was frequently eccentric and almost always theatrical he enjoyed himself unfortunately his various wives rarely enjoyed him for very long at any rate no one wanted to tangle with a crazy israeli the tactics were too familiar are you suggesting we recruit him asked the deputy director no apart from his age hes winding up his life in paris with the most beautiful women he can hire and certainly with the most expensive brandy he can find he couldnt help but theres something you can do whats that listen to me kendrick leaned forward ive been thinking about this for the past eight hours and with every hour im more convinced its a possible explanation the problem is that there are so few factsalmost none reallybut a patterns there and its consistent with things we heard five years ago what things what pattern only rumours to begin with then came the threats and they were threats no one was kidding go on im listening while defusing those threats in his own way usually with prohibited whisky weingrass heard something that made too much sense to be dismissed as drunken babbling he was told that a consortium was silently being formedan industrial cartel if you like it was quietly gaining control of dozens of different companies with growing resources in personnel technology and equipment the objective was obvious then and if the informations accurate even more obvious now they intend to take over the industrial development of southwest asia as far as weingrass could learn this underground federation was based in bahrainnothing surprising therebut what came as a shocker and amused the hell out of manny was the fact that among the unknown board of directors was a man who called himself the mahdilike the muslim fanatic who threw the british out of khartoum a hundred years ago the mahdi khartoum exactly the symbols obvious except this new mahdi doesnt give a damn about religious islam much less its screaming fanatics hes using them to drive the competition out and keep it out he wants the contracts and the profits in arab handsspecifically his hands wait a minute swann interrupted thoughtfully as he picked up his phone and touched a button on the console this ties in with something that came from mi in masqat last night he continued quickly looking at kendrick we couldnt follow it up because there wasnt anything to follow no trail but it sure as hell made wild reading get me gerald bryce please hello gerry last nightactually around two oclock this morningwe got a nothingzero from the brits in ohio i want you to find it and read it to me slowly because ill be writing down every word the deputy covered the mouthpiece and spoke to his suddenly alert visitor if anything youve said makes any sense at all it may be the first concrete breakthrough weve had thats why im here mr swann probably reeking of smoked fish the deputy director nodded aimlessly impatiently waiting for the man he had called bryce to return to the phone a shower wouldnt hurt congressman yes gerry go ahead do not look where you would logically expect to look search elsewhere yes ive got that i remember that it was right after i think where grievances are not born of poverty or abandonment thats it and something else right around there where allah has bestowed favour in this world although perhaps not in the after one yes now go down a bit something about whispers thats all i remember there thats it give it to me again the whispers speak of those who will benefit from the bloodshed okay gerry thats what i needed the rest was all negative if i recall no names no organizations just crap thats what i thought i dont know yet if anything breaks youll be the first to know in the meantime oil up the equipment and work on a printout of all the construction firms in bahrain and if theres a listing for what we call general or industrial contractors i want that too when yesterday for gods sake swann hung up the phone looked down at the phrases he had written and then up at kendrick you heard the words congressman do you want me to repeat them its not necessary theyre not kalamfaregh are they no mr kendrick none of its garbage its all very pertinent and i wish to hell i knew what to do recruit me mr swann said the congressman send me to masqat on the fastest transport you can find why asked the deputy studying his visitor what can you do that our own experienced men in the field cant they not only speak fluent arabic most of them are arabs and working for consular operations completed kendrick so theyre marked they were marked five years ago and theyre marked now if they make any miswired moves you could have a dozen executions on your hands thats an alarming statement said swann slowly his eyes narrowing as he looked at his visitors face theyre marked would you care to explain it i told you a few minutes ago that your cons op briefly became a household name over there you made a gratuitous remark about my elaborating on congressional rumours but i wasnt i meant what i said a household name ill go further if you like a household joke an exarmy engineer and manny weingrass even did a number on them a number im sure its in your files somewhere we were approached by husseins people to submit plans for a new airfield after wed completed one at qufar in saudi arabia the next day two of your men came to see us asking technical questions pressing the point that as americans it was our duty to relay such information since hussein frequently conferred with the sovietswhich of course was immaterial an airports an airport and any damn fool can fly over an excavation site and determine the configuration what was the number manny and the engineer told them that the two main runways were seven miles long obviously designed for very special flying equipment they ran out of the office as if both were struck by acute diarrhea and swann leaned forward the next day husseins people called and told us to forget the project wed had visitors from consular operations they didnt like that the deputy director leaned back in his chair his weary smile conveying futility sometimes its all kind of foolish isnt it i dont think its foolish now offered kendrick no of course it isnt swann instantly sat forward in his chair so the way you read it this whole goddamned thing is all about money lousy money if it isnt stopped itll get worse said kendrick much worse jesus how because its a proven formula for economic takeover once theyve crippled the government in oman theyll use the same tactics elsewhere the emirates bahrain qatar even the saudis whoever controls the fanatics gets the contracts and with all those massive operations under one entityregardless of the names they usetheres a dangerous political force in the area calling a lot of vital shots we definitely wont like good lord you have thought this out ive done nothing else for the past eight hours say i sent you over there what could you do i wont know until im there but ive got a few ideas i know a number of influential men powerful omanis who know what goes on there and who couldnt possibly be any part of this insanity for various reasonsprobably the same mistrust we felt whenever your cons op flunkies showed upthey might not talk to strangers but they will talk to me they trust me ive spent days weekends with their families i know their unveiled wives and their children unveiled wives and children repeated swann interrupting the ultimate shorbet in the arab vocabulary the broth of friendship a harmonious mixture of ingredients agreed the congressman from colorado theyll work with me perhaps not with you also im familiar with most of the suppliers on the docks and in the lading offices even people who avoid anything official because they make money out of what you cant get officially i want to trace the money and the instructions that come with the money and end up inside the embassy someone somewhere is sending both suppliers asked swann his eyebrows arched his voice incredulous you mean like food and medical supplies that kind of thing thats only are you crazy exclaimed the deputy director those hostages are our people weve opened the vaults anything they need anything we can get to them like bullets and weapons and spare parts for weapons of course not from all the accounts i read what i could get my hands on at the newsstands in flagstaff and phoenix every night after el maghreb theres four or five hours of fireworksthousands of rounds shot off whole sections of the embassy sprayed with rifle and machinegun fire its part of their goddamned terror exploded swann can you imagine what its like inside lined up against a wall under floodlights and all around you everythings being blasted with bullets thinking jesus im going to be killed any second if we ever get those poor souls out theyll be on couches for years trying to get rid of the nightmares kendrick let the emotion of the moment pass those hotheads dont have an arsenal in there mr swann i dont think the people running them would allow it theyre supplied just as the mimeograph machines are supplied because they dont know how to operate your copiers and word processors for the daily bulletins they print for the television cameras please try to understand maybe one in twenty of those crazies has a minimum intellect much less a thoughtout ideological position theyre the manipulated dregs of humanity given their own hysterical moments in the sun maybe its our fault i dont know but i do know theyre being programmed and you know it too and behind that programming is a man who wants all of southwest asia to himself this mahdi whoever he is yes you think you can find him ill need help getting out of the airport arab clothes ill make a list the deputy director again leaned back in his chair his fingers touching his chin why congressman why do you want to do this why does evan kendrick multimillionaireentrepreneur want to put his very rich life on the line theres nothing left for you over there why i suppose the simplest and most honest answer is that i might be able to help as youve pointed out i made a lot of money over there maybe this is the time to give a little of myself back if it was just money or a little of yourself id have no trouble with that said swann but if i let you go youll be walking into a minefield and no training on how to survive has that thought struck you congressman it should have i dont intend to storm the embassy answered evan kendrick you might not have to just ask the wrong person the wrong question and the results could be the same i could also be in a cab at twentythird street and virginia avenue at noontime today and be in an accident i presume that means you were the point is i wasnt driving i was in a taxi im careful mr swann and in masqat i know my way around the traffic which isnt as unpredictable as washingtons were you ever in military service no you were the right age for vietnam id guess any explanation i had a graduate school deferment it kept me out have you ever handled a gun ive had limited experience which means you know where the trigger is and which end to point i said limited not imbecilic during the early days in the emirates we kept ourselves armed at our construction sites sometimes later also ever had to fire one pressed the deputy director certainly replied kendrick his voice calm not rising to the bait so i could learn where the trigger was and which end to point very funny but what i meant was did you ever have to fire a gun at another human being is this necessary yes it is i have to make a judgment all right then yes i did when was that when were they corrected the congressman among my partners and our american crew was a geologist an equipmentlogistics man and several refugees from the army corps of engineersforeman types we made frequent trips to potential sites for soil and shale testings and to set up fenced compounds for machinery we drove a camper and on several occasions we were attacked by banditswandering nomad gangs looking for strays theyve been a problem for years and the authorities warn everyone heading into the interior to protect themselves not much different from any large city over here i used a gun then to frighten or to kill mr kendrick by and large to frighten mr swann however there were times when we had to kill they wanted to kill us we reported all such incidents to the authorities i see said the deputy director of consular operations what kind of shape are you in the visitor shook his head in exasperation i smoke an occasional cigar or a cigarette after a meal doctor and i drink moderately i do not however lift weights or run in marathons however again i do ride class five white water and backpack in the mountains whenever i can i also think this is a bunch of bullshit think what you like mr kendrick but were pressed for time simple direct questions can help us assess a person just as accurately as a convoluted psychiatric report from one of our clinics in virginia blame that on the psychiatrists tell me about it said swann with a hostile chuckle no you tell me countered the visitor your showandtell games are over do i go or dont i and if not why not swann looked up you go congressman not because youre an ideal choice but because i dont have a choice ill try anything including an arrogant son of a bitch which under that cool exterior i think you probably are youre probably right said kendrick can you give me briefing papers on whatever youve got theyll be delivered to the plane before takeoff at andrews air force base but they cant leave that plane congressman and you cant make any notes someone will be watching you understood are you sure well give you whatever deep cover help we can under severe restrictions but youre a private citizen acting on your own your political position notwithstanding in short words if youre taken by hostile elements we dont know you we cant help you then we wont risk the lives of two hundred and thirtysix hostages is that understood yes it is because its directly in line with what i made clear when i walked in here i want a written guarantee of anonymity i was never here i never saw you and i never talked to you send a memo up to the secretary of state say you had a phone call from a political ally of mine in colorado mentioning my name and telling you that with my background you should get in touch with me you rejected the approach believing it was just another politician trying to make mileage out of the state departmentthat shouldnt be difficult for you kendrick pulled out a notepad from his jacket pocket and reached over picking up swanns pencil heres the address of my attorney in washington have a copy delivered to him by messenger before i get on the plane at andrews when he tells me its there ill get on board our mutual objective here is so clear and so clean i should be congratulating myself said swann so why dont i why do i keep thinking theres something youre not telling me because youre suspicious by nature and profession you wouldnt be in that chair if you werent this secrecy youre so insistent on apparently so are you kendrick broke in ive given you my reason there are two hundred and thirtysix people out there were not about to give anyone an excuse to pull a trigger you on the other hand if you dont get killed have a lot to gain whats your reason for this secrecy not much different from yours said the visitor i made a great many friends throughout the whole area ive kept up with a lot of them we correspond they visit me frequentlyour associations are no secret if my name surfaced some zealots might consider jaremat thadr penalty for friendship translated swann the climates right for it added kendrick i suppose thats good enough said the deputy director without much conviction when do you want to leave as soon as possible theres nothing to straighten out here ill grab a cab go home and change clothes no cabs congressman from here on until you get to masqat youre listed as a government liaison under an available cover and flying military transport youre under wraps swann reached for his phone youll be escorted down to the ramp where an unmarked car will drive you home and then on to andrews for the next twelve hours youre government property and youll do what we tell you to do evan kendrick sat in the back seat of the unmarked state department car staring out of the window at the lush foliage along the potomac soon the driver would veer to the left and enter a long wooded corridor of virginia greenery five minutes from his house his isolated house he reflected his very lonely house despite a livein couple who were old friends and the discreet though not excessive procession of graceful women who shared his bed also friends four years and nothing permanent permanency for him was half a world away where nothing was permanent but the constant necessity of moving from one job to the next finding the best quarters available for everyone and making sure that tutors were available for his partners childrenchildren he wished at times were his specific children of course but for him there had never been time for marriage and children ideas were his wives projects his offspring perhaps this was why he had been the leader he had no domestic distractions the women he made love to were mostly driven like himself again like himself they sought the temporary exhilaration even the comfort of brief affairs but the operative word was temporary and then in those wonderful years there was the excitement and the laughter the hours of fear and the moments of elation when a projects results exceeded their expectations they were building an empirea small one to be surebut it would grow and in time as weingrass insisted the children of the kendrick group would go to the best schools in switzerland only a few hours away by air theyll become a boardroom of international mensch manny had roared all that fine education and all those languages were rearing the greatest collection of statesmen and stateswomen since disraeli and golda uncle manny can we go fishing a young spokesman would invariably implore wideeyed conspirators behind him of course davidsuch a glorious name the river is only a few kilometers away well all catch whales i promise you manny please one of the mothers would invariably object their homework that work is for homestudy your syntax whales are in the river all that was permanence for evan kendrick and suddenly it had all been shattered a thousand broken mirrors in the sunlight each fragment of bloody glass reflecting an image of lovely reality and wondrous expectations all the mirrors had turned black no reflections anywhere death dont do it screamed emmanuel weingrass i feel the pain as much as you but dont you see its what they want you to do expect you to do dont give themdont give himthat gratification fight them fight him i will fight with you show me your posture boy for whom manny against whom you know as well as i do were only the first others will follow other accidents loved ones killed projects abandoned you will allow that i simply dont care so you let him win who the mahdi a drunken rumour nothing more he did it he killed them i know it theres nothing here for me old friend and i cant chase shadows theres no fun any longer forget it manny ill make you rich i dont want your coward money you wont take it of course ill take it i simply dont love you any more then four years of anxiety futility and boredom wondering when the warm wind of love or the cold wind of hate would blow across the smouldering coals inside him he had told himself over and over again that when the fires suddenly erupted for whatever reason the time would be right and he would be ready he was ready now and no one could stop him hate the mahdi you took the lives of my closest friends as surely as if you had installed that conduit yourself i had to identify so many bodies the broken twisted bleeding bodies of the people who meant so much to me the hatred remains and its deep and cold and wont go away and let me live my life until youre dead i have to go back and pick up the pieces be my own self again and finish what all of us were building together manny was right i ran away forgiving myself because of the pain forgetting the dreams we had ill go back and finish now im coming after you mahdi whoever you are wherever you are and no one will know i was there sir sir were here i beg your pardon this is your house said the marine driver i guess you were catching a nap but we have a schedule to keep no nap corporal but of course youre right kendrick gripped the handle and opened the door ill only be twenty minutes or so why dont you come in the maidll get you a snack or a cup of coffee while you wait i wouldnt get out of this car sir why not youre with ohio id probably get shot stunned and halfway out of the door evan kendrick turned and looked behind him at the end of the street the deserted treelined street without a house in sight a lone car was parked at the curb inside two figures sat motionless in the front seat for the next twelve hours youre government property and youll do what we tell you to do the silhouetted figure walked rapidly into the windowless sterile room closed the door and in the darkness continued to the table where there was the small brass lamp he turned it on and went directly to his equipment that covered the right wall he sat down in front of the processor touched the switch that brought the screen to life and typed in the code ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed he continued his journal his fingers trembling with elation everything is in motion now the subject is on his way the journey begun i cannot of course project the obstacles facing him much less his success or failure i only know through my highly developed appliances that he is uniquely qualified one day we will be able to factor in more accurately the human quotient but that day is not yet here nevertheless if he survives lightning will strike my projections make that clear from a hundred different successfully factored options the small circle of needtoknow officials have been alerted through ultra max modem communications childs play for my appliances the icarus agenda chapter the estimated flying time from andrews to the us air force base in sicily was seven hours plus arrival was scheduled for am rome time eight oclock in the morning in oman which was four to five hours away depending on the prevailing mediterranean winds and whatever secure routes were available takeoff into the atlantic darkness had been swift in the military jet a converted f delta with a cabin that included two adjacent seats in the rear with tray tables that served both as miniature desks and surfaces for food and drink swivelled lights angled down from the ceiling permitting those reading to move the sharp beams into the areas of concentration whether they were manuscript photographs or maps kendrick was fed the pages from ohiofourzero by the man on his left one page at a time each given only after the previous page was returned in two hours and twelve minutes evan had completed the entire file he was about to start at the beginning again when the young man on his left a handsome darkeyed member of ohiofourzero who had introduced himself simply as a state department aide held up his hand cant we take time out for some food sir he asked oh sure kendrick stretched in his seat frankly theres not a hell of a lot here thats very useful i didnt think there would be said the cleancut youngster evan looked at his seat companion for the first time studying him you know i dont mean this is in a derogatory sensei really dontbut for a highly classified state department operation you strike me as being kind of young for the job you cant be out of your twenties close to it replied the aide but im pretty good at what i do which is sorry no comment sir said the seat companion now how about that food its a long flight how about a drink weve made special provision for civilians the darkhaired darkbrowed young man smiled and signalled the air force steward a corporal in a bulkhead seat facing aft the attendant rose and came forward a glass of white wine and a canadian on the rocks please a canadian thats what you drink isnt it youve been busy we never stop the aide nodded to the corporal who retreated to the miniature galley im afraid the food is fixed and standard continued the young man from ohio its in line with the pentagon cutbacks and certain lobbyists from the meat and produce industries filet mignon with asparagus hollandaise and boiled potatoes some cutbacks some lobbyists added evans seat companion grinning then theres a dessert of baked alaska what you cant overlook the dairy boys the drinks arrived the steward returned to a bulkhead phone where a white light flashed and the aide held up his glass your health yours too do you have a name pick one thats succinct will you settle for joe joe it is nice to meet you sir since you obviously know who i am you have the advantage you can use my name not on this flight then who am i for the record youre a cryptanalyst named axelrod whos being flown to the embassy in jiddah saudi arabia the name doesnt mean much its basically for the pilots logs if anyone wants your attention hell just say sir names are sort of off limits on these trips dr axelrod the corporals intrusion made the state departments aide blanch doctor replied evan mildly astonished looking at joe obviously youre a phd said the aide under his breath thats nice whispered kendrick raising his eyes to the steward yes the pilot would like to speak with you sir if youll follow me to the flight deck please certainly agreed evan pushing up the tray table while handing joe his drink at least you were right about one thing junior he mumbled to the state department man he said sir and i dont like it rejoined joe quietly intensely all communications involving you are to be funnelled through me you want to make a scene screw it its an ego trip he wants to get close to the special cargo the what forget it dr axelrod just remember there are to be no decisions without my approval youre a tough kid the toughest congressdr axelrod also im not junior not where youre concerned shall i convey your feelings to the pilot you can tell him ill cut both his wings and his balls off if he pulls this again since i was the last on board i didnt meet him but i gather hes a brigadier general hes brigadierbullshit to me good lord said kendrick chuckling interservice rivalry at forty thousand feet im not sure i approve of that sir the air force steward was anxious coming corporal the compact flight deck of the f delta glowed with a profusion of tiny green and red lights dials and numbers everywhere the pilot and copilot were strapped in front the navigator on the right a cushioned earphone clipped to his left ear his eyes on a gridded computer screen evan had to bend down to advance the several feet he could manage in the small enclosure yes general he inquired you wanted to see me i dont even want to look at you doctor answered the pilot his attention on the panels in front of him im just going to read you a message from someone named s you know someone named s i think i do replied kendrick assuming the message had been radioed by swann at the department of state what is it its a pain in the butt to this bird is what it is cried the brigadier general ive never landed there i dont know the field and im told those fucking eyetals over in that wasteland are better at making spaghetti sauce than they are at giving approach instructions its our own air base protested evan the hell it is countered the pilot as his copilot shook his head in an emphatic negative were changing course to sardinia not sicily but sardinia ill have to blow out my engines to contain us on that stripif for christs sake we can find it whats the message general asked kendrick calmly theres usually a reason for most things when plans are changed then you explain itno dont explain it im hot and bothered enough goddamned spooks the message please here it is the angry pilot read from a perforated page of paper switch necessary jiddah out all ma where permitted under eyes what does that mean interrupted evan quickly the ma under eyes what it says in english please sorry i forgot whoever you are youre not whats logged it means all military aircraft in sicily and jiddah are under observation as well as every field we land on those arab bastards expect something and theyve got their filthy psychos in place ready to relay anything or anyone unusual not all arabs are bastards or filthy or psychos general they are in my book then its unprintable what is your book the rest of the message please the pilot made an obscene gesture with his right arm the perforated paper in his hand read it yourself arablover but it doesnt leave this deck kendrick took the paper angled it towards the navigators light and read the message switch necessary jiddah out all ma where permitted under eyes transfer to civilian subsidiary on south island routed through cyprus riyadh to target arrangements cleared eta is close to second pillar elmaghreb best timing possible sorry evan reached out holding the message over the brigadier generals shoulder and dropped it i assume that south island is sardinia you got it then i gather im to spend roughly ten more hours on a plane or planes through cyprus saudi arabia and finally to masqat ill tell you one thing arablover continued the pilot im glad its you flying on those minnie mouse aircraft and not me a word of advice grab a seat near an emergency exit and if you can buy a chute spend the money also a gas mask im told those planes stink ill try to remember your generous advice now you tell me something said the general what the hell is that second pillar arab stuff do you go to church asked evan youre damned right i do when im home i make the whole damn family gono welching on that by christ at least once a month its a rule so do the arabs but not once a month five times a day they believe as strongly as you do at least as strongly wouldnt you say the second pillar of el maghreb refers to the islamic prayers at sundown hell of an inconvenience isnt it they work their arab asses off all day long mostly for nothing and then its sundown no cocktails just prayers to their god maybe its all theyve got like the old plantation spirituals the pilot turned slowly in his seat his face in the shadows of the flight deck startled kendrick the brigadier general was black you set me up said the pilot flatly im sorry i mean that i didnt realize on the other hand you said it you called me an arablover sundown masqat oman the ancient turbojet bounced on to the runway with such force that some of the passengers screamed their desert instincts alert to the possibility of fiery oblivion then with the realization that they had arrived that they were safe and that there were jobs for the having they began chanting excitedly thanks be to allah for his benevolence they had been promised rials for servitude the omanis would not accept so be it it was far better than what they had left behind the suited businessmen in the front of the aircraft handkerchiefs held to their noses rushed to the exit door gripping their briefcases all too anxious to swallow the air of oman kendrick stood in the aisle the last in line wondering what the state departments swann had in mind when he said in his message that arrangements had been cleared come with me cried a berobed arab from the crowd forming outside the terminal for immigration we have another exit dr axelrod my passport doesnt say anything about axelrod precisely that is why you are coming with me what about immigration keep your papers in your pocket no one wants to see them i do not want to see them then how enough ya shaikh give me your luggage and stay ten feet behind me come evan handed his soft carryon suitcase to the excited contact and followed him they walked to the right past the end of the onestoreyed brown and white terminal and headed immediately to the left towards the tall wire fence beyond which the fumes from dozens of taxis buses and trucks tinted the burning air the crowds outside the airport fence were racing back and forth amidst the congested vehicles shrieking admonishments and screeching for attention their robes flowing along the fence for perhaps to feet scores of other arabs pressed their faces against the metal links peering into an alien world of smooth asphalt runways and sleek aircraft that was no part of their lives giving birth to fantasies beyond their understanding ahead kendrick could see a metal building the airfield warehouse he remembered so well recalling the hours he and manny weingrass had spent inside waiting for long overdue equipment promised on one flight or another often furious with the customs officials who frequently could not understand the forms they had to fill out which would release the equipmentif indeed the equipment had arrived the gate in front of the warehouses hangarlike doors was open accommodating the line of freight containers their deep wells filled with crates disgorged from the various aircraft guards with attack dogs on leashes flanked the customs conveyor belt that carried the freight inside to anxious suppliers and retailers and the everpresent everfrustrated foremen of construction teams the guards eyes constantly roamed the frenzied activity in their hands repeating machine pistols they were there not merely to maintain a semblance of order amid the chaos and to back up the customs officials in the event of violent disputes but essentially to look out for weapons and narcotics being smuggled into the sultanate each crate and thicklylayered box was examined by the snarling yelping dogs as it was lifted on to the belt evans contact stopped he did the same the arab turned and nodded at a small side gate with a sign in arabic above it stop authorized personnel only violators will be shot it was an exit for the guards and other officials of the government the gate also had a large metal plate where a lock would normally be placed and it was a lock thought kendrick a lock electronically released from somewhere inside the warehouse the contact nodded twice more indicating that on a signal evan was to head for the gate where violators will be shot kendrick frowned questioningly a hollow pain forming in his stomach with masqat under a state of siege it would not take much for someone to start firing the arab read the doubt in his eyes and nodded for a fourth time slowly reassuringly the contact turned and looked to his right down the line of freight containers almost imperceptibly he raised his right hand suddenly a fight broke out beside one of the containers curses were shrieked as arms swung violently and fists pounded contraband liar your mother is a goat a filthy shegoat your father lies with whores you are a product dust flew as the grappling bodies fell to the ground joined by others who took sides the dogs began barking viciously straining at their leashes their handlers carried forward towards the melee all but one handler one guard and the signal was given by evans contact together they ran to the deserted personnel exit good fortune sir said the lone guard his attack dog sniffing menacingly at kendricks trousers as the man tapped the metal plate in a rapid code with his weapon a buzzer sounded and the gate swung back kendrick and his contact ran through racing along the metal wall of the warehouse in the parking lot beyond stood a brokendown truck the tires apparently only half inflated the engine roared as loud reports came from a worn exhaust pipe besuraa cried the arab contact telling evan to hurry there is your transport i hope mumbled kendrick his voice laced with doubt welcome to masqat shaikehwhoever you know who i am said evan angrily you picked me out in the crowd how many others can do that very few sir and i do not know who you are i swear by allah then i have to believe you dont i asked kendrick staring at the man i would not use the name of allah if it were not so please besuraa thanks said evan grabbing his case and running towards the trucks cab suddenly the driver was gesturing out the window for him to climb into the back under the canvas that covered the bed of the ancient vehicle the truck lurched forward as a pair of hands pulled him up inside stretched out on the floorboards kendrick raised his eyes to the arab above him the man smiled and pointed to the long robes of an aba and the anklelength shirt known as a thob which were suspended on a hanger in the front of the canvastopped trailer beside it hanging on a nail was the ghotra headdress and a pair of white balloon trousers the street clothes of an arab and the last items evan had requested of the state departments frank swann these and one other small but vital catalyst the arab held it up it was a tube of skindarkening gel which when generously applied turned the face and hands of a white occidental into those of a middleeastern semite whose skin had been permanently burnished by the hot blistering nearequatorial sun the dyed pigment would stay darkened for a period of ten days before fading ten days a lifetimefor him or for the monster who called himself the mahdi the woman stood inside the airport fence inches from the metal links she wore gently flared white slacks and a tapered dark green silk blouse the blouse creased by the leather strap of her handbag long dark hair framed her face her sharp attractive features were obscured by a pair of large designer sunglasses her head covered by a widebrimmed white sun hat the crown circled by a ribbon of green silk at first she seemed to be yet another traveller from wealthy rome or paris london or new york but a closer look revealed a subtle difference from the stereotype it was her skin its olive tones neither black nor white suggested northern africa what confirmed the difference was what she held in her hands and only seconds before had pressed against the fence a miniature camera barely two inches long and with a tiny bulging convex prismatic lens engineered for telescopic photography equipment associated with intelligence personnel the seedy rundown truck had swerved out of the warehouse parking lot the camera was no longer necessary she grabbed the handbag at her side and slipped it out of sight khalehla shouted an obese wideeyed baldheaded man running towards her pronouncing the name in arabic kalayla he was awkwardly carrying two suitcases the sweat drenching his shirt and penetrating even the black pinstripe suit styled in savile row for gods sake why did you drift off that dreadful queue was simply too boring darling replied the woman her accent an unfathomable mixture of british and italian or perhaps greek i thought id stroll around good christ khalehla you cant do that cant you understand this place is a veritable hell on earth right now the englishman stood before her his jowled face flushed dripping with perspiration i was the very next in line for that immigration imbecile and i looked around and you werent there and when i started rushing about to find you three lunatics with gunsgunsstopped me and took me into a room and searched our luggage i hope you were clean tony the bastards confiscated my whisky oh the sacrifices of being such a successful man never mind darling ill have it replaced the british businessmans eyes roved over the face and figure of khalehla well its past isnt it well go back now and get it over with the obese man winkedone eye after the other ive got us splendid accommodation youll be very pleased my dear accommodation with you darling yes of course oh i really couldnt do that what you said i said khalehla broke in her dark brows arched above her sunglasses well you implied rather emphatically i might add that if i could get you on that plane we might have a rather sporting time of it in masqat sporting of course drinks on the gulf perhaps the races dinner at el quamanyes all of those things but in your room well well well certain things shouldnt have to bespecified oh my sweet tony how can i apologize for such a misunderstanding my old english tutor at the cairo university suggested i contact you shes one of your wifes dearest friends oh no i couldnt really shit exploded the highly successful businessman named tony miraya shouted kendrick over the deafening sounds of the dilapidated truck as it bounced over a back road into masqat you did not request a mirror ya shaikh yelled the arab in the rear of the trailer his english heavily accented but understandable enough rip out one of the sideview mirrors on the doors then tell the driver he cannot hear me ya shaikh like so many others this is an old vehicle one that will not be noticed i cannot reach the driver goddamn it exclaimed evan the tube of gel in his hand then you be my eyes ya sahbee he said calling the man his friend come closer to me and watch tell me when its right open the canvas the arab folded back part of the rear covering letting the sunlight into the darkened trailer cautiously holding on to the straps he moved forward until he was barely a foot away from kendrick this is the iddawa sir he asked referring to the tube iwah said evan when he saw that the gel was indeed the medicine he needed he began spreading it first on his hands both men watched the waitingtime was less than three minutes anna shouted the arab holding out his right hand the colour of the skin nearly matched his own kwayis agreed kendrick trying to approximate the amount of gel he had applied to his hands so as to equal the proportion for his face there was nothing for it but to do it he did and anxiously watched the arabs eyes maool cried his newest companion grinning the grin of significant triumph delwatee anzur he had done it his exposed flesh was now the colour of a sundrenched arab help me into the thob and the aba please evan asked as he started to disrobe in the violently shaking truck i will of course said the arab suddenly in much clearer english than he had employed before but now we are finished with each other forgive me for playing the naïf with you but no one is to be trusted here the american state department not exempted you are taking risks ya shaikh far more than i as the father of my children would take but that is your business not mine you will be dropped off in the centre of masqat and you will then be on your own thanks for getting me there said evan thank you for coming ya shaikh but do not try to trace those of us who helped you in truth we would kill you before the enemy had a chance to schedule your execution we are quiet but we are alive who are you believers ya shaikh that is enough for you to know alfshukr said evan thanking the clerk and tipping him for the confidentiality he had been guaranteed he signed the hotel register with a false arabic name and was given the key to his suite he did not require a bellboy kendrick took the elevator to a wrong floor and waited at the end of a corridor to see if he had been followed he had not so he walked down the staircase to his proper floor and went to his suite time times valuable every minute frank swann department of state the evening prayers of el maghreb were over darkness descended and the madness at the embassy could be heard in the distance evan threw his small case into a corner of the living room took out his wallet from under his robes and withdrew a folded sheet of paper on which he had written the names and telephone numbersnumbers that were by now almost five years oldof the people he wanted to contact he went to the desk and the telephone sat down and unfolded the paper thirtyfive minutes later after the effusive yet strangely awkward greetings of three friends from the past the meeting was arranged he had chosen seven names each among the most influential men he remembered from his days in masqat two had died one was out of the country the fourth told him quite frankly that the climate was not right for an omani to meet with an american the three who had agreed to see him with varying degrees of reluctance would arrive separately within the hour each would go directly to his suite without troubling the front desk thirtyeight minutes passed during which time kendrick unpacked the few items of clothing he had brought and ordered specific brands of whisky from room service the abstinence demanded by islamic tradition was more honoured in the breach and beside each name was the libation each guest favoured it was a lesson evan had learned from the irascible emmanuel weingrass an industrial lubricant my son you remember the name of a mans wife hes pleased you remember the brand of whisky he drinks now thats something else now you care the soft knocking at the door broke the silence of the room like cracks of lightning kendrick took several deep breaths walked across the room and admitted his first visitor it is you evan my god you havent converted have you come in mustapha its good to see you again but am i seeing you said the man named mustapha who was dressed in a dark brown business suit and your skin you are as dark as i am if not darker i want you to understand everything kendrick closed the door gesturing for his friend from the past to choose a place to sit ive got your brand of scotch care for a drink oh that manny weingrass is never far away is he said mustapha walking to the long brocadecovered sofa and sitting down the old thief hey come on musty protested evan laughing and heading for the bar he never shortchanged you no he didnt neither he nor you nor your other partners ever shortchanged any of us how has it been with you without them my friend many of us talk about it even after all these years sometimes not easy said kendrick honestly pouring drinks but you accept it you cope he brought mustapha his scotch and sat down in one of the three chairs opposite the sofa the best musty he raised his glass no old friend it is the worstthe worst of times as the english dickens wrote lets wait till the others get here theyre not coming mustapha drank his scotch what we talked i am as is said in so many business conferences the representative of certain interests also as the only minister of the sultans cabinet it was felt that i could convey the governments consensus about what youre jumping way the hell ahead of me you jumped ahead of us evan by simply coming here and calling us one of us two perhaps even in the extreme threebut seven no that was reckless of you old friend and dangerous for everyone why did you think for a minute continued the arab overriding kendrick that even three recognizable men of standingsay nothing of sevenwould converge on a hotel within minutes of each other to meet with a stranger without the management hearing about it ridiculous evan studied mustapha before speaking their eyes locked what is it musty what are you trying to tell me this isnt the embassy and that obscene mess over there hasnt anything to do with the businessmen or the government of oman no it obviously does not agreed the arab firmly but what im trying to tell you is that things have changed herein ways many of us do not understand thats also obvious interrupted kendrick youre not terrorists no were not but would you care to hear what peopleresponsible peopleare saying go ahead it will pass they say dont interfere it would only inflame them further dont interfere repeated evan incredulously and let the politicians settle it the politicians cant settle it oh theres more evan theres a certain basis for their anger they say not the killing of course but within the context of certain events et cetera et cetera ive heard that too context of certain events what events current history old friend theyre reacting to a very uneven middle east policy on the part of the united states thats the catchphrase evan the israelis get everything and they get nothing people say they are driven from their lands and their homes and forced to live in crowded filthy refugee camps while in the west bank the jews spit on them these are the things i hear thats bullshit exploded kendrick beyond the fact that theres another equally painful side to that bigoted coin it has nothing to do with those two hundred and thirtysix hostages or the eleven whove already been butchered they dont make policy uneven or otherwise theyre innocent human beings brutalized and terrified and driven to exhaustion by goddamned animals how the hell can responsible people say those things thats not the presidents cabinet over there or hawks from the knesset theyre civil service employees and tourists and construction families i repeat bullshit the man named mustapha sat rigidly on the sofa his eyes still levelled at evan i know that and you know that he said quietly and they know that my friend then why the truth then continued the arab his voice no louder than before two incidents that forged a dreadful consensus if i may use the word somewhat differently from before the reason these things are said is that none of us cares to create targets of our own flesh targets your flesh two men one i shall call mahmoud the other abdulnot their real names of course for its better that you not know them mahmouds daughterraped her face slashed abduls son his throat slit in an alley below his fathers office on the piers criminals rapists murderers the authorities say but we all know better it was abdul and mahmoud who tried to rally an opposition guns they cried storm the embassy ourselves they insisted do not let masqat become another tehran but it was not they who suffered it was those close to them their most precious possessions these are the warnings evan forgive me but if you had a wife and children would you subject them to such risks i think not the most precious jewels are not made of stone but of flesh our families a true hero will overcome his fear and risk his life for what he believes but he will balk when the price is the lives of his loved ones is it not so old friend my god whispered evan you wont helpyou cant there is someone however who will see you and hear what you have to say but the meeting must take place with extraordinary caution miles away in the desert before the mountains of jabal sham who is it the sultan kendrick was silent he looked at his glass after a prolonged moment he raised his eyes to mustapha im not to have any official linkage he said and the sultans pretty official i dont speak for my government thats got to be clear you mean you dont want to meet with him on the contrary i want to very much i just need to make my position clear i have nothing to do with the intelligence community the state department or the white housegod knows not the white house i think thats patently clear your robes and the colour of your skin confirm it and the sultan wants no connection with you as emphatically as washington wants no connection im rusty said evan drinking the old man died a year or so after i left didnt he im afraid i didnt keep up with things over herea natural aversion i think certainly understandable our current sultan is his son hes nearer your age than mine even younger than you after school in england he completed his studies in your country dartmouth and harvard to be exact his names ahmat broke in kendrick remembering i met him a couple of times evan frowned economics and international relations he added what those were the degrees he was after graduate and postgraduate hes educated and bright but hes young very young for the tasks facing him when can i see him tonight before others become aware of your presence here mustapha looked at his watch in thirty minutes leave the hotel and walk four blocks north a military vehicle will be at the corner get in and it will take you to the sands of jabal sham the slender arab in the soiled aba ducked into the shadows of the darkened shopfront opposite the hotel he stood silently next to the woman called khalehla now dressed in a tailored black suit the kind favoured by women executives and indistinct in the dim light she was awkwardly securing a lens into the mount of her small camera suddenly two sharp highpitched beeps sounded out hurry said the arab hes on his way hes reached the lobby as fast as i can replied the woman swearing under her breath as she manipulated the lens i ask little of my superiors but decent functioning equipment is one of them there its on here he comes khalehla raised her camera with the telescopic infrared lens for night photographs she rapidly snapped three pictures of the robed evan kendrick i wonder how long theyll let him live she said i have to reach a telephone ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the journal was continued reports from masqat are astonishing the subject has transformed himself into an omani complete with arab dress and darkened skin he moves about the city like a native apparently contacting old friends and acquaintances from his previous life the reports however are also sketchy as the subjects shadow routes everything through langley and as yet i havent been able to invade the cia access codes from the gulf nations who knows what langley conceals ive instructed my appliances to work harder the state department naturally is duck soup and why not the icarus agenda chapter the vast arid desert appeared endless in the night the sporadic moonlight outlining the mountains of jabal sham in the distancean unreachable menacing border towering on the dark horizon everywhere the flat surface seemed to be a dry mixture of earth and sand the windless plain devoid of those swelling impermanent hills of windblown dunes one conjures up with images of the great sahara the hard winding road beneath was barely passable the brown military vehicle lurched and skidded around the sandy curves on its way to the royal meeting ground kendrick as instructed sat beside the armed uniformed driver in the back was a second man an officer and also armed security started at the pickup a perceived wrong move on evans part and he was flanked apart from polite greetings neither soldier spoke this is desert country said kendrick in arabic why are there so many turns there are many offshoot roads sir answered the officer from the back seat a straight lane in these sands would mark them too clearly royal security thought evan without comment they took an offshoot road after twentyfive minutes of speeding due west several miles beyond a campfire glowed on the right as they drew near kendrick saw a platoon of uniformed guards circling the fire facing out all points of the compass covered the dark silhouettes of two military trucks loomed in the distance the car stopped the officer leaped out and opened the door for the american precede me sir he said in english certainly replied evan trying to spot the young sultan in the light of the fire there was no sign of him nor of anyone not in uniform evan tried to recall the face of the boyman he had met over four years ago the student who had come home to oman during a christmas or a spring break he could not remember which only that the son of the sultan was an amiable young man as knowledgeable ashe was enthusiastic about american sports but that was all evan could recall no face came to him only the name ahmat which mustapha had confirmed three soldiers in front of him gave way they walked through the protective ring you will permit me sir said a second officer suddenly standing in front of kendrick permit you what it is customary under these circumstances to search all visitors go ahead the soldier swiftly and efficiently probed the robes of the aba raising the right sleeve above the area where evan had spread the skindarkening gel seeing the white flesh the officer held the cloth in place and stared at kendrick you have papers with you ya shaikh no papers no identification i see the soldier dropped the sleeve you have no weapons either of course not that is for you to claim and for us to determine sir the officer snapped out a thin black device from his belt no larger than a pack of cigarettes he pressed what looked like a red or orange button you will wait here please im not going anywhere said evan glancing at the guards their rifles poised no you are not ya shaikh agreed the soldier striding back towards the fire kendrick looked at the englishspeaking officer who had accompanied him in the back seat from masqat they take no chances do they he said aimlessly the will of almighty allah sir replied the soldier the sultan is our light our sun you are aurobbi a white man would you not protect your lineage to the heavens if i thought he could guarantee my admittance i certainly would he is a good man ya shaikh young perhaps but wise in many ways we have come to learn that he is coming here then he has arrived sir the basstoned roar of a big powerful car broke the crackling intrusion of the campfire the vehicle with tinted windows swerved in front of the ring of guards and came to an abrupt stop before the driver could emerge the rear door opened and the sultan stepped out he was in the robes of his royal office but with the door still open he proceeded to remove them throwing his aba into the car the ghotra headdress remaining on his head he walked through the circle of his royal guard a slender muscular man of medium height and broad shoulders except for the ghotra his clothes were western his slacks were a tan gabardine and over his chest was a tshirt with a cartoon figure wearing a threecornered american revolutionary hat bursting out of an american football underneath the legend read new england patriots its been a long time evan kendrick ya shaikh said the young man in a slightly british accent smiling and extending his hand i like your costume but its not exactly brooks brothers is it neither is yours unless the brothers brooks are into tshirts they shook hands kendrick could feel the sultans strength thank you for seeing me ahmat forgive mei should say your royal highness my apologies you knew me as ahmat and i knew you as shaikh sir must i still call you sir thatd be inappropriate i think good we understand each other you look different from what i remember said evan i was forced to grow up swiftlynot by choice from student to teacher without the proper qualifications im afraid youre respected ive heard that the office does it not the man i must learn to fill the office come on lets talkaway from here the sultan ahmat took kendricks arm and started through his circle of guards only to be stopped by the officer who had searched evan your highness cried the soldier your safety is our lives please remain within the cordon and be a target by the light of the fire we surround you sir and the men will continuously sidestep around the circle the ground is flat instead point your weapons beyond the shadows sahbee said ahmat calling the soldier his friend well only be a few metres away with pain in our hearts your highness it will pass ahmat ushered kendrick through the cordon my countrymen are given to trivial melodramatics its not so trivial if theyre willing to make a moving ring and take a bullet meant for you its nothing special evan and frankly i dont know all the men in those bodies what we may have to say to each other could be for our ears only i didnt realize kendrick looked at the young sultan of oman as they walked into the darkness your own guards anythings possible during this madness you can study the eyes of a professional soldier but you cant see the resentments or the temptations behind them here this is far enough both men stopped in the sand the madness said evan flatly in the dim light of the fire and the intermittent moonlight lets talk about it thats why youre here of course thats why im here kendrick said what the hell do you want me to do cried ahmat in a harsh whisper whatever move i make another hostage could get shot and one more bulletriddled body thrown out of a window the young sultan shook his head now i know you and my father worked well togetheryou and i discussed a few projects at a couple of dinner parties but i dont expect you to remember i remember broke in kendrick you were home from harvard your second year in graduate school i think you were always on your fathers left the position of inheritance thanks a bunch evan i could have had a terrific job at e f hutton you have a terrific job here i know that said ahmat his whispered voice again rising and thats why i have to make sure i do it right certainly i can call back the army from the yemen border and take the embassy by blowing it apartand in doing so i guarantee the deaths of two hundred and thirtysix americans i can see your headlines now arab sultan kills et cetera et cetera arab the knesset in jerusalem has a field day no way pal im no hairtrigger cowboy who risks innocent lives and somehow in the confusion gets labelled antisemitic in your press god in heaven washington and israel seem to have forgotten that were all semites and not all arabs are palestinians and not all palestinians are terrorists and i wont give those pontificating arrogant israeli bastards another reason to send their american fs to kill more arabs just as innocent as your hostages do you read me evan shaikh i read you said kendrick now will you cool off and listen to me the agitated young sultan exhaled audibly nodding his head of course ill listen to you but listening isnt agreeing to a damn thing all right evan paused his eyes intense wanting to be understood despite the strange obscure information he was about to impart youve heard of the mahdi khartoum the s no bahrain the s what kendrick repeated the story he had told frank swann at the state department the story of an unknown obsessed financier who called himself the mahdi and whose purpose was to drive out the westerner from the middle east and southwest asia keeping the immense wealth of industrial expansion in arab handsspecifically his hands how this same man who had spread his gospel of islamic purity throughout the fanatic fringes had formed a network a silent cartel of scores perhaps hundreds of hidden companies and corporations all linked together under the umbrella of his own concealed organization evan then described how his old israeli architect emmanuel weingrass had perceived the outlines of this extraordinary economic conspiracy initially by way of threats levelled against the kendrick groupthreats he had countered with his own outrageous warnings of retributionand how the more manny learned the more he was convinced that the conspiracy was real and growing and had to be exposed looking back im not proud of what i did continued evan in the dim light of the campfire and the flitting desert moon but i rationalized it because of what had happened i just had to get out of this part of the world and so i walked away from the business walked away from the fight manny said we must confront i told him his imagination was working overtime that he was giving credence to irresponsibleand often drunkengoons i remember so clearly what he said to me could my wildest imaginings he said or even less conceivably theirs come up with a mahdi those killers did it to ushe did it manny was right then and hes right now the embassy is stormed homicidal lunatics kill innocent people and the ultimate statement is made stay away western boy you come over here youll be another corpse thrown out of a window cant you see ahmat there is a mahdi and hes systematically squeezing everyone else out through sheer manipulative terror i can see that youre convinced replied the young sultan skeptically so are others here in masqat they just dont understand they cant find a pattern or an explanation but theyre so frightened they refused to meet with me me an old friend of many years a man they worked with and trusted terror breeds anxiety what would you expect also theres something else youre an american disguised as an arab that in itself must frighten them they didnt know what i was wearing or what i looked like i was a voice over the telephone an american voice even more frightening a western boy there are many westerners here but the united states government understandably has ordered all americans out and prohibited all incoming american commercial flights your friends ask themselves how you got here and why with lunatics roaming the streets perhaps they also understandably dont care to involve themselves in the embassy crisis they dont because children have been killedthe children of men who did want to involve themselves ahmat stood rigidly in place his dark eyes bewildered angry again theres been crime yes and the police do what they can but ive heard nothing about thisabout children being killed its true a daughter was raped her face disfigured a son was murdered his throat slit goddamn you if youre lying i may be helpless where the embassy is concerned but not outside who were they give me names none were given to me not the real ones i wasnt to be told but mustapha had to do the telling there was no one else yes hell tell me you can bet your ass on that then you see now dont you kendrick was close to pleading the pattern i mean its there ahmat an underground network is being formed this mahdi and his people are using terrorists to drive out all current and potential competition they want total control they want all the money funnelled to them the young sultan delayed his reply then shook his head im sorry evan i cant accept that because they wouldnt dare try it why not because the computers would pick up a pattern of payments to a central hub of the network thats why how do you think cornfeld and vesco got caught somewhere there has to be linkage a convergence youre way ahead of me because youre way behind in computer analyses retorted ahmat you can have a hundred thousand dispersals for twenty thousand separate projects and whereas before it would have taken months even years to find the hidden linkages between say five hundred corporations dummy and otherwise those disks can do it in a couple of hours very enlightening said kendrick but youre forgetting something what finding those linkages would take place after the fact after all those dispersals were made by then the networks in place and the fox has got one hell of a lot of chickens if youll excuse a couple of mixed metaphors not too many people will be interested in setting traps or sending out hounds under the circumstances who could care the trains are running on time and no ones blowing them up of course theres also a new kind of government around now that has its own set of rules and if you and your ministers dont happen to like them you might just be replaced but again who cares the sun comes up every morning and people have jobs to go to you make it sound almost attractive oh it always is in the beginning mussolini did get those damned trains on schedule and the third reich certainly revitalized industry i see your point except youre saying that its the reverse here an industrial monopoly could move into a void and take over my government because it represents stability and growth two points for the sultan agreed evan he gets another jewel for his harem tell my wife about it shes a presbyterian from new bedford massachusetts how did you get away with that my father died and shes got a hell of a sense of humour again i cant follow you some other time lets suppose youre right and this is a shakedown cruise to see if their tactics can take the weather washington wants us to keep talking while you people come up with a plan that obviously combines some kind of penetration followed by a delta force but lets face it america and its allies are hoping for a diplomatic breakthrough because any strategy that depends on force could be disastrous theyve called in every nut leader in the middle east and short of making arafat mayor of new york city theyll deal with anyone holierthanthou statements notwithstanding whats your idea the same as what you say those computers of yours could do in a couple of years from now when itd be too late trace the source of whats being sent into the embassy not food or medical supplies but ammunition and weapons and somewhere among those items the instructions that someones sending inside in other words find this manipulator who calls himself the mahdi and rip him out the tshirted sultan looked at evan in the flickering light youre aware that much of the western press have speculated that i myself might be behind this that i somehow resent the western influence spreading throughout the country otherwise they say why doesnt he do something im aware of it but like the state department i think its nonsense no one with half a brain gives any credence to those speculations your state department said ahmat reflectively his eyes still on kendrick you know they came to me in when tehran blew up i was a student then and i dont know what those two guys expected to find but whatever it was it wasnt me probably some bedouin in a long flowing aba sitting crosslegged and smoking a hashish water pipe maybe if id dressed the part they would have taken me seriously youve lost me again oh sorry you see once they realized that neither my father nor the family could do anything that we had no real connection with the fundamentalist movements they were exasperated one of them almost begged me saying that i appeared to be a reasonable arabmeaning that my english was fluent if tainted by early british schoolingand what would i do if i were running things in washington what they meant here was what advice would i offer if my advice were sought goddamn it i was right what did you tell them i remember exactly i said what you should have done in the beginning it could be too late now but you might still pull it off i told them to put together the most efficient insurgency force they could mount and send itnot to tehran but to qum khomeinis backwoods headquarters in the north send exsavak agents in first those bastards would figure out a way to do it if the firepower and compensation were guaranteed take khomeini in qum i told them take the illiterate mullahs around him and get them all out alive then parade them on world television hed be the ultimate bargaining chip and those hairy fanatics that are his court would serve to point up how ridiculous they all are a deal could have been made evan studied the angry young man it might have worked he said softly but what if khomeini had decided to standto and fast as a martyr he wouldnt have believe me he would have settled there would have been a compromise offered by others of course but designed by him he has no desire to go so quickly to that heaven he extols or to opt for that martyrdom he uses to send twelveyearold kids into minefields why are you so sure asked kendrick himself unsure i met that halfwit in paristhats not to justify pahlevi or his savak or his plundering relatives i couldnt do thatbut khomeinis a senile zealot who wants to believe in his own immortality and will do anything to further it i heard him tell a group of fawning imbeciles that instead of two or three he had twenty perhaps thirty even forty sons i have spread my seed and i will continue to spread it he claimed it is allahs will that my seed reach far and wide bullshit hes a dribbling dirty old man and a classic case for a funnyfarm can you imagine populating this sick world with little ayatollahs i told your people that once they had him to catch him on video tape with his guard down sermonizing to his hick highpriestsoneway mirror stuff that kind of thing his holy persona would have collapsed in a global wave of laughter youre drawing some kind of parallel between khomeini and this mahdi ive described arent you i dont know i suppose so if your mahdi exists which i doubt but if youre right and he does exist hes coming from the opposite pole a very practical nonreligious pole still anybody who feels he has to spread the spectre of the mahdi in these times has a few dangerous screws loose im still not convinced evan but youre persuasive and ill do everything i can to help you help all of us but its got to be from a distance an untraceable distance ill give you a telephone number to call its buriednonexistent in facti and only two other people have it youll be able to reach me but only me you see shaikh kendrick i cant afford to know you im very popular washington doesnt want to know me either of course not neither of us wants the blood of american hostages on our hands ill need papers for myself and probably lists of air and sea shippers from areas ill pinpoint spoken nothing written down except for the papers a name and an address will be delivered to you pick up the papers from that man thank you incidentally the state department said the same thing nothing they gave me could be written down for the same reasons dont worry about it everything coincides with what ive got in mind you see ahmat i dont want to know you either really thats the deal ive cut with state im a non person in their books and i want to be the same in yours the young sultan frowned pensively his eyes locked with evans i accept what you say but i cant pretend to understand you lose your life thats one thing but if you have any measure of success thats another why im told youre a politician now a congressman because im getting out of politics and coming back here ahmat im picking up the pieces and going back to work where i worked best but i dont want any excess baggage with me that might make me a target or anyone with me all right ill accept that gratefully on both counts my father claimed that you and your people were the best i remember he once said to me those retarded camels never overrun on cost he meant it kindly of course and of course we usually got the next project so we werent so retarded were we our idea was to work on reasonable margins and we were pretty good at controlling costs ahmat we have only four days left before the executions start again i had to know that if i needed help i could go to you and now i do know it i accept your conditions and you accept mine now please i havent an hour to waste whats the number where i can reach you it cant be written down understood the sultan gave kendrick the number instead of the usual masqat prefix of it was followed by three zeros and a fourth five can you remember that its not difficult answered kendrick is it routed through a palace switchboard no its a direct line to two telephones both locked in steel drawers one in my office the other in the bedroom instead of ringing small red lights flash on in the office the light is built into the right rear leg of my desk and in the bedroom its recessed in the bedside table both phones become answering machines after the tenth ring the tenth to give me the time to get rid of people and talk privately when i travel outside the palace i carry a beeper that tells me when that phone has been called at an appropriate time i use the remote control and hear the messageover a scrambler of course you mentioned that only two other people had the number should i know who they are or isnt it any of my business it doesnt matter replied ahmat his dark brown eyes riveted on the american one is my minister of security and the other is my wife thanks for that kind of trust his gaze still rigid on kendrick the young sultan continued a terrible thing happened to you here in our part of the world evan so many dead so many close friends a horrible senseless tragedy far more so for the greed that was behind it i must ask you has this madness in masqat dredged up such painful memories that you delude yourself reaching for implausible theories if only to strike out at phantoms no phantoms ahmat i hope to prove that to you perhaps you willif you live ill tell you what i told the state department i have no intention of mounting a oneman assault on the embassy if you did something like that you could be considered enough of a lunatic to be spared lunacy recognizes its own now youre the one being implausible undoubtedly agreed the sultan of oman his eyes still levelled at the congressman from colorado have you considered what might happennot if youre discovered and taken by the terrorists you wouldnt live long enough to speculatebut if the very people you say you wanted to meet with actually confronted you and demanded to know your purpose here what would you tell them essentially the truthas close to it as possible im acting on my own as a private citizen with no connection to my government which can be substantiated i made a great deal of money over here and im coming back if i can help in any way its in my own best interests so the bottom line is selfserving you intend to return here and if this insane killing can be stopped it will be infinitely more profitable for you also if it isnt stopped you have no business to return to thats about it be careful evan few people will believe you and if the fear you spoke of is as pervasive among your friends as you say it may not be the enemy who tries to kill you ive already been warned said kendrick what a man in a truck a sahbee who helped me kendrick lay on the bed his eyes wide his thoughts churning turning from one possibility to another one vaguely remembered name to another a face another face an office a street the harbour the waterfront he kept going back to the waterfront to the docksfrom masqat south to al qurayyat and ras al hadd why then his memory was jogged and he knew why how many times had he and manny weingrass made arrangements for equipment to be brought in by purchasable surplus space on freighters from bahrain and the emirates in the north so many they were uncountable that hundredmile stretch of coastline south of masqat and its sister port of matrah was open territory even more so beyond ras al hadd but from there until one reached the short strait of masirah the roads were worse than primitive and travellers heading into the interior risked being attacked by haraamiya on horsebackmounted thieves looking for prey usually other thieves transporting contraband still considering the numbers and depth of the combined intelligence efforts of at least six western nations concentrating on masqat the southern coastline of oman was a logical area to examine intensively this was not to say that the americans british french italians west germans and whoever else were cooperating in the effort to analyze and resolve the hostage crisis in masqat had overlooked that stretch of omans coast but the reality was that few american patrol boats those swift penetrating bullets on the water were in the gulf those which were there would not shirk their duties but they did not possess that certain fury that grips men in the heat of the search when they know their own are being slaughtered there might even be a degree of reluctance to engage terrorists for fear of being held responsible for additional executions the southern coast of oman could bear some scrutiny the sound erupted as harshly as if a siren had split the hot dry air of the hotel room the telephone screamed he picked it up yes get out of your hotel said the quiet strained voice on the line ahmat evan swung his legs on to the floor yes were on a direct scrambler if youre bugged all theyll hear me say is gibberish i just said your name there are thousands like it whats happened mustapha because of the children you spoke of i called him and ordered him to come immediately to the palace unfortunately in my anger i mentioned my concern he must have phoned someone said something to someone else why do you say that on his way here he was gunned down in his car my god if im wrong the only other reason for killing him was his meeting with you oh christ leave the hotel right away and dont leave any identification behind it could be dangerous to you youll see two policemen theyll follow you protect you and somewhere in the street one of them will give you the name of the man who will provide you with papers im on my way said kendrick getting to his feet focusing his mind on removing such items as his passport money belt airline tickets and whatever articles of clothing might be traced to an american on a plane from riyadh evan shaikh ahmats voice over the line was low firm im convinced now your mahdi exists his people exist go after them go after him the icarus agenda chapter hasib the warning came from behind telling him to watch out he spun around only to be pressed into the wall of a building in the crowded narrow street by one of the two policemen following him his face against the stone the ghotra protecting his flesh he turned his head to see two bearded dishevelled youths in paramilitary fatigues striding through the bazaarlike thoroughfare waving heavy ugly black repeating weapons in their hands kicking out at merchants stalls and rubbing their heavy boots on the surfaces of the squatting streetsellers woven rugs look sir whispered the policeman in english his voice harsh angry yet somehow elated they do not see us i dont understand the arrogant young terrorists approached stay against the wall commanded the arab now hammering kendrick back into the shadows shielding the americans body with his own why the armed hoodlums passed thrusting the barrels of their guns menacingly into the robed figures in front of them be still sir they are drunk either with the forbidden spirits or on the blood they have shed but thanks be to allah they are outside the embassy what do you mean those of us in uniform are not permitted within sight of the embassy but if they come outside it is another matter our hands are untied what happens up ahead one of the terrorists smashed the butt of his weapon into the head of an offending omani his companion swung his rifle around at the crowd warning it they face either the wrath of the allah they spit on replied the policeman whispering his eyes filled with rage at the scene or they join the other reckless filthy pigs stay here ya shaikh sir stay in this small bazaar i will be back i have a name to give you the otherwhat other filthy pigs evans words were lost the sultans police officer sprang away from the wall joining his partner now surging through the shadowed turbulent frightened sea of abas kendrick pulled the ghotra around his face and ran after them what followed was as baffling and as swift to the untrained eye as a surgeons scalpel plunging into a haemorrhaging organ the second policeman glanced back at his companion they nodded to each other both sprang forward closing in on the two swaggering terrorists ahead on the right was an intersecting alleyway and as if an unheard signal had pierced the narrow bazaar the crowds of sellers and buyers dispersed in various directions almost instantly the alleyway was empty a dark deserted tunnel the policemens two knives were suddenly plunged into the upper right arms of the two arrogant killers screams covered by the intense growing babble of the moving crowds followed the involuntary release of weapons as blood spewed out of torn flesh and arrogance turned into infuriated weakness death perhaps preferable to disgrace eyes bulging in disbelief the terrorists were rushed into the dark alley by ahmats two trusted police unseen hands threw the huge lethal weapons after them kendrick parted the bodies in front of him and raced into the deserted tunnel twenty feet inside the youthful wildeyed killers were supine on the stone pavement the policemens knives above their throats la shouted evans protector telling him no turn away he continued in english for fear kendrick might misunderstand hide your face and say nothing i must ask you cried kendrick turning but disobeying the second command they probably dont speak english anyway they probably do ya shaikh sir broke in the other policeman whatever you have to say say later as spokesman my instructions are to be obeyed without question is that understood sir understood evan nodded quickly and walked back towards the arched entrance to the bazaar i will come back ya shaikh said kendricks protector hovering over his prisoner we will take these pigs out the other end and i will be back for you the mans words were interrupted by a violent shattering scream of defiance without thinking evan whipped his head around suddenly wishing he hadnt wondering instantly if the image would ever leave him the terrorist on the left had grabbed the policemans longbladed knife above and yanked it down slicing it into his own throat the sight turned kendricks stomach he thought he would vomit fool roared the second policeman not so much in rage as in anguish child pig why do you do this to yourself why to me the protest was in vain the terrorist was dead blood covering his bearded young face somehow thought evan he had witnessed a microcosm of the violence the pain and the futility that was the world of the middle east and southwest asia all is changed said the first officer his knife held up rising above his openmouthed incredulous prisoner and touching his comrades shoulder the latter shook his head as if trying to rid his eyes and his mind of the youthful bloody corpse beneath him then nodded rapidly telling his companion he understood the first officer approached kendrick there will be a delay now this incident must not reach the other streets so we must move quickly the man you seek the man who is waiting for you is known as elbaz you will find him in the market beyond the old south fortress in the harbour there is a bakery selling orange baklava ask inside the south fortress in the harbour there are two stone fortresses built by the portuguese many centuries ago the mirani and the jalili i remember of course interrupted evan rambling finding part of his sanity his eyes avoiding the deathwound of the mutilated body on the floor of the dark alleyway two forts built to protect the harbour from raiding pirates theyre ruins nowa bakery selling orange baklava there is no time sir go run out the other side you cannot be seen here any longer quickly first answer my question shot back kendrick angering the police officer by not moving or i stay here and you can answer to your sultan what question leave you said these two might join other reckless pigs those were your words what other pigs where there is no time answer me the policeman inhaled deeply through his nostrils trembling with frustration very well incidents like tonight have happened before we have taken a number of prisoners who are questioned by many people nothing must be said how many thirty forty perhaps fifty by now they disappear from the embassy and others always others take their places where the officer stared at evan and shook his head no ya shaikh sir that i will not tell you go i understand thanks the congressman from colorado gripped the cloth of his aba and raced down the alley towards the exit turning his face away as he ran past the dead terrorist whose streaming blood now filled the crevices between the cobblestones he emerged on the street looked up at the sky and determined his direction to the sea to the ruins of the ancient fortress on the south shore of the harbour he would find the man named elbaz and arrange for the proper papers but his mind was not on that negotiation instead he was consumed by information he had heard only moments ago thirty forty perhaps fifty by now between thirty and fifty terrorists were being held in some isolated compound in or outside the city being interrogated with varying degrees of force by combined intelligence units yet if his theory was correct that these childbutchers were the maniacal dregs of islam manipulated by an overlord of financial crime in bahrain all the interrogation techniques from the pharaohs to the inquisition to the camps in hoa binh would be useless unlessunlessa name that conjured up a zealots most fanatical passions was delivered to one of the prisoners persuading him to divulge what he would normally take his own life before revealing it would mean finding a very special fanatic of course but it was possible evan had said to frank swann that perhaps one in twenty of the terrorists might be intelligent enough to fit this descriptionone out of twenty roughly ten or twelve in the entire contingent of killers at the embassyif he was right could one of them be among the thirty to fifty prisoners in that isolated secret compound the odds were slim but a few hours inside at most a night would tell him the time was worth spending if he could be allowed to spend it to begin his hunt he needed a few words a name a placea location on the coastline an access code that led back to bahrain something he had to get inside that compound tonight the executions were to be resumed three days from tomorrow at ten oclock in the morning first the papers from a man called elbaz the ruins of the old portuguese fortress rose eerily into the dark sky a jagged silhouette that bespoke the strength and resolve of seagoing adventurers of centuries past evan walked rapidly through the area of the city known as harat waljat towards the market of sabat aynub the name translated freely as the basket of grapes a marketplace far more structured than a bazaar with wellkept shops lining the square the architecture bewildering for it was an amalgam of early arabic persian indian and the most modern of western influences all these thought kendrick would fade one day an omani presence to be restored once again confirming the impermanence of conquerorsmilitary political or terrorist it was the last that concerned him now the mahdi he entered the large square a roman fountain was sending sprays of water above a dark circular pool in whose centre stood a statue of some italian sculptors concept of a desert sheik striding forward robes flowing going nowhere but it was the crowds that stole evans attention most were male arabs merchants catering for the rich and foolhardy europeans tourists indifferent to the chaos at the embassy marked by their western clothes and profusion of gold bracelets and chains glistening symbols of defiance in a city gone mad the omanis however were like animated robots forcing themselves to concentrate on the inconsequential their ears blocking out the constant gunfire from the american embassy less than a halfmile away everywhere their eyes blinked and squinted incessantly brows frowning in disbelief and disassociation what was happening in their peaceful masqat was beyond their understanding they were no part of the madness no part at all so they did their best to shut it out he saw it balawa bohrtooan orange baklava the specialty of the bakery the turkishstyle small brown shop with a succession of minarets painted above the glass of the shopfront was sandwiched between a large brightly lit jewelry store and an equally fashionable boutique devoted to leather goods the name paris scattered in black and gold signs beyond the glass in front of ascending blocks of luggage and accessories kendrick walked diagonally across the square past the fountain and approached the door of the bakery your people were right said the darkhaired woman in the tailored black suit walking out of the shadows of the harat waljat the miniature camera in her hand she raised it and pressed the shutterrelease the automatic advance took successive photographs as evan kendrick entered the bakery shop in the market of sabat aynub was he noticed in the bazaar she asked replacing the camera in her bag addressing the short robed middleaged arab who cautiously stood behind her there was talk about a man running into the alley after the police said the informant his eyes on the bakery it was contradicted convincingly i believe how he was seen but in the excitement he was not seen rushing out clasping his wallet which was presumably taken by the pigs that was the information emphatically exclaimed by our man to the onlookers naturally others emphatically agreed for hysterical people will always leap on new information unknown to a crowd of strangers it elevates them youre very good said the woman laughing softly so are your people we had better be ya anisa khalehla responded the arab using the omani title of respect if we are less than that we face alternatives wed rather not consider why the bakery asked khalehla any ideas none whatsoever i detest baklava the honey doesnt drip it pours the jews like it you know so do i then you both forget what the turks did to youboth i dont think our subject went into that bakery for either baklava or an historical treatise on the turks versus the tribes of egypt and israel a daughter of cleopatra speaks the informant smiled this daughter of cleopatra doesnt know what the hell youre talking about im just trying to learn things then start with the military car that picked up your subject several blocks north of his hotel after the praters of el maghreb it has considerable significance he must have friends in the army there is only the sultans garrison in masqat so the officers are rotated bimonthly between the city and the posts at jiddah and marmul as well as a dozen or so garrisons along the borders of south yemen whats your point i present you with two points khalehla the first is that i find it unbelievably coincidental that the subject after four or five years would so conveniently know a certain friend in the relatively small rotating officer corps stationed this specific fortnight in masqat in an officer corps that changes with the years unusually coincidental i agree but certainly possible whats your second point actually it negates my mentioning the first these days no vehicle from the masqat garrison would pick up a foreigner in the manner he was picked up in the guise he was picked up without supreme authority the sultan who else he wouldnt dare hes boxed a wrong move and hed be held responsible for whatever executions take place if that happens the americans would level masqat to the ground he knows that perhaps he also knows that he is held responsible both for what he does do as well as for what he does not in such a situation its better to know what others are doing if only to offer guidanceor to abort some unproductive activity with one more execution khalehla looked hard at the informant in the dim light of the squares periphery if that military car took the subject to a meeting with the sultan it also brought him back yes it did agreed the middleaged man his voice flat as if he understood the implication which means that whatever the subject proposed was not rejected out of hand it would appear so ya anisa khalehla and we have to know what was proposed dont we it would be dangerous in the extreme for all of us not to know said the arab nodding we are dealing with more than the deaths of two hundred and thirtysix americans we are dealing with the destiny of a nation my nation i should add and i shall do my best to see that it remains ours do you understand me my dear khalehla i do ya sahib el aumer better a dead cipher than a catastrophic shock i understand do you really you had far more advantages in your mediterranean than we ever had in our obscure gulf it is our time now we wont let anyone stop us i want you to have your time dear friend we want you to have it then do what you must do ya sahbtee khalehla i will the welltailored woman reached into her shoulder bag and took out a shortbarrelled automatic holding it in her left hand she again searched her bag and removed a clip of bullets with a pronounced click she jammed it into the base of the handle and snapped back the loading chamber the weapon was ready to fire go now adeem sahbee she said securing the strap of her bag over her shoulder her hand inside gripping the automatic we understand each other and you must be somewhere else some place where others can see you not here salaam aleikum khalehla go with allah ill send him to allah to plead his case quickly hes coming out of the bakery ill follow him and do what has to be done you have perhaps ten to fifteen minutes to be with others away from here at the last you protect us dont you you are a treasure be careful dear khalehla tell him to be careful he intrudes ill go to the zwadi mosque and talk with the elder mullahs and muezzins holy eyes are not questioned it is a short distance five minutes at most aleikum essalaam said the woman starting across the square to her left her gaze riveted on the american in arabian robes who had passed beyond the fountain and was walking rapidly towards the dark narrow streets to the east beyond the market of sabat aynub what is that damn fool doing she thought as she removed her hat crushing it with her left hand and shoving it into her bag next to the weapon which she gripped feverishly in her right hes heading into the mish kwayis ishshari she concluded mixing her thoughts in arabic and english referring to what is called in the west the roughest section of the town an area outsiders avoid they were right hes an amateur and i cant go in there dressed like this but i have to my god hell get us both killed evan kendrick hurried down the uneven layers of stone that was the narrow street past low rundown congested buildings and halfbuildingscrumbling structures with canvas and animal skins covering blownout windows those that remained intact were protected by slatted shutters more broken than not bare wires sagged everywhere municipal junction boxes having been spliced electricity stolen dangerous the pungent smells of arabic cooking intermingled with stronger odours unmistakable odourshashish burning coca leaves smuggled into unpatrolled coves in the gulf and pockets of human waste the inhabitants of this stretch of ghetto moved slowly cautiously suspiciously through the dimly lit caverns of their world at home with its degradation comfortable with its insulated dangers at ease with their collective status as outcaststhe ease confirmed by sudden bursts of laughter behind shuttered windows the dress code of this mish kwayis ishshari was anything but consistent abas and ghotras coexisted with torn blue jeans forbidden miniskirts and the uniforms of sailors and soldiers from a dozen different nationssoiled uniforms exclusively from the ranks of enlisted personnel although it was said that many an officer borrowed a subordinates clothes to venture inside and taste the prohibited pleasures of the neighbourhood men huddled in doorways to evans annoyance for they obscured the barely legible numbers on the sandstone walls he was further annoyed by the filthy intersecting alleys that unaccountably caused the numbers to skip from one section of the street to the next elbaz number shari el balahthe street of dates where was it there it was a deeply recessed heavy door with thick iron bars across a closed slot that was built into the upper panel at eye level however a man in dishevelled robes squatting diagonally against the stone blocked the door on the right side of the tunnellike entrance esmahlee said kendrick excusing himself and stepping forward lay replied the hunched figure asking why i have an appointment continued evan in arabic im expected who sends you said the man without moving thats not your concern i am not here to receive such an answer the arab raised his back angling it against the door the robes of his aba parted slightly revealing the handle of a pistol tucked into an undersash again who sends you evan wondered whether the sultans police officer had forgotten to give him a name or a code or a password that would gain him entrance he had so little time he did not need this obstruction he reached for an answer i visited a bakery in the sabat aynub he said rapidly i spoke a bakery broke in the squatting man his brows arched beneath his headdress there are at least three bakeries in the sabat aynub goddamn it baklaval spat out kendrick his frustration mounting his eyes on the handle of the gun some asinine orange enough said the guard abruptly rising to his feet and pulling his robes together it was a simple reply to a simple question sir a baker sent you you see all right fine may i go inside please first we must determine whom you visit whom do you visit sir for gods sake the man who lives here works here he is a man without a name are you entitled to know it evans intense whisper carried over the street noises beyond a fair question sir said the arab nodding pensively however since i was aware of a baker in the sabat aynub christ on a raft exploded kendrick all right his name is elbaz now will you let me in im in a hurry it will be my pleasure to alert the resident sir he will let you in if it is his pleasure certainly you can understand the necessity for it was as far as the ponderous guard got before snapping his head towards the pavement outside the undercurrent of noises from the dark street had suddenly erupted a man screamed others roared their strident voices echoing off the surrounding stone elhahoonai udam and then piercing the chorus of outrage was a womans voice siboomi jihalee she cried frantically demanding to be left alone then came in perfect english you bastards evan and the guard rushed to the edge of the stone as two gunshots shattered the human cacophony escalating it into frenzy the ominous rings of ricocheting bullets receding in the cavernous distance the arab guard spun around hurling himself to the hard stone floor of the entranceway kendrick crouched he had to know three robed figures accompanied by a young man and woman dressed in slovenly western clothes raced past the male in torn khaki trousers clutching his bleeding arm evan stood up and cautiously peered around the edge of the stone corner what he saw astonished him in the shadows of the confining street stood a bareheaded woman a shortbladed knife in her left hand her right gripping an automatic slowly kendrick stepped out on the uneven layers of stone their eyes met and locked the woman raised her gun evan froze trying desperately to decide what to do and when to do it knowing that if he moved quickly she would fire instead to his further astonishment she began stepping backward into the deeper shadows her weapon still levelled at him suddenly with the approach of excited voices punctuated by the repeated penetrating sounds of a shrill whistle the woman turned and raced away down the dark narrow street in seconds she had disappeared she had followed him to kill him why who was she here in a panicked whisper the guard was calling him evan whipped his head around the arab was gesturing wildly for him to come to the heavy forbidding door in the recessed entranceway quickly sir you have gained admittance hurry you must not be observed here the door swung open and evan ran inside instantly pulled to his left by the strong hand of a very small man who shouted to the guard in the entranceway get away from here he cried quickly he added the diminutive arab slammed the door shut slapping in place two iron bolts as kendrick squinted his eyes in the dim light they were in some kind of foyer a wide rundown hallway with several closed doors set progressively down both sides of the corridor numerous small persian rugs covered the rough wood of the floorrugs kendrick mused which would bring very decent prices at any western auctionand on the walls were more rugs larger rugs that evan knew would bring small fortunes the man called elbaz put his profits into intricately woven treasures those who knew about such things would be instantly impressed that they were dealing with an important man the others which included most of the police and other regulating authorities would undoubtedly think that this secretive man covered his floors and his walls with touristcloth so as not to repair flaws in his residence the artist called elbaz knew his marketing procedures i am elbaz said the small slightly bent arab in english extending a veined large hand you are whoever you say you are and i am delighted to meet you preferably not with the name your revered parents gave you please come this way the second door on the right please it is our first and most vital procedure in truth the rest has been accomplished accomplished whats been accomplished asked evan the essentials answered elbaz the papers are prepared according to the information delivered to me what information who you may be what you may be where you might come from that is all i needed who gave this information to you i have no idea said the aged arab touching kendricks arm insinuating him down the foyer an unknown person instructing me over the telephone from where i know not however she used the proper words and i knew i was to obey she the gender was insignificant ya shaikh the words were all important come inside elbaz opened the door to a small photographic studio the equipment appeared out of date evans rapid appraisal was not lost on elbaz the camera on the left duplicates the grainy quality of government identification papers he explained which of course is as much due everywhere to government processing as it is to the eye of the camera here sit on the stool in front of the screen it will be painless and swift elbaz worked quickly and as the film was instant polaroid he had no difficulty selecting a print burning the others the old man put on a pair of thin surgical gloves held the single photo and gestured towards a widecurtained area beyond the stretched grey fabric that served as a screen approaching it he pulled back the heavy drapery revealing a blank distressed wall the appearance was deceiving placing his right foot next to a spot on the chipped floor moulding his gloved right hand reaching for another specific location above he simultaneously pressed both a jagged crack in the wall slowly separated the left side disappearing behind the curtain it stopped leaving a space roughly two feet wide the small purveyor of false papers stepped inside beckoning kendrick to follow him what evan saw now was as modern as any machine in his washington office and of even higher quality there were two large computers each with its own printer and four telephones in four different colours all with communication modems all situated on a long white table kept spotlessly clean in front of four typists chairs here said elbaz pointing to the computer on the left where the dark screen was alive with bright green letters see how privileged you are shaikh i was told to provide you with complete information and the sources thereof but not however with any written documents other than the papers themselves sit study yourself study myself asked kendrick you are a saudi from riyadh named amal bahrudi you are a construction engineer and there is some european blood in your veinsa grandfather i think its written on the screen european it explains your somewhat irregular features should anyone comment wait a minute evan bent over looking closer at the computer screen this is a real person he was he died last night in east berlinthat is the green telephone died last night east german intelligence controlled of course by the soviets will keep his death quiet for days perhaps weeks while their bureaucrats examine everything with an eye to kgb advantage naturally in the meantime mr bahrudis arrival here has been duly entered on our immigration liststhats the blue telephonewith a visa good for thirty days so if anyone runs a check added kendrick this bahrudi is legitimately here and not dead in east berlin exactly what happens if im caught that would hardly concern you youd be an immediate corpse but the russians could make trouble for us here theyd know im not bahrudi could they would they the old arab shrugged never pass up an opportunity to confuse or embarrass the kgb ya shaikh evan paused frowning i think i see what you mean how did you get all this for gods sake a dead saudi in east berlincovered uphis dossier even some grandfather a european grandfather its unbelievable believe my young friend whom i do not know nor have ever met of course there must be confederates in many places for men like me but that is not your concern either simply study the salient factsrevered parents names schools universities two i believe one in the united states so like the saudis you wont need any more than that if you do it wont matter youll be dead kendrick walked out of the underworld city within a city skirting the grounds of the waljat hospital in the northeast section of masqat he was less than yards from the gates of the american embassy the wide street was now only half filled with diehard spectators the torches and the rapid bursts of gunfire from within the grounds of the embassy created the illusion that the crowds were much larger and more hysterical than they actually were such witnesses to the terror inside were interested only in entertainment their ranks thinned as one by one they were overcome by sleep ahead less than a quarter of a mile beyond the harat waljat a calm passed over the young sultans seaside mansion evan looked at his watch the hour and his location were an advantage he had so little time and ahmat had to move quickly he looked for a street phone vaguely remembering that there were several near the hospital entrancethanks again to manny weingrass twice the reprobate old architect had claimed his brandy was poisoned and once an omani woman had bitten his wandering hand so severely that he required seven stitches the white plastic shells of three public phones in the distance reflected the light from the streetlamps gripping the inside pocket of his robes where he had put his false papers he broke into a run then immediately slowed down instinct told him not to appear obvious or threatening he reached the first booth inserted a larger coin than was necessary and dialed the strange number indelibly printed on his mind beads of sweat formed at his hairline as the progressively slower rings reached eight two more and an answering machine would replace the human voice please iwah came the simple greeting saying yes english said evan so quickly replied ahmat astonished what is it first things first a woman followed me the light was dim but from what i could see she was of medium height with long hair and dressed in what looked like expensive western clothes also she was fluent in both arabic and english anybody come to mind if you mean someone who would follow you into elbazs neighbourhood absolutely no one why i think she meant to kill me what and a woman gave elbaz the information about meover a telephone of course i know that could there be a connection how someone moving in someone looking to steal false papers i hope not said ahmat firmly the woman who spoke to elbaz was my wife i would not trust your presence here with anyone else thank you for that but someone else knows im here you spoke to four men evan and one of them our mutual friend mustapha was killed i agree that someone else knows youre here its why the other three are under twentyfourhour surveillance perhaps you should stay out of sight in hiding for at least a day i can arrange it and we might learn something also i have something i must discuss with you it concerns this amal bahrudi go in hiding for a day i think that would be best dont you no answered kendrick his voice hollow at what he was about to say out of sight yes but not in hiding i dont understand i want to be arrested seized as a terrorist i want to be thrown into that compound youve got somewhere ive got to get in there tonight the icarus agenda chapter the robed figure raced down the middle of the wide avenue known as the wadi al kabir he had burst out of the darkness from beyond the massive mathaib gate several hundred yards from the waterfront west of the ancient portuguese fortress called the mirani his robes were drenched with the oil and flotsam of the harbour his headdress clinging to the back of his wet hair to observersand there were still many in the street at this late hourthe desperately running man was one more dog from the sea an alien who had leaped from a ship to gain illegal entrance into this oncepeaceful sultanate a fugitiveor a terrorist strident eruptions of a twonote siren grew louder as a patrol car careened around the corner from the wadi al uwar into the al kabir the chase was joined a police informant had betrayed the point of entry and the authorities were ready these days they were always ready ready and eager and frenzied a blinding light split the dimly lit street its beam coming from a movable lamp mounted on the patrol car the powerful light caught the panicky illegal immigrant he spun to his left facing a series of shops their dark fronts protected by iron shutters protection that had not been thought of barely three weeks ago the man pivoted lurching across the al kabir to his right suddenly he stopped blocked by a number of latenight strollers who moved together stood together their stares not without fear but somehow collectively saying they had had enough they wanted their city back a short man in a business suit but in arab headdress stepped forwardcautiously to be sure but with purpose two larger men in robes perhaps more cautiously but with equal purpose joined him followed hesitantly by others down the al kabir to the south a crowd had gathered tentatively they formed a line robed men and veiled women creating a human wall across the street courage reluctantly summoned from both exasperation and fury it all had to stop get away spread out he may have grenades a police officer had jumped out of the patrol car and was racing forward his automatic weapon levelled at the quarry disperse roared a second policeman sprinting down the left side of the street dont get caught in our fire the cautious strollers and the hesitant crowd beyond scattered in all directions running for the protection of distance and the shelter of doorways as if on cue the fugitive grappled with his drenched robes pulling them apart and menacingly reaching inside the folds of cloth a rapid staccato burst of gunfire shattered the al kabir the fugitive screamed calling on the powers of a furious allah and a vengeful al fatah as he gripped his shoulder arched his neck and dropped to the ground he seemed to be dead but in the dim light no one could determine the extent of his wounds he screamed again a roar summoning the furies of all islam to descend on the hordes of impure unbelievers everywhere the two police officers fell on him as the patrol car skidded to a stop its tyres screeching a third policeman leaped from the open rear door shouting orders disarm him search him his two subordinates had anticipated both commands it could be he added the superior officer crouching to examine the fugitive more closely his voice even louder than before there he continued still shouting strapped to his thigh a packet give it to me the onlookers slowly rose in the semidarkness curiosity drawing them back to the furious activity taking place in the middle of the al kabir under the dim wash of the streetlights i believe you are right sir yelled the policeman on the prisoners left here this mark it could be what remains of the scar across his neck bahrudi roared the ranking police officer in triumph as he studied the papers ripped from the oil cloth packet amal bahrudi the trusted one he was last seen in east berlin and by allah we have him all of you yelled the policeman kneeling to the right of the fugitive addressing the mesmerized crowd leave get away this pig may have protectorshe is the infamous bahrudi the eastern european terrorist we have radioed for soldiers from the sultans garrisonget away dont be killed the witnesses fled a disjointed stampede racing south on the al kabir they had summoned up courage but the prospect of a gun battle panicked them all was uncertainty punctuated by death the only thing the crowd was certain of was that a notorious international terrorist named amal bahrudi had been captured the word will spread quickly in our small city said the sergeantofpolice in fluent english helping the prisoner to his feet we will help of course if it is necessary ive got a question or twomaybe three evan untied the headdress removing it over his head and stared at the police officer what the hell was all that stuff about the trusted one the islamic leader of east european whateveritwas apparently the truth sir im way behind you in the car please time is vital we must leave here i want answers the two other policemen walked up beside the congressman from colorado gripped his arms and escorted him to the back door of the patrol car i played that little charade the way i was told to play it continued evan climbing into the green police car but someone forgot to mention that this real person whose name im assuming is some killer whos throwing bombs around europe i can only tell you what ive been told to tell you which truthfully is all i know replied the sergeant settling his uniformed figure beside kendrick everything will be explained to you at the laboratory in the compound headquarters i know about the laboratory i dont know about this bahrudi he exists sir i know that but not the rest of it hurry driver said the police officer the other two will remain here the green car lurched in reverse made a uturn and sped back towards the wadi al uwar all right hes real i understand that pressed kendrick rapidly breathlessly but i repeat no one said anything about his being a terrorist at the headquarters laboratory sir the police sergeant lit a brown arabian cigarette inhaled deeply and expunged the smoke through his nostrils in relief his part of the strange assignment was over there was a great deal that elbazs computer did not print out for your eyes said the omani doctor studying evans bare shoulder they were alone in the laboratoryexamining room kendrick sitting on the elongated hardcushioned table his feet resting on a footstool his money belt beside him as ahmatsforgive methe great sultans personal physicianwhich i have been since he was eight years old i am now your only contact to him in the event you cannot for whatever reason reach him yourself is that understood how do i reach you the hospital or my private number which i will give you when we are finished you must remove your trousers and undergarment and apply the dye ya shaikh strip searches are a daily often hourly occurrence in that compound you must be all one flesh colour and certainly no canvas belt filled with money youll hold it for me certainly back to this bahrudi please said kendrick applying the skindarkening gel to his thighs and lower regions as the omani physician did the same to his arms chest and back why didnt elbaz tell me ahmats instructions he thought you might object so he wished to explain it to you himself i spoke to him less than an hour ago he didnt say anything except he wanted to talk about this bahrudi thats all you were also in a great hurry and he had much to organize in order to bring about your socalled capture therefore he left the explanation to me lift your arm up higher please whats the explanation asked evan less angry now quite simply if you were taken by the terrorists youd have a fallback position at least for a while with luck providing enough time to help youif help was at all possible what fallback position youd be considered one of them until they learned otherwise bahrudis dead his corpse is in the hands of the kgb added the doctor instantly overriding kendricks words the komitet is notoriously indecisive afraid of embarrassment elbaz mentioned something about that if anyone in masqat would know it is elbaz so if bahrudi is accepted here in oman if im accepted as this bahrudi i might have some leverage if the soviets dont blow the whistle and tell what they know they will exhaustively examine the whistle before bringing it near their lips they cant be certain they will fear a trap a trap of embarrassment of course and wait for developments your other arm please lift it straight up please question said evan firmly if amal bahrudi supposedly went through your immigration why wasnt he picked up youve got one hell of a security force out there these days how many john smiths are there in your country ya shaikh so bahrudi is a fairly common arabic name more so perhaps in cairo than riyadh but nevertheless not unusual amal is the equivalent of your joe or bill or of course john still elbaz entered him in the immigration computers flags would leap up and rapidly return to their recesses broke in the omani the officials satisfied by observation and harsh if routine questioning because theres no scar on my neck asked evan quickly one of the police in the al kabir made a point of a scar across my neckbahrudis neck that is information i know nothing about but i suppose its possible you have no such scar but there are more fundamental reasons such as a terrorist does not announce his arrival in a foreign land much less a troubled one he uses false papers thats what the authorities look for not the coincidence of one john w booth a pharmacist from philadelphia who was cursed with the same name as the assassin from fords theatre youre pretty well versed in things american arent you johns hopkins medical school mr bahrudi courtesy of our sultans father who found a bedouin child eager for more than a wandering tribal existence how did that happen it is another story you may lower your arm now evan looked at the doctor youre very fond of the sultan i gather the omani physician returned kendricks gaze i would kill for the family ya shaikh he said softly of course the method would be nonviolent perhaps poison or a misdiagnosed medical crisis or a reckless scalpelsomething to repay my debt in kindbut i would do it im sure you would and by extension then youre on my side obviously the proof i am to give you and which was previously unknown to me comes numerically five five fivezero zero zero five thats good enough whats your name faisal dr amal faisal i see what you meanjohn smith kendrick got off the examining table and walked naked to a small sink across the room he washed his hands kneading them with strong soap to remove the excess stains from his fingers and studied his body in the mirror above the basin the undarkened white flesh was turning brown in moments it would be dark enough for the terrorist compound he looked at the doctor reflected in the glass how is it in there he said it is no place for you thats not what i asked i want to know what its like are there rites of passage any rituals they go through with new prisoners you must have the place wiredyoud be fools if you dont its wired and we have to assume they know it they crowd around the door where the main taps are and make a great deal of noise the ceiling is too high for audible transmission and the remaining taps are in the flushing mechanisms of the toiletsa civilizing reform instituted by ahmat several years ago replacing the floor holes those microphones have been useless as if the inmates had discovered them alsowe dont know this of course however what little we hear is not pleasant the prisoners like all extremists continuously vie for who is the most zealous and as there are constant newcomers many do not know each other as a result the questions are severe and pointed the methods of interrogation often brutal theyre fanatics but not fools in the accepted sense ya shaikh vigilance is their credo infiltration a constant threat to them then itll be my credo kendrick crossed back to the examining table and the neat pile of prison clothes provided for him my vigilance he continued as fanatical as anyones in there he turned to the omani i need the names of the leaders inside the embassy i wasnt permitted to make any notes from the briefing papers but i memorized two because they were repeated several times one was abu nassir the other abbas zaher do you have any more nassir hasnt been seen for over a week they believe hes gone and zaher is not considered a leader merely a showoff recently the most prominent appears to be a woman named zaya yateem shes fluent in english and reads the televised bulletins what does she look like who can tell she wears a veil anyone else a young man whos usually behind her he seems to be her companion and carries a russian weaponi dont know what kind his name he is called simply azra blue the colour blue yes and speaking of colours theres another a man with premature grey streaks in his hairquite unusual for one of us he is called ahbyahd white said evan yes hes been identified as one of the hijackers of the twa plane in beirut only by photographs however no name was uncovered nassir the woman yateem blue and white that should be enough for what asked the doctor for what im going to do think about what youre doing said the doctor softly watching evan draw up the loosefitting prison trousers with the elastic waistband ahmat is torn for we might learn a great deal by your sacrificebut you must understand it could well be your sacrifice he wants you to know that im no fool either kendrick put on the grey prison shirt and slipped into the hard leather sandals common to arab jails if i feel threatened ill yell for help you do and theyll be on you like crazed animals you wouldnt survive ten seconds no one could reach you in time all right a code evan buttoned the coarse shirt while looking around the police laboratory his eyes fell on several xrays suspended on a string if your people monitoring the taps hear me say that films were smuggled out of the embassy move in and get me out understood films smuggled out of the embassy thats it i wont say it or shout it unless i think theyre closing in on me now let the word go inside tell the guards to taunt the prisoners amal bahrudi leader of the islamic terrorists in east europe has been captured here in oman your bright young sultans strategy for my temporary protection can make a big leap forward its my passport into their rotten world it was not designed for that but its damn convenient isnt it almost as though ahmat had it in mind before i did come to think of it he might have why not thats ridiculous protested the doctor both palms raised towards evan listen to me we can all theorize and postulate as much as we like but we cannot guarantee that compound is guarded by soldiers and we cannot see into the soul of each man suppose there are sympathizers look at the streets crazed animals awaiting the next execution wagering bets america is not loved by every citizen in an aba or conscript in uniform there are too many stories too much talk of antiarab bias over there ahmat said the same thing about his own garrison here in masqat only he called it looking into their eyes the eyes hold the secrets of the soul ya shaikh and the sultan was right we live in constant fear of weakness and betrayal here within these soldiers are young impressionable quick to make judgments about real or imagined insults suppose just suppose the kgb decides to send in a message to further destabilize the situation amal bahrudi is dead the man claiming to be him is an impostor there would be no time for codes or cries for help and the manner of your death should not be contemplated lightly ahmat should have thought of that unfair cried faisal you ascribe to him things he never dreamed of the bahrudi alias was to be used only as a diversionary tactic in the last extremity not for anything else the fact that ordinary citizens could publicly state that they witnessed the capture of a terrorist even to the point of naming him would create confusion that was the strategy confusion bewilderment indecision if only to delay your execution for a few hourswhatever time might be used to extricate you a single individualthat was ahmats intention not infiltration evan leaned against the table his arms folded studying the omani then i dont understand and i mean that doctor im not looking for demons but i think theres a lapse in your explanation what is it if finding me the name of a terroristan unaccountedfor dead terroristwas to be my fallback position as you called it your temporary protection as you so rightfully called it interrupted faisal then supposejust supposei hadnt been around to act in that little melodrama on the al kabir tonight you were never meant to replied the doctor calmly you simply moved up the schedule it was to take place not at midnight but in the early morning hours just before the prayers near the mosque of khor the word of bahrudis capture would have spread through the markets like the news of a shipment of cheap contraband on the waterfront another would have posed as the impostor you are that was the plan nothing else then as the lawyers would say theres a convenient convergence of objectives rearranged in time and purpose so as to accommodate all parties without conflict i hear phrases like that in washington all the time very sharp i am a doctor ya shaikh not a lawyer to be sure agreed evan smiling faintly but i wonder about our young friend in the palace he wanted to discuss amal bahrudi i wonder where that discussion would have led us hes not a lawyer either he has to be everything to run this place said kendrick sharply he has to think especially now were wasting time doctor mess me up a bit not the eyes or the mouth but around the cheeks and the chin then cut into my shoulder and bandage it but dont dry the blood i beg your pardon for christs sake im not going to do it myself the heavy steel door sprang back yanked by two soldiers who instantly placed their arms against the exterior iron plate as if expecting an assault on the exit a third guard hurled the wounded still bleeding prisoner into the huge concrete hall that served as a mass cell what light there was was subdued provided by lowwattage bulbs encased in wire mesh and bolted to the ceiling a group of inmates instantly converged on the new entry several gripping the shoulders of the bloody disfigured man awkwardly trying to rise from his knees others huddled around the imposing metal door chattering loudly among themselveshalf shrieking actuallyapparently to drown out whatever was being said inside the compound khalee balak roared the newcomer his right arm lashing upward to free itself then with a tight fist pummelling the face of a young prisoner whose grimace revealed rotted teeth by allah ill break the head of any imbecile here who touches me continued kendrick screaming in arabic and rising to his full height which was several inches taller than the tallest man around him we are many and you are one hissed the offended youngster pinching his nose to stop the bleeding you may be many but you are lovers of shegoats you are stupid get away from me i must think with his last explosive remark evan slammed his left arm against those holding it then instantly pulled it back and thrust his elbow into the throat of the nearest prisoner holding him with his stillclenched right fist he swung around and hammered his knuckles into the mans unsuspecting eyes he could not remember when he had last hit another person physically attacked another human being if his flashing memories were correct it went back to junior school a boy named peter somebodyorother had hidden his best friends lunchboxa tin box with walt disney characters on itand because his friend was small and peter somebodyorother was bigger than his best friend he had challenged the bully unfortunately in his anger he had beaten the boy named peter so severely that the principal called his father and both adults told him he was terribly wrong a young man of his size did not pick fights it wasnt fair but sir dad no appeal he had to accept twenty demerit points but then his father said if it happens again son do it again it happened again someone grabbed his neck from behind lifesaving procedure why did it come to mind pinch the nerve under the elbow it releases the grip of a drowning man red crosssenior lifesaving certificate summer money on the lake in panic he slid his hand down the exposed arm reached the soft flesh under the elbow and pressed with all the strength that was in him the terrorist screamed it was enough kendrick hunched his shoulders and threw the man over his back slamming him down on to the cement floor do any of you want more whispered the newest prisoner harshly crouching turning his height still apparent you are fools if it werent for you idiots i would not have been taken i despise all of you now leave me alone i told you i must think who are you to insult us and give us orders screeched a wildeyed postadolescent a harelip impeding his diction it was all a scene out of kafkahalfcrazed prisoners prone to instant violence yet nervously aware of more brutal punishment from the guards whispers became harsh commands suppressed insults screams of defiance while those who spoke looked continuously towards the door making sure the babble beyond covered whatever they said keeping it from eavesdropping enemy ears i am who i am and that is enough for shegoat fools the guards told us your name stammered another inmate this one perhaps thirty with an unkempt beard and long filthy hair he cupped his lips with his hands as though they would stifle his words amal bahrudil they yelled the trusted one from east berlin and weve caught him so what who are you to us i dont even like the way you look you look very odd to me what is an amal bahrudi why should we care kendrick glanced over at the door and the agitated group of prisoners talking excitedly he took a step forward again whispering harshly because i was sent by others much higher than anyone here or in the embassy much much higher now im telling you for the last time let me think i have to get information out you try and youll put us all in front of a firing squad exclaimed another prisoner through his teeth he was short and strangely well groomed except for unaccountable splotches of urine staining his prison trousers that bothers you replied evan staring at the terrorist his voice low and filled with loathing it was the moment to establish his credo further tell me pretty little boy are you afraid to die only because i could no longer serve our cause gushed the boyman defensively his eyes darting about seeking justification a few in the crowd agreed there were emotional kneejerk nods from those close enough to hear him swept up in his fears kendrick wondered how pervasive was this deviation from zealotry keep your voice down you fool said evan icily your martyrdom is service enough he turned and walked through the hesitantly parting bodies to the stone wall of the immense cell where there was an open rectangular window with iron bars embedded in the concrete not so fast oddlooking one the rough voice barely heard above the noise came from the outer fringes of the crowd a stocky bearded man stepped forward those in front of him gave way as men casually do in the presence of a noncommissioned superiora sergeant or a foreman perhaps not a colonel or a corporate vice president was there someone with more authority in that compound wondered evan someone else watching closely someone else giving orders what is it asked kendrick quietly abrasively i also dont like the way you look i dont like your face thats enough for me enough for what said evan contemptuously dismissing the man with a shrug of his head as he leaned into the wall his hands gripping the iron bars of the small cell window his gaze on the floodlit grounds outside turn around ordered the surrogate foreman or sergeant in a harsh voice directly behind him ill turn when i care to said kendrick wondering if he was heard now rejoined the man in a voice no louder than evansa quiet prelude to his strong hand suddenly crashing down on kendricks right shoulder gripping the flesh around the bleeding wound dont touch me thats an order evan shouted holding his ground his hands gripping the iron bars so as not to betray the pain he felt his antennae alert for what he wanted to learn it came the fingers clenching his shoulder spastically separated the hand fell away on evans command but tentatively returned a moment later it revealed enough the noncom gave orders bluntly yet he received and executed them with alacrity when they were given by an authoritative voice enough he was not the man here in the compound he was high on the totem pole but not high enough was there really another a further test was called for kendrick stood rigid then without motion or warning swung swiftly around to his right ignominiously dislodging the hand as the stocky man was thrown off balance by the clockwise movement all right he spat out his sharp whisper not a statement but an accusation what is it about me you dont like ill convey your judgment to others im sure theyll be interested for they would like to know whos making judgments here in masqat evan again paused then abruptly continued his voice rising in a oneonone challenge those judgments are considered by many to be curdled in asss milk what is it imbecile what dont you like about me i do not make judgments shouted the muscular terrorist as defensively as the boyman who feared a firing squad then just as quickly as his outburst had erupted the wary sergeantforeman momentarily frightened that his words might have been heard above the babble regained his suspicious composure youre free with words he whispered hoarsely squinting his eyes but they mean nothing to us how do we know who you are or where you come from you dont even look like one of us you look different i move in circles you dont move incant move in i can he has lightcoloured eyes the stifled cry came from the older bearded prisoner with the long filthy hair who was peering forward hes a spy hes come to spy on us others crowded in studying the suddenly more menacing stranger kendrick slowly turned his head towards his accuser so might you have these eyes if your grandfather was european if i cared to change them for your grossly stupid benefit a few drops of fluid would have been sufficient for a week naturally youre not aware of such techniques you have words for everything dont you said the sergeantforeman liars are free with words for they cost nothing except ones life replied evan moving his eyes staring at individual faces which i have no intention of losing you are afraid to die then challenged the wellgroomed youngster with the soiled trousers you yourself answered that question for me i have no fear of deathnone of us should havebut i do fear not accomplishing what ive been sent here to accomplish i fear that greatlyfor our most holy cause words again choked the stocky wouldbe leader annoyed that a number of the prisoners were listening to the strangelooking euroarab with the fluid tongue what is this thing you are to accomplish here in masqat if we are so stupid why dont you tell us enlighten us i will speak only to those i was told to find no one else i think you should speak to me said the sergeantnow more sergeant than foremanas he took a menacing step towards the rigid american congressman we do not know you but you may know us that gives you an advantage i dont like and i dont like your stupidity said kendrick immediately gesturing with both hands one pointing to his right ear the other at the moving chattering crowd by the door cant you understand he exclaimed his whisper a shout into the mans face you could be heard you must admit you are stupid oh yes we are that sir the sergeantdefinitely a sergeantturned his head looking at an unseen figure somewhere in the huge concrete cell evan tried to follow the mans gaze with his height he saw a row of open toilets at the end of the hall several were in use each occupants eyes watching the excitement other inmates curious many frantic rushed alternately between the loud group by the heavy door and the crowd around the new prisoner but then sir great sir continued the heavyset terrorist mockingly we have methods to overcome our stupidity you should give inferior people credit for such things i give credit when it is due our account is due now suddenly the muscular fanatic shot up his left arm it was a cue and with the signal voices swelled raised in an islamic chant followed instantly by a dozen others and then more until the entire compound was filled with the reverberating echoes of fiftyodd zealots shrieking the praises of the obscure stations leading into the arms of allah and then it happened a sacrifice was in the making bodies fell on him fists crashed into his abdomen and face he could not screamhis lips were clamped by strong clawlike fingers the flesh stretched until he thought his mouth would be torn away the pain was excruciating and then abruptly his lips were free his mouth halfway in place tell us screamed the sergeantterrorist into kendricks ear his words lost to the wiretaps by the wildly accelerating islamic chanting who are you what place in hell do you come from i am who i am shouted evan grimacing and holding on as long as he could manage convinced he knew the arabic mind believing a moment would come when respect for an enemys death would induce a few seconds of silence before the blow was administered it would be enough death was revered in islam by friend and adversary alike he needed those seconds he had to let the guards know oh christ he was being killed a clenched fist hammered down on his testicleswhen when would it stop for those few precious moments a blurred figure was suddenly above him bending over studying him another fist crashed into his left kidney the inward scream did not emerge from his mouth he could not permit it stop cried the voice of the blurred outline above tear off his shirt let me see his neck it is said there is a mark he cant wash away evan felt the cloth being ripped from his chest his breath sinking knowing the worst was about to be revealed there was no scar on his neck it is amal bahrudi intoned the man above the barely conscious kendrick heard the words and was stunned what do you look for asked the bewildered sergeantforeman furious what is not there said the echoing voice throughout europe amal bahrudi is marked by the scar on his throat a photograph was circulated to the authorities that was confirmed to be of him a picture obscuring the face but not the bare neck where the scar of a knife wound was in clear focus it had been his best cover an ingenious device of concealment you confuse me shouted the squatting stocky man his words nearly drowned out by the cacophonous chanting what concealment what scar a scar that never was a mark that never existed they all look for a lie this is bahrudi the blueeyed man who can take pain with silence the trusted one who moves about western capitals unnoticed because of the genes of a european grandfather word must have reached oman that he was reported to be on his way here but even so hell be released in the morning no doubt with great apologies you see there is no scar on his throat through the haze and the terrible pain evan knew it was the moment to react he forced a smile across his burning lips his light blue eyes centering on the blurred figure above a sane man he coughed in agony please get me up get them away from me before i see them all in hell amal bahrudi speaks asked the unknown man reaching out with his hand let him up no roared the sergeantterrorist plunging down and pinning kendricks shoulders theres no sense in what you say he is who he says he is because of a scar that does not exist wheres the sense in that i ask you i will know if he lies replied the figure above slowly coming into focus for kendrick the gaunt face was that of a man in his early twenties with high cheekbones and intense dark intelligent eyes flanking a sharp straight nose the body was slender bordering on thin but there was a supple strength in the way he crouched and held his head the muscles of his neck stood out let him up repeated the younger terrorist his voice casual but no less a command for that and instruct the others to gradually stop their chantinggradually you understandbut then keep talking among themselves all must appear normal including the incessant arguing which you dont have to encourage the angry subordinate gave evan a last shove into the floor widening the cut in his shoulder so severely that new blood burst out on to the concrete then the surly man got to his feet turning to the crowd to carry out his orders thank you said evan breathless trembling and getting to his knees wincing at the pain he felt everywhere conscious of the bruises on his face and body aware of the hot lacerations where his flesh had been puncturedagain seemingly everywhere i would have joined allah in a minute you still may which is why i wont bother to stem your bleeding the young palestinian shoved kendrick against the wall into a sitting position his legs stretched out on the floor you see i have no idea whether youre really amal bahrudi or not i acted on instinct from the descriptions ive heard you could be he and you speak an educated arabic which also fits in addition you withstood extreme punishment when a gesture of submission on your part would have meant you were prepared to deliver the information demanded of you instead you reacted with defiance and you must have known that at any moment you could have been strangled that is not the way of an infiltrator who values his life here on earth it is the way of one of us who will not harm the cause for as you remarked its a holy cause and it is most holy good god thought kendrick assuming the cold expression of a dedicated partisan how wrong you are if i had thoughtif id been able to think forget it what will finally convince you i tell you now i shall not reveal things i shouldnt evan paused his hand covering the swallow in his throat even to the point where you may resume the punishment and strangle me if you like both are statements i would expect said the intense slender terrorist lowering himself to crouch in front of evan you can however tell me what it is you came here for why were you sent to masqat whom were you told to find your life depends on your answers amal bahrudi and im the only one who can make that decision he had been right in spite of the odds he had been right escape he had to escape with this young killer in a holy cause the icarus agenda chapter kendrick stared at the palestinian as if indeed the eyes held the meaning of a mans soul although evans own eyes were too swollen to betray anything other than overwhelming physical pain the remaining taps are in the flushing mechanisms of the toilets dr amal faisal contact to the sultan i was sent here to tell you that among your people in the embassy there are traitors traitors the terrorist remained motionless in his crouching position in front of evan beyond a slight frown there was no reaction whatsoever thats impossible he said after several moments of intensely studying amal bahrudis face im afraid its not contradicted kendrick i saw the proof consisting of what evan suddenly winced grabbing his wounded shoulder his hand instantly covered with blood if you wont stop this bleeding i will he started to push himself up against the stone wall stay put commanded the young killer why why should i how do i know youre not part of the treasonmaking money out of our work money what money you wont know that until i know you have the right to be told again evan pressed himself against the wall his hands on the floor trying to rise you talk like a man but youre a boy i grew up quickly said the terrorist shoving his strange prisoner down again most of us have over here grow up now my bleeding to death will tell neither of us anything kendrick ripped the bloodsoaked shirt away from his shoulder its filthy he said nodding at the wound its filled with dirt and slime thanks to your animal friends theyre not animals and theyre not friends they are my brothers write poetry in your own time mines too valuable is there any water in hereclean water the toilets answered the palestinian theres a sink on the right help me up no what proof who were you sent to find fool exploded evan all right where is nassir everyone asks where is nassir dead replied the young man his expression without comment what a marine guard jumped him took his weapon and shot him the marine was killed instantly nothing was said what could be said that was productive countered the terrorist make a martyr out of a single american guard show one of our own to have been overcome we dont parade weakness nassir asked kendrick hearing a rueful note in the young killers voice nassir was weak he was a theoretician and not suited to this work a theoretician evan arched his brows our student is an analyst this student can determine those moments when active involvement must replace passive debate when force takes over from words nassir talked too much justified too much and you dont im not the issue you are what proof of treason do you have the woman yateem replied kendrick answering the former question not the current one zaya yateem i was told she was yateem a traitor cried the terrorist his eyes furious i didnt say that what did you say she was reliable far more than that amal bahrudi the young man grabbed the remaining cloth of evans shirt she is devoted to our cause a tireless worker who exhausts herself beyond any of us at the embassy she also speaks english said kendrick hearing still another note in the terrorists voice so do i shot back the angry selfproclaimed student releasing his prisoner within their prison i do too said evan quietly glancing over at the numerous groups of inmates many of whom were looking at them may we speak english now he asked once more studying his bleeding shoulder you say you want proof which of course is beyond my providing but i can tell you what ive seen with my own eyesin berlin you yourself can determine whether or not im telling you the truthsince youre so adept at determining things but i dont want any of your brother animals understanding what i say youre an arrogant man under circumstances that do not call for arrogance i am who i am youve said that the terrorist nodded english he agreed switching from arabic you spoke of yateem what about her you assumed i meant she was the traitor who dares i meant quite the opposite insisted kendrick wincing and gripping his shoulder with greater force shes trusted even extolled shes doing her job brilliantly after nassir she was the one i was to find evan gasped in pain an all too easy reflex and coughed out his next words if she had been killed i was to look for a man whos called azraif he was gone another with grey streaks in his hair known as ahbyahd i am azra cried the darkeyed student i am the one called blue bingo thought kendrick staring hard at the young terrorist his eyes questioning but youre here in this compound not at the embassy a decision of our operations council broke in azra headed by yateem i dont understand word reached us prisoners had been taken and held in isolationtortured bribed broken one way or another into revealing information it was decided that the strongest among us on the council should also be takento provide leadership resistance and they chose you she chose you zaya knew whereof she spoke she is my sister i her blood brother she is as certain of my dedication as i am of hers we fight together to our deaths for death is our past jackpot evan arched his neck his head falling against the hard concrete wall his pained eyes roaming across the ceiling with the naked bulbs encased in wire so i meet my vital contact in the most impossible place possible allah may have deserted us after all to hell with allah exclaimed azra astonishing kendrick youll be released in the morning there is no scar across your throat youll be free dont be so sure of that said evan wincing again and again grabbing his shoulder to put it plainly that photograph of me was traced to a jihad cell in rome and the scar is now questioned theyre searching riyadh and manamah for my early dental and medical records if any were overlooked if any are found ill be facing an israeli hangman however thats not your concern nor mine at the moment frankly at least your courage matches your arrogance i told you before snapped kendrick write poems in your own time if you are azra brother of yateem you need information you have to know what i saw in berlin the evidence of treason if not treason utter stupidity and if not stupidity unforgivable greed which is no less than treason evan started once more to rise pressing his back against the wall his hands against the floor this time the terrorist did not stop him damn you help me he cried i cant think like this i have to wash away the blood clear my eyes very well said the man called azra haltingly his expression conveying his intense curiosity lean on me he added without enthusiasm i only meant you to help me up said kendrick yanking his arm away once he was on his feet ill walk by myself thank you i dont need assistance from ignorant children you may need more assistance than im prepared to offer i forgot interrupted evan lurching making his way awkwardly towards the row of four toilets and the sink the student is both judge and jury as well as the right hand of allah whom he sends to the devil understand this man of faith said azra firmly staying close to the arrogant insulting stranger my war is not for or against allah abraham or christ it is a struggle to survive and live like a human being despite those who would destroy me with their bullets and their laws i speak for many when i say enjoy your faith practise it but do not burden me with it i have enough to contend with just trying to stay alive if only to fight one more day kendrick glanced at the angry young killer as they neared the sink i wonder if i should be talking to you he said narrowing his swollen eyes i wonder if perhaps you are not the azra i was sent to find believe it replied the terrorist in this work accommodations are made between people of many stripes many different purposes all taking from each other for very selfish reasons together we can accomplish more for our individual causes than we can separately we understand each other said kendrick no comment in his voice they reached the rusted metal sink evan turned on the single tap of cold water at full force then conscious of the noise reduced the flow as he plunged his hands and face into the stream he splashed the water everywhere over his upper body dousing his head and chest and repeatedly around the bleeding wound in his shoulder he prolonged the bathing sensing azras growing impatience as the palestinian shifted his weight from foot to foot knowing that the moment would come the remaining taps are in the flushing mechanisms of the toilets the moment came enough exploded the frustrated terrorist gripping kendricks unharmed shoulder and spinning him away from the sink give me your information what you saw in berlin now what is this proof of treason or stupidity or greed what is it there has to be more than one person involved began evan coughing each cough more pronounced more violent his whole body trembling as people leave they take them out suddenly kendrick bent over clutching his throat lurching for the first toilet to the left of the filthy sink im retching he cried grabbing the edges of the bowl with both hands take what out films spat out evan his voice directed towards the area around the toilets handle films smuggled out of the embassy for sale films photographs two rolls i intercepted them bought them both identities methods nothing further could be heard in the enormous concrete terrorist cell earshattering bells erupted deafening sounds signalling an emergency reverberated off the walls as a group of uniformed guards rushed in weapons levelled eyes frantically searching in seconds they spotted the object of their search six soldiers bolted forward towards the row of toilets never screamed the prisoner known as amal bahrudi kill me if you wish but you will learn nothing for you are nothing the first two guards approached kendrick lunged at them hurling his body at the stunned soldiers who thought they were rescuing an infiltrator about to be killed he swung his arms and smashed his fists into the confused faces mercifully a third soldier hammered the stock of his rifle into the skull of amal bahrudi all was darkness but he knew he was on the examining table in the prison laboratory he could feel the cold compresses on his eyes and ice packs over various parts of his body he reached up and removed the thick wet compresses faces above him came into focusbewildered faces angry faces he had no time for them faisal he choked speaking arabic where is faisal the doctor i am down here by your left foot answered the omani physician in english im sponging out a rather strange puncture wound someone bit you im afraid i can see his teeth said evan now also speaking english they were like those of a sawtoothed fish only yellow proper diets are lacking in this part of the world get everyone out doctor interrupted kendrick now weve got to talknow after what you did in there i doubt theyd leave and im not even sure id let them are you crazy they came to save your life and you tore into them fracturing one mans nose and breaking apart anothers bridgework i had to be convincing tell them thatno dont not yet get them out tell them anything you like but weve got to talk then you have to reach ahmat for me how long have i been here nearly an hour christ what time is it fourfifteen in the morning hurry for gods sake hurry faisal dismissed the soldiers with calming words reassuring them explaining that there were things he could not explain as the last guard went out of the door he paused removed his automatic from its holster and handed it to the doctor should i aim this at you while we talk asked the omani after the soldier had left before sunrise said kendrick pushing away the ice packs and sitting up painfully swinging his legs over the table i want a number of guns aimed at me but not as accurately as they might be what are you saying you cant be serious escape ahmat has to arrange an escape what you are crazy never saner doctor and never more serious pick two or three of your best men which means men you completely trust and set up some kind of transfer transfer evan shook his head and blinked his eyes the swelling still apparent although reduced by the cold compresses he tried to find the words he needed for the astonished doctor let me put it this way somebodys decided to move a few prisoners from here to somewhere else who would do that why nobody you make it up and do it dont explain do you have photographs of the men inside of course its normal arrest procedure although the names are meaningless when theyre given theyre always false let me have them all of them ill tell you whom to choose choose for what the transfer the ones youre moving out of here to some place else to where really youre not making sense youre not listening somewhere along the way a back street or a dark road outside the city well overpower the guards and escape overpower we im part of the group part of the escape im going back in there complete madness exclaimed faisal complete sanity countered evan theres a man inside who can take me where i want to go take us where we have to go get me the police photographs and then reach ahmat on the triplefive number tell him what ive told you hell understand understand hell its what that ivy league juvenile delinquent had in mind from the beginning i think perhaps you did also ya shaikh ya amreekdnee maybe i did maybe i just want to blame it on someone else i dont fit into this mould then something inside is propelling you reshaping the man who was it happens kendrick looked into the soft brown eyes of the omani doctor it happens agreed evan suddenly his mind was filled with the outlines of a murky silhouette the figure of a man emerged from the raging fires of an earthbound hell whirlwinds of smoke enveloped the apparition as cascading rubble fell all around it muting the screams of victims the mahdi killer of women and children of friends dear to him partners in a visionhis family the only family he ever wanted all gone all dead the vision joining the smoke of destruction disappearing in the rising vapours until nothing was left but the cold and the darkness the mahdi it happens repeated kendrick softly rubbing his forehead get me the photographs and call ahmat i want to be back in that compound in twenty minutes and i want to be taken out ten minutes later for gods sake move ahmat sultan of oman still in slacks and his new england patriots tshirt sat in the highbacked chair the red light of his private secure telephone glowing below on the right leg of his desk with the instrument next to his ear he was listening intensely so it happened faisal he spoke quietly praise be to allah it happened he told me you expected it said the doctor over the line his tone questioning expected is too strong old friend hoped is more appropriate i removed your tonsils great sultan and i attended you over the years for minor illnesses including a great fear you had that proved groundless ahmat laughed more to himself than into the phone a wild week in los angeles amal who knew what i might have contracted we had a pact i never told your father which means you think im not telling you something now the thought occurred to me very well old friend suddenly the young sultan snapped his head up as the door of his royal office was opened two women entered the first was obviously pregnant an occidental from new bedford massachusetts blonde and wearing a bathrobe his wife next to appear was an oliveskinned darkhaired female dressed fashionably in street clothes she was known to the household simply as khalehla apart from common sense good doctor continued ahmat into the phone i have certain sources our mutual acquaintance needed assistance and who better to provide it than the ruler of oman we leaked information to the animals at the embassy prisoners were being held somewhere subjected to brutal interrogation someone had to be sent there to maintain discipline orderand kendrick found him give our american anything he wants but delay his schedule by fifteen or twenty minutes until my two police officers arrive the al kabir your cousins two special police will suffice my friend there was a brief silence a voice searching for words the rumours are true arent they ahmat i have no idea what you mean rumours are gossip and neither interests me they say you are so much wiser than your years thats sophomoric broke in the sultan he said you had to be torun this place he said its difficult for one who treated you for mumps dont dwell on it doctor just keep me informed ahmat reached into the drawer where the base of the private telephone lay and punched a series of numbers within seconds he spoke im sorry my family i know youre asleep but i must again bother you go to the compound at once amal bahrudi wants to escape with fish he hung up whats happened asked the young sultans wife as she rapidly walked forward please said ahmat his eyes on the stomach of his waddling spouse you have only six weeks to go bobbie move slowly hes too much said roberta aldridge yamenni turning her head and addressing khalehla at her side this jock of mine came in around two thousand in the boston marathon and hes telling me how to carry a baby is that too much the royal seed bobbie replied khalehla smiling royal my foot diapers are one hell of an equalizer ask my mother she had four of us in six years really darling what happened our american congressman made contact in the compound were mocking up an escape it worked cried khalehla approaching the desk it was your idea said ahmat please forget it im way out of line here nothings out of line the youthful sultan said firmly appearances notwithstanding risks notwithstanding we need all the help we can get all the advice we can gather i apologize khalehla i havent even said hello as with my cousins my lowly policemen im sorry to drag you out at this hour but i knew youd want to be here nowhere else how did you manage it i mean leaving the hotel at four in the morning thank bobbie i add however ahmat that neither of our reputations has been enhanced oh the sultan looked at his wife great lord intoned bobbie her palms together bowing and speaking in her boston accent this lovely lady is a courtesan from caironice ring to it huh under the circumstances here the royal wife outlined her swollen stomach with her hands and continued the privilege of rank has its goodies speaking as one of radcliffes history graduates which my former roommate here will attest henry the eighth called it riding in the saddle it happened when anne boleyn was too indisposed to accommodate her monarch for gods sake roberta this isnt the king and i and im not yul brynner you are now pal laughing ahmats wife looked at khalehla of course if you touch him ill scratch your eyes out not to fear my dear said khalehla in mock seriousness not after what youve told me all right you two ahmat interrupted his brief look expressed the gratitude he felt towards both women we have to laugh now and then said his wife otherwise i think wed go stark raving mad raving as in mad agreed ahmat quietly settling his eyes on the woman from cairo hows your british businessman friend raving as in drunk answered khalehla he was last seen half upright in the hotels american bar still calling me names its not the worst thing that could happen to your cover certainly not i obviously go to the highest bidder what about our super patriots the elder merchant princes whod just as soon see me flee to the west in frustration as stay here they still believe youre working with them dont they yes my friend in the sabat aynub market told me that theyre convinced you met with kendrick his logic was such that i had to go along with him and agree that you were a damn fool you were asking for the worst kind of trouble sorry what logic they know that a garrison car picked up the american a few blocks away from his hotel i couldnt argue i was there then they were looking for that car garrison vehicles are all over masqat sorry again it was a wrong move ahmat i could have told you that if id have been able to reach you you see the circle was broken they knew kendrick was here mustapha interrupted the young sultan angrily i mourn his death but not the closing of his big mouth perhaps it was he perhaps not said khalehla washington itself could be responsible too many people were involved in kendricks arrival i saw that also as i understand it was a state department operation there are others who do these things better we dont know who the enemy is or where to look ahmat clenched his fist bringing his knuckles to his teeth it could be anyone anywhereright in front of our eyes goddamn it what do we do do as hes told you said the woman from cairo let him go in under deep cover hes made contact wait for him to reach you is that all i can do wait no theres something else added khalehla give me the escape route and one of your fast cars i brought along my courtesans equipmentits in a suitcase outside in the halland while i change clothes you coordinate the details with your cousins and that doctor you call an old friend hey come on protested ahmat i know you and bobbie go back a long time but that doesnt give you the right to order me to endanger your life no way jose were not talking about my life said khalehla icily her brown eyes staring at ahmat or yours frankly were talking about raw terrorism and the survival of southwest asia nothing may come of tonight but its my job to try to find out and its your job to permit me isnt that what weve both been trained for and also give her the number where she can reach you said roberta yamenni calmly reach us go change your clothes said the young sultan of oman shaking his head his eyes closed thank you ahmat ill hurry but first i have to speak to my people i dont have much to say so itll be quick the drunken baldheaded man in the dishevelled savile row pinstripes was escorted out of the elevator by two countrymen the girth and weight of their inebriated charge were such that each struggled to uphold his part of the body bloody disgrace is what he is said the man on the left awkwardly glancing at a hotel key dangling from the fingers of his right hand which was even more awkwardly shoved up under the drunks armpit come now dickie retorted his companion weve all swigged our severaltoomany on occasion not in a goddamned country going up in flames fuelled by nigger barbarians he could start a bloody brawl and wed be hanged by our necks from two lamp posts wheres the damned room down the hall heavy bugger isnt he all lard and straight whisky is my guess i dont know about that he seemed like a pleasant enough chap who got taken by a fasttalking whore that sort of thing makes anyone pissed you know did you get whom he worked for some textile firm in manchester twillingame or burlingame something like that never heard of it said the man on the right arching his brows in surprise here give me the key theres the door well just throw him on the bed no courtesies beyond that i tell you do you think that fellow will keep the bar open for us i mean while were doing our christian duty the bugger could lock the doors you know the bastard had better not exclaimed the man named dickie as the three figures lurched into the darkened room the light from the hallway outlining the bed i gave him twenty pounds to keep the place open if only for us if you think im shutting my eyes for a single second until im on that plane tomorrow youre ready for the twit farm ill not have my throat slit by some wog with a messianic complex i tell you that too come on heave good night fat prince said the companion and may all kinds of black bats carry you to wherever the heavyset man in the pinstriped suit raised his head from the bed and turned his face towards the door the footsteps in the hallway receded inelegantly he rolled his bulk over and got to his feet in the shadowed light provided by the dull streetlamps below outside the window he removed his jacket and trousers hanging them carefully in the open closet smoothing out the wrinkles he proceeded to undo his regimental tie slipping it off his neck he then unbuttoned his soiled shirt reeking of whisky removed it also and threw it into a wastebasket he went into the bathroom turned on both taps and sponged his upper torso satisfied he picked up a bottle of cologne and splashed it generously over his skin drying himself he walked back into the bedroom to his suitcase on a luggage rack in the corner he opened it selected black trousers and a black silk shirt and put them on as he buttoned the shirt and tucked it under the belt around his thick stomach he walked over to a window taking out a book of matches from his trouser pocket he struck a match let the flame settle and made three semicircles in front of the large glass pane he waited ten seconds then crossed to the desk in the centre of the left wall and switched on the lamp he went to the door unlatched the automatic lock and returned to the bed where he meticulously removed the two pillows from under the spread fluffed both up for a backrest and lowered his large frame he looked at his watch and waited the scratching at the door made three distinct eruptions each semicircular on the wood if one listened come in said the man on the bed in the black silk shirt a darkskinned arab entered hesitantly in apparent awe of his surroundings and the person within those surroundings his robes were clean if not brand new and his headdress spotless his was a privileged mission he spoke in a quiet reverent voice you made the holy sign of the crescent sir and i am here much thanks said the englishman come in and close the door please of course effendi the man did as he was told holding his position of distance did you bring me what i need yes sir both the equipment and the information the equipment first please indeed the arab reached under his robes and withdrew a large pistol its outsize appearance due to a perforated cylinder attached to the barrel it was a silencer with his other hand the messenger pulled out a small grey box it contained twentyseven rounds of ammunition he walked dutifully forward to the bed extending the handle of the weapon the gun is fully loaded sir nine shells thirtysix shells in all thank you said the obese englishman accepting the equipment the arab stepped back obsequiously now the information if you please yes sir but first i should tell you that the woman was recently driven to the palace from her hotel in the next street what astonished the british businessman bolted upright on the bed his heavy legs swinging around pounding the floor are you certain yes sir a royal limousine picked her up when roughly ten to twelve minutes ago naturally i was informed immediately she is there by now but what about the old men the merchants the fat mans voice was low and strained as if he were doing his utmost to control himself she made contact didnt she yes sir answered the arab tremulously as though he feared a beating if he replied in the negative she had coffee with an importer named hajazzi in the dakhil then much later met with him at the sabat market she was taking photographs following someone who i dont know sir the sabat was crowded and she fled i could not follow her the palace whispered the businessman hoarsely as he slowly stood up incredible it is true sir my information is accurate or i would not deliver it to such an august personage as yourself in truth effendi i shall praise allah with all my heart in my every prayer for having met a true disciple of the mahdi the englishmans eyes snapped up at the figure of the messenger yes youve been told that havent you he said softly i was blessed with this gift of knowledge singled out among my brothers for the privilege who else knows on my life no one sir yours is a sacred privilege to be made in silence and invisibly i shall go to my grave with the secret of your presence in masqat splendid idea said the large man in shadows as he raised the pistol the two gunshots were like rapid muted coughs but their power belied the sound across the room the arab was blown into the wall his spotless robes suddenly drenched with blood the hotels american bar was dark except for the dull glow of fluorescent tubes from under the counter the aproned bartender slouched in a corner of his domain every now and then glancing wearily at the two figures sitting in a booth by a front window the view outside partially blocked by the lowered halfclosed blinds the englishmen were fools thought the bartender not that they should disregard their fearswho lived without them in these maddog days foreigner and sane omani alike but these two would be safer from a maddog assault behind the locked doors of hotel rooms unnoticed unseen or would they mused the bartender reconsidering he himself had told the management that they insisted on remaining where they were and the management not knowing what the foreigners carried on their persons or who else might know and be looking for them had stationed three armed guards in the lobby near the american bars only entrance in any case the bartender concluded yawning wise or unwise dullwitted or very clever the englishmen were extremely generous that was all that mattered that and the sight of his own weapon covered by a towel under the bar ironically it was a lethal israeli submachine gun he had bought from an accommodating jew on the waterfront hah now the jews were really clever since the madness began they were arming half of masqat dickie look whispered the more tolerant of the two englishmen his right hand separating a pair of slats in the lowered blind covering the window what jack dickie jerked his head up blinking his eyes he had been dozing isnt that our squiffed countryman out there who where my god youre right outside in the deserted dimly lit street the heavyset manupright agitated pacing the curb while rapidly looking back and forthsuddenly struck several matches one after the other he appeared to raise and lower the flames snapping each match angrily down on the pavement before lighting the next within ninety seconds a dark car appeared racing down the street as it abruptly stopped the headlights were extinguished astonished dickie and his companion watched through the slats of the blind as the fat man with startling agility and purpose strode around the bonnet of the vehicle as he approached the passenger door an arab wearing a headdress but otherwise in a dark western suit leaped out instantly the heavy britisher began speaking rapidly repeatedly jabbing his index finger into the face of the man in front of him finally he heaved his large torso around spun his jowled head and pointed at an area in the upper floors of the hotel the arab turned and raced across the pavement then in clear view the obese businessman pulled a large weapon from his belt as he opened the car door farther and quickly again angrily lowered himself inside my god did you see that cried dickie yes hes changed his clothes his clothes of course the lights poor but not for the practised eye the white shirts gone and so are the pinstripes hes wearing a dark shirt now and his jacket and trousers are a dull black coarsewoven wool i should think hardly suitable for the climate what are you talking about exclaimed the astounded dickie i meant the gun well yes old chap youre in ferrous metals and im in textiles really you leave me dumbfounded we both see a twentystone bugger who fifteen minutes ago was so squiffed we had to carry him upstairs suddenly running around cold sober in the street issuing orders to some bloke and brandishing a gun while he jumps into a madly driven car he obviously had signalledand all you see are his clothes well actually theres more to it than that old boy i saw the gun of course and the jackrabbit arab and that carobviously driven by a maniacand the contrariness of it all was why the clothes struck me as odd dont you see not a hapenny worth perhaps odd is the wrong choice of word try the right one jack all right ill try that fat bugger may or may not have been squiffed but he was a dandy of the first water best featherweight worsted stripe an angelo shirt the finest pure silk tie and benedictine shoesleather from the veldt and sewn to order in italy hes dressed to kill i thought to myself and everything right for the climate so asked the exasperated dickie so out there in the street just now hes in a jacket and trousers of quite ordinary quality illfitting and far too heavy for this blasted weather and certainly not the sort of outfit that would stand out in a crowd much less appropriate for a dawn social or an ascot breakfast and while im at it there isnt a textile firm in manchester im not familiar with and theres no twillingame or burlingame or any name remotely similar you dont say i do say thats a wicket isnt it i also say we shouldnt take that plane this morning my god why i think we should go over to our embassy and wake someone up what dickie suppose that bugger is dressed to kill ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the journal continued the latest report is troubling and insofar as my appliances havent broken langleys access codes i dont even know whether data was withheld or not the subject has made contact the shadow speaks of a highrisk option that was inevitableinevitablebut extremely dangerous what is he doing and how is he doing it what are his methods and who are his contacts i must have specifics if he survives i will need every detail for it is the details that lend credence to any extraordinary action and it is the action that will propel the subject into the conscience of the nation but will he survive or will he be yet another buried statistic in an unrevealed series of events my appliances cannot tell me they can only attest to his potential which means nothing if hes dead then all my work will have been for nothing the icarus agenda chapter the four terrorist prisoners were shackled two sitting on the right side of the speeding violently shaking police van the other two opposite them on the left as arranged kendrick sat with the young wildeyed fanatic whose harelip impeded his screeching pronouncements azra was across the way with the gruff older killer who had challenged and attacked evan the man he thought of as a sergeantforeman by the rattling steel door of the van stood a police guard his left hand gripping a crossbar on the roof trying to keep himself upright in his right held in place by a taut leather shoulder strap was a mac machine pistol a single scattershot burst would turn the four breathing prisoners into bloodied breathless corpses pinned to the walls of the racing van yet alsoas arrangeda ring of keys was hooked to the guards belt the same keys that had secured the prisoners shackles everything had been a race against time precious time minutes became hours and hours brought about another day youre insane you know that dont you doctor we dont have a choice that man is azracolour him blue wrong wrong wrong azra has a beard and long hairweve all seen him on television he shaved off his beard and cut his hair i ask you are you amal bahrudi i am now no youre not any more than he is azra that man was brought in here five hours ago from a bazaar in the waljat hes a drunken imbecile a swaggering clown nothing more his fellow pig slashed his own throat with a policemans knife i was there faisal he is azra brother of zaya yateem because he tells you so no because i talked to him listened to him his holy war isnt for or against allah abraham or christ its for survival in this life on this earth madness all around us madness what did ahmat say to do as you say but you must wait until his special police arrive they are two men he trusts completelyyour instructions i believe tweedledum and tweedledee the two uniforms whove been with me from the bazaar to the al kabir they are special one will drive the police vehicle the other will act as your guard good thinking im really playing out ahmats scenario arent i youre unfair mr kendrick hes not too shabby himself here are the other two prisoners i want in the transfer in the truck with azra and me why who are they ones a lunatic whod curse at his own firing squad but the other the other is azras beard he does whatever colourmeblue tells him take those two away and theres no one to hold the fort together youre being cryptic the rest are breakable doctor they dont really know anything but theyre breakable i suggest you take three or four out at a time put them into smaller cells and then shoot off some rifles into the back wall of this compound you might find a few fanatics who arent so crazy about their own executions you are shedding your true skin shaikh kendrick youre going into a world of which you know nothing ill learn doctor thats why im here the sign came the guard by the vans door steadied himself briefly lowering his left hand he shook it to restore circulation and immediately reached up to grip the crossbar again he would repeat the action in less than a minute and then it would be the moment for evan to make his move the choreography had been created quickly in the compounds laboratory the attack was to be swift and simple the guards reaction was the key to its success twentytwo seconds later the guards left hand plummeted down again in a gesture of weariness kendrick sprang off the bench his body a compact missile hammering into the guard whose head crashed against the door with such force that the mans suddenly hysterical expression became instantly passive as he collapsed quickly commanded evan turning to azra help me get his keys the palestinian leaped forward followed by the sergeantforeman all together their shackled hands threw the mac machine pistol out of the way and ripped the keys from the guards belt ill kill him now shrieked the harelipped zealot grabbing the weapon and lurching forward in the swaying truck the gun aimed at the guards head stop him ordered azra fool roared the sergeantforeman wrestling the weapon away from the young fanatic the driver will hear the shots he is our holy enemy he is our holy way out of here you miserable idiot said azra unlocking kendricks shackles and handing evan the key to do the same for him the congressman from colorado did so then turned to the extended wrists of the sergeantforeman my name is yosef said the older man it is a hebrew name for my mother was hebrew but we are not part of the jews of israeland you are a brave man amal bahrudi i dont like firing squads in the desert said kendrick throwing his shackles on the floor and turning to the young terrorist who would have killed the unconscious guard i dont know whether to let you free or not why shrieked the boy because i will kill for our holy war die for our cause no young man because you might kill us and were more valuable than you amal cried azra gripping evans arm as much to steady himself as to compel kendricks attention i agree hes an idiot but there are special circumstances settlers in the west bank blew up his familys house and his fathers clothing store his father died in the explosion and israels custodial commission sold both properties to new settlers for next to nothing blue lowered his voice speaking into kendricks ear hes a mental case but he had no one to turn to but us yosef and i will control him let him free on your head poet answered evan gruffly unlocking the young terrorists wrist irons why do you say a desert execution asked yosef because the road beneath us is half sand cant you feel it said kendrick knowing the route they were taking we just disappear burned or buried in the desert why us pressed the older terrorist i can explain me better than i can you they dont know what to do with me so why not just kill me if im dangerous or influential both the danger and the influence go with me evan paused then nodded his head come to think of it he added that probably explains yosef and the boy they were the loudest prisoners in there and their voices were probably identifiedboth are easily distinguishable and me asked azra staring at kendrick i should think you could answer that without my help replied kendrick returning the palestinians look a degree of contempt in his eyes i tried to break away from you when they came after me by the toilets but you were too slow you mean they saw us together the student gets a barely passing grade not only together but away from everyone else it was your conference big shot the trucks slowing down exclaimed yosef as the van braked slightly heading into a descending curve we have to get out said evan now if hes going down into a valley therell be soldiers quickly we want the high ground we need it wed never climb back up the door cried azra it must be padlocked on the outside i have no idea kendrick lied following the scenario as it had been rapidly drawn up in the compounds laboratory rivets had been removed and loosened in two panels ive never been taken prisoner here but it doesnt matter its as heetsteel alloy with seams the four of us rushing together can smash out a partition the centre its the weakest evan grabbed the harelipped boy by the shoulder pulling him to his left all right wild man hit it like youre breaking down the wailing wall the four of us now wait azra lurched across the van the weapon he exclaimed picking up the mac machine pistol and looping the strap over his shoulder the barrel directed downward all right he said rejoining the others go shouted kendrick the four prisoners crashed into the centre panel of the door as the van lurched over the rocks in the downhill curve the metal partition gave way bulging at the seams moonlight protruding through the wide separations once more roared yosef his eyes on fire remember commanded the man now accepted as amal bahrudi if we break through tuck into your knees when you hit the ground we dont need anyone hurt again they rushed the halfcollapsed panel the bottom rivets snapped the metal flew up in the moonlight and the four figures bolted out on the twisting road that led to a desert valley inside the van the guard rolled forward with the pitch of the vehicles descent his face streaked with perspiration brought about by fear of his own death he crawled to his knees and hammered repeatedly on the wall of the drivers carriage a single thud was heard in response their assignment for the night was half finished the fugitives also rolled but against the descent their movements abruptly halted reversed by gravity each straining to regain his balance azra and yosef rose first to their feet swivelling their necks and shaking their heads instinctively checking their bruises for signs of anything worse kendrick followed his shoulder on fire his legs in momentary agony and his hands scraped but all in all he was grateful for the harsh requirements of backpacking through the mountains and riding the white water he hurt but he was not hurt the harelipped palestinian had fared the worst he moaned on the stony earth with its pattern of desert grass beneath the road writhing in fury as he tried to rise but could not yosef ran to him and as evan and azra studied the valley below the gruff older man made his pronouncement this child has broken his leg he called over to his two superiors then kill me now shrieked the youngster i go to allah and you go on to fight oh shut up said azra gripping the mac weapon in his hand and walking with kendrick to the injured boy your compulsion to die becomes boring and your grating voice will kill us instead tear his shirt in strips yosef tie his hands and feet and put him in the road that truck will race back up the minute it reaches the camp below and those fools realize whats happened theyll find him you deliver me to my enemies screamed the teenager be quiet replied azra angrily strapping the machine pistol to his shoulder were delivering you to a hospital where youll be taken care of children arent executed except by bombs and missilesall too frequently but thats neither here nor there i will reveal nothing you dont know anything said the man called blue tie him up yosef make the leg as comfortable as possible azra bent over the youngster there are better ways to fight than dying needlessly let the enemy heal you so you can fight again come back to us my stubborn freedom fighter we need you yosef hurry as the older terrorist carried out his orders azra and kendrick walked back to the road hewn from rock far below the white sands began stretching endlessly in the moonlight a vast alabaster floor its roof the dark sky above in the distance intruding on the blanket of white was a small pulsating eruption of yellow it was a desert fire the rendezvous that was an intrinsic part of the escape it was too far away for the figures to be seen clearly but they were there and rightly assumed to be omani soldiers or police but they were not the executioners amal bahrudis companions imagined youre much more familiar with the terrain than i am said evan in english how far do you judge the camp to be ten kilometers perhaps twelve no more than that the road straightens out below theyll be there soon then lets go kendrick turned watching the older yosef carrying the injured teenager to the road he started towards them azra however did not move where amal bahrudi he called out where should we go evan snapped his head back where he repeated contemptuously to begin with away from here itll be light soon and if i know what im talking about which i do therell be a dozen helicopters crisscrossing at low altitude looking for us we can melt in the city not here then what do we do where do we go kendrick could not see clearly in the dim moonlight but felt the intense questioning stare levelled at him he was being tested we get word to the embassy to your sister yateem or the one named ahbyahd stop the photographs and kill the ones involved how do we do that get word into the embassy did your people tell you that amal bahrudi evan was prepared it was the inevitable question frankly they werent sure where the pipeline was and they assumed if any of you had any brains it would change daily i was to pass a note through the gates directed to your operations council to let me throughthrough the pipeline wherever it was at the moment many such notes could be passed as a trap why would yours be accepted kendrick paused when he answered his voice was low and calm and laced with meaning because it was signed by the mahdi azras eyes widened he nodded slowly and held up his hand who he asked the envelope was sealed with wax and not to be broken it was an insult i found hard to accept but even i follow orders from those who pay the freight if you know what i mean those who give us the money to do what we do if there was a code signifying authenticity it was for one or all of you on the council to know not i give me the note said azra idiot yelled the congressman from colorados ninth district exasperated when i saw the police closing in on me i tore it to shreds and scattered it through the al kabir would you have done otherwise the palestinian remained motionless no obviously not he replied at any rate we wont need it ill get us into the embassy the pipeline as you call it is well regulated both inside and out its so well regulated that films are slipped out under the noses of your wellregulated guards send word in to your sister change them every one of them and start a search immediately for the camera when its found kill the owner and anyone who seems to be a friend kill them all on such surface observation protested azra we risk wasting innocent lives valuable fighters lets not be hypocritical laughed amal bahrudi we have no such hesitations with the enemy were not killing valuable fighters were killing innocent people quite properly to make the world listen a world thats blind and deaf to our struggles our very survival by your almighty allah now youre the one whos blind and deaf spat out azra you believe the western press its not to be questioned of the eleven corpses four were already dead including two of the womenone by her own hand for she was paranoid about rape arab rape the other a much stronger woman not unlike the marine who attacked nassir threw herself on a young imbecile whose only reaction was to fire his weapon the two men were old and infirm and died of heart failure it does not absolve us from causing innocent death but no guns were raised against them all this was explained by zaya and no one believed us they never will not that it matters but what about the others seven i believe condemned by our council and rightly so intelligence officers building networks against us throughout the gulf and the mediterranean members of the infamous consular operationseven two arabswho sold their souls to sell us into oblivion paid by the zionists and their american puppets they deserved death for they would have seen us all die but not before we were dishonoured made caricatures of evil when there is no evil in usonly the desire to live in our own lands thats enough poet broke in kendrick looking over at yosef and the boy terrorist who longed for the arms of allah theres no time for your sermons we have to get out of here to the embassy agreed azra through the pipeline kendrick walked back to the palestinian approaching him slowly to the embassy yes he said but not through the pipeline just to the gates there youll send in the message to your sister spelling everything out for her with those orders my job is finished here and so is yoursyours at least for a day or two what are you talking about asked the bewildered blue my instructions are to take one of you to bahrain as soon as possible it will only be for a short time but its urgent bahrain to the mahdi he has new orders for you orders he wont trust to anyone but a member of the council the airports watched said azra firmly its patrolled by guards and attack dogs no one can get in or out except by passing through interrogation wed never make it its the same on the waterfront every boat is flagged down and searched or blown out of the water if it does not comply none of that has stopped your people from coming and going through the pipeline i saw the results in berlin but you said urgent and the pipeline is a twentyfour to fortyeighthour process why so long we travel south only at night and in the uniforms of the yemen border garrisons if were stopped we say were patrolling the coastline we then rendezvous with the fast deepwater boatssupplied by bahrain of course of course he had been right thought evan the southern coast as far as ras al hadd and beyond to the strait of masirah was open territory a cruel wasteland of rockfilled shores and inhospitable interiors heavensent for thieves and smugglers and above all for terrorists and what better protection than the uniforms of the border garrisons those soldiers chosen for both their loyalty and especially their brutality that equalled or bettered that of the international desperadoes given sanctuary in yemen thats very good continued amal bahrudi his tone professional how in allahs name did you get hold of the uniforms i understand theyre unusual a lighter colour different epaulettes boots designed for desert and water i had them made interrupted azra his eyes on the valley below in bahrain of course each is accounted for and locked up when not in use youre right we must go that truck will reach the camp in less than two minutes well talk along the way come yosef had placed the bound injured young terrorist across the road calming him and giving him quiet but firm instructions azra and kendrick approached evan spoke well make better time here on the road he said well stay on it until we see the headlights coming up from the valley hurry final words of encouragement given to their fallen colleague the three fugitives started running up the curving ascent to the flat ground several hundred feet above the terrain was a combination of dry scrubby brush weaving over the mostly arid earth and short gnarled trees encouraged by the night moisture blown in from the sea only to be dwarfed by the windless blistering heat of day for as far as their eyes could see in the moons dull wash the road was straight breathing hard his barrelchest heaving yosef spoke three or four kilometers north there are more trees taller trees much more foliage to hide in you know that asked kendrick unpleasantly surprised thinking he was the only one who knew where they were not this exact road perhaps although there are only a few answered the blunt older terrorist but they are the same from the sands towards the gulf the earth changes everything is greener and there are small hills suddenly one is in masqat it happens quickly yosef was part of the scouting team under ahbyahds command explained azra they came here five days before we captured the embassy i see i also see that the entire black forest couldnt help us when the light comes up and oman isnt the schwarzwald therell be troops and police and helicopters combing every inch of ground theres no place for us to hide except masqat evan directed his next words to the man called blue certainly you have contacts in the city numerous what does that mean between ten and twenty several highly placed they fly in and out of course call them together in masqat and bring me to them ill choose one youll choose one all i need is one but it must be the right one hell carry a message for me and ill have you in bahrain in three hours to the mahdi yes but you saidyou impliedthat you dont know who he is i dont still you know how to reach him then no answered kendrick a sudden hollow pain in his chest another insult but more readily understood my operations are in europe not here i simply assumed that you knew where to find him in bahrain perhaps it was in the note you destroyed in the al kabir a code there are always emergency procedures broke in evan harshly trying to control his anxiety yes there are said azra thoughtfully but none that ever directly involve the mahdi as you must know his name is spoken in whispers to only a few i dont know i told you i dont operate in this part of the worldwhich was why i was chosen obviously yes obviously agreed blue you are far away from your base the unexpected messenger i dont believe this exploded kendrick you receive instructionsno doubt daily dont you we do azra looked briefly at yosef but like yourself i am a messenger what i am a member of the council and young and strong and not a woman but i am not a leader my years do not permit it nassir my sister zaya and ahbyahd they were appointed the leaders of the council until nassirs death the three of them shared responsibility for the operation when sealed instructions came i delivered them but i did not break the seals only zaya and ahbyahd know how to reach the mahdinot personally of course but through a series of contacts that lead to him get word to him can you make radio contact with your sisterover a secure frequency or perhaps a sterile telephone shed give you the information impossible the enemys scanning equipment is too good we say nothing on the radio or the telephone that we would not say in public we must assume its one and the same your people in masqat continued evan rapidly emphatically feeling the beads of perspiration on his hairline could one of them go inside and bring it out information concerning the mahdi no matter how remote asked azra shed execute the one who sought it weve got to have it im to take you to bahrainto himby tonight and i wont risk our sources of operating funds in europe because im held responsible for a failure here that isnt mine there is only one solution said azra the one i spoke of below we go to the embassy into the embassy theres no time for such complications insisted kendrick desperately terrified now of being discovered i know bahrain ill choose a location and well call one of your people here to get the word inside to your sister she or ahbyahd will find a way to reach one of the mahdis contacts there cant be any mention of either of us of coursewell have them say an emergency has arisen thats it an emergency theyll know what it means ill fix the meeting ground a street a mosque a section of the piers or the outskirts of the airport someone will come someone has to the lean muscular young terrorist once more was silent as he studied the face of the man he believed to be his counterpart in far off europe i ask you bahrudi he said after the better part of ten seconds would you be so free so undisciplined with your financial sources in berlin would moscow or the bulgarian banks in sofia or the unseen money in zagreb tolerate such loose communications in an emergency they would understand if you allowed such an emergency they would slit your throat with a shearing knife and replace you you take care of your sources and ill take care of mine mr blue i will take care of mine here now we go to the embassy the winds from the gulf of oman swept over the scrubby grass and the gnarled dwarfed trees but they could not prohibit the sound of the persistent twonote siren in the distance coming up from the desert valley it was the signal conceal yourselves kendrick expected it run roared yosef grabbing azras shoulder and propelling his superior forward on the road run my brothers as you have never run before in your lives the embassy cried the man called blue before the light comes up for evan kendrick congressman from the ninth district of colorado the nightmare that would live with him the rest of his life was about to begin the icarus agenda chapter khalehla gasped her eyes had been suddenly drawn to the rearview mirrora speck of light an image of black upon darker black something and then it was there far away on the hill above masqat a car was following her there were no headlights just a dark moving shadow in the distance it was rounding a curve on the deserted road that led to the twisting descent into the valleyto the beginning of the sands of jabal sham where the escape was to take place there was only one entrance to and one exit from the desert valley and her strategy had been to drive off the road out of sight and follow evan kendrick and his fellow fugitives on foot once they had broken out of the van that strategy was now void oh my god i cant be caught theyll kill every hostage in the embassy what have i done get out get away khalehla spun the wheel the powerful car swung around on the soft sandy earth leaping over ruts on the primitive road and reversing its direction she slammed her foot on the accelerator stabbing it into the floor and within moments her headlights on high beam she passed the car now rushing towards her a figure beside the astonished driver tried to lunge down concealing his face and body but it was impossible and khalehla did not believe what she saw but then she had to in a sudden moment of utter clarity she saw it was so right so perfectso unmistakably perfect tony fumbling bumbling inarticulate anthony macdonald the company reject whose position was secure because the firm was owned by his wifes father but who was nevertheless sent to cairo where he could do the least damage a representative without portfolio apart from hosting dinner parties where he and his equally inept and boring wife invariably got drunk it was as though a company memorandum had been tattooed on their foreheads not permitted in the uk except for obligatory family funerals return flight tickets mandatory how perfectly ingenious the overweight overindulged underbrained fop in sartorial plumage that could not hide his excesses the scarlet pimpernel could not have matched his cover and it was a cover khalehla was convinced of it in building one for herself she had forced a master to expose his own she tried to think back to reconstruct how he had snared her but the steps were blurred because she had not thought about it at the time she had no reason whatsoever to doubt that tony macdonald the alcoholic cipher was beside himself at the thought of travelling to oman alone without someone knowledgeable beside him he had complained several times nearly trembling that his firm had accounts in masqat and he was expected to service them despite the horrors going on over there she had repliedseveral timeswith comforting words that it was basically a usisraeli problem not a british one so he would not be harmed it was as though he had expected her to be sent there and when the orders came she had remembered his fears and telephoned him believing he was her perfect escort to oman oh just perfect my god what a network he must have she thought a little over an hour ago he was apparently paralysed with alcohol making an ass of himself in a hotel bar and here he was at five oclock in the morning following her in a large blackedout car one assumption was unavoidable he had put her under twentyfourhour surveillance and picked her up after she had driven out of the palace gate which meant that his informers had unearthed her connection to the sultan of oman but for whom was the profoundly clever macdonald playing out his charade a cover that gave him access to an efficient omani network of informers and drivers of powerful vehicles at any hour of the day and night in this besieged country where every foreigner was put under a microscope which side was he on and if it was the wrong one for how many years had the ubiquitous tony macdonald been playing his murderous game who was behind him did this contradictory englishmans visit to oman have anything to do with evan kendrick ahmat had spoken cautiously abstractly about the american congressmans covert objective in masqat but would not elaborate except to say that no theory should be overlooked no matter how implausible it seemed he revealed only that the former construction engineer from southwest asia believed that the bloody seizure of the embassy might be traced to a man and an industrial conspiracy whose origins were perceived four years ago in saudi arabiaperceived not proved it was far more than she had been told by her own people yet an intelligent successful american did not risk going under cover among terrorists without extraordinary convictions for ahmat sultan of oman and fan of the new england patriots football team this was enough apart from getting him here washington would not acknowledge him would not help him but we can i can ahmat had exclaimed and now anthony macdonald was a profoundly disturbing factor in the terrorist equation her professional instincts demanded that she walk away race away but khalehla could not do that something had happened someone had altered the delicate balances of past and impending violence she would not call for a small jet to fly her out of an unknown rockbased plateau to cairo not yet not yet not now there was too much to learn and so little time she could not stop dont stop roared the obese macdonald clutching the hand strap above his seat as he yanked his heavy body upright she was driving out here for a reason certainly not for pleasure at this hour she may have seen you effendi not likely but if she did im merely a client tricked by a whore keep going and switch on your lights someone may be waiting for them and we have to know who it is whoever it is may be unfriendly sir in which case im just another drunken infidel youve been hired by the firm to protect from his own outrageous behaviour no different from other times old sport as you wish effendi the driver turned on the headlights whats ahead asked macdonald nothing sir only an old road that leads down to the jabal sham what the hell is that the start of the desert it ends with the far off mountains that are the saudi borders are there other roads a number of kilometers to the east and less passable sir very difficult when you say theres nothing ahead exactly what do you mean exactly what i said sir only the road to the jabal sham but this road the one were on pressed the englishman where does it go it does not sir it turns left into the road down to the this jabalwhatever completed macdonald interrupting i see so were not talking about two roads but one that happens to head left down to your bloody desert yes sir a rendezvous broke in the mahdis conduit whispering to himself ive changed my mind old boy he continued quickly douse the damned headlights theres enough of a moon for you to see isnt there oh yes replied the driver in minor triumph while turning off the lights i know this road very well i know every road in masqat and matrah very very well even the unpassable ones to the east and to the south but i must say effendi i do not understand quite simple my boy if our busy little whore didnt head down to whatever and whomever she intended to reach someone else will come up herebefore the light does i expect which wont be too long now the sky brightens quickly sir quite so macdonald placed his pistol on top of the dashboard reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a short pair of binoculars with bulging thickly coated lenses he brought them to his eyes and scanned the area ahead it is still too dark to see effendi said the driver not for these little dears explained the englishman as they approached another curve in the dim moonlight black out the entire sky and ill count you the number of those stubby trees a thousand metres away they rounded the sharp curve the driver squinting and braking the large car the road was now straight and flat disappearing into the darkness ahead another two kilometers and we reach the descent into the jabal sham sir i will have to go very slowly as there are many turns many rocks good christ roared macdonald peering through the infrared binoculars get off the road quickly what sir do as i say cut your engine sir turn it off coast as far as you can into the sand grass the driver swung the car to the right lurching over the hard rutted ground gripping the wheel and spinning it repeatedly to avoid the scattered squat trees barely seen in the night light seventyodd feet into the grass the car came to a jolting stop an unseen gnarled tree close to the ground had been caught in the undercarriage sir be quiet whispered the obese englishman replacing the binoculars in his pocket and reaching for his weapon above the dashboard with his free hand he grabbed the door handle then abruptly stopped do the lights go on when the door is opened he asked yes sir answered the driver pointing to the roof of the car the overhead light sir macdonald smashed the barrel of his pistol up into the glass of the ceiling light im going outside he said again whispering stay here stay still and stay the hell away from the damned horn if i hear a sound youre a dead man do you understand me clearly sir in case of emergency however may i ask why there are men on the road up aheadi couldnt say whether three or four they were just specksbut theyre coming this way and theyre running silently the englishman opened the door and rapidly uncomfortably climbed out staying as close to the ground as possible he made his way swiftly across the sand grass to within twenty feet of the road in his dark suit and black silk shirt he lowered his bulk beside the stub of a dwarfed tree put his weapon to the right of the twisted trunk and took the infrared binoculars out of his pocket he trained them on the road in the path of the approaching figures suddenly they were there blue it was azra without his beard but unmistakable the junior member of the council brother of zaya yateem the only set of brains on that council and the man on his left macdonald could not recall the name but he had studied the photographs as though they were his passage to infinite wealthwhich they wereand he knew it was he a jewish name an older man a terrorist for nearly twenty years yosef yes yosef trained in the libyan forces after fleeing the golan heights but the man on azras left was puzzling because of his appearance the englishman felt he should know him focusing the infrared lenses on the bouncing rushing face macdonald was perplexed the running man was nearly as old as yosef and the few people in the embassy over thirty years of age were generally there for a reason known to bahrain the remainder were imbeciles and hotheadsfundamentalist zealots easily manipulated then macdonald noticed what he should have seen at first the three men were in prison clothes they were escaped prisoners nothing made sense were these the men the whore khalehla was racing to meet if so everything was doubly incomprehensible the bitchwhore was working for the enemy in cairo the information was confirmed in bahrain it was irrefutable it was why he had cultivated her repeatedly telling her of his firms interests in oman and how frightened he was to go there under the circumstances and how grateful he would be for a knowledgeable companion she had swallowed the bait accepting his offer even to the point of insisting that she could not leave cairo until a specific day a specific time which meant a very specific flight of which there was only one a day he had phoned bahrain and was told to comply and watch her which he did there was no meeting with anyone no hint of eye contact whatsoever but in the chaos of masqats securityconscious immigration she had strayed away damn damn she had wanderedwanderedout to the air freight warehouse and when he found her she was alone by her petulant self had she made contact with someone there passed instructions to the enemy and if she had did either have anything to do with the escaped prisoners now racing up the road that there was a connection would seem to be irrefutable and totally out of place as the three figures passed him a perspiring anthony macdonald pushed himself off the ground grunting as he got to his feet reluctantlyvery reluctantlyconsidering that millions upon millions could depend on the next few hours he reached a conclusion the sudden enigma that was khalehla had to be resolved and the answers he so desperately needed were inside the embassy not only could the millions be lost without those answers but if the bitchwhore was pivotal to some hideous coup and he failed to stop her it was entirely possible that bahrain would order his execution the mahdi did not suffer failure he had to get inside the embassy and all the hell that it stood for the lockheed c hercules with israeli insignia cruised at feet above the saudi desert east of al ubaylah the flight plan from hebron was an evasive one south across the negev into the gulf of aqaba and the red sea proceeding south again equidistant from the coasts of egypt sudan and saudi arabia at hamdanah the course change was northnortheast splitting the radar grids between the airports in mecca and qal bishah then due east at al khurmah into the rub al khali desert in southern arabia the plane had been refuelled in midair by a tanker from sudan west of jiddah over the red sea it would do so again on the return flight without however its five passengers they sat in the cargo hold five soldiers in coarse civilian clothes each a volunteer from the little known elite masada brigade a strike force specializing in interdiction rescue sabotage and assassination none was over thirtytwo years old and all were fluent in hebrew yiddish arabic and english they were superb physical specimens deeply bronzed from their desert training and imbued with a discipline that demanded splitsecond decisions based on instantaneous reactions each had an intelligence quotient in the highest percentile and all were motivated in the extreme for all had suffered in the extremeeither they themselves or their immediate families although they were capable of laughing they were better at hating they sat leaning forward on a bench on the port side of the aircraft absently fingering the straps of their parachutes which had only recently been mounted on their backs they talked quietly among themselves that is to say four talked one did not the silent man was their leader he was sitting in the forward position and stared blankly across at the opposite bulkhead he was perhaps in his late twenties with hair and eyebrows bleached a yellowishwhite by the unrelenting sun his eyes were large and dark brown his cheekbones high fencing a sharp semitic nose his lips thin and firmly set he was neither the oldest nor the youngest of the five men but he was their leader it was in his face in his eyes their assignment in oman had been ordered by the highest councils of israels defence ministry their chances of success were minimal the possibility of failure and death far greater but the attempt had to be made for among the two hundred and thirtysix remaining hostages held inside the american embassy in masqat was a deepcover field director of the mossad israels unparalleled intelligence service if he was discovered he would be flown to any one of a dozen medical clinics of both friendly and unfriendly governments where intravenous chemicals would be far more effective than torture a thousand secrets could be learned secrets that could imperil the state of israel and emasculate the mossad in the middle east the objective get him out if you can kill him if you cannot the leader of this team from the masada brigade was named yaakov the mossad agent held hostage in masqat was his father adonim said the voice in hebrew over the aircrafts loudspeakera calm and respectful voice addressing the passengers as gentlemen we are starting our descent he continued in hebrew the target will be reached in six minutes thirtyfour seconds unless we encounter unexpected head winds over the mountains which will extend our time to six minutes fortyeight seconds or perhaps fiftyfive seconds but then whos counting four men laughed yaakov blinked his eyes still on the opposite bulkhead the pilot went on we will circle once over the target at eight thousand feet so if you have to make any adjustments mental or physical with respect to those crazy bedsheets youve got on your dorsal fins do so now personally i do not care to go out and take a walk at eight thousand feet but then i can read and write yaakov smiled the others laughed louder than before the voice again interrupted the hatch will be opened at eight thousand five hundred by our brother jonathan levy who like all experienced doormen in tel aviv will expect a generous tip from each of you for his service lous are not acceptable the flashing red light will mean you must depart this luxurious hotel in the sky however the boys in the parking lot below refuse to retrieve your automobiles under the circumstances they too can read and write and have been judged mentally competent as opposed to certain unnamed tourists on this airborne cruise the laughter now echoed off the walls of the plane yaakov chuckled the pilot once more broke in his voice softer the tone altered our beloved israel may she exist through eternity through the courage of her sons and daughters and may almighty god go with you my dear dear friends out one by one the parachutes cracked open in the night sky above the desert and one by one the five commandos from the masada brigade landed within a hundred and fifty yards of the amber light shining up from the sands each man held a miniaturized radio that kept him in contact with the others in case of emergencies where each touched ground each dug a hole and buried his chute inserting the widebladed shovel down beside the fabric and the canvas then all converged on the light it was extinguished replaced by the single torch held by a man who had come from masqat a senior intelligence officer of the mossad let me look at you he said turning his beam on each soldier not bad you look like ruffians from the docks your instructions i believe said yaakov theyre not always followed replied the agent you must be we have no names interrupted yaakov sharply i stand rebuked said the man from the mossad truthfully i know only yours which i think is understandable put it out of your mind what shall i call all of you we are colours only colours from right to left they are orange grey black and red a privilege to meet you said the agent shining his light on each manfrom right to left and you he asked the beam on yaakov i am blue naturally the flag no said the son of the hostage in masqat blue is the hottest fire and that is all you have to understand it is also in refraction the coldest ice young man but no matter my vehicle is several hundred metres north im afraid i must ask you to walk after your exhilarating glide in the sky try me said grey stepping forward i hate those terrible jumps a man could get hurt you know what i mean the vehicle was a japanese version of a landrover without the amenities and sufficiently bashed and scraped to be unobtrusive in an arab country where speed was a relative abstraction and collisions frequent the hourplus drive into masqat however was suddenly interrupted a small amber light flashed repeatedly on the road several miles from the city its an emergency said the mossad agent to yaakov who was beside him in the front seat i dont like it there were to be no stops whatsoever when we approached masqat the sultan has patrols everywhere draw your weapon young man one never knows who may have been broken whos to break asked yaakov angrily his gun instantly out of his jacket holster were in total security nobody knows about usmy own wife thinks im in the negev on manoeuvres underground lines of communication have to be kept open blue sometimes our enemies dig too deeply into the earth instruct your comrades prepare to fire yaakov did so weapons were drawn each man at a window the aggressive preparation however was unnecessary it is benami cried the man from the mossad stopping the van the tyres screeching and hurtling over the crevices in the badly paved road open the door a small slender man in blue jeans a loose white cotton shirt and a ghotra over his head leaped inside squeezing yaakov into the seat keep driving he ordered slowly there are no patrols out here and we have at least ten minutes before we might be stopped do you have a torch the mossad driver reached down and brought up his flashlight the intruder snapped it on inspecting the human cargo behind and the one beside him good he exclaimed you look like scum from the waterfront if were stopped slur your arabic and shout about your fornications do you understand amen said three voices the fourth orange was contrary the talmud insists on the truth he intoned find me a bigbreasted houri and i may go along shut up cried yaakov not amused what has happened to bring you here asked the mossad officer insanity answered the newcomer one of our people in washington got through an hour after you left hebron his information concerned an american a congressman no less hes here and interferinggoing under cover can you believe it if its true replied the driver gripping the steering wheel then every thought of incompetence ive ever entertained about the american intelligence community has blossomed to full flower if hes caught theyll be the pariahs of the civilized world it is not a risk to be taken theyve taken it hes here where we dont know what has it to do with ms objected yaakov one american one fool what are his credentials considerable im sorry to say answered benami and we are to give him what leverage we can what said the young leader from the masada brigade why because my colleague notwithstanding washington is fully aware of the risks of the potentially tragic consequences and therefore has cut him off hes on his own if hes captured theres no appeal to his government for it wont acknowledge him cant acknowledge him hes acting as a private individual then i must ask again insisted yaakov if the americans wont touch him why should we because they never would have let him come here in the first place unless someone very highly placed thought he was on to something extraordinary but why us we have our own work to do i repeat why us perhaps because we canand they cant its politically disastrous said the driver emphatically washington sets whatever it is in motion then walks away covering its collective ass and dumps it on us that kind of policy decision must have been made by the arabists in the state department we failwhich is to say he fails while were there with himand whatever executions take place they blame it on the jews the christkillers did it again correction interrupted benami washington did not dump this on us because no one in washington has any idea we know about it and if we do our jobs correctly we wont be in evidence we give only untraceable assistance if its needed you will not answer me shouted yaakov why i did but you werent listening young fellow you have other things on your mind i said that we do what we do because perhaps we can perhaps no guarantees at all there are two hundred and thirtysix human beings in that horrible place suffering as we as a people know only too well among them is your father one of the most valuable men in israel if this man this congressman has even a shadow of a solution we must do what we can if only to prove him right or prove him wrong first however we must find him who is he asked the mossad driver contemptuously does he have a name or did the americans bury that also his name is kendrick the large shabby vehicle swerved cutting off benamis words the man from the mossad had reacted so joltingly to the name that he nearly drove off the road evan kendrick he said steadying the wheel his eyes wide in astonishment yes the kendrick group the what asked yaakov watching the drivers face the company he ran over here his dossier is being flown over from washington tonight said benami well have it by morning you dont need it cried the mossad agent weve got a file on him as thick as moses tablets weve also got emmanuel weingrasswhom we frequently wish we did not have youre too swift for me not now benami it would take several hours and a great deal of winedamn weingrass he made me say that would you be clearer please briefer my friend not necessarily clearer if kendrick is back he is on to something and hes here for a fouryearold scorean explosion that took the lives of seventyodd men women and children they were his family youd have to know him to understand that you knew him asked benami leaning forward you know him not well but enough to understand the one who knew him bestfatherfigure drinking companion confessor counsellor genius best friendwas emmanuel weingrass the man you obviously disapprove of interjected yaakov his eyes still on the drivers face disapprove wholeheartedly agreed the israeli intelligence officer but hes not totally without value i wish he were but he isnt value to the mossad asked benami it was as if the agent at the wheel felt a sudden rush of embarrassment he lowered his voice in reply weve used him in paris he said swallowing he moves in odd circles has contact with fringe people actuallygod i hate to admit ithes been somewhat effective through him we tracked down the terrorists who bombed the kosher restaurant on the rue du bac we resolved the problem ourselves but some damn fool allowed him to be in on the kill stupid stupid and to his credit added the driver grudgingly gripping the wheel firmly he called us in tel aviv with information that aborted five other such incidents he saved many lives said yaakov jewish lives and yet you disapprove of him you dont know him you see no one pays much attention to a seventynineyearold bonvivant a boulevardier who struts down the avenue montaigne with one if not two parisienne models whom hes outfitted in the st honore with the funds he received from the kendrick group why does that detract from his value asked benami he bills us for dinners at la tour dargent three thousand four thousand shekels how can we refuse he does deliver and he was a witness at a particularly violent event where we took matters into our own hands a fact he now and then reminds us of if the payments are late id say hes entitled said benami nodding his head hes an agent of the mossad in a foreign country and must maintain his cover caught strangled our testicles in a vice whispered the driver softly to himself and the worst is yet to come i beg your pardon said yaakov if anyone can find evan kendrick in oman its emmanuel weingrass when we get to masqat to our headquarters ill make a call to paris damn je regretted said the switchboard operator at the pont royal hotel in paris but monsieur weingrass is away for a few days however he has left a telephone number in monte carlo je suis desolee said the operator at the lhermitage in monte carlo monsieur weingrass is not in his suite he was to have dinner this evening at the hotel de paris opposite the casino do you have the number please but of course replied the ebullient woman monsieur weingrass is a most charming man only tonight he brought us all flowers they fill up the office such a beautiful person the number is desole intoned the male operator at the hotel de paris with unctuous charm the dining room is closed but the most generous monsieur weingrass informed us that he would be at table eleven at the casino for at least the next two hours if any calls come for him he suggested that the person telephoning should ask for armand at the casino the number is je suis tres desole gurgled armand obscure factotum at the casino de paris in monte carlo the delightful monsieur weingrass and his lovely lady did not have luck at our roulette this evening so he decided to go to the loews gaming room down by the wateran inferior establishment of course but with competent croupiers the french naturally not the italians ask for luigi a barely literate cretan but he will find monsieur weingrass for you and do send him my affectionate greetings and tell him i expect him here tomorrow when his luck will change the number is naturalmente roared the unknown luigi in triumph my dearest friend in all my life signer weingrass my hebrew brother who speaks the language of como and lago di garda like a nativenot the boot or even napoletano barbarians you understandhe is in front of my eyes would you please ask him to come to the telephone please he is very engrossed signore his lady is winning a great deal of money it is not good fortuna to interfere tell that bastard to get on this phone right now or his hebrew balls will be put in boiling arabian goats milk che cosa do as i say tell him the name is mossad pazzo said luigi to no one placing the telephone on his lectern instabile he added cautiously stepping forward towards the screaming craps table emmanuel weingrass his perfectly waxed moustache below an aquiline nose that bespoke an aristocratic past and his perfectly groomed white hair that rippled across his sculptured head stood quietly amid the gyrating bodies of the frenetic players dressed in a canaryyellow jacket and a redchecked bow tie he glanced around the table more interested in the gamblers than in the game every now and then aware that an idle player or one of the excited crowd of onlookers was staring at him he understood as he understood most things about himself approving of some disapproving of many many more they were looking at his face somewhat more compact than it might be an old mans face that had not lost its childhood configurations still young no matter the years and aided by his stylish if rather extreme clothing those who knew him saw other things they saw that his eyes were green and alive even in blank repose the eyes of a wanderer both intellectually and geographically never satisfied never at peace constantly roving over landscapes he wanted to explore or create one knew at first glance that he was eccentric but one did not know the extent of the eccentricity he was artist and businessman mammal and babel he was himself and to his credit he had accepted his architectural genius as part of lifes infinitely foolish game a game that would involuntarily end for him soon hopefully while he was asleep but there were things to live to experience while he was alive approaching eighty he had to be realistic much as it annoyed and frightened him he looked at the garishly voluptuous girl beside him at the table so vibrant so vacuous he would take her to bed perhaps fondle her breastsand then go to sleep mea culpa what was the point signore whispered the tuxedoed italian into weingrasss ear there is a telephone call for you someone i could never in my life have respect for thats a strange remark luigi he insulted you my dear friend and most considerate guest if you wish i will dismiss him in the language of barbarians which he so justly deserves not everyone loves me as you do luigi what did he say what he said i would not repeat in front of the grossest french croupier here youre very loyal my friend did he give you his name yes a signer mossad and i tell you he is deranged pazzol most of them are said weingrass as he walked quickly to the telephone the icarus agenda chapter the early light progressively threatened azra looked up at the morning sky swearing at himselfincluding the roughhewn yosef in his oathsfor taking a wrong turn at the kabritta tower and thus wasting precious minutes the three fugitives had torn off their prison trousers high above the ankles at midcalf and the sleeves away from their shoulders without the benefit of sunlight they could pass for labourers brought in from lebanon or the slums of abu dhabi spending their rials on the only recreation accessible to them the whores and the whisky available in the el shari el mish kwayis that landlocked island of the city they were in the recessed concrete employees entrance of the waljat hospital less than two hundred yards away from the gates of the american embassy a narrow street on the right intersected the broad thoroughfare angling around the corner was a line of shops indistinguishable behind their iron shutters all business was suspended while the madness lasted in the distance inside the gates of the embassy were ragtag squads of lethargic young people walking slowly the weight of their weapons dragging their arms and shoulders down doing what they were ordered to do for their jihad their holy war the lethargy however would vanish with the first rays of the sun and manic energy would erupt with the first wave of onlookers especially the radio and television crewsmainly because of those crews the angry children would go onstage within the hour azra studied the large square in front of the gates opposite on the north side stood three white twostorey office buildings close to one another the curtained windows were dark no signs of light anywhere which was immaterial in any event if there were men inside watching they were too far away from the gates to hear what he would say softly through the bars and the light was still too dim for him to be definitely identifiedif indeed word of their escape had reached the post and even if it had the enemy would not mount a rash attack on the basis of vague possibilities the consequences were too deadly actually the square was deserted except for a row of beggars their clothes in shreds squatting in front of the embassys sandstone walls their alms plates in front several with their own excrement in evidence the filthiest of these outcasts were not potential agents of the sultan or foreign governments but others might be he focused his eyes on each of the latter looking for sudden abrupt movements that would betray a man not used to a beggars locked hunkered stance only someone whose muscles were trained to withstand the interminable stress of a beggars squat could remain immobile for any length of time none moved none squeezed a leg it was not proof but it was all he could ask for azra snapped his fingers at yosef removing the mac weapon from under his shirt and thrusting it towards the older terrorist im going over he said in arabic cover me if any of those beggars make an unbeggarly move i expect you to be there go ahead ill swing out behind you in the hospitals shadow and slip from doorway to doorway on the right side my aim is unequalled so if theres one unbeggarly move there is no beggar dont anticipate yosef dont make a mistake and fire when you shouldnt i have to reach one of those imbeciles inside ill stumble down as though it wasnt the best morning of my life the young palestinian turned to kendrick who was crouched in the sparse foliage by the hospital wall you bahrudi he whispered in english when yosef reaches the first building over there come out slowly and follow him but for gods sake dont be obvious pause now and then to scratch yourself spit frequently and remember that your appearance doesnt belong to someone with good posture i know those things evan lied emphatically impressed with what he was learning about terrorists you think i havent employed such tactics a thousand times more than you have i dont know what to think answered azra simply i do know that i didnt like the way you walked past the zawawi mosque the mullahs and the muezzins were congregating perhaps youre better in the refined capitals of europe i assure you im adequate said kendrick icily knowing he had to retain the arabic version of strength which came with cold understatement his playacting was quickly deflated however as the young terrorist grinned it was a genuine smile the first he had observed in the man who called himself blue im assured said azra nodding his head im here and not a corpse in the desert thank you for that amal bahrudi now keep your eyes on me go where i direct you pivoting swiftly blue rose and walked haltingly across the hospitals short stretch of zoysia lawn and into the wide thoroughfare that led to the square proper within seconds yosef raced out ninety degrees to the right of his superior crossing the narrow street twenty feet from the corner hugging the side of the building in the dim lights darkest shadows as the lone isolated figure of azra came into clear view staggering towards the embassy gates yosef spun around the corner the last object evan saw was the murderous mac machine pistol held low in his left hand by the blunt sergeantforeman kendrick knew it was the moment to move and a part of him suddenly wished he were back in colorado southwest of telluride at the base of the mountains and at temporary peace with the world then the images came again filling his inner screen thunder a series of deafening explosions smoke walls suddenly collapsing everywhere amid the screams of terrified children about to die children and womenyoung mothersshrieking in horror and protest as tons of rubble came cascading down from a hundred feet above the earth and helpless menfriends husbands fathersroaring defiantly against the cascading hell they knew instantly would be their tomb the mahdi evan got to his feet breathed deeply and started out towards the square he reached the north side pavement in front of the barricaded shops his shoulders bent he paused frequently to scratch himself and spit the woman was right whispered the darkskinned arab in western clothes peering out through a loose slat in a boardedup store that only twentytwo days ago had been an attractive cafe devoted to cardamom coffee cakes and fruit the older pig was so close i could have touched him as he passed by i tell you i did not breathe shhh warned the man at his side in full arab dress here he comes the american his height betrays him others will betray him also he will not survive who is he asked the robed man his whispered voice barely audible its not for us to know that he risks his life for us is all that matters we listen to the woman those are our orders outside the stooped figure in the street passed the store pausing to scratch his groin while spitting into the gutter beyond diagonally across the square another figure blurred in the dim light approached the embassy gates it was the woman continued the arab in western clothes still squinting between the loose boards who told us to watch for them on the waterfront checking the small boats and on the roads north and south even here where they were least expected well contact her and tell her the unexpected has happened then call the others on the kalbah and bustafi wadis and let them know they neednt watch any longer of course said the robed man starting towards the back of the deserted dark cafe with its profusion of chairs eerily perched on top of tables as if the management expected unearthly customers who disdained the floor then the arab stopped quickly returning to his colleague then what do we do the woman will tell you hurry the pig by the gates is gesturing for someone inside thats where theyre going inside azra gripped the iron bars his eyes darting up at the sky the sprays of light were growing brighter by the minute in the east soon the dull dark grey of the square would be replaced by the harsh blinding sun of masqat it would happen at any moment as it did every dawn an explosion of light that was suddenly total allencompassing quickly pay attention to me you idiots you mongrels the enemy is everywhere watching scanning waiting for the instant to pounce and i am now a prize of extraordinary value one of us must reach bahrain reach the mahdi for the love of your goddamned allah will somebody come over here i cannot raise my voice someone did a youngster in soiled fatigues broke hesitantly away from his fiveman squad squinting in the still dim but growing light drawn by the sight of the oddlooking person at the left side of the huge chained double gate as he drew nearer he walked faster his expression slowly changing from the quizzical to the astonished azra he cried is it you be quiet whispered blue pressing both palms repeatedly through the bars the teenager was one of the dozens of recruits he had instructed in the basic use of repeating weapons and if he remembered correctly not a prize pupil among so many just like him they said you had gone on a secret mission an assignment so holy we should thank almighty allah for your strength i was captured allah be praised for what for your having slain the infidels if you had not you would be in the blessed arms of allah i escaped without slaying the infidels asked the youngster sadness in his voice theyre all dead replied blue with exasperated finality now listen to allah be praised allah be quietyou be quiet and listen to me i must get inside quickly go to yateem or ahbyahdrun as if your life depended on it my life is nothing mine is damn it have someone come back here with instructions run the waiting produced a pounding in blues chest and temples as he watched the sky watched the light in the east about to inflame this infinitesimal part of the earth knowing that when it did he would be finished dead no longer able to fight the bastards who had stolen his life erased his childhood with blood taken his and zayas parents away in a burst of gunfire sanctioned by the killers of israel he remembered it all so clearly so painfully his father a gentle brilliant man who had been a medical student in tel aviv until in his third year the authorities deemed him better suited to the life of a pharmacist to make room for an immigrating jew in the medical college it was common practice remove the arabs from the esteemed professions was the israeli credo as the years went on however the father became the only doctor in their village on the west bank the governments visiting physicians from beer sheva were incompetents who were forced to make their shekels in the small towns and the camps one such physician complained and it was as if the writing were stamped on the wailing wall the pharmacy was shut down we have our unspectacular lives to live when will they let us live them the father and husband had screamed the answer came for a daughter named zaya and a son who became azra the terrorist the israeli commission of arab affairs on the west bank again made a pronouncement their father was a troublemaker the family was ordered out of the village they went north towards lebanon towards anywhere that would accept them and along the journey of their exodus they stopped at a refugee camp called shatila while brother and sister watched from behind the low stone wall of a garden they saw their mother and father slaughtered as were so many others their bodies broken by staccato fusillades of bullets snapping them into the ground blood spewing from their eyes and their mouths and up above in the hills the sudden thunder of israeli artillery was to the ears of children the sound of unholy triumph someone had very much approved of the operation thus was born zaya yateem from gentle child to icecold strategist and her brother known to the world as azra the newest crown prince of terrorists the memories stopped with the sight of a man running inside the gates of the embassy blue cried ahbyahd the streaks of white in his hair apparent in the growing light his voice a harsh astonished whisper as he raced across the courtyard in allahs name what happened your sister is beside herself but she cannot come outside not as a woman not at this hour and especially not with you here eyes are everywherewhat happened to you ill tell you once were inside theres no time now hurry we myself yosef and a man named bahrudihe comes from the mahdi quickly the lights nearly up where do we go almighty god the mahdi please ahbyahd the east wall about forty metres from the south corner theres an old sewer line i know it weve been working on it its clear now one must crouch low and climb slowly but yes its clear there is an opening beneath the three large rocks on the water said azra nodding rapidly have someone there we race against the light the terrorist called blue slipped away from the chained gates and with gathering speed slowly subtly discarding his previous posture quickly rounded the south edge of the wall he stopped pressing his back into the stone his eyes roaming up the line of barricaded shops yosef stepped partially out of a boardedup recessed doorway he had been watching azra and wanted the young leader to know it the older man hissed and in seconds amal bahrudi emerged from a narrow alleyway between the buildings staying in the shadows he raced up the pavement joining yosef in the doorway azra gestured to his left indicating a barelypaved road in front of him that ran parallel to the embassy wall it was beyond the stretch of shops on the square across the way there was only a wasteland of rubble and sand grass in the distance towards the fiery horizon was the rockladen coastline of the oman gulf one after the other the fugitives raced down the road in their torn prison clothes and hard leather sandals past the walls of the embassy into the sudden startling glare of the bursting sun azra leading they reached a small promontory above the crashing waves with surefooted agility the worlds new crown prince of killers started down over the huge boulders stopping every now and then to gesture behind him pointing out the areas of green sea moss where a man could lose his life by slipping and plunging down into the jagged rocks below in less than a minute they reached an oddlyshaped indentation at the bottom of the short cliff where the huge stones met the water it was marked by three boulders forming a strange triangle at the base of which was a cavelike opening no more than three feet wide and continuously assaulted by the pounding surf there it is exclaimed azra exaltation and relief in his voice i knew i could find it what is it yelled kendrick trying to be heard over the crashing waves an old sewer line roared blue built hundreds of years ago a communal toilet continuously washed down by sea water carried up by slaves they bored through rock no amal they creased the surface and angled the rocks above nature took care of the rest a reverse aqueduct if you like its a steep climb but as someone had to build it there are ridges for feetslaves feet like our palestinian feet no how do we get in there we walk through water if the prophet jesus can walk on it the least we can do is walk through it come the embassy perspiring heavily anthony macdonald climbed the open waterfront staircase on the side of the old warehouse the creaking of the steps under his weight joined the sounds of wood and rope that erupted from the piers where hulls and stretched halyards scraped the slips along the docks the first yellow rays of the sun pulsated over the waters of the harbour broken by intruding skiffs and aged trawlers heading out for the days catch passing observant marine patrols that every now and then signalled a boat to stop for closer inspection tony had ordered his driver to crawl the car back towards masqat on the deserted road without headlights until they reached a back street in the as saada that cut across the city to the waterfront only when they encountered streetlamps did macdonald instruct the driver to switch on the lights he had no idea where the three fugitives were running or where they expected to hide in the daylight with an army of police searching for them but he assumed it would be with one of the mahdis more unlikely agents in the city he would avoid them there was too much to learn too many contradictory things to understand before a chance confrontation with the young ambitious azra but there was one place he could go one man he could see without fear of being seen himself a hired killer who followed orders blindly for money a stick of human garbage who made contact with potential clients only in the filthy alleyways of the el shari el mish kwayis only those who had to know knew where he lived tony heaved his way up the last flight of steps to the short thick door at the top that led to the man he had come to see as he reached the final step he froze mouth gaping eyes bulging suddenly without warning the door whipped open on greased hinges as the halfnaked killer lunged out on the short platform a knife in his left hand its long razorsharp blade glistening in the new sun while in his right was a small calibre pistol the blade was poised across macdonalds throat the barrel of the gun jammed into his left temple unable to breathe the obese englishman gripped both railings with his hands to keep from falling back down the steps it is you said the gaunt hollowcheeked man withdrawing the pistol but keeping the knife in place you are not to come here you are never to come here swallowing air his immense body rigid macdonald spoke hoarsely feeling the psychopaths blade across his throat if it were not an emergency i would never have done so that should be perfectly clear what is clear is that i was cheated replied the man wiggling the knife i killed that importers son in the same way i could kill you at this moment i carved up that girls face and left her in the streets with her skirt above her head and i was cheated no one meant to someone did ill make it up to you we must talk as i mentioned its an emergency talk here you dont come inside no one comes inside very well if youll be so kind as to permit me to stand rather than hang on for dear life half over this all too ancient staircase talk tony steadied himself on the third step from the top taking out a handkerchief and blotting his perspiring forehead his gaze on the knife below its imperative i reach the leaders inside the embassy since they cannot of course come out i must go in to them it is too dangerous especially for the one who gets you inside since he remains outside the bonegaunt killer pulled the blade away from macdonalds throat only to readjust it with a twist of his wrist the glistening point now resting at the base of the englishmans neck you can talk to them on the telephone people do all the time what i have to saywhat i must ask themcant be spoken over the phone its vital that only the leaders hear my words and i theirs i can sell you a number that is not published in the listings its published somewhere and if you have it others do also i cannot take the risk inside i must get inside you are difficult said the psychopath his left eyelid flickering both pupils dilated why are you difficult because i am immensely rich and you are not you need money for your extravagances your habits you insult me spat out the killerforhire his voice strident but not loud the halfcrazed man aware of the fishermen and dock labourers trudging to their morning chores three storeys below im only being realistic inside how much the killer coughed his foul breath in macdonalds face pulling the blade back and settling his rheumy stare on his past and present benefactor it will cost a great deal of money more than you have ever paid before im prepared for a reasonable increase not exorbitant mind you but reasonable well always have work for you theres an embassy press conference at ten oclock this morning interrupted the partially drugged man as usual the journalists and television people will be selected at the last minute their names called out at the gates be there and give me a telephone number so i can give you a name within the next two hours tony did so his hotel and his room how much dear boy he added the killer lowered the knife and stated the amount in omani rials it was equivalent to three thousand english pounds or roughly five thousand american dollars i have expenses he explained bribes must be paid or the one who bribes is dead its outrageous cried macdonald forget the whole thing accepted said the englishman khalehla paced her hotel room and although she had given up cigarettes for the sixth time in her thirtytwo years she smoked one after another her eyes constantly straying to the telephone under no condition could she operate from the palace that connection had been jeopardized enough damn that son of a bitch anthony macdonaldcipher drunk someones agentextraordinaryhad his efficient network in masqat but she was not without resources herself thanks to a roommate at radcliffe who was now a sultans wifethanks to khalehlas having introduced a fellow arab to her best friend a number of years ago in cambridge massachusetts god how the world moved in smaller swifter and ever more familiar circles her mother a native californian had met her father an exchangestudent from port said while both were in graduate school at berkeley she an egyptologist he working for his doctorate in western civilization both aiming for academic careers they fell in love and got married the blonde california girl and the oliveskinned egyptian in time with khalehlas birth the stunned raciallyabsolute grandparents on both sides discovered that there was more to children than the purity of strain the barriers fell in a sudden rush of love four elderly individuals two couples predisposed to abhor each other had bridged the gaps of culture skin and belief by finding joy in a child and other mutually shared pleasures they became inseparable the banker and his wife from san diego and the wealthy exporter from port said and his only arab wife what am i doing cried khalehla to herself this was no time to think about the past the present was everything then she realized why her mind had wanderedtwo reasons really firstly the pressures had become too great she needed a few minutes to herself to think about herself and those she loved if only to try to understand the hatred that was everywhere the second was the more important reason the faces and the words spoken at a dinner party long ago had been lurking in the background especially the words quietly echoing off the walls of her mind they had made an impression on an eighteenyearold girl about to leave for america the monarchs of the past had precious little to their overall credit her father had said that night in cairo when the whole family was together including both sets of grandparents but they understood something our present leaders dont considercant consider actually unless they try to become hereditary rulers themselves which wouldnt be seemly in these times although some do try whats that young man asked the california banker i havent entirely given up on monarchy with the proper rightwing principles of course well throughout history they arranged marriages to make alliances to bring the diverse nations into their central families once a person knows another under those circumstancesdining dancing hunting even telling jokesits difficult to maintain a stereotyped bias isnt it everyone around the table had looked at one another smiles and gentle nods emerging in such circles however my son remarked the exporter from port said things did not always work out so felicitously as here im no scholar but there were wars families against their own ambitions thwarted true revered father but how much worse might it have all been without such arranged marriages far far worse im afraid i refuse to be seen as a geopolitical tool khalehlas mother had exclaimed laughing actually my dear everything between us was arranged by our devious parents here have you any idea how theyve profited from our alliance the only profit ive ever seen is the lovely young lady whos my granddaughter said the banker shes off to america my friend said the exporter your profits may dwindle how does it feel darling quite an adventure for you id think its hardly the first time grandmother weve visited you and grandfather a lot and ive been to quite a few cities it will be different now dear khalehla forgot who had said those words but they were the beginning of one of the strangest chapters of her life youll be living there added whoever it was i cant wait everyones so friendly you feel so wanted so liked once again those around the table looked at one another it was the banker who had broken the silence you may not always feel that way he said quietly there will be times when youre not wanted not liked and it will confuse you certainly hurt you thats hard to believe grandfather said an ebullient young girl khalehla only vaguely remembered the californian had briefly looked at his soninlaw his eyes pained as i think back its hard for me to believe it too dont ever forget young lady if problems arise or if things become difficult pick up the phone and ill be on the next plane oh grandfather i cant imagine doing that and she hadnt although there were times when she came close only pride and what strength she could summon stopping her shvartzeh arviyah niggerarab was her first introduction to oneonone hatred not the blind irrational hatred of mobs running amok in the streets brandishing placards and crudely made signs cursing an unseen enemy far away across distant borders but of young people like herself in a pluralistic community of learning sharing classrooms and cafeterias where the worth of the individual was paramount from entrance through constant evaluation to graduation each contributed to the whole but as himself or herself not as an institutional robot except perhaps on the playing fields and even there individual performance was recognized often more so in defeat touchingly more so yet for so long she had not been an individual she had lost herself that had been eradicated transferred to an abstract insidious racial collective called arab dirty arab devious arab murderous arabarab arab arabuntil she couldnt stand it any longer she stayed by herself in her room turning down offers from dormitory acquaintances to visit the collegiate drinking halls twice had been enough the first should have been enough she had gone to the ladies room only to find it blocked by two male students they were jewish students to be sure but they were also american students thought you arabs didnt drink shouted the drunken young man on her left its a choice one makes she had replied im told you arviyah piss on the floor of your tents cried the other leering you were misinformed were quite fastidious may i please go inside not here arab we dont know what youd leave on the toilet seat and we have a couple of yehudiyah with us got the message arab the breaking point however came at the end of her second term she had done well in a course taught by a renowned jewish professor well enough to have been singled out by the soughtafter teacher as the student he deemed to have achieved the most the prize an annual event in his class was a personally inscribed copy of one of his works many of her classmates jews and nonjews alike had come around to congratulate her but when she left the building three others in stocking masks had stopped her on a wooded path back to her dormitory what did you do one asked threaten to blow his house up maybe knife his kids with a sharp arab dagger hell no shed call in arafat were going to teach you a lesson shvartzeh arviyaht if the book means so much to you take it no arab you take it she had been raped this is for munich this is for the children in the golan kibbutz this is for my cousin on the beaches of ashdod where you bastards killed him there had been no sexual gratification for the attackers only the fury of inflicting punishment on the arab she had half crawled half stumbled back towards her dormitory when a very important person came into her life one roberta aldridge the inestimable bobbie aldridge the iconoclastic daughter of the new england aldridges scum she had screamed into the trees of cambridge massachusetts you must never tell pleaded the young egyptian girl you dont understand dont you worry about that honey in boston we have a phrase that means the same thing from southie to beacon hill them that gives gets and those motherfuckers will get take my word no theyll come after methey wont understand either i dont hate jews my dearest friend since childhood is the daughter of a rabbi one of my fathers closest colleagues i dont hate jews theyll say i do because to them im just a dirty arab but i dont my familys not like that we dont hate hold it kid i didnt say anything about jews you did i said motherfuckers which is an allinclusive term so to speak its finished here im finished ill leave the hell you will youre seeing my doctor whod better know his marbles and then you move in with me christ i havent had a cause in almost two years praise god and allah and all those other deities above i have a friend and somehow within the pain and the hatred of those days an idea was born that grew into a commitment an eighteenyearold girl knew what she was going to do with the rest of her life the telephone rang the past was finished over the present was everything she ran to the bedside phone yanking it out of its cradle yes hes here where the embassy oh my god whats happening whats he doing hes with two others there are three not four we have only seen three one is at the gate among the beggars hes been talking to the terrorists inside the american where is he with the third man the two of them stay in the shadows only the first man shows himself he is the one who makes the decisions not the american what do you mean we think hes making arrangements for them to go inside no screamed khalehla they canthe cant he mustnt stop them stop him such orders should come from the palace madame such orders come from me youve been told the prisoner compound was one thing but not the embassy never the embassy not for him go out and take them stop them kill them if you have to kill him hurry cried the robed arab running to his colleague in the front of the boardedup restaurant and cracking the bolt of his machine gun into the firing position our orders are to take them now stop them stop the american kill him if we must kill him asked the astonished official from the palace those are the orders kill him the orders have come too late theyre gone ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the figure in the dark sterile room touched the letters of the keyboard with angry precision ive broken the langley access codes and its madness not the cia for the liaison is withholding nothing instead the insanity is with the subject he has gone into the embassy he cant survive hell be found outin the toilet at a meal with or without utensils with a single reaction to a phrase hes been away too long ive factored in every possibility and my appliances offer little hope perhaps my appliances and i were too quick to render judgment perhaps our national messiah is no more than a fool but then all messiahs have been considered fools and idiots until proved otherwise that is my hope my prayer the icarus agenda chapter the three escaped prisoners crawled in the darkness up through the ancient mossladen sewer line to a gridded opening on the stone floor of the embassys east courtyard struggling their hands and feet scraped and bloodied they emerged into the dazzling sunlight only to be met by a scene evan kendrick wished with all his being had remained in darkness sixty or more hostages had been removed from the roof to the courtyard for their meagre morning food and ablutions a latrine consisted of wooden planks with circular holes above planter boxes the men separated from the women by a large transparent screen ripped from one of the embassys windows the degradation was complete in that the guards male and female walked back and forth in front of the hostages male and female laughing and making loud jokes about the functional difficulties their captives were experiencing the toilet paper tauntingly held out beyond the reach of trembling hands before it was finally delivered consisted of printouts from the embassys computers across the way in full view of the frightened humiliated people at the planks the hostages had formed a line leading to three long narrow tables with rows of metal plates holding dry bread and small wedges of questionable cheese spaced between were filthy pitchers filled with a greyishwhite liquid presumably diluted goats milk which was poured sparingly into the prisoners wooden bowls by a group of armed terrorists behind the tables every now and then a hostage was refused a plate or a ladle of milk pleading was futile it resulted in a slap or a fist or a ladle in the face when the cries were too loud suddenly as kendricks eyes were still adjusting to the harsh light a young prisoner a boy of no more than fourteen or fifteen tears streaming down his face his features contorted screamed in defiance you lousy bastard my mothers sick she keeps throwing up from this crap give her something decent you sons of bitches the boys words were cut short by the barrel of a rifle across his face tearing his left cheek instead of subduing the youngster the blow infuriated him he lunged across the table grabbing the shirt of the man with the rifle tearing it off his chest sending metal plates and pitchers crashing down from the table in seconds the terrorists were on him pulling him away from the bearded man he was wrestling to the ground pummelling him with rifle butts and kicking his writhing body on the courtyard stone several other male hostages their anger and courage aroused by the boys action rushed forward shouting with weak hoarse voices their arms flailing pathetically against their arrogant far stronger enemies what followed was a brutal suppression of the mini revolt as the hostages fell they were beaten unconscious and kicked like carcasses being thumped and processed in a slaughter house animals roared an old man holding his trousers and walking unsteadily forward from the planks his resolve and dignity intact arab animals arab savages have none of you a shred of civilized decency does beating to death weak defenceless men make you heroes of islam if so take me and issue yourselves more medals but in the name of god stop what youre doing whose god shouted a terrorist over the body of the unconscious boy a christian jesus whose followers arm our enemies so they can massacre our children with bombs and cannons or a wandering messiah whose people steal our lands and kill our fathers and mothers get your gods straight enough commanded azra striding rapidly forward kendrick followed unable to control himself thinking that moments before he might have grabbed the mac weapon off blues shoulder and fired into the terrorists standing above the bloodied youngster azra continued his voice casual the lessons been taught dont overteach it or youll numb those you want to instruct take these people down to the infirmary to the hostage doctor and find the boys mother take her there also and get her a meal why azra protested the palestinian no such consideration was shown my mother she was nor to mine broke in blue firmly stopping the man and look at us now take this child down and let him stay with his mother have someone speak to them about overzealousness and pretend to care kendrick watched in revulsion while the limp bleeding bodies were carried away you did the right thing he said to azra in english his words coldly noncommittal talking like a technician one doesnt always want to but one has to know when to stop the new prince of terrorists studied evan through opaque eyes i meant what i said look at us now the death of our own makes us different one day were children the next we are grown up no matter the years and we are experts at death for the memories never leave us i understand no you dont amal bahrudi yours is an ideological war for you death is a political act you are a passionate believer i have no doubtbut still what you believe is politics thats not my war i have no ideology but survival so that i can extract death for deathand still survive for what asked kendrick suddenly terribly interested oddly enough to live in peace which was forbidden to my parents for all of us to live in our own land which was stolen from us delivered to our enemies and paid for by rich nations to assuage their own guilt over crimes against a people that were not our crimes now were the victims can we do less than fight if you think thats not politics i suggest you think again you remain a poet azra with a knife and a gun as well as my thoughts bahrudi there was another commotion across the courtyard this one benign two figures raced out of a doorway one a veiled woman the other a man with streaks of white in his hair zaya yateem and ahbyahd the one called white thought evan standing rigid aloof the greeting between brother and sister was odd they formally shook hands looking at each other then fell into an embrace the universal guardianship of an older sister for a younger brother the latter so often awkward impulsive in the eyes of the older wiser sibling bridged races and ideology the younger child would inevitably grow stronger the muscular arms of the household but the older sister was always there to guide him ahbyahd was subsequently less formal throwing his arms around the youngest strongest member of the operations council and kissing him on both cheeks you have much to tell us exclaimed the terrorist called white i do agreed azra turning to evan kendrick because of this man he is amal bahrudi from east berlin sent by the mahdi to us here in masqat above her veil zayas urgent even violent eyes searched evans face amal bahrudi she repeated ive heard the name of course the mahdis strings reach great distances you are far from your own work uncomfortably so said kendrick in the cultured dialect of riyadh but others are watched their every move monitored it was thought that someone unexpected should come here and east berlin is a convenient place from which to travel people will swear youre still there when the mahdi called i responded in truth it was i who first made contact with his people about a problem you have here which your brother will explain to you we may have different objectives but we all progress by cooperating with each other especially when our bills are paid but you said ahbyahd frowning the bahrudi of east berlin the one who moves anywhere everywhere you were found out its true i have a reputation for getting around answered evan permitting himself the hint of a smile but it certainly wont be enhanced by what happened to me here you were betrayed then asked zaya yateem yes i know who it was and ill find him his body will drift up in the harbour bahrudi broke us out interrupted azra while i was thinking he was doing he deserves whatever reputation he has we go inside my dearest brother well talk there my dearest sister said blue we have traitors here thats what amal came to tell usthat and one more thing theyre taking photographs and smuggling them outside selling them if we live well be hunted for years a record of our activities for all the world to see the sister now studied the brother her dark eyes above the veil questioning photographs taken by concealed cameras with sophisticated features to operate yet noticed by no one do we have such advanced students of photography among our brothers and sisters here the majority of whom can barely read he saw the photographs in east berlin well talk inside the two englishmen sat in front of the large desk at the british embassy the weary attaché behind it still in a dressing gown doing his best to stay awake yes he said yawning theyll be here any moment now and if you dont mind my saying so i hope theres substance in what youre telling us mi is seven ways into a dither here and theyre not too charmed by a couple of our own brits robbing them of a few precious hours of sleep my friend jack here was in the grenadiers exclaimed dickie protectively if he thinks theres something you should be told i think you should pay attention after all what are we here for to make money for your firms offered the attaché well of course thats a minor part of it said dickie but first were englishmen and dont you forget it well not see whats left of the empire sink into oblivion right jack it already has said the attaché stemming another yawn you see interrupted jack my friend dickie here is in ferrous metals but im in textiles and i tell you the way that bugger was dressedas opposed to the way he had dressed beforehes up to no good the cloth not only determines the man but also suits his activitiesbeen that way since the first flax was woven probably right here in this part of the world come to think of it mi has the information broke in the attaché with the dulled expression of a man numbed by repetition theyll be here soon they were within five seconds of the attaché s remark two men in open shirts both needing a shave and neither looking particularly pleasant walked into the office the second man carried a large manila envelope the first man spoke are you gentlemen the reason were here he asked addressing dickie and jack richard harding on my left said the attaché and john preston on the right may i leave sorry old boy replied the second man approaching the desk and opening the envelope were here because you summoned us that entitles you to stay youre too kind said the embassy man unkindly however i did not summon you i merely relayed information that two british citizens insisted i relay that entitles me to get some sleep insofar as im not in your line of endeavour actually interrupted dickie harding it was jack here who insisted but ive always felt that in times of crisis no stone or instinct should be overlooked and jack prestona former grenadier you knowhas had some fine instincts in the past damn it dickie its got nothing to do with instincts its what he was wearing i mean a chap could swelter in the winter in the highlands under that material and if the sheen on his shirt indicated silk or polyester hed positively suffocate cotton pure breathing cotton is the only cloth for this climate and the tailoring of his ensemble well i told you do you mind sir his eyes briefly straying to the ceiling the second man removed a pile of photographs from the envelope and thrust them between preston and harding cutting off the dialogue would you look these over and see if theres anyone you recognize eleven seconds later the task was done thats him cried jack believe it is dickie agreed and youre both bonkers said the first man from mi his names macdonald and hes a swizzling societyboy drunk from cairo his wifes father owns the company he works fora spare parts firmand hes posted over here because hes a complete ass and the secondincommand at the cairo branch runs the show so much for instincts at this hour of the morning should i ask where you two spent the night now jack i did say you might be overreacting on rather superficial grounds a minute please interrupted the second man from mi picking up the enlarged passport photograph and studying it a year or so ago one of our military staff stationed here contacted us and wanted to set up a meeting regarding an ee problem he thought was in the making a what asked the attaché equipment evaluation thats to be read as espionage he wouldnt say much on the phone of course but he did remark that wed be astonished at the suspect a bloated sot of an englishman working in cairo or words to that effect could this be the man still continued dickie i urged jack to follow it up not to hold back now really old chap you werent all that enthusiastic you know we still might make that plane you were so worried about what happened at the meeting asked the attaché leaning forward his eyes riveted on the second man from mi it never took place our military man was killed on the waterfront his throat slit outside a warehouse they called it a robbery as nothing was left in his pockets i do think we should catch that plane jack the mahdi exclaimed zaya yateem sitting behind the desk in what three weeks before had been the american ambassadors office you are to take one of us to him in bahrain tonight as i told your brother kendrick sat in a chair next to ahbyahd and facing the woman the instructions were probably in the letter i was to deliver to you yes yes zaya spoke rapidly impatiently he explained it to me during our few moments together but youre wrong bahrudi i have no way of directly reaching the mahdino one knows who he is i assume you contact someone who in turn reaches him naturally but it could take a day or possibly two days the avenues to him are complicated five calls are made and ten times five are relayed to unlisted numbers in bahrain and only one of them can reach the mahdi what happens in an emergency theyre not permitted interrupted azra who was leaning against the wall by a tall sunlit window i told you that and that my young friend is ridiculous we cant do what we do effectively without considering the unexpected granted zaya yateem nodded her head then shook it slowly however my brother has a point we are expected to carry on in any emergency for weeks if we must otherwise as leaders we would not be given our assignments very well said the congressman from the ninth district of colorado feeling the sweat rolling down his neck despite the cool morning breezes sweeping through the open windows then you explain to the mahdi why were not in bahrain tonight ive done my part including i believe saving your brothers life hes right about that zaya agreed azra pushing himself away from the wall id be a corpse in the desert by now for which im grateful bahrudi but i cant do the impossible i think youd better try kendrick glanced at ahbyahd beside him then turned back to the sister your mahdi went to a great deal of trouble and expense to get me here which i assume means he has an emergency the news of your capture would explain what happened said ahbyahd do you really think omans security forces will put out the word that they caught me only to admit i escaped of course not answered zaya yateem the mahdi holds your purse strings added kendrick and he could influence mine which i dont like our supplies are low broke in ahbyahd we need the fast boats from the emirates or everything weve done will be for nothing instead of besieging we ourselves will be in a state of siege there may be a way said zaya suddenly getting out of the chair her hands on the desk her dark eyes above the veil gazing aimlessly in thought weve scheduled a press conference this morning it will be watched everywhere and certainly by the mahdi himself at some point in my talk ill mention that we are sending out an urgent message to our friends a message that requires an immediate response what good would that do asked azra all communications are monitored we know that none of the mahdis people will risk getting in touch with us they dont have to interrupted evan sitting forward i understand what your sisters saying the response need not be verbal no communication is necessary were not asking for instructions were giving them its what you and i talked about several hours ago azra i know bahrain ill choose a place where well be and let one of your contacts here in masqat forward it telling him that this is the urgent message your sister spoke of during the press conference kendrick turned to yateem that is what you had in mind isnt it i hadnt refined it admitted zaya but its feasible my thought was merely to speed up the process of reaching the mahdi it is plausible its the solution cried ahbyahd bahrudi has given it to us nothing is solved at this juncture said the veiled woman again sitting down theres the problem of getting my brother and mr bahrudi to bahrain how can it be done its been taken care of answered evan the pounding in his chest accelerating astonished at his own control at his casual voice he was closer closer to the mahdi i have a telephone number which i wont give youcant give youbut with a few words it will get us a plane just like that exclaimed ahbyahd your benefactor here in oman has methods you havent dreamed of all phone calls in and out are intercepted objected azra what i say may be heard but not what the person im calling says i was assured of that a scrambling device asked yateem theyre part of our kits in europe a simple cone pressed over the mouthpiece the distortion is absolute except on the direct connection make your call said zaya getting up and walking rapidly around the desk as kendrick did the same replacing her in the chair holding his hand over the numbers evan dialled yes ahmats voice came on the line before the second ring a plane said kendrick two passengers where when my god exploded the young sultan of oman let me think the airport of course theres a turn in the road about a quarter of a mile before the cargo area someone will pick you up in a garrison car tell them it was stolen to get you past the guards when it will take time the securitys heavy everywhere and arrangements have to be made can you give me a destination the twentysecond letter split in two v splita slanted iiran no by the numbers twentysecond two b yes bahrain yes that helps ill make some calls how soon do you need it at the height of the festivities here we have to get out in the confusion that would be around noon whatever you say incidentally theres a doctorhe has something i may need for my health the money belt of course it will be slipped to you good the turn before the cargo area be there we will evan hung up the phone were to be at the airport by twelve noon the airport shouted azra well be picked up on the road before the airport someone will steal a garrison car and theyll pick us up ill arrange for one of our contacts here in the city to drive you said zaya yateem hell be the one to whom you will give the location in bahrain the meeting ground you have at least five hours before you leave well need clothes a shower and some rest said azra i cant remember when i last slept id like to look around your operation remarked kendrick getting out of the chair i might learn something whatever you wish amal bahrudi said zaya yateem approaching evan you saved my dear brothers life and for that there are no adequate words to express my thanks just get me to that airport by noon replied kendrick no warmth in his voice frankly i want to get back to germany as soon as possible by noon agreed the female terrorist weingrass will be here by noon exclaimed the mossad officer to benami and the fiveman unit from the masada brigade they were in the cellar of a house in the jabal saali minutes from the rows of english graves where scores of privateers were buried centuries before the primitive stone basement had been converted into a control centre for israeli intelligence how will he get here asked benami who had taken the ghotra off his head the blue jeans and loose dark shirt far more natural to him his passport was issued in jerusalem not the most welcome of documents one does not question emmanuel weingrass he undoubtedly has more passports than there are bagels in tel avivs jabotinsky square he says we are to do nothing until he arrives absolutely nothing were his exact words you dont sound so disapproving of him as you did before said yaakov code name blue son of a hostage and leader of the masada unit because i will not have to sign his expense vouchers therell be none all i had to do was mention kendricks name and he said he was on his way that hardly means he wont submit his expenses countered benami chuckling oh no i was very specific i asked him how much would it cost us for his assistance and he replied unequivocally up yours this is on me its an american expression that absolves us from payment were wasting time cried yaakov we should be scouting the embassy weve studied the plans there are a halfdozen ways we might enter and get out with my father heads snapped and eyes widened at the young leader called blue we understand said the mossad officer im sorry i didnt mean to say that you of all people have every right to say it said benami i shouldnt have i apologize again but why should we wait for this weingrass because he delivers my friend and without him we may not i see you people in the mossad turn flipflops now its the american you want to help not our original objective damn it yes my father the result could be one and the same yaakov im not yaakov roared the young leader to you i am only bluethe son of a father who watched his own father and mother pulled apart in auschwitz as they clung to each other before each was driven into the showers of gas i want my father out and safe and i can do it how much more can that man suffer a childhood of horror watching while children his own age were hanged for stealing garbage to eat sodomized by wehrmacht pigs hiding starving in forests all over poland until the allies came then later blessed with three sons only to have two of them killed my brothers killed butchered in sidon by filthy pigterrorist arabs now i should care about one american cowboy a politician who wants to be a hero so he can act in films and have his picture on cereal boxes from what ive been told said benami calmly none of that is true this american risks his life without help from his own people without the prospect of future rewards if he lives as our friend here tells us he does what hes doing for a reason not very much different from yours to right a terrible wrong that was done to him to his family as it were to hell with him that was a family not a people i say we go to the embassy i say you dont said the officer placing his pistol slowly on the table you are now under the command of the mossad and you will follow our orders pigs screamed yaakov youre pigs all of you ever so said benami all of us am oman time the controlled press conference was over the reporters and television crews were securing their notebooks and equipment prepared to be ushered out through the embassy halls to the outside gates patrolled by a hundred young men and veiled women marching back and forth with weapons at readyfire inside the conference hall however a fat man broke through the guards with unctuous words and approached the table where zaya yateem sat rifles at his head he spoke i come from the mahdi he whispered who pays every shilling you owe you too the emergency in bahrain must be serious indeed i beg your pardon hes been searched asked zaya of the guards who nodded let him go thank you madamewhat emergency in bahrain obviously we dont know one of our own is going there tonight to be told and will return to us with the news macdonald stared into the eyes above the veil a sharp hollow pain forming in his enormous chest what was happening why was bahrain going around him what decisions had been made that excluded him why what had the filthy arab whore done madame continued the englishman slowly his words measured the emergency in bahrain is a new development whereas i am concerned with another question equally serious our benefactor would like clarifiedimmediately clarifiedthe presence of the woman khalehla here in masqat khalehla theres no woman named khalehla among us here but then names are meaningless arent they not here not inside here but outside and in contact with your peopleyour own brother in fact my brother precisely three escaped prisoners raced to meet her on the road to jabal sham to meet with the enemy what are you saying im not saying madame im demanding we are demanding an explanation the mahdi insists on it most emphatically i have no idea what youre talking about it is true three prisoners escaped one of them my brother along with yosef and our benefactors other emissary a man named bahrudi from east berlin eastmadame youre too quick for me if youre really from the mahdi im astonished youre not aware of him yateem stopped her penetrating large eyes roaming over macdonalds face on the other hand you could be from anyone anywhere while in masqat i am the mahdis only voice call bahrain and hear it for yourself madame you know perfectly well such calls are not permitted zaya snapped her fingers for the guards they rushed to the table take this man and bring him to the council room then wake my brother and yosef and find amal bahrudi another conference is called for now the clothes evan chose for himself were a blend of the terrorist dress code unpressed khaki trousers a soiled americanstyle field jacket and a dark shirt open to midchest except for his age and his eyes he was similar in appearance to the majority of the fanatic punks who had captured the embassy even the years were obscured by his darkened flesh and his eyes were shaded by the visor of a cloth cap to complete the image he wanted a sheathed knife was attached to his jacket and the bulge of a revolver apparent in the right pocket the trusted one was trusted he had saved the life of azra prince of terrorists and moved freely about the seized embassy from one sickening scene to another one frightened exhausted hopeless group to another hope it was all he could give knowing that in the final analysis it was probably false but he had to give it give them something to cling to at least to think about in the darkest most terrifying hours of the night im an american he whispered to shocked hostages wherever he found three or more together his eyes constantly glancing around at the roving punks who thought he was insulting their prisoners with sudden audible bursts of anger nobodys forgotten you were doing all we can dont mind my shouting at you i have to thank god was the constant initial reply followed by tears and descriptions of horror that invariably included the public execution of the seven condemned hostages theyll kill us all they dont care the filthy animals dont care about deathours or theirs do your best to stay calm and i mean that try not to show fear thats very very important dont antagonize but dont crawl to them seeing you afraid is like a narcotic to them remember that at one point kendrick suddenly stood up and shouted abusively at a group of five americans his straying eyes had picked out one of zaya yateems personal guards the man was walking rapidly towards him you bahrudi yes zaya must see you right away come the council room evan followed the guard across the roof and down three flights of stairs into a long corridor he removed his cap now soaked with perspiration and was led to the open door of a large embassy office he walked inside and four seconds later his world was shattered by the last words he could ever hope to hear good christ youre evan kendrick the icarus agenda chapter meen ir rdhgill da said evan mind and body paralysed straining forcing himself to move casually as he asked zaya who was the obese man who had spoken english he says he is from the mahdi azra replied standing between yosef and ahbyahd what did he mean you heard him he says youre someone named kendrick whos that asked evan in english addressing anthony macdonald trying desperately to remain composed while adjusting not only to the sight of a man he had not seen in nearly five years but to his very presence in that room macdonald the fatuous society drunk from the british colony in cairo my name is amal bahrudi what is yours you know damned well who i am shouted the englishman jabbing his index finger in the air looking in turn at the four arab councillors especially zaya yateem hes not amalwhatever and hes not from the mahdi hes an american named evan kendrick i studied at two american universities said evan smiling but no one ever called me a kendrick other things yes but not kendrick youre lying on the contrary id have to say youre the liar if you claim to be working for the mahdi i was shown the photograph of every european in hisshall we sayconfidential employ and you certainly were not among them i would definitely remember becauseshall we again sayyou have a very distinctive face and figure liar impostor you work with khalehla the whore the enemy early this morning before daybreak she was on her way to meet you what are you talking about kendrick glanced at azra and yosef ive never heard of a khalehla either as an enemy or a whore and before daybreak my friends and i were running for our lives we had no time for dalliance i assure you i tell you hes lying i was there and i saw her i saw all of you you saw us asked evan eyebrows arched how i drove off the road you saw us and you did not help us broke in kendrick angrily and you say youre from the mahdi he has a point englishman said zaya why did you not help them there were things to learn thats why and now i have learned them khalehla him you have extraordinary fantasies thats what you have whatever your name is which i dont know one however we can easily dispose of were on our way to bahrain to meet the mahdi well take you with us the great man will undoubtedly be delighted to see you again since youre so important to him i agree said azra firmly bahrain roared macdonald how in hell are you going to get there you mean you dont know said kendrick emmanuel weingrass his slender chest heaving in pain from the most recent fit of coughing stepped out of the car in front of the cemetery at jabal saali he turned to the driver who held the door and spoke reverently in an exaggerated british accent i shall pray over my english ancestors so few do you know come back in an hour howar asked the man holding up one finger issa he repeated in arabic using the word for hour yes my islamic friend it is a profound pilgrimage i make every year can you understand that yes yes el sallah alláhoo akbar answered the driver rapidly nodding his head saying that he understood prayers and that god was great he also held money in his hand more money than he had expected knowing that even more could be his when he returned in an hour leave me now said weingrass i wish to be alonesibni fiháhlee yes yes the man closed the door ran back to his seat and drove away manny permitted himself a brief spasm one vibrating cough compounding the previous one and looked around to ascertain his bearings then started across the cemetery to the stone house that stood in a field several hundred yards away ten minutes later he was ushered down to the basement where israeli intelligence had set up its command post weingrass cried the mossad officer its good to see you again no its not youre never happy to see me or hear me on the telephone you know nothing about the work you do youre only an accountanta miserly one at that now manny lets not start i say we start right away interrupted weingrass looking over at benami and the five members of the masada unit do any of you misfits have whisky i know this zohlah doesnt he added implying that the mossad man was cheap not even wine replied benami it was not included in our provisions no doubt issued by this one all right accountant tell me everything you know where is my son evan kendrick here but thats all we know thats standard you were always three days behind the sabbath manny calm yourself youll have cardiac arrest and i dont want israel to lose its worst accountant who can tell me more i can tell you more shouted yaakov code name blue we should be at this momenthours agostudying the embassy we have a job to do that has nothing to do with your american so besides an accountant you have a hothead said weingrass anyone else kendrick is here without sanction replied benami he was flown over under cover but is now left to his own devices hes unacknowledged if caught where did you get that information one of our men in washington i dont know who or from what department or agency youd need a telephone book how secure is this phone asked weingrass sitting down at the table no guarantees said the mossad officer it was installed in a hurry for as few shekels as possible im sure manny oh shut up weingrass took a notebook out of his pocket flipped through the pages and riveted his eyes on a name and a number he picked up the phone and dialled within seconds he spoke thank you my dear friend at the palace for being so courteous my name is weingrass insignificant to you of course but not to the great sultan ahmat naturally i would not care to disturb his illustrious person but if you could get word to him that i called perhaps he might return a great favour let me give you a number may i manny did so squinting at the digits on the phone thank you my dear friend and may i say in respect that this is a most urgent matter and the sultan may praise you for your diligence thank you again the once renowned architect hung up the telephone and leaned back in the chair breathing deeply to stem the rattling echo erupting in his chest now we wait he said looking at the mossad officer and hope that our sultan has more brains and money than you do my god he came back after four years he heard me and my son has come back why asked yaakov the mahdi said weingrass quietly angrily staring at the floor the who youll learn hothead hes not really your son manny hes the only son i ever wanted the telephone rang weingrass grabbed it pulling it to his ear yes emmanuel at one time when we found ourselves in los angeles you were far less formal allah be praised ill never forget i had myself checked when i got back here tell me you young stinker did you ever get a passing grade for that economics thesis in your third year only a b manny i should have listened to you you told me to make it far more complicatedthat they liked complications can you talk asked weingrass his voice suddenly serious i can but you may not from this end everythings static do you understand yes our mutual acquaintance where is he on his way to bahrain with two other people from the embassythere was supposed to be only one other but that was changed at the last minute i dont know why because theres a string leading to someone else probably is that everyone ahmat paused briefly no manny he said quietly theres one other you must not interfere with or acknowledge in any way she is a woman and her name is khalehla i tell you this because i trust you and you should know that shes there but no one else must ever know her presence here must be kept as quiet as our friends her exposure would be a catastrophe thats a mouthful young fellow how do i recognize this problem i hope therell be no cause for you to shes hidden in the pilots cabin which will remain locked until they reach bahrain thats all youll tell me about her yes ive got to move what can you do for me send you on another plane as soon as he can our friend will call and tell me whats happening when you get there contact me heres how ahmat gave his private scrambled telephone number to weingrass must be a new exchange said manny its no exchange said the young sultan will you be at this number yes ill call you back with the arrangements if theres a commercial flight leaving soon it would be easier all around to get you on it sorry cant do that why not everything has to be blind and deaf ive got seven peacocks with me seven yes and if you think thered be troublelike catastrophestry those highly intelligent birds feathered in blue and white ahmat sultan of oman gasped the mossad he whispered thats about it holy shit exclaimed ahmat the small sixpassenger rockwell jet flew northwest at thirtyfour thousand feet over the united arab emirates and into the persian gulf on its eighthundredmile course to the sheikdom of bahrain a disturbingly quiet confident anthony macdonald sat alone in the first row of two seats azra and kendrick in the last row together the door to the pilots cabin was shut and according to the man who had met them in the stolen garrison car and ushered them through the cargo area to the far end of masqats airfield and the plane that door would remain shut until the passengers left the aircraft no one was to see them they would be met at bahrains international airport in muharraq by someone who would escort them through immigration evan and azra had gone over the schedule several times and as the terrorist had never been to bahrain he took notesprimarily locations and their spellings it was imperative to kendrick that he and azra separate at least for an hour or so the reason was anthony macdonald the most unlikely of the mahdis agents the englishman might be a short cut to the mahdi and if he was evan would abandon the crown prince of terrorists remember we escaped together from the jabal sham and when you consider interpol to say nothing of the combined intelligence units from europe and america therell be alerts out for us everywhere and with our photographs we cant take the chance of being spotted together in daylight after sundown the risk is less but even then we must take precautions what precautions buy different clothes to begin with these have the mark of lowerclass roughnecks all right for the conditions in masqat but not here take a taxi to manamah thats the city across the causeway on the big island and get a room at the aradous hotel on the wadi al ahd theres a mens shop in the lobby buy yourself a western business suit and get a haircut at the barbers write it all down i am azra wrote faster register under the name ofcome to think of it yateem is a common name in bahrain but lets not take the chance my mothers name ishaad their computers are too full use farouk everyone else does t farouk ill reach you in an hour or two what will you be doing what else said kendrick about to tell the truth stay with the english liar who claims to work for the mahdi if by any chance he does and his communications broke down the meeting tonight will be easily arranged but frankly i dont believe him and if hes the liar i think i have to learn who he is working for azra looked at the man he knew as amal bahrudi and spoke softly you live in a more complicated world than i do we know our enemies we aim our weapons at them and try to kill them because they would kill us yet it appears to me that you cannot be sure that instead of firing your guns in the heat of battle you must first concern yourselves over who is the enemy youve had to infiltrate and consider the possibility of traitors the precautions arent that much different infiltration isnt difficult when thousands dress like we do talk like we do its a matter of attitude we assume the enemys as to traitors we failed in masqat you taught us that me the photographs bahrudi of course sorry my minds on other things it was but he could not do that again thought kendrick the young terrorist was looking curiously at him he had to remove any doubts quickly but speaking of those photographs your sister will have to provide proof that shes ripped out the entire treacherous business i suggest other photographs corpses in front of a smashed camera with taped statements that can be circulatedtaped confessions of course zaya knows what to do shes the strongest among us the most dedicated she wont rest until shes torn apart every room searched every brother and sister methodically words poet admonished evan harshly perhaps you dont understand what happened in masqatwhat was carelessly permitted to happencould affect our operations everywhere if it gets out and goes unpunished agents everywhere will be flocking to infiltrate us worming their way inside to expose us with cameras and recordings all right all right said azra nodding unwilling to hear further criticism my sister will take care of everything i dont think she was convinced until she understood what you did for us in the jabal sham saw what you could do on the telephone she will quickly take the actions she must i assure you good rest now angry poet weve got a long afternoon and night ahead of us kendrick leaned far back in the seat as though prepared to doze his halfclosed eyes on the back of anthony macdonalds large balding head in the first row there was so much to think about so many things to consider that he had not had time to analyse even try to analyse yet above everything there was a mahdi the mahdi not surrounding and starving out khartoum and general gordon in the late s but living and manipulating terror a hundred years later in bahrain and there was a complex chain that led to the monster it was concealed buried professionally fashioned but it was there he had found a terrorist appendage only a tentacle perhaps but part of the host body the killer beside him could lead to the main conduit as each electric cable in a building ultimately leads to the central power source five calls are made ten times jive to unlisted numbers in bahrain and only one can reach the mahdi zaya yateem who knew whereof she spoke fifty calls fifty telephone numbersone among fifty unknown men or women who knew where the mahdi was who he was he had created an emergency the way manny weingrass had always told him to invent emergencies when dealing with potential clients who would not or could not communicate with each other tell the fast bozo that you have to have an answer by wednesday or were moving on to riyadh tell the second clown we cant wait beyond thursday because theres a hell of a job in abu dhabi thats ours for the asking this was not the same of course only a variation of the technique the terrorist leaders at the embassy in masqat were convinced an emergency existed for their benefactor the mahdi since he had arranged for east berlins amal bahrudi to bring one of them to bahrain conversely the forces of the mahdi had been told on international television that an urgent message had been sent out to friends and it required an immediate responseemergency manny did i do it right i have to find him fight himkill him for what he did to all of us emmanuel weingrass mused evan his eyes beginning to close the dead weight of sleep descending yet he could not prevent it a quiet laugh echoed in his throat he remembered their first trip to bahrain now for christs sake bear in mind that were dealing with a people who run an archipelago not a land mass bordering another land mass that both sides conveniently call a country this is a sheikdom consisting of over thirty goddamned islands in the persian gulf its nothing youre going to measure in acreage and they never want you tothats their strength what are you driving at manny try to understand me you unread mechanic you appeal to that sense of strength this is an independent state a collection of eruptions from the sea that protects the ports from the storms of the gulf and is conveniently situated between the qatar peninsula and the hasa coast of saudi arabia the latter extremely important because of the saudi leverage what the hell has that got to do with a lousy island golf course do you play golf manny i never could afford it chasing a little white ball over a hundred acres of grass while the arthritis is killing you and your heart is blowing apart in frustration has never been my idea of a civilized pursuit however i know what we put into this lousy golf course what remembrances of things past because its a constant reminder of their present a reminder to everyone their strength will you come down from orbit please read the historical chronicles of assyria persia the greeks and the romans take a peek through the early drawings of the portuguese cartographers and the logs of vasco da gama at one time or another all these people fought for control of the archipelagothe portuguese held it for a hundred yearswhy im sure youll tell me because of its geographical location in the gulf its strategic importance for centuries its been a coveted centre for trade and the financial repositories of trade the much younger evan kendrick had sat up at that moment now understanding what the eccentric architect was driving at thats whats happening now he had interrupted by leaps and bounds money pouring in from all over the world as an independent state without fear of being conquered in todays world clarified weingrass bahrain services allies and enemies alike so our magnificent clubhouse on this lousy golf course will reflect its history well do it with murals a businessman looks up at the paintings above the bar and sees all these things pictured and thinks jesus this is some place everybody wanted it look at the money they spent hes now even more anxious to operate here its common knowledge that deals are made on golf courses you young illiterate why do you think they want to build one after they had built the somewhat grotesque clubhouse on the secondrate golf course the kendrick group contracted for three banks and two government buildings and manny weingrass was personally pardoned by one of the highest ministers for disturbing the peace at a cafe on the al zubara road the drone of the jet bored into evans brain his eyes were closed i object to this subsidiary operation and i want the record to show it said yaakov code name blue of the masada brigade as the seven men climbed into the jet at the far east end of masqats airfield emmanuel weingrass immediately joined the pilot strapping himself into the adjacent seat coughing quietly deeply as he secured the belt the mossad officer had remained behind he had work to do in oman his pistol was in the possession of the slender benami who kept it unholstered until the fiveman unit had taken their seats in the aircraft the record will show it my friend replied benami as the plane sped down the runway please try to understand that there are things we cannot be told for the good of all of us we are the activists the soldiersand those who make the decisions are the high command they do their job and we do ours which is to follow orders then i must object to a loathsome parallel said the unit member code name grey following orders is not a phrase i find very palatable i remind you mr benami added code orange for the past three weeks weve trained for a single assignment one we all believe we can accomplish despite profound doubts back home were ready were primed for it and suddenly its aborted without explanation and were on our way to bahrain hunting a man we dont know with a plan weve never seen if there is a plan said code black and not simply a debt owed by the mossad to a disagreeable old man who wants to find an american a gentile son that isnt his weingrass turned around the plane was climbing rapidly the engines partially muted by the swift ascent listen to me peaheads he shouted if that american has gone to bahrain with a demented arab terrorist it means hes got a damn good reason it probably hasnt occurred to you musclebound intellectual crap shooters but masqat wasnt planned by those subhuman yoyos playing with guns the brains if youll pardon an obscure reference are in bahrain and thats what hes after who hes after your explanation if true said code white does not include a plan mr weingrass or do we roll dice on that issue the odds may be worse smart ass but no we dont once weve landed and set up shop ill be calling masqat every fifteen minutes until we have the information we need then we have a plan how asked blue angrily suspiciously we make it up hothead the huge englishman stood in rigid disbelief as the terrorist azra started walking away with the bahrainian official the quiet man in uniform had met the rockwell jet beyond the last maintenance hangar at the airport in muharraq wait shouted macdonald glancing wildly at evan kendrick standing beside him stop you cant leave me with this man i told you hes not who he says he is hes not one of us no hes not agreed the palestinian stopping and looking over his shoulder hes from east berlin and he saved my life if youre telling the truth i assure you hell save yours you cant i must broke in azra turning to the official and nodding the bahrainian without comment either in his words or his expression addressed kendrick as you can see my associate is coming out of the hangar he will escort you through another exit welcome to our country azra screamed macdonald his voice drowned out by the roar of jet engines easy tony said evan as the second bahrainian official approached them were entering illegally and you could get us shot you i knew it was you you are kendrick of course i am and if any of our people here in bahrain knew you used my name your lovely besotted ceciliait is cecilia isnt itwould be a widow before she could ask for another drink by christ i dont believe it you sold your firm and went back to america i was told youd become a politician of sorts with the mahdis help i might even become president oh my god smile tony this man doesnt like what hes doing and i wouldnt want him to think were ungrateful smile you fat son of a bitch khalehla in tan slacks a flight jacket and a visored officers cap stood by the tail of the harrier jet watching the proceedings a hundred feet away the young palestinian killer called blue had been ushered out the american congressman and the incredible macdonald were leaving with another uniformed man who conveyed them through a maze of cargo alleyways that eluded immigration this kendrick this apparent conformist with some terrible cause was better than she thought not only had he survived the horrors of the embassy something she had believed impossible nine hours ago and over which she had panicked but he had now separated terrorist from terrorists agent what was on his mind what was he doing hurry up she called to the pilot who was talking to a mechanic by the starboard wing lets go the pilot nodded briefly throwing his arms up in despair and the two of them headed towards the exit reserved for flight personnel ahmat the youthful sultan of oman had pushed all the buttons at his considerable command the three passengers on the jet were to be led to a stretch of the airports lowerlevel concourse far behind the main terminals taxi line where temporary taxi signs had been mounted on the pavement each cab driven by a member of the bahrainian secret police none had been given any information only a single order report the destination of each passenger khalehla and the pilot said their brief goodbyes and both went their separate ways he to the flight control centre for his returntomasqat instructions she to the designated area of the concourse where she would pick up the american and follow him it would call for all the skill she had to stay out of sight while she followed kendrick and macdonald tony would spot her in an instant and the obviously alert american might look twice and remember a dark filthy street in the el shari el mish kwayis and a woman who held a gun in her hand the fact that it had not been pointed at him but instead at four people in that street of garbage who had tried to rob her or worse would not be readily believed by a man living on the edge of very real peril purpose and paranoia converged in the infinite reaches of a mind under severe stress he was armed and one exploding image could trigger a violent response khalehla did not fear for her life eight years of training including four years in the violent middle east had taught her to anticipate to kill before she was killed what saddened her was not only that this decent man should have to die for what he was doing but it was entirely possible that she could be his executioner it was growing more possible by the minute she reached the area before the passengers from the oman jet the traffic on the arrivals level was horrendous cars with tinted windows taxis ordinary nondescript vehicles pickup trucks of all descriptions the noise and the fumes were overpowering the cacophony deafening under the low concrete ceiling khalehla found a shadowed enclave between two cargo bins and waited the first to emerge was the terrorist called azra accompanied by a uniformed official the latter flagged a taxi which sped up to the coarselydressed young man at the curb he stepped inside and read from a piece of paper in his hand giving the driver instructions several minutes later the strange american and the unbelievable anthony macdonald walked out on the pavement something was wrong thought khalehla instantly without really thinking merely observing tony was behaving like his once and former cairo self there was agitation in every movement of his huge body wasted energy craving attention his eyes bulging his constantly changing facial expressions those of a drunk pleading for respectall in counterpoint to the superb control necessary to a deep cover operator with a network of informers in a worldclass volatile situation it was all wrong and then it happened as the taxi sped up to the curb macdonald suddenly rammed his enormous torso against the american sending him out into the covered street in front of the rushing cab kendrick bounced off the bonnet his body flung in midair into the racing traffic of the tunnellike concourse brakes screeched whistles blew and the congressman from the ninth district of colorado was impaled curved around the shattered windscreen of a small japanese car good god hes dead thought khalehla running out on the pavement and then he movedboth arms moved as the american tried to push himself up collapsing as he did so khalehla raced to the car surging through a knot of police and bahrains secret police who had converged on the scene rupturing one immovable mans spleen with a vicious accurate fist she threw her body over the spastically moving kendrick while removing the gun from her flight jacket she spoke to the nearest uniformed man the weapon angled at his head my name is khalehla and thats all you have to know this man is my property and he goes with me pass the word and get us out of here or ill kill you the figure raced into the sterile room so agitated that he slammed the door behind him nearly tripping in the darkness on his way to his equipment hands trembling he brought his appliance to life ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed somethings happened breakthrough or breakdown the hunter or the hunted the last report speaks of bahrain but without specifics only that the subject was in a state of extreme anxiety demanding to be flown there immediately of course that assumes he either escaped from the embassy was taken out by subterfuge or never went inside at all but why bahrain everything is too incomplete as if the subjects shadow was obscuring events for his own reasonsa not unlikely possibility considering everything thats happened during the past few years and the subpoena powers of congress and various special prosecutors what has happened whats happening now my appliances scream for information but i cant give them anything to factor in a name without specific reference only spews forth encyclopaedic historical data long since insertedand updatedby photoscan sometimes i think my own talents defeat me for i see beyond factors and equations and find visions yet he is the man my appliances tell me that and i trust them the icarus agenda chapter evan struggled against the constricting tape around his left shoulder and then was aware of a stinging sensation that extended throughout his upper chest accompanied by the sharp smell of rubbing alcohol he opened his eyes startled to find that he was sitting up in a bed pillows supporting his back he was in a womans bedroom a dressing table with a low goldrimmed chair against the wall stood on his left a profusion of lotions and perfumes were in small ornate bottles in front of a large threesided mirror bordered with tiny bulbs tall windows flanked the table the cascading peachcoloured curtains made of a translucent material that virtually shoutedas did the rest of the rococo furniturea hefty decorators fee a satin chaiselounge was in front of the far window beside it a small telephone tablecummagazine rack with a top of rose marble the wall directly in front of the bed some twenty feet away consisted of a long row of mirrored cupboards on his right beyond the bedside table was an ivorycoloured writing desk with another goldrimmed chairand then the longest single bureau he had ever seen it was lacquered peachpeche as manny weingrass would insist uponand extended the entire length of the wall the floor was covered with soft thick white carpeting the pile of which appeared capable of massaging the bare feet of anyone walking across it if he dared the only item lacking was a mirror over the bed the sculptured door was closed yet he could hear voices beyond it a mans and a womans he turned his wrist to look at his watch it was gone where was he how did he get here oh christ the airport concourse he was slammed into a cartwo rushing carsand a crowd had gathered around him until limping he was led away azra azra was waiting for him at the aradous hotel and macdonald gone oh my god everythings blown apart close to panic only vaguely aware of the late afternoon sun streaming through the windows he threw off the sheet and climbed out of bed unsteady wincing gritting his teeth with each move he made but he could move and that was all that mattered he was also naked and suddenly the door opened im glad you could get up said the oliveskinned woman as kendrick lurched back to the bed and the peche sheet while she closed the door it confirms the doctors diagnosis he just left he said you were badly banged up but the x rays showed no broken bones x rays where are we and who the hell are you lady you dont remember me then if this exclaimed evan angrily sweeping his hand over the room is your modest pieddterre in bahrain i assure you ive never seen it before its not a place one easily forgets its not mine said khalehla shaking her head with a trace of a smile and walking to the foot of the bed it belongs to a member of the royal family a cousin of the emir an elderly man with a young wifehis youngestboth of whom are in london hes quite ill which accounts for the medical equipment in the basement a great deal of equipment rank and money have their privileges everywhere but especially here in bahrain your friend the sultan of oman made this possible for you but someone had to make it possible for him to know what happenedfor him to make it possible that was me of course i do know you interrupted kendrick frowning i just cant remember where or how i wasnt dressed like this and we saw each other under equally unpleasant circumstances in masqat in a dark filthy alleyway that serves as a street rot town cried evan eyes wide head rigid slime town elbaz youre the woman with the gun you tried to kill me no not true i was protecting myself from four thugs three men and a girl kendrick briefly closed his eyes i remember that a kid in cutoff khakis holding his arm he wasnt a kid objected khalehla he was a drug addict as stretched out as his girlfriend and they both would have killed me to pay their arab suppliers for what they needed i was following you nothing more nothing less information thats my job for whom the people i work for how did you know about me that i wont answer whom do you work for in the broad sense an organization that seeks to find solutions for the multiple horrors of the middle east israeli no replied khalehla calmly my roots are arab that doesnt tell me a damn thing but it sure scares me why is it so impossible for an american to think we arabs might want to find equitable solutions ive just come from the embassy in masqat what i saw there wasnt prettyarab pretty nor to us however may i quote an american congressman who said on the floor of the house of representatives that a terrorist isnt born hes made astonished evan looked hard at the woman that was the only comment i ever made for the congressional record the only one you did so after a particularly vicious speech by a congressman from california who practically called for the wholesale slaughter of all palestinians living in what he termed eretz israel he didnt know eretz from biarritz he was a wasp grubber who thought he was losing the jewish vote in los angeles he told me that himself the day before he mistook me for an ally thinking that id approvegoddamn it he winked at me do you still believe what you said yes replied kendrick hesitantly as if questioning his own response no one whos walked through the squalor of the refugee camps can think anything remotely normal can come out of them but what i saw in masqat went too far forget about the screaming and the wild chants there was something ice cold a methodical brutality that thrived on itself those animals were enjoying themselves the majority of those young animals never had a home their earliest memories are of wandering through the filth of the camps trying to find enough to eat or clothes for their younger brothers and sisters only a pitiful few have any skills even basic schooling these things were not available to them they were outcasts in their own land tell that to the children of auschwitz and dacha said evan in quiet cold fury these people are alive theyre part of the human race checkmate mr kendrick i have no answer only shame i dont want your shame i want to get out of here youre in no condition to continue what you were doing look at you youre exhausted and on top of that youve been severely damaged the sheet across his waist kendrick supported himself on the edge of the bed he spoke slowly i had a gun a knife and a watch among several other valuable items id like them back please i think we should discuss the situation theres nothing to discuss said the congressman absolutely nothing suppose i were to tell you weve found tony macdonald tony i work from cairo i wish i could say we were on to him months ago perhaps years ago but it wouldnt be true the first inkling i had was early this morning before daybreak in fact he followed me in a car with no headlights on the road above the jabal sham asked evan interrupting yes then youre crawly or something like that cawley theenemy among other things my name is khalehla the first two syllables pronounced like the french seaport calais and i am indeed his enemy but not the other things which i can easily imagine you were following me a statement yes then you knew about the escape again yes ahmat he trusts me we go back a long time then he must trust the people you work for i cant answer that i said he trusts me thats a corkscrew statementtwo corkscrew statements its a corkscrew situation wheres tony holed up in a room at the tylos hotel on government road under the name of strickland how did you find him through the taxi company on the way he stopped at a sporting goods store suspected of selling illegal weapons hes armed lets say the driver was cooperative lets say itll suffice if macdonald makes a move youll be informed immediately hes already made eleven phone calls to whom the numbers were unpublished a man will go over to the central exchange in an hour or so when the calling lets up and get the names theyll be given to you as soon as he has them and can reach an official or a public phone thanks i need those numbers khalehla pulled over the small rococo chair in front of the dressing table and sat down opposite kendrick tell me what youre doing congressman let me help why should i you wont give me my gun or my knife or my watchor a certain piece of clothing youve probably sold by now you wont even tell me whom you work for as to your gun your knife your watch and your wallet and a money belt with some fifty thousand american dollars and your gold cigarette lighter and a squashed pack of notforexport american cigaretteswhich was very foolish of youyou may have them all if youll just convince me that what youre doing wont result in the slaughter of two hundred and thirtysix americans in masqat we arabs cant tolerate that possibility were despised enough for the horrible things we cant control as to whom i work for why should it matter to you any more than it does to your friend and my friend ahmat you trust him he trusts me so you can trust me too a equals b equals c a therefore equals c incidentally your clothes have been fumigated laundered and pressed theyre in the first closet on the left evan perched awkwardly on the edge of the bed stared at the intense young woman his lips slightly parted thats a hell of a mouthful lady ill have to think about your alphabetical logic i dont know your schedule but you cant have much time between eleventhirty and midnight tonight said kendrick with no intention of revealing anything but a time span a young man was with me on the plane hes a terrorist from the embassy in masqat he registered at the aradous hotel on the wadi al ahd as t farouk how another cooperative driver answered khalehla permitting herself a broader smile lets say she added whoever you work for has a lot of input in a lot of places oddly enough the people i work for have nothing to do with it they wouldnt go this far but you did i had to personal reasons theyre off limits too youre something cawley khalehlakahlaylain english why dont you call your friend at the aradous he bought clothes at the hotel and also got a haircut i assume these were your instructions but call him relieve his mind youre almost too cooperativelike the drivers because im not your enemy and i want to cooperate call ahmat if you wish hell tell you the same thing incidentally like you i have the triple five number it was as if an unseen veil had been lifted off the arab womans face a lovely striking face thought evan as he studied the large brown eyes that held such care and curiosity in them yet still he swore silently at himself for being the amateur not knowing who was real and who was false between eleventhirty and midnight that was the zero hour the minute span when he would catch a link the link to the mahdi could he trust this terribly efficient female who told him only so much and no more then again could he do it himself she had the triple five number how did she get it suddenly the room started to spin around the sunlight through the windows became a sprayed burst of orange where were the windows no kendrick shouted khalehla not now dont collapse now make the call ill help you your friend must know that everything is all right hes a terrorist in bahrain he has nowhere to goyou must make the call evan felt the hard slaps against his face the harsh stinging blows that rushed the blood to his head his head that was suddenly cradled in khalehlas right arm as her left hand reached for a glass on the bedside table drink this she commanded holding the glass to his lips he did so the liquid exploded in his throat jesus he roared a hundred and twenty proof vodka and brandy said khalehla smiling still holding him it was given to me by a british misixer named melvyn get someone to have three of these and you can sell him a gross of anything on the rack thats what melvyn told me can i sell you something congressman like a phone call im not buying i dont have any money youve got it make that call please said khalehla releasing her prisoner as she retreated to the goldrimmed dressing table chair i think its terribly important kendrick shook his head trying to focus on the telephone i dont know the number i have it here khalehla reached into the pocket of her flight jacket and pulled out a piece of paper the number is fiveninefivenineone thank you madame secretary evan reached for the phone feeling a thousand aches in his body as he bent over and picked it up pulling it to his lap the exhaustion was spreading through him he could barely move barely dial azra he said hearing the terrorists voice have you studied the map of manamah good ill pick you up at the hotel at ten oclock kendrick paused darting his eyes up at khalehla if for any reason im delayed ill meet you in the street at the north end of the juma mosque where it joins the al khalifa road ill find you understood good kendrick trembling hung up the phone you have one more call to make congressman give me a couple of minutes kendrick leaned back on the pillows god he was tired you really should make it now you must tell ahmat where you are what youve done what is happening he expects it he deserves to hear it from you not me all right all right with enormous effort evan sat forward and picked up the phone which was still on the bed its direct dialling here in bahrain i forgot whats the code for masqat ninesixeight replied khalehla dial zerozeroone first i should reverse the goddamned charges said kendrick dialling barely able to see the numbers when did you last sleep asked khalehla twothree days ago when did you eat last cant remember how about you youve been pretty busy yourself madame notsuchbutterfly i cant remember either oh yes i did eat when i left the el shari el mish kwayis i stopped at that awful bakery in the square and got some orange baklava more to find out who was there than anything evan held up his hand the sultans buried private line was ringing iwah ahmat its kendrick im relieved im pissed off what what are you talking about why didnt you tell me about her her who evan handed the phone to a startled khalehla its me ahmat she said embarrassed eight seconds later during which the voice of the perplexed and angry young sultan could be heard across the room khalehla continued it was either this or having the press learn that an american congressman armed and with fifty thousand dollars on him had flown into bahrain without going through customs how long would it be before it was learned that he flew in on a plane ordered by the royal house of oman and how soon after that would there be speculation about his mission in masqat i used your name with a brother of the emir ive known for years and he arranged a place for us thank you ahmat here he is kendrick took the phone shes a biscuit my oldyoung friend but i suppose im better off here than where i might be just dont give me any more surprises okay why are you so quiet forget it heres the schedule and remember no interference unless i ask for it ive got our boy from the embassy at the aradous hotel and the macdonald situation which i assume you know about khalehla nodded and evan continued rapidly i gather you do hes being monitored at the tylos well be given a list of the calls hes been making when he stops making them incidentally theyre both armed exhausted kendrick then described the specifics of the meeting ground as they had been relayed to the agents of the mahdi we only need one ahmat one man who can lead us to him ill personally turn the rack until we get the information because i wouldnt have it any other way kendrick hung up the phone and fell back on to the pillows you need food said khalehla send out for chinese said evan youve got the fifty thousand not me ill get the kitchen to prepare you something me his lids half closed kendrick looked at the oliveskinned woman in the ridiculously rococo goldrimmed chair the whites of her dark brown eyes were bloodshot the sockets blue from exhaustion the lines of her striking face far more pronounced than her age called for what about you i dont matter you do youre about to fall out of that lilliputian throne of yours queen mother ill handle it thank you said khalehla sitting upright blinking in defiance since you wont give me my watch what time is it ten minutes past four everythings in place said evan swinging his legs out on to the floor under the sheet and im sure this garishlycivilized establishment can accommodate a wakeup call rest is a weapon i read that once battles have been won and lost more through sleep and the lack of sleep than firepower if youll modestly look away ill grab a towel from what i assume is the largest bathroom in bahrain over there and find myself another bed we cant leave this room except to leave the house why not those are the arrangements the emir doesnt care for his cousins young wife therefore the defilement caused by your person is restricted to her quarters there are guards outside to enforce the order i dont believe this i didnt make up the rules i simply got you a place to stay his eyes closing kendrick rolled back on the bed and over to the far side holding up the sheet to negotiate the distance all right miss cairo unless you want to keep slipping off that sillylooking couch or fall flat on your face on the floor heres your siesta pad before you relent two things dont snore and make sure im up by eightthirty twenty agonizing minutes later unable to keep her eyes open and having fallen off the chaiselounge twice khalehla crept into the bed the incredible happened incredible because neither expected it nor was it sought nor had either remotely considered the possibility two frightened exhausted people felt each others presence and more asleep than awake drew closer at first touching then slowly haltingly reaching finally holding grasping at each other swollen parted lips seeking searching desperately needing the moist contact that promised release from their fears they made love in a burst of frenzynot as strangers imitating animals but as a man and a woman who had communicated and somehow knew that there had to be a touch of warmth of comfort in a world gone mad i suppose i should say im sorry said evan his head on the pillows his chest heaving as if he were swallowing his last breaths of air please dont said khalehla quietly im not sorry sometimes sometimes we all need to be reminded that were part of the human race werent those your words in a different context i think not really not when you really think about it go to sleep evan kendrick i wont say your name again what does that mean go to sleep three hours later nearly to the minute khalehla got out of the bed picked up her clothes from the white carpet and glancing at the unconscious american quietly dressed she wrote a note on a sheet of royal stationery and placed it on the bedside table next to the phone she then went to the dressing table opened a drawer and removed kendricks possessions including the gun the knife the watch and his money belt she put everything on the floor by the bed except the halfused pack of american cigarettes which she crushed and shoved into her pocket she crossed to the door and silently let herself out ismah she whispered to the uniformed bahrainian guard telling him in a single word to heed her orders he is to be awakened at precisely eightthirty i myself will contact this royal house to see that it is done do you understand iwah iwah replied the guard stiffnecked and nodding his head in obedience there may be a phone call for him asking for the visitor its to be intercepted the information written down placed in an envelope and pushed under the door ill clear it with the authorities theyre just names and telephone numbers of people doing business with his firm understood iwah iwah good khalehla gently pointedly placed bahrainian diners worth fifty american dollars into the guards pocket he was hers for a lifetime or at least for five hours she walked down the ornate curved staircase to the enormous foyer and the carved front door which was opened by another guard bowing obsequiously she went out on the bustling pavement where robes and dark business suits rushed in both directions and looked for a public telephone she saw one on the corner and moved quickly towards it this call will be accepted i assure you operator said khalehla having given the numbers she had been instructed to give in an extreme emergency yes the voice five thousand miles away was harsh abrupt my name is khalehla youre the one i was to reach i believe no one else the operator said bahrain do you confirm it yes hes here ive been with him for several hours whats going down theres a meeting between eleventhirty and midnight near the juma mosque and the al halifax road i should be there sir hes not equipped he cant handle it no way lady hes a child where these people are concerned i can help you can also involve us which is out of the question and you know it as well as i do now get out of there i thought youd say that sir but may i please explain what i consider to be the negative odds of the equation in this particular operation i dont want to hear any of that spook bullshit get out of there khalehla winced as frank swann slammed down the telephone in washington dc the aradous and the tylos i know them both said emmanuel weingrass into the phone in the small secure office at the airport in muharraq t farouk and stricklandgood god i cant believe it that daffodil drunk from cairo oh sorry stinker i forgot i mean that french lilac from algiers thats what i meant to say go on weingrass wrote down the information from masqat given by a young man for whom he was beginning to have enormous respect he knew men twice ahmats age and with three times his experience who would have buckled under the stress the sultan of oman was enduring not excluding the outrageous western press that had no concept of his courage the courage for risks that could bring about his downfall and his death okay ive got it all hey stinker youre quite a guy you grew up to be a real mensch of course you probably learned it all from me i learned one thing from you manny a very important truth that was to face things as they were and not to make excuses whether it was for fun or in pain you said you told me a person could live with failure but not with the excuses that took away his right to fail it took me a long time to understand that thats very nice of you young fellow pass it on to the kid i read youre expecting call it the weingrass addendum to the ten commandments but manny yes please dont wear one of those yellow or red polkadotted bow ties in bahrain they kind of mark you you know what i mean now youre my tailor ill be in touch mensch wish us all good hunting i do my friend above all i wish i could be with you i know that i wouldnt be here if i didnt know itif our friend didnt know it weingrass hung up the phone and turned to the six men behind him they were perched on tables and chairs several holding their small secondary side arms others checking the battery charges in their handheld radios all watching and listening intently to the old man we split up he said benami and grey will come with me to the tylos blue you take the others to the aradous hotel manny stopped gripped by a sudden coughing seizure his face reddened and his slender frame shook violently benami and the members of the masada unit glanced at one another none moved each knowing instinctively that weingrass would rebuff any assistance but one thing was clear to all of them they were looking at a dying man water asked benami no replied manny curtly the coughing seizure subsiding lousy chest cold lousy weather in france all right where were we i was to take the others to the aradous hotel answered yaakov code name blue get yourself some decent clothes so you wont get thrown out of the lobby there are shops here in the airport clean jackets will be enough these are our working clothes objected black paper bag em said weingrass what are we to do at the aradous blue got off the table he was sitting on manny looked down at his notes then up at the young leader in room twozeroone is a man called azra arabic for blue interrupted code red glancing at yaakov hes on the terrorist council in masqat broke in orange they say he led the team that stormed the teverya kibbutz near the galilee killing thirtytwo including nine children he planted bombs in three settlements on the west bank added grey and blew up a pharmacy paintspraying the name azra on a wall after the blast the wall was pieced together like a puzzle and there it was the name azra ive seen him on television pig said yaakov quietly adjusting the straps of his weapon under the jacket when we get to the aradous what do we do give him tea and cakes or just a medal for humanitarianism you stay out of his sight replied weingrass harshly but dont let him out of yours two of you get rooms near his watch the door dont get a glass of water dont go to the toilet just watch his door every minute the two others take up positions in the street one in front the other by the employees exit stay in radio contact with each other work out simple codes oneword codesin arabic if he moves you move with him but dont let him suspect for even a moment that youre there remember hes as good as you are hes had to survive too are we silently escorting him to a private dinner party asked code blue sarcastically this is a plan without the most rudimentary blueprint the blueprint will come from kendrick said manny for once not rising to the insult if he really has one he added softly concern in his voice what benami rose from his chair not however in anger but in astonishment if everything goes according to schedule hell pick up the arab at ten oclock with his masqat terrorist in tow he expects to make contact with one of the mahdis agents someone who can lead them either to the mahdi himself or to someone else who can on what basis asked the incredulous benami from the mossad actually its not bad the mahdis people think theres an emergency but they dont know what it is an amateur roared code red of the masada unit therell be backups and blind drones and backups for them what the hell are we doing here youre here to take out the backups and the drones and the backups behind them shouted weingrass in reply if i have to tell you what to look for go back and start all over again with the boy scouts in tel aviv you follow you protect you take out the bad guys you clear a path for that amateur whos putting his life on the line this mahdis the key and if you havent understood that by now theres nothing i can do about it one word from him preferably with a gun to his head and everything stops in oman its not without merit said benami but its without sense cried yaakov suppose this kendrick does reach your mahdi what does he do what does he say code blue shifted to a broad caricature of an american accent say pardner ah gotta hell of a deal for you buddy you call off your dumb goons and ahll give you mah new leather boots ridiculous hell be shot in the head the moment hes asked whats the emergency thats not without merit either repeated benami lawyers now ive got yelled manny you think my son is stupid he built a construction empire on mishegoss the minute he has something concretea name a location a companyhe contacts masqat and our mutual friend the sultan calls the americans the british the french and anyone else he trusts whos set up shop in oman and they go to work their people here in bahrain close in merit said benami once again nodding not totally without agreed code black and what will you be doing asked a somewhat subdued yet still challenging yaakov caging a fat fox whos been devouring a lot of chickens in a coop no one ever knew about said weingrass kendricks eyes snapped open a sound a scrapean intrusion on the silence of the bedroom that had nothing to do with the traffic outside the tall windows it was closer more personal somehow intimate yet it was not the woman khalehla she was gone he blinked for a moment at the indented pillows beside him and despite everything that his mind was putting together he felt a sudden sadness for those brief few hours with her he had cared feeling a warmth between them that was only a part of their frantic lovemaking which in itself would not have happened without that sense of warmth what time was it he turned his wrist andhis watch was not there goddamn it the bitch still had it he rolled over on the bed and swung his legs out on the floor without regard for the sheet covering him the soles of his feet landed on hard objects he looked down at the polarbear white rug and blinked again everything that had been in his pockets was thereeverything but the pack of cigarettes which he very much wanted at the moment and then his eyes were drawn to a goldbordered page of notepaper on the bedside table he picked it up i think we were both kind to each other when each of us needed some kindness no regrets other than one i wont see you again goodbye no name no forwarding address just ciao amico so much for two passing ships in the persian gulf or two uptight damaged people on a late afternoon in bahrain but it was not afternoon any longer he realized he was barely able to read khalehlas note only the last orange sprays of sundown now streamed through the windows he reached for his watch it was sevenfiftyfive he had slept nearly four hours he was famished and his years in the deserts the mountains and the white water had taught him not to travel hard on an empty stomach a guard she had said outside she had explained evan yanked the sheet off the bed wrapped it around himself and walked across the room he stopped on the floor was an envelope that was the sound he had heard an envelope shoved under a door forced under sliding back and forth because of the thick rug he picked it up tore it open and read it a list of sixteen names addresses and telephone numbers macdonald the roster of calls he had made in bahrain one step closer to the mahdi evan opened the door the greetings between himself and the uniformed guard were dispensed with rapidly in arabic you are awake now sir you were not to be disturbed until eightthirty oclock id be most grateful if you would disturb me now with some food the woman said i might get something to eat from your kitchen indeed whatever you wish sir whatever you can find meat rice bread and milk id like some milk everything as soon as possible please very quick sir the guard turned and rushed down the hallway towards the staircase evan closed the door and stood for a moment finding his bearings in the now darkened room he switched on a lamp at the edge of the endless bureau then started across the thickpiled rug to another door that led to one of the most opulent bathrooms in bahrain ten minutes later he emerged showered and shaved now dressed in a short terrycloth robe he walked to the cupboard where khalehla had said his clothes werefumigated laundered and pressed he opened the mirrored door and barely recognized the odd assortment of apparel he had collected at the embassy in masqat it looked like a respectable paramilitary uniform leaving everything on hangers he draped the starched outfit over the chaiselounge walked back to the bed and sat down gazing at his belongings on the floor he was tempted to check his money belt to see if any of the large bills were missing then decided against it if khalehla was a thief he did not want to know it not at the moment the telephone rang its harsh bell less a ring than a prolonged metallic shriek for a moment he stared at the instrument wondering who he had macdonalds list that was the only call khalehla said he could expect khalehla had she changed her mind with a rush of unanticipated feeling he reached for the phone yanking it to his ear eight seconds later he wished to god he had not amreekánee said the male voice its flat monotone conveying hatred you leave that royal house before morning and you are a dead man tomorrow you go quietly back to where you came from where you belong the icarus agenda chapter emmanuel weingrass pulled code greys radio to his lips and spoke go ahead and remember to keep the line open ive got to hear everything if youll forgive me weingrass replied benami from the shadows across government road i would feel somewhat more secure if our colleague grey also heard you and i are not so adept in these situations as those young men they havent a brain in their collective head we have two this is not shul emmanuel this is whats called the field and it can be very unpleasant i have every confidence in you benny boy so long as you guarantee these kiddie radios can be heard through steel theyre as clear as any electronic bug ever developed with the added function of direct transmission one just pushes the right buttons one doesnt said weingrass you do go on well follow when we hear what this macdonaldstrickland says send code grey first please out of the shadows near the marquee of the tylos hotel benami joined the bustling crowds around the entrance people came and went mostly male mostly in western dress along with a smattering of women exclusively in western dress taxis disgorged passengers as others filled them tipping a harried doorman whose sole job was to open and close doors and every now and then to blow a strident whistle for a lowly thobed bellhop to carry luggage benami melted into this melee and went inside moments later through the background noise of the lobby he could be heard dialling squinting in irritation manny held up the radio between himself and the much taller muscular code grey the first words from room were obscured then the mossad agent spoke shaikh strickland whos this the englishmans cautious whisper was now distinct benami had adjusted the radio im downstairs anah henah littee gáhrah bloody damn black fool cried macdonald i dont speak that gibberish why are you calling from the lobby i was testing you mr strickland benami broke in quickly a man under stress often gives himself away you might have asked me where my business trip was taking me perhaps leading to a subsequent code then i would have known you were not the man yes yes i understand thank christ youre here its taken you long enough i expected you a halfhour ago you were to say something to me say it not over the telephone answered the mossad infiltrator firmly never over the telephone you should know that if you think im just going to let you into my room i wouldnt if i were you interrupted benami once again we know youre armed you do every weapon sold under a counter is known to us yes yes of course open your door with the latch on if my words are incorrect kill me yes very well im sure it wont be necessary but understand me whoever you are one misplaced syllable and youre a corpse i shall practise my english shaikh strickland a tiny green light suddenly began blinking on the small radio in weingrasss hand what the hell is that asked manny direct transmission replied code grey give it to me the masada commando took the instrument and pressed a button go ahead hes alone said benamis voice we have to move quickly take him now we dont make any moves you mossad imbecile countered weingrass grabbing the radio even those mutants from the state departments consular operations can hear what theyve just been told but not the holy mossad they hear only their own voices and maybe abrahams if hes got a code ring out of a box of corn flakes manny i dont need this said benami slowly painfully over the radio you need ears thats what you need ganza macher that daffodil expects a contact from the mahdi any minutesomeone whos not to call from the lobby but whos to go directly to his room hes got the words to get macdonald to open the door thats when we join the party and take them both what did you have in mind breaking the door down courtesy of the neanderthal here beside me well yes i dont need this either muttered grey quietly no wonder you idiots blew it in washington you thought password was a mossad drop and not a television show manny get your secret ass up to the second floor well be there in two minutes right tinker bell mr weingrass said code grey the muscles of his lean muscular jaw working furiously as he snapped off the radio you are probably the most irritatingly vexatious man i have ever met oy such words in the bronx you would have been beaten up for thatif ten or twelve of my irish or italian buddies could have handled you come on manny started across government road followed by grey who kept shaking his head not in disagreement but only to purge the thoughts he was thinking the hotel corridor was long the carpet worn it was the dinner hour and most of the guests were out weingrass stood at one end he had tried to smoke a gauloise but had crushed it out burning a hole in the carpet as it had started a devastating rumble in his chest benami was by the farthest elevator the everpresent irritated hotel guest waiting for a conveyance that never came code grey was nearest to room leaning casually against the wall next to a door fifteen feet diagonally across the hall from mr stricklands he was a professional he assumed the posture of a young man eagerly awaiting a woman he was perhaps not meant to meet even to the point of seeming to talk through the door it happened and weingrass was impressed the uniformed doorman from the tyloss marqueed entrance suddenly walked out of an elevator his goldbraided cap in his hand he approached room he stopped knocked waited for the chained door to be partially opened and spoke the chain was unlatched suddenly with the aggressive speed and purpose of an olympic athlete code grey spun away from the wall hurling himself at the two figures in the doorway somehow managing to withdraw a handgun from some unseen place as he crashed his body surging up laterally into his two enemies his feet and arms again somehow pulling them together as one entity and sending them across the floor two muted shots erupted from the commandos pistol the automatic in anthony macdonalds hand was blown away as were two of his fingers weingrass and benami converged on the door and rushed inside slamming it shut behind them my god look at me screamed the englishman on the floor grabbing his bleeding right hand jesus christ i have no get a towel from the bathroom ordered grey calmly addressing benami the mossad agent did as he was told by the younger man i am only a messenger yelled the doorman writhing next to the bed in fear i was only to deliver a message the hell youre a messenger said emmanuel weingrass standing over the man youre perfect you son of a bitch you see who comes who goesyoure their goddamned eyes oh i want to talk to you i have no hand shrieked the obese macdonald the blood rolling in tiny rivers down his arm here said benami kneeling down and wrapping a towel around the englishmans blownapart fingers dont do that ordered code grey grabbing the towel and throwing it aside you told me to get it protested benami confused ive changed my mind said grey his voice suddenly cold holding macdonalds arm down the blood now rushing out of his two stumped fingers blood continued the masada commando speaking calmly to the englishman especially blood from the right armfrom the aorta expelling it from the heartwill have nowhere to go but on this floor do you read me khanzeer do you understand me pig tell us what we must know or be drained of life where is this mahdi who is he i dont know shouted anthony macdonald coughing tears rolling down his cheeks and jowls like everyone else i call telephone numberssomeone gets back to me thats all i know the commandos head snapped up he was trained to hear things and sense vibrations others did not hear or sense get down he whispered harshly to benami and weingrass roll to the walls behind chairs anything the hotel door crashed open three arabs in sheer white robes their faces concealed by cloth lunged through the open space their muted machine pistols on openfire their targets obvious macdonald and the tylos doorman whose screaming prostrate bodies thumped like jackhammers under the fusillade of bullets until no sounds came from their bleeding mouths suddenly the killers were aware of others in the room they spun their weapons slashing the air for new targets but there were none to be had for they were no competition for the lethal code grey of the masada brigade the commando had raced to the left of the open door his back pressed into the wall his uzi ripped from the velcro straps under his jacket with a prolonged burst he cut down the three executioners instantly there were no deathreflexes each skull was blown apart out shouted grey lurching to weingrass and pulling the old man to his feet to the staircase by the elevators if were stopped added benami racing to the door were three people panicked by the gunfire out on government road they rested in an alley that led to the shaikh hamad boulevard code grey suddenly swore under his breath more at himself than at his companions damn damn damn i had to kill them you had no choice said the mossad agent one of their fingers on a trigger and we might all be dead certainly one of us but with even one of them alive we could have learned so much countered the man from the masada unit we learned something tinker bell said weingrass will you stop that actually its a term of affection young man what did we learn manny macdonald talked too much in his panic the englishman said things to people over the telephone he shouldnt have said so he had to be killed for a loose mouth how does that account for the doorman asked code grey expendable he got macdonalds door open for the mahdis firing squad your gun made the real noise they didnt and now that we know about macdonalds mouth and his execution we can assume two vital factslike the stress factors when youre designing an overhanging balcony on a building one weight perched off centre on another offcentre gravity pitch what the hell are you talking about manny my boy kendrick did a better job than he probably realizes the mahdis frightened he really doesnt know whats going on and by killing the big mouth now nobody can tell him he made a mistake isnt that something the mahdi made a mistake if your architectural schematics are as abstruse as you are mr weingrass said grey i hope none of your designs will be used for buildings in israel oh the words that boy has you sure you didnt go to the high school of science in the bronx never mind lets check out the scene at the juma mosque tell me tinker bell did you ever make a mistake i think i made one coming to bahrain the answer was lost on emmanuel weingrass the old man was doubled over in a coughing seizure against the wall of the dark alleyway stunned kendrick stared at the phone in his hand then in anger slammed it downanger and frustration and fear you leave that royal house before morning and you are a dead man go quietly back to where you came from where you belong if he needed any final confirmation that he was closing in on the mahdi he had it for all the good it did him he was virtually a prisoner one step outside the elegant town house and he would be shot on sight by men waiting for him to appear even his fumigated laundered and pressed clothes would not be mistaken for anything but what they were cleanedup terrorist apparel and the order for him to go back where he came from could hardly be taken seriously he accepted the fact that there would be reluctance to kill an american congressman even one whose presence in bahrain could easily be traced to the horrors in masqat where he had once worked an obliterated bombedout oman as demanded by a large segment of the american people would not be in the mahdis interestsbut neither could the mahdi permit that congressman to return to washington the absence of hard evidence notwithstanding he knew too much that others far more experienced in the black arts could put to advantage the mahdis solution was all too obvious the curious interfering american would be one more victim of these terrible timesalong with others of course a massacre at an airport terminal a plane blown out of the sky a bomb in a coffee shopso many possibilities as long as among those killed was a man who had learned too much at the end it was as he had conceived it in the beginning himself and the mahdi himself or the mahdi now he had lost as surely as if he were in the shell of a building with a thousand tons of concrete and steel crashing down on him there was a sharp tapping at the door odkluíl he said in arabic telling the visitor to come in instinctively picking up his weapon from the white rug the guard walked in expertly balancing a large tray in the palm of his left hand evan shoved the gun under a pillow and stood up as the soldier carried his food to the white desk all is in readiness sir exclaimed the guard no little triumph in his voice i personally selected each item for its proper deliciousness my wife tells me i should have been a chef rather than a warrior kendrick did not actually hear the rest of this warriors paean to himself instead he was suddenly mesmerized by the sight of the man he was about six feet tall give or take an inch with respectable shoulders and an enviably trim waist except for that irritating waist he was evans size or close to it kendrick glanced over at the clean starched clothes on the chaiselounge and then back at the colourful red and blue uniform of the frustrated chefwarrior without really thinking evan reached down for the hidden weapon as the soldier humming like an italian cudniere supremo placed the steaming plates on the desk the only thought that kept racing through kendricks mind was that a cleanedup terrorists outfit would be a target for a salvo of bullets but not the uniform of a bahrainian royal guard especially one walking out of a royal house actually there was no alternative if he did nothing he was dead in the morningsomewhere somehow he had to do something so he did it he walked around the outsized bed stood behind the guard and with all his strength smashed the handle of the gun into the soldiers bobbing humming head the guard fell to the floor unconscious and again without really thinking evan sat down at the desk and ate faster than he had ever eaten in his life twelve minutes later the soldier was bound and gagged on the bed as kendrick studied himself in front of a closet mirror the creased red and blue uniform might have been improved by the experienced fingers of a tailor but withal and in the shadows of the evening streets it was acceptable he ransacked the row of cupboards until he found a plastic shopping bag and stuffed his masqat clothing into it he looked at the telephone he knew he would not use that phone could not use it if he survived the street outside he would call azra from another his jacket off the shoulder holster in place azra angrily paced the room at the aradous hotel consumed by thoughts of betrayal where was amal bahrudi the man with blue eyes who called himself bahrudi was he in reality someone else someone the foolish bloated englishman called kendrick was everything a trap a trap to capture a member of masqats organization council a trap to take the terrorist known as the arabic blue terrorist how typical of the zionist killers from the irgun zvai leumi and the haganah how easily they erase the massacres of jepthah and deir yasin to say nothing of their surrogate executioners at sabra and shatila they steal a homeland and sell what is not theirs to sell and kill a child for carrying the palestinian flagan accident of excess they call itand yet we are the terrorists if the aradous hotel was a trap he could not remain caged in the room yet if it was not a trap he had to be where he could be contacted the mahdi was everything his summons a command for he gave them the means for hope for spreading their message of legitimacy when would the world understand them when would the mahdis of the world be irrelevant the telephone rang and azra raced to it yes i was delayed but im on my way they found me i was nearly killed at the airport but i escaped they may even have traced you by now what leaks in the system get out but dont go through the lobby theres a staircase designed for a fire exit its at the south end of the hallway i think north or south one or the other use it and go through the restaurants kitchen to the employees exit youll come out on the wadi al ahd walk across the road ill pick you up you are you amal bahrudi i can trust you neither of us has a choice do we that is not an answer im not your enemy lied evan kendrick well never be friends but im not your enemy i cant afford it and youre wasting time poet part of which is mine ill be there in five minutes hurry i go be careful azra hung up the phone and went to his weapons which he had cleaned repeatedly and placed in a neat row on the bureau he took the small heckler and koch ps automatic knelt down pulling up his left trouser leg and inserted the weapon in the crisscrossing calf straps that rested below the back of his knee standing up he removed the larger more powerful mauser parabellum pistol and shoved it into his shoulder holster this followed by the sheathed hunting knife resting alongside the gun he walked to a chair where he had thrown the coat of his newly purchased suit put on the jacket and crossed to the door rapidly letting himself out into the corridor nothing would have seemed odd to him were it not for his concentration on the whereabouts of the staircase and his desire to save timetime now measured in minutes and segments of minutes he started to his right to the south end of the hallway his eyes only partially aware of a door being closed not an open door but one barely ajar meaningless a careless guest a western woman carrying too many shopping boxes then unable to see an exit sign for a staircase he turned quickly to check the other end the north end of the hallway a second door this one open no more than two inches was closed swiftly silently the first was now no longer meaningless for surely the second was not they had found him his room was being watched by whom who were they azra continued walking now to the north end of the corridor but the instant he passed the second door he pivoted against the wall reached inside his jacket for the longbladed hunting knife and waited in seconds the door opened he spun around the frame instantly facing a man he knew was his enemy a deeply tanned muscular man near his own agedesert training was written all over him an israeli commando instead of a weapon the startled jew held a radio in his hand he was unarmed azra thrust the knife directly forward towards the israelis throat in a lightning move the blade was deflected the terrorist then arced it down slicing into the hebrews wrist the radio fell to the carpeted floor as azra kicked the door shut the automatic lock clicked gripping his wrist the israeli lashed out his right foot expertly catching the palestinians left kneecap azra stumbled another steel toe caught him in the side of his neck then still another crashed into his ribs but the angle was right the israeli was off balance the terrorist lunged the knife an extension of his arm as he sent it directly into the commandos stomach blood erupted covering azras face as the israeli code name orange of the masada brigade fell back on the floor the palestinian struggled to get up sharp bolts of pain surging through his ribs and his knee the tendons in his neck nearly paralysed suddenly without a scratch or a footstep the door crashed open the hotel lock blown out of its mount the second commando younger his thick bare arms bulging in tension his furious eyes surveying the scene in front of him whipped his hand beyond his right hip for a holstered weapon azra hurled himself against the israeli smashing the commando into the door slamming it shut code blues gun spiralled across the floor freeing his right hand to intercept the palestinians arm as it slashed down with the bloodstreaked blade of the knife the israeli hammered his knee up into the terrorists rib cage as he swung the gripped arm clockwise forcing azra towards the floor still the palestinian would not release the knife both men parted crouching staring at each other contempt and hatred in both pairs of eyes you want to kill jews try to kill me pig cried yaakov why not replied azra thrusting his knife forward to draw out the israeli you kill arabs you killed my mother and father as if youd pulled the trigger yourself you killed my two brothers on the sidon patrols i may have i hope so i was there you are azra like two crazed animals the young men flung themselves at each other with violence incarnate the taking of lifehated lifetheir only reason for being on earth blood burst out of punctured flesh as ligaments were torn and bones broken amid throated cries of vengeance and loathing finally it happened the ending as volcanic as the initial eruption sheer brutal strength was the victor the knife was lodged in the terrorists throat reversed and forced to its mark by the commando from the masada brigade exhausted and drenched in blood yaakov pushed himself off the body of his enemy he looked over at his slain comrade code orange and closed his eyes shalom he whispered find the peace we all seek my friend there was no time for mourning he thought as his eyes flashed open the body of his comrade as well as that of his enemy had to be moved he had to be at the source for what came next he had to reach the others the killer azra was dead they could now fly back to masqat they had to to his father in pain blue limped to the bed and yanked back the bedspread revealing his dead comrades uzi machine pistol he picked it up awkwardly strapped it over his shoulder and went to the door to check the hallway his father in the far shadows of the wadi al ahd kendrick knew he could not wait any longer nor could he risk using a telephone conversely he could not remain in the foliage opposite the aradous and do nothing time was winding down and the contact from the mahdi expected to find the puppet azra newly crowned prince of terrorists at the rendezvous it was so clear now he realized he had been found out either through the events at the airport or through a leak in masqatthe panicked men from the past he had talked to men who unlike mustapha refused to see him and might have betrayed him for their own safety as surely as one of them had killed musty for the same reason we cannot be involved its madness our families are dead our children raped disfigured dead the mahdis strategy was obvious isolate the american and wait for the terrorist to approach the meeting ground alone take the young killer thus aborting the trap for there is no trap without the american only an expendable palestinian on the loose kill him but first find out what happened in masqat where was azra thirtyseven minutes had passed since they talked the arab called blue was thirtytwo minutes late evan looked at his watch for the eleventh time and swore silently furiously his unspoken words at once a plea for help and an outburst of anger at the swirling clouds of frustration he had to move do something find out where azra was for without the terrorist there was no trap for the mahdi either the mahdis contact would not show himself to someone he did not know someone he did not recognize so close so far in the distance of reality kendrick threw the plastic shopping bag containing his starched clothes from masqat into the densest interior of the bushes bordering the pavement of the wadi al ahd he walked across the boulevard towards the employees entrance a postured upright royal guard arrogantly on royal business as he went rapidly down the cobblestone alley towards the service entrance several of the departing servants bowed obsequiously obviously hoping not to be stopped and searched for small treasures they had stolen from the hotel namely soap toilet paper and morsels of food scraped from the plates of jetlagged or drunken westerners too far gone to eat standard procedure evan had been there it was why he had chosen the aradous hotel again emmanuel weingrass he and the unpredictable manny had once fled the aradous by way of the kitchen because a stepbrother of the emir had heard that weingrass had promised a stepsister of that royal brother citizenship in the united states if she would sleep with hima privilege that manny in no way could provide kendrick passed through the kitchen reached the south staircase and walked cautiously up the steps to the second floor he withdrew the gun from under his scarlet jacket and opened the door the corridor was empty and indeed it was the hour of the evening when affluent visitors to bahrain were out in the cafes and the hidden casinos he sidestepped down the left wall to room careful of every footstep he listened there was no sound he knocked quietly odkhúloo said the voice in quiet arabic addressing not one but more than one to enter strangewrong thought evan as he reached for the doorknob why the plural why more than one he turned the knob spun back into the wall and kicked the door open with his right foot silence as if the room were an empty cave the eerie voice a disembodied recording gripping hard the unfamiliar unwanted but necessary weapon kendrick slipped around the frame and went inside oh god what he saw made him freeze in horror azra was slumped against the wall a knife embedded in his neck his eyes wide in death blood still dripping in rivulets down over his chest your friend the pig is dead said the quiet voice behind him evan whipped around to face a young man as bloodied as azra the wounded killer leaned against the wall barely able to stand and in his hands was an uzi machine pistol who are you whispered kendrick what the hell have you done he added now shouting the man limped rapidly to the door and closed it the weapon remaining on evan i killed a man who would kill my people as swiftly as he could find them who would have killed me good christ youre israeli youre the american why did you do it what are you doing here its not my choice thats no answer my orders are to give no answers you had to kill him cried kendrick turning and wincing at the sight of the dead mutilated palestinian to use his words why not they slaughter our children in school playgrounds blow up planes and buses filled with our citizens execute our innocent athletes in munich shoot old men in the head simply because all are jews they crawl up on beaches and murder our young our brothers and sisterswhy because we are jews living finally on an infinitesimal strip of arid wild land that we tamed we not others he never had the chance spare me american i know whats coming and it fills me with disgust at the last its the same as it has always been underneath in whispers the world still wants to blame the jew after everything thats been done to us were still the irksome troublemakers well hear this you interfering amateur we dont want your comments or your guilt or your pity we only want what belongs to us weve marched out of the camps and the ovens and the gas chambers to claim what is ours goddamn you roared evan gesturing angrily at the bleeding corpse of the terrorist you sound like him like him when will you all stop what difference does it make to you go back to your safe condominium and your fancy country club american leave us alone go back where you belong whether it was the repeated words he had heard barely an hour ago over the phone or the sudden images of cascading blocks of concrete crashing down on seventyeight screaming helpless loved ones or the realization that the hated mahdi was slipping away from him he would never know all he knew at that moment was that he hurled himself at the startled wounded israeli tears of fury rolling down his cheeks you arrogant bastard he screamed ripping the uzi out of the young mans grip and throwing it across the room hammering the weakened commando against the wall what right do you have telling me what to do or where to go we watch you people kill each other and blow yourselves and everything else up in the name of blind credos we spend lives and money and exhaust brains and energy trying to instil a little reason but no none of you will move an inch maybe we should leave you alone and let you massacre each other let the zealots hack each other to death just so somebodys left wholl make some sense suddenly kendrick broke away and raced across the room picking up the uzi he returned to the israeli the weapon ominously levelled at the commando who are you and why are you here i am code name blue that is my response and i will give no other code name what blue oh my god whispered evan glancing over at the dead azra he turned back to the israeli and without comment handed the uzi machine pistol to the stunned commando go ahead he said softly shoot up the fucking world i dont give a damn with those words kendrick walked to the door and let himself out yaakov stared after the american at the closed door and then over at the corpse slumped on the floor against the wall he angled the weapon down with his left hand and with his right pulled out the powerful miniaturized radio from his belt he pressed a button itklem said the voice of code black outside the hotel did you contact the others code r did theyre hereor i should say i can see them walking up the al ahd now our elder colleague is with r g is with the eldest but somethings wrong with the latter g is holding him how about you im no good to you now maybe later orange hes gone what no time sos the pig the subjects on his way out hes in a red and blue uniform follow him hes gone over the edge call me at my room ill be there as if in a daze evan crossed the wadi al ahd and went directly to the line of shrubbery where he had thrown the plastic shopping bag whether it was there or not did not really matter it was simply that he would feel more comfortable certainly be able to move more quickly and be less of a target now in the clothes from masqat whatever the case he had gone this far he could not turn back only one man he kept repeating to himself if he could find him within the parameters of the meeting groundthe mahdi he had to find him the shopping bag was where he had left it and the shadows of the shrubbery were adequate for his purpose crouching in the deepest bushes he slowly article by article changed clothes he walked out on the pavement and started west towards the shaikh isa road and the juma mosque itklem said yaakov into the radio while lying on the bed in his unsullied room towels wrapped tightly around his wounds wet lukewarm towels scattered about the bedspread its g said code grey how bad are you cuts mainly some loss of blood ill make it then you agree that until you do i take over thats the line i wanted to hear it from you youve heard it ive got to hear something else with the pig eliminated do you want us to abort and head back to masqat i can force it if your answers yes yaakov stared at the ceiling the conflicts raging inside him the scathing words of the american still scalding his ears no he said haltingly he came too far he risks too much stay with him about w id like to leave him behind with you perhaps hed never permit it thats his son out there remember youre right forget it i might add hes impossible tell me something i dont know i will interrupted code grey the subject dropped the uniform and has just passed us across the street w spotted him hes walking like a dead man he probably is out kendrick changed his mind and his route to the juma instinct told him to stay with crowds on his way to the mosque after he turned north on the wide bab al bahrain he would head right at the huge bab al square into the al khalifa road thoughts bombarded him but they were scattered unconnected unclear he was walking into a labyrinth he knew that but he also knew that within that maze there would be a man or men watching waiting for the dead azra to appear that was his only advantage but it was considerable he knew who and what they were looking for but they did not know him he would circle the rendezvous like an earthbound hawk until he saw someone the right kind of someone who understood he could lose his life if he failed to bring the crown prince of terrorists to the mahdi that man would betray himself perhaps even stop people to stare into their faces anxiety growing with each passing minute evan would find that someone and isolate himtake him and break him or was he deluding himself his obsession blinding him it did not matter any longer nothing mattered only one step after another on the hard pavement weaving his way through the night crowds of bahrain the crowds he sensed it men were crowding around him a hand touched his shoulder he spun around and lashed out his arm to break the grip and suddenly he felt the sharp point of a needle entering his flesh somewhere near the base of his spine then there was darkness complete the telephone jarred yaakov awake he grabbed it yes theyve got the american said code grey more to the point they exist where did it happen how that doesnt matter i dont know the streets anyway what matters is we know where theyve taken him you what how and dont tell me that doesnt matter weingrass did it damn it was weingrass he knew he couldnt take it any longer on foot so he gave a delirious arab ten thousand dollars for his brokendown taxi that al harmmee will be drunk for six months we piled in and followed the subject and saw the whole thing happen damn it was weingrass control your homicidal tendencies ordered yaakov with an uncontrollable smile that vanished quickly where is the subjectshitkendrick being held in a building called the sahalhuddin on tujjar road who owns it give us time blue give weingrass time hes calling in every debt thats owed him in bahrain and id hate to think what the morals commission in jerusalem would say if were tied in with him answer me apparently six firms occupy the complex its a matter of narrowing them down someone come and get me commanded yaakov so youve found the mahdi congressman said the darkskinned arab in a pure white robe and a white silk headdress with a cluster of sapphires on the crown they were in a large room with a domed ceiling covered with mosaic tiles the windows were high and narrow the furniture sparse and all in dark burnished wood the huge ebony desk more like an altar or a throne than a functional work surface there was a mosquelike quality to the room like the chambers of some high priest of a strange but powerful order in a land removed from the rest of the world are you satisfied now continued the mahdi from behind the desk or possibly disappointed to find that i am a man like youno not like you or anyone elsebut still a man youre a killer you son of a bitch evan lurched from the thick straightbacked chair only to be grabbed by two flanking guards and thrown back you murdered seventyeight innocent peoplemen women and children screaming as the building collapsed on them youre filth it was the start of a war kendrick all wars have casualties not restricted to combatants i submit that i won that very important battleyou disappeared for four years and during those years i made extraordinary progress progress i might not have made with you here or with that abominable jew weingrass and his flatulent mouth manny he kept talking about you warning us i silence such mouths with a terribly swift sword you may interpret that as a bullet in their heads but when i heard about you i knew youd come back because of that first battle five years ago you led me as they say a merry chase until nine hours ago amal bahrudi oh the soviets are not without men who prefer to be on additional payrolls bahrudi the euroarab was killed several days ago in east berlin kendricks name surfaces a dead arab with blue eyes and pronounced occidental features is suddenly in masqatthe equation was imaginative in the extreme almost unbelievable but it balanced you must have had help youre not that experienced in these matters evan stared at the striking face with the high cheekbones and the fired eyes that gazed steadily back at him your eyes said kendrick shaking his head pushing away the last effects of the drug administered to him in the street that flat mask of a face ive seen you before of course you have evan think the mahdi slowly removed his ghotra revealing a head of tightly ringleted black hair salted with eruptions of grey the high smooth forehead was now emphasized by the dark arched eyebrows it was the face of a man easily given to obsession instantly summoning it for whatever purpose it served do you find me in an iraqi tent or perhaps on a podium in a certain midwest armoury jesus christ whispered kendrick the images coming into focus you came to see us in basrah seven or eight years ago and told us youd make us rich if we turned down the job you said there were plans to break iran break the shah and you didnt want any updated airfields in iraq it happened a true islamic society bullshit you must broker their oil fields by now and youre as islamic as my scots grandfather youre from chicagothats the midwest armouryand you were thrown out of chicago twenty years ago because even your own black constituencywhich you bled drycouldnt take your screaming fascist crap you took their millions and came over here to spread your garbage and make millions more my god weingrass knew who the hell you were and he told you to shove it he said you were slimetwobit slime if i remember correctlyand if you didnt get the hell out of that tent in basrah hed really lose his temper and throw bleach in your face so he could say he only shot a white nazi weingrass isor wasa jew said the mahdi calmly he vilified me because the greatness he expected eluded him but it had started to flower for me the jews hate success in anyone but their own kind its why they are the agitators of the world who the hell are you kidding he called you one rotten shvartzeh and it had nothing to do with whites or blacks or anything else youre pus and hate al falfa or whatever you called yourself and the colour of your skin is irrelevant after riyadhthat very important battlehow many others did you kill did you slaughter only what was called for in our holy war to maintain the purity of race culture and belief in this part of the world the lips of the mahdi from chicago illinois formed a slow cold smile you goddamned fucking hypocrite shouted kendrick unable to control himself evan again lunged out of the chair his hands like two claws flying across the desk towards the robes of the killermanipulator other hands reached him before he could touch the mahdi he was hurled to the floor kicked simultaneously in his stomach and his spine coughing he tried to get up while on his knees the guard on the left gripped his hair yanking back his head as the man on the right held a knife laterally across his throat your gestures are as pathetic as your words said the mahdi rising from behind the desk we are well on our way to building a kingdom here and theres nothing the paralysed west can do about it we set people against people with forces they cannot control we divide thoroughly and conquer completely without ourselves firing a shot and you evan kendrick have been of great service to us we have photographs of you taken at the airport when you flew in from oman also of your weapons your false papers and your money belt the latter showing what appears to be hundreds of thousands of dollars we have documented proof that you an american congressman using the name of amal bahrudi managed to get inside the embassy in masqat where you killed an eloquent gentle leader named nassir and later a young freedom fighter called azraall during the days of precious truce agreed by everyone were you an agent of your brutal government how could it be otherwise a wave of revulsion will spread over the socalled democraciesthe fumbling warlike giant has done it again without regard for the lives of its own you evan leaped up grabbing the wrist that held the knife wrenching his head away from the hand that gripped his hair he was struck in the back of the neck pummelled again to the floor the executions have been moved forward continued the mahdi they will resume tomorrow morningprovoked by your insidious activities which will be made public chaos and bloodshed will result because of the rash contemptible americans until a solution is found our solutionmy solution but none of this will concern you congressman you will have vanished from the face of the earth thanks no doubt to your terribly embarrassed government which is not above punishing traceable failure while issuing feverish denials therell be no corpus delicti no inkling of your whereabouts whatsoever tomorrow with first light youll be flown out to sea a bleeding skinned pig strapped to your naked body and dropped into the sharkinfested shoals of qatar the icarus agenda chapter theres nothing here shouted weingrass standing and poring over the papers on the table in the dining room of a bahrainian official he had known since the kendrick group had built an island country club on the archipelago years before after all i did for you hassan all the little and not so little fees i passed your way this is what you give me more is coming emmanuel replied the nervous arab nervous because weingrasss words were heard by benami and the four commandos sitting twenty feet away in the westernized living room on the outskirts of the city a doctor had been summoned to stitch and bandage yaakov who refused to lie down instead he sat up in an armchair the man named hassan glanced at him mentioning if only to change the subject of his past with the old architect the boy doesnt look well manny he gets in scraps what can i tell you someone tried to steal his roller skates whats coming and when these are companies and the products or services they sell i have to see names people thats whats coming its not easy to persuade the minister of industrial regulations to leave his house at two oclock in the morning and go down to his office to commit an illegal act industrial and regulations in bahrain are mutually exclusive words those are secret papers a bahrainian imperative thats not true manny oh shut up and get me a whisky youre incorrigible my old friend tell me about it the voice of code grey drifted out from the living room he had returned from the telephone which he had been using with permission but without being questioned every fifteen minutes may i get you something gentlemen asked hassan walking through the dining room arch the cardamom coffee is more than sufficient answered the older benami its also delicious there are spirits if you wishas of course youve just gathered from mr weingrass this is a religious house but we do not impose our beliefs on others would you put that in writing sir said code black chuckling ill deliver it to my wife and tell her youre a mullah i have to go across the city to get bacon with my eggs thank you but no spirits mr hassan added grey slapping blacks knee with luck well have work to do tonight with greater luck my hands will not be cut off said the arab quietly heading towards the kitchen he stopped interrupted by the sound of the front door chimes the highplaced courier had arrived fortyeight minutes later with computer printouts scattered over the dining room table weingrass studied two specific pages going back and forth from one to the other tell me about this zareeba limited the name comes from the sudanese language replied the robed official who had refused to be introduced to anyone roughly it translates as a protected encampment surrounded by rock or dense foliage the sudan its a nation in africa i know what it is khartoum thats the capital heavens i thought it was buffalo interrupted weingrass curtly how come they list so many subsidiaries its a holding company their interests are extensive if a company needs government licences for multiple export and import theyre more easily expedited under the corporate umbrella of a very solid firm horseshit i beg your pardon its bronx for oh good gracious who runs it theres a board of directors theres always a board of directors i asked you who runs it no one really knows frankly the chief executive is an amiable fellowive had coffee with himbut he doesnt appear to be a particularly aggressive man if you know what i mean so theres someone else i wouldnt know wheres the list of directors right in front of you its beneath the page on your right weingrass lifted the page and picked up the one underneath for the first time in two hours he sat down in a chair his eyes roaming the list of names over and over again zareeba khartoum he kept saying quietly every now and then shutting his eyes tightly his lined face wrinkled by repeated grimaces as if he was trying desperately to recall something he had forgotten finally he picked up a pencil and circled a name then pushed the page across the table to the still standing rigid bahrainian official hes a black man said the highplaced courier whos white and whos black over here one tells by the features usually of course centuries of afroarab intermingling often obscure the issue is it an issue to some not most where did he come from if hes an immigrant his country of origin is listed there it says concealed that generally means the person has fled from an authoritarian regime usually fascist or communist we protect such people if they contribute to our society obviously he does sahibe al farrahkhaliffe said weingrass emphasizing each part of the name what nationality is that ive no idea part african obviously part arab more obviously its consistent wrongo buster exclaimed manny startling everyone in both rooms its pure american aliasfraud if this is who i think he is hes a black son of a bitch from chicago who was heaved out by his own people they got crapped on because hed banked their moneysome twenty million incidentallyin accommodating banks on this side of the atlantic some eighteen twenty years ago he was a steamrolling fire and brimstone fanatic called al farrahhis fucking ego wouldnt let him drop that part of his past the hallelujah chorus part we knew the big gloxinia was on the board of directors of some fat corporation but we didnt know which one besides we were looking in the wrong direction khartoum hell south side chicago heres your mahdi are you certain asked hassan standing in the archway the accusation is inflammatory im certain said weingrass quietly i should have shot the bastard in that tent in basrah i beg your pardon the bahrainian official was visibly shaken never mind no one has left the sahalhuddin building said code grey walking forward into the archway youre sure i paid a taxi driver who was very willing to accept a considerable sum of money with a great deal more to come if he did my bidding i call him every few minutes at a public phone their two cars are still there can you trust him asked yaakov from the chair i have his name and licence number doesnt mean a damned thing protested manny i told him that if he lied id find him and kill him i withdraw the statement tinker bell will you shut up what part of the sahalhuddin does the zareeba company occupy the top two floors if im not mistaken the lower floors are leased by its subsidiaries zareeba owns the building convenient said weingrass can you get us the updated structural plans including the fire and security systems i read those things pretty well at this hour cried the official its after three oclock in the morning i wouldnt know how try a million dollars american broke in manny softly ill send it from paris my word what split it up any way you like thats my son in there get them the small room was dark the only light the white rays of the moon shining through a window high up on the walltoo high to reach for there was no furniture except a lowslung cot with ripped canvas a guard had left him a bottle of seebertoo ahbyahd a numbing local whisky suggesting that what faced him was better faced in a drunken stupor he was tempted he was frightened the fear consuming him causing him to sweat to the point where his shirt was drenched his hair soaking wet what stopped him from uncorking the bottle and draining it were the remnants of angerand one last act he would perform he would fight with all the violence he could summon hoping perhaps in the back of his mind for a bullet that would end everything quickly christ why did he ever think he could do it what possessed him to believe that he was qualified to do what far more experienced people thought was suicidal of course the question was the answer he was possessed the hot winds of hate were burning him up had he not tried they would have burned him out and he had not failed entirely he had lost his life but only because he had achieved a measure of success he had proved the existence of the mahdi he had hacked a trail through the dense jungle of deceit and manipulation others would follow there was comfort in that he looked at the bottle again at the white liquid that would put him out of it unconsciously he shook his head slowly back and forth the mahdi had said his gestures were as pathetic as his words neither would be pathetic on that plane flying over the shoals of qatar each soldier of the masada brigade had understood from the beginning and each checked the plastic tape around his left wrist to make certain the cyanide capsule was in its small exposed bubble none carried papers or any traces of identification their working clothes down to the shoes on their feet and the cheap buttons on their trousers were all purchased by mossad agents in benghazi libya the core of terrorist recruitment in these days of injected chemicals the amphetamines and the scopolamines no member of the masada unit could permit himself to be captured alive where his actions could be even remotely connected to the events in oman israel could not afford to be held responsible for the slaughter of two hundred and thirtysix american hostages and the spectre of israeli interference was to be avoided even at the cost of the unholy suicide of each man sent to southwest asia each understood each had held out his wrist at the airfield in hebron for the doctor to secure the ribbed plastic tape each had watched as the doctor swiftly brought his left hand to his mouth where hard teeth and the soft rounded bubble met a quick puncture brought death the tujjar was deserted the street and lamps muted by pockets of mist drifting in from the persian gulf the building known as the sahalhuddin was dark except for several lighted offices on the top floor and five storeys below the dull wash of the foyer neons beyond the glass entrance doors where a bored man sat at a desk reading a newspaper a small blue car and a large black one were parked at the curb two uniformed private guards stood casually in front of the doors which meant that there was probably security at the rear of the building as well there was a single man codes grey black and red returned to the brokendown taxi two hundred yards west at the corner of al mothanna road inside in the back seat was the wounded yaakov in front benami and emmanuel weingrass the latter still studying under the dashboard lights the structural plans of the building code grey delivered the information through an open window yaakov issued their instructions you black and red take out the guards and get inside grey you follow with benami and cut the wires hold it eagle scout said weingrass turning in the front seat this mossad relic sitting beside me doesnt know a damn thing about alarm systems except probably how to set em off thats not quite true manny protested benami youre going to trace precoded wires where theyve been altered on purpose heading to dummy receptacles just for people like you youd start an italian festival down here im going with them mr weingrass pressed code blue from the back seat suppose you begin coughinghave one of the attacks weve all sadly observed i wont answered the architect simply i told you thats my son in there i believe him said grey at the window and im the one who pays for it if im wrong youre coming around tinker bell will you please oh shut up lets go if there had been a disinterested observer in the tujjar at that hour the following minutes would have appeared like the intricate movements of a large clock each serrated wheel turning another which in turn sent motion back into the frenzied momentum of the mechanism no cog however flying out of sequence or making a false move codes red and black removed the two private guards in front before either knew there was a hostile presence within a hundred metres of him red took off his jacket squeezed into the tunic of one of the guards buttoned it put on the visored cap pulled it down and quickly ran back to the glass doors where he tapped lightly holding his backside with his left hand pleading in the shadows with humorous gestures to be permitted inside to relieve himself frustrated bowels are a universal calamity the man inside laughed put down the newspaper and pressed a button on the desk the buzzer was activated codes red and black raced inside and before the allnight receptionist understood the mistake he had made he was unconscious on the marble floor code grey followed dragging a limp guard through the left door which he caught before it swung shut and behind him was emmanuel weingrass carrying reds discarded jacket on cue code black ran outside for the second guard as weingrass held the door all inside codes red and grey bound and gagged the three security personnel behind the wide reception desk while black took a long capped syringe from his pocket he removed the plastic casing checked the contents level and injected each unconscious arab at the base of the neck the three commandos then pulled the three immobile employees of the sahalhuddin to the farthest reaches of the enormous foyer get out of the light whispered red the command directed at weingrass go into the hall by the elevators what i hear something outside you do two or three people perhaps quickly silence and beyond the thick glass doors two obviously drunken americans weaved down the pavement the words of a familiar melody more softly spoken than sung to the tables down at marys to the place we love so well son of a bitch you heard them asked weingrass impressed go to the rear said grey to black do you know the way i read the plans of course i do ill wait for your signal and take out the last one my magic elixir is still half full code black disappeared into a south corridor as grey raced across the sahalhuddins lobby weingrass was now in front of him heading for a steel door that led to the basement of the building shit cried manny its locked to be expected said grey pulling a small black box from his pocket and opening it its not a problem the commando removed a puttylike gel from the box pressed it around the lock and inserted a oneinch string fuse stand back please it wont explode but the heat is intense weingrass watched in amazement as the gel first became bright red upon firing then the bluest blue he had ever seen the steel melted before his eyes and the entire lock mechanism fell away youre something tinker dont say it lets go agreed manny they found the security system it was contained in a huge steel panel at the north end of the sahalhuddins underground complex its an upgraded guardian pronounced the architect taking a pair of wire cutters from his left pocket there are two false receptacles for every six leadseach lead covering fifteen to twenty thousand square feet of possible entrywhich considering the size of the structure means probably no more than eighteen wires eighteen wires repeated grey hesitantly that means six false receptacles thats it tinkerforget it thank you we cut one of those we get a rockmuchacha band blaring in the street how can you tell you said the precoded wires were alteredfor amateurs like benami how can you tell mechanics courtesy my friend the slobjoes who work on this stuff hate like hell to read diagrams so they make it easier for themselves or others who have to service the systems on every false wire they make a mark usually with pincer pliers high up towards the main terminal that way they call in after fixing the system and say they spent an hour tracing the falsies because the diagrams werent clearthey never are suppose youre wrong mr weingrass suppose that here there was an honest mechanic impossible there arent enough of them around replied manny taking a small torch and a chisel out of his right pocket come on prise off the panel weve got roughly eighty to ninety seconds to snip off twelve leads can you imagine that cheap bastard hassan said these batteries are weak go on i can use plastique said code grey and with that heat set off every alarm in the place including the sprinkler system meshuga im sending you back to shul youre making me very upset mr shut up do your job ill get you a badge the architect handed code grey the chisel he had taken from hassan knowing it would be necessary from the plans of the sahalhuddins security do it quickly these things are sensitive the commando jammed the chisel below the panels lock and with the strength of three normal men pressed forward snapping the panel open give me the torch said the israeli you find the wires one by anxious one emmanuel weingrass moved from right to left the beam of light on each coloured wire eight nine ten eleven wheres twelve yelled manny i caught every false lead there has to be one more without it theyll all trigger off here theres a mark here cried code grey touching the seventh wire its next to the third false lead you missed it i got it weingrass suddenly collapsed in a fit of coughing he doubled over on the floor straining beyond his endurance to stop the seizure go ahead mr weingrass said grey gently touching the old mans thin shoulder let it out no one can hear you i promised i wouldnt there are promises beyond our control of keeping sir stop being so fucking polite manny coughed out his last spasm and awkwardly painfully got to his feet the commando purposely did not offer assistance okay soldierboy said weingrass breathing deeply the place is securefrom our point of view lets find my boy code grey held his place despite your less than generous personality sir i respect you said the israeli and for all our sakes i cant permit you to accompany us you what we dont know whats on the upper floors i do you son of a bitch my boys up there give me a gun tinker bell or ill send a telegram to israels defence minister telling him you own a pig farm weingrass suddenly kicked the commando in the shins incorrigible muttered code grey without moving his leg impossible come on bubbelah a little gun i know youve got one please dont use it unless i tell you to said the commando lifting his left trouser leg and reaching down for the small revolver strapped behind his knee actually i never told you i was part of the haganah the haganah sure me and menachem had a lot of roughandtumbles menachem was never part of the haganah must have been some other baldheaded fellow come on lets go benami the uzi gripped in his hands in the shadows of the sahalhuddins entrance kept in touch by radio but why is he with you asked the mossad agent because hes impossible replied the irritated voice of code grey thats not an answer insisted benami i have no other out weve reached the sixth floor ill contact you when its feasible understood two of the commandos flanked the wide double doors on the right of the landing the third stood at the other end of the hall outside the only other door with light showing through the crack below emmanuel weingrass reluctantly remained on the marble staircase his anxiety provoked rumblings in his chest but his resolve suppressed them now whispered code grey and both men crashed the door open with their shoulders instantly dropping to the floor as two robed arabs at each end of the room turned firing their repeating weapons they were no match for the uzis both fell with two bursts from the israeli machine pistols a third and a fourth man started to run one in white robes from behind the enormous ebony desk the other from the left side stop yelled code grey or youre both dead the darkskinned man in the robes of a lavish aba stood motionless his glowering eyes riveted on the israeli have you any idea what youve done he asked in a low threatening voice the security in this building is the finest in bahrain the authorities will be here in minutes you will lay down your weapons or you will be killed hello there garbage yelled emmanuel weingrass walking into the room with effort as old men do when their legs do not work as well as they once did especially after a great deal of excitement the systems not that good not when youve subcontracted five or six hundred you who else i should have blown you away years ago in basrah but i knew my boy would come back to find you you scum of the earth it was just a matter of time where is he my life for his youre in no position to bargain perhaps i am broke in the mahdi hes on his way to an unmarked airfield where a plane will fly him out to sea destinationthe shoals of qatar the sharks said weingrass quietly in cold fury ever so one of natures conveniences now do we bargain only i can stop them the old architect his frail body trembling as he breathed deeply stared at the tall robed black man his voice strained as he replied we bargain he said and by almighty god youd better deliver or ill hunt you down with an army of mercenaries you were always such a melodramatic jew werent you the mahdi glanced at his watch theres time as is the custom on such flights there can be no groundtoair radio contact no subsequent forensic examinations of a plane theyre scheduled to take off with the first light once outside ill place the call the aircraft will not leave but you and your little army of whatevertheyare will dont even think about any tricks you scum ball we deal no code grey whipped out his knife and lunged at the mahdi gripping his robes and throwing him over the desk there are no bargains no deals no negotiations whatsoever theres only your life at this moment grey shoved the point of his blade into the flesh below the chicagoans left eye the mahdi screamed as the blood rolled down his cheek and into his open mouth make your call now or lose first this eye then the other after that it wont matter to you where my knife goes next you wont see it the commando reached over grabbed the phone on the desk and slammed it down beside the bleeding head thats your bargain scum give me the number ill dial it for youjust to make sure its an airfield and not some private barracks give it to me nono i cant the blade goes in no stop there is no airfield no plane liar not now later lose your first eye liar hes here my god stop hes here where roared manny rushing up to the desk the west wing theres a staircase in the hall on the right a small storage area below the roof emmanuel weingrass did not hear any more he raced out of the room screaming with all the breath that was in him evan evan he was hallucinating thought kendrick a person dear to him from the past was calling to him giving him courage the singular privilege of a condemned man he considered he looked up from the cot at the window the moon was moving away its light fading he would not see another moon soon there would be nothing but darkness evan evan it was so like manny he had always been there when his young friend needed him and here at the end he was there to give comfort oh lord manny i hope you learn somehow that i came back that finally i listened to you i found him manny others will too i know it please be a little proud of me goddamn it kendrick where the hell are you that voice was no hallucination nor were the pounding footsteps on the narrow staircase and other footsteps jesus christ was he already dead manny manny he screamed here it is this is the room break it down musclehead the door of the small room crashed open like a deafening crack of thunder goddamn boy cried emmanuel weingrass seeing kendrick stagger up from his cell cot is this any way for a respectable congressman to behave i thought i taught you better tears in their eyes father and son embraced they were all in hassans westernized living room on the outskirts of the city benami had monopolized the telephone since weingrass relinquished it after a lengthy call to masqat and a spirited conversation with the young sultan ahmat fifteen feet away around the large dining room table sat seven officials representing the governments of bahrain oman france the united kingdom west germany israel and the palestine liberation organization as agreed there was no representative from washington but there was nothing to fear in terms of americas clandestine interests where a certain congressman was concerned emmanuel weingrass was at that table sitting between the israeli and the man from the plo evan was next to the wounded yaakov both in armchairs beside each other a courtesy for the two most in pain code blue spoke i listened to your words at the aradous he said softly ive been thinking about them thats all i ask you to do its hard kendrick weve been through so much not me of course but our fathers and mothers grandfathers and grandmothers and generations before them added evan no one with a grain of intelligence or sensitivity denies it but in a way so have they the palestinians werent responsible for the pogroms or the holocaust but because the free world was filled with guiltas it damn well should have beenthey became the new victims without knowing why i know yaakov nodded his head slowly ive heard the zealots in the west bank and the gaza ive listened to the meir kahanes and they frighten me so frighten you of course they use the words that were used against us for as you say generations yet still they kill they killed my two brothers and so many countless others its got to stop sometime its all such a terrible waste i have to think its a beginning the men around the dining room table abruptly rose from their chairs they nodded to one another and one by one walked through the living room to the front door and out to their staff cars without acknowledging the presence of anyone else in the house the host hassan came through the archway and addressed his last guests at first it was difficult to hear his words as emmanuel weingrass was doubled up with a coughing seizure in the dining room evan started to rise yaakov shaking his head gripped kendricks arm evan understood he nodded and sat back the american embassy in masqat will be relieved in three hours the terrorists granted safe escort to a ship on the waterfront provided by sahibe al farrahkhaliffe what happens to him asked kendrick angrily in this room and only in this room will that answer be given i am instructed by the royal house to inform you that it is to go no further is that understood and accepted all heads nodded sahibe al farrahkhaliffe known to you as the mahdi will be executed without trial or sentence for his crimes against humanity are so outrageous they do not deserve the dignity of jurisprudence as the americans say well do it our way may i speak said benami of course answered hassan arrangements have been made for me and my colleagues to be flown back to israel since none of us has passports or papers a special plane and procedures have been provided by the emir we must be at the airport concourse within the hour forgive us for our abrupt departure come along gentlemen forgive us said hassan nodding for not having the wherewithal to thank you have you got any whisky asked code red anything you wish anything you can part with its a long terrible trip back and i hate flying it frightens me evan kendrick and emmanuel weingrass sat next to each other in the armchairs in hassans living room they waited for their instructions from a harried bewildered american ambassador who was permitted to make contact only by telephone it was as though the two old friends had never been apartthe ofttimes bewildered student and the strident teacher yet the student was the leader the shaker and the teacher understood ahmat must be up in space with relief said evan drinking brandy a couple of things are keeping him grounded oh seems theres a group that wanted to get rid of him send him back to the states because they thought he was too young and inexperienced to handle things he called them his arrogant merchant princes hes bringing them to the palace to straighten them out thats one item what else theres another bunch who wanted to take things in their own hands blow up the embassy if they had to anything to get their country back theyre machinegun nuts theyre also the ones who were recruited by cons op to get you out of the airport whats he going to do about them not a hell of a lot unless you want your name shouted from the minarets if he calls them in theyll scream state department connections and all the crazies in the middle east will have another cause ahmat knows better let them alone theres a last item and hes got to do it for himself hes got to blow that boat out of the water and kill every one of those filthy bastards no manny thats not the way the killing will just go on and on wrong shouted weingrass youre wrong examples must be made over and over again until they all learn the price they have to pay suddenly the old architect was seized by a prolonged echoing rattling cough that came from the deepest rawest cavities of his chest his face reddened and the veins in his neck and forehead were blue and distended evan gripped his old friends shoulder to steady him well talk about it later he said as the coughing subsided i want you to come back with me manny because of this weingrass shook his head defensively its just a chest cold lousy weather in france thats all i wasnt thinking of that lied kendrick he hoped convincingly i need you what for i may be going into several projects and i want your advice it was another lie a weaker one so he added quickly also i want to completely redesign my house i thought you just built it i was involved with other things and wasnt paying attention its terrible i cant see half the things i was supposed to see the mountains and the lakes you never were any damned good reading exterior schematics i need you please i have business in paris ive got to send out money i gave my word send mine like a million ten if you like im here and not in some sharks stomach im not going to beg you manny but please i really do need you well maybe for a week or two said the irascible old man they need me in paris too you know gross profits will drop all over the city i know that replied evan softly relieved what fortunately the telephone rang preventing kendrick from having to repeat his statement their instructions had arrived im the man you never met never spoke to said evan into the pay phone at andrews air force base in virginia im heading out to the white water and the mountains where ive been for the past five days is that understood understood answered frank swann deputy director of the state departments consular operations i wont even try to thank you dont i cant i dont even know your name ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the figure sat hunched over the keyboard his eyes alive his mind alert though his body was racked with exhaustion he kept breathing deeply as if each breath would keep his brain functioning he had not slept for nearly fortyeight hours waiting for developments out of bahrain there had been a blackout a suspension of communications silence the small circle of needtoknow personnel at the state department and the central intelligence agency may now themselves be breathing deeply he considered but not before instead they had been holding their collective breath bahrain represented the irreversible hard edge of finality the ending unclear not any longer it was over the subject airborne he had won the figure proceeded to type our man has done it my appliances are ecstatic for although they refused to commit themselves they indicated that he could succeed in their inanimate way they saw my vision the subject arrived here this morning under deep cover thinking that everything is finished that his life will return to its abnormal normalcy but he is wrong everything is in place the record written the means must be found and they will be found lightning will strike and he will be the bolt that changes a nation for him it is only the beginning book two ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the means have been found as in the ancient vedic scriptures a god of fire has arrived as a messenger to the people he has made himself known to me and i to him the oman file is now completed everything and i have obtained everything through access and penetration and i have given everything to him hes a remarkable man as i realistically believe i am and he has a dedication that matches my own with the file completed and entered in its entirety this journal is finished another is about to begin the icarus agenda chapter one year later sunday august pm one by one like quiet graceful chariots the four limousines had deposited their owners in front of the marble steps leading to the pillared entrance of the estate on the banks of chesapeake bay the arrivals were erratically spaced so that no sense of urgency was conveyed to suddenly curious onlookers either on the highway or through the streets of the wealthy village in marylands eastern shore it was merely another subdued social gathering of the immensely rich a common sight in this enclave of financial power brokers a prosperous local banker might glance out of his window and see the glistening cars roll by and wish he were privileged to hear the men talk over their brandy or billiards but that was the extent of his ruminations the immensely rich were generous to their suburban environs and the townspeople were richer for them crumbs from their tables provided frequent bonuses there were the armies of domestic and gardening help whose relatives swelled the payrolls with never a complaint from the owners so long as the estates were shipshape for their return from london paris or gstaad and for those in the professions there was the occasional stock market tip over a friendly drink at the commercially quaint tavern in the centre of the town the bankers the merchants and the perpetually awed residents were fond of their lairds they guarded the privacy of these distinguished men and women with quiet firmness and if guarding their privacy meant bending a few laws now and then it was a small price to pay and in a sense even moral when one considered how the gossip pedlars and the scandal sheets twisted everything out of all proportion to sell their newspapers and magazines the ordinary man in the street could get roaring drunk or have a bloody fight with his wife or his neighbour even be in a car accident and no one took grotesque photographs of him to splatter all over the tabloids why were the rich singled out to provide lurid reading for people without an iota of their talents the rich were different they provided jobs and gave generously to charity and often made life just a little bit easier for those they came in contact with so why should they be persecuted so went the townsfolks logic it was a small matter for the local police to keep their blotters cleaner than they might be it made for harmonious relations it also made for a number of wellkept secrets in this privileged enclave where the estate on chesapeake bay was located but secrecy is relative one mans secret is anothers joke a government file marked classified has more often than not appeared in public print and a prominent cabinet members sexual appetites are confidential fundamentally in terms of his wife finding out as are hers regarding him cross my heart and hope to die is a promise made by children of all ages who fail to keep their word but where extraordinary death is concerned the circle of secrecy must be impenetrable as it was this night when the five big cars passed through the village of cynwid hollow on their way to chesapeake bay inside the immense house in the wing nearest the water the highceilinged library was ornately masculine leather and burnished wood predominated while long windows overlooked the sculptured grounds outside illuminated by floodlights and sevenfoothigh bookshelves formed an imposing wall of knowledge wherever space allowed armchairs of soft brown leather floor lamps at their sides flanked the windows a wide cherrywood desk stood at the far right corner of the room a highbacked swivel chair of black leather behind it completing the typical aspects of such a room was a large circular table in the centre a meeting ground for conferences best held in the security of the countryside with these items and this ambience however ordinary appearances came to an end and the unusual if not the strange became apparent on the surface of the table in front of each place was a brass lamp its light directed down on a yellow legal pad it was as if the small sharp circles of light made it easier for those at the table to rivet their concentration on whatever notes they made without the distraction of fully illuminated facesand eyesof those next to or opposite them for there were no other lights on in the room faces moved in and out of shadows expressions discernible but not for lengthy examination at the west end of the library attached to the upper wall moulding above the bookshelves was a long black tube that when electrically commanded shot down a silver screen that descended halfway to the parquet floor as it was now it was for the benefit of another unusual piece of equipment unusual because of its permanence built into the east wall beyond and above the table and electronically pushed forward into view as now was a console of audiovisual components that included projectors for immediate and taped television film photographic slides and voice recordings through the technology of a periscoped remotecontrolled disk on the roof the sophisticated unit was capable of picking up satellite and shortwave transmissions from all over the globe at the moment a small red light glowed on the fourth lateral a carousel of slide photographs had been inserted and was ready for operation all these accoutrements were certainly unusual for such a library even to the rich for their inclusion took on another ambiencethat of a strategy room far from the white house or the pentagon or the sterile chambers of the national security agency one pressed button and the world past and current was presented for scrutiny judgments rendered in isolated chiaroscuro but at the far right corner of this extraordinary room was a curious anachronism standing by itself several feet away from the booklined wall was an old castiron stove its flue rising to the ceiling beside it was a metal pail filled with coal what was especially odd was that the stove was glowing despite the quiet whirr of the central air conditioning necessitated by the warm humid night on chesapeake bay that stove however was intrinsic to the conference about to take place on the shores of cynwid hollow everything written down was to be burned the notepads as well for nothing said among these people could be communicated to the world outside it was a tradition born of international necessity governments could collapse economies rise and fall on their words wars be precipitated or avoided on their decisions they were the inheritors of the most powerful silent organization in the free world they were five and they were human the president will be reelected by an overwhelming majority two years from this november said the whitehaired man with an aquiline aristocratic face at the head of the conference table we hardly needed our projections to determine this he has the country in the palm of his hand and short of catastrophic errors which his more reasonable advisers will prevent theres nothing anyone can do about it ourselves included therefore we must prepare for the inevitable and have our man in place a strange term our man commented a slender balding man in his seventies with sunken cheeks and wide gentle eyes nodding his head well have to move quickly and yet again things could change the president is such a charming person so attractive so wanting to be likedloved i imagine so shallow broke in a broadshouldered middleaged black quietly with no animosity in his voice his impeccably tailored clothes signifying taste and wealth i have no ill feeling towards him personally for his instincts are decent hes a decent perhaps a good man thats what the people see and theyre probably right no its not him its those mongrels behind himso far behind its likely he doesnt know they exist except as campaign contributors he doesnt said the fourth member at the table a rotund middleaged man with a cherubic face and the impatient eyes of a scholar below a rumpled thatch of red hair his elbowpatched tweed jacket labelled him an academic and ill bet ten of my patents that some profound miscalculation will take place before his first term is over youd lose said the fifth member at the table an elderly woman with silver hair and dressed elegantly in a black silk dress with a minimum of jewelry her cultured voice was laced with those traces of inflection and cadence often described as midatlantic not because you underestimate him which you do but because he and those behind him will consolidate their growing consensus until hes politically invincible the rhetoric will be slanted but there wont be any profound decisions until his opposition is rendered damn near voiceless in other words theyre saving their big guns for the second term then you agree with jacob that we have to move quickly said the whitehaired samuel winters nodding at the gauntfaced jacob mandel on his right of course i do sam replied margaret lowell casually smoothing her hair then suddenly leaning forward her elbows firmly on the table her hands clasped it was an abruptly masculine movement in a very feminine woman but none at the table noticed her mind was the focal point realistically im not sure we can move quickly enough she said rapidly quietly we may have to consider a more abrupt approach no peg broke in eric sundstrom the redhaired scholar on lowells left everything must be perfectly normal befitting an upbeat administration that turns liabilities into assets this must be our approach any deviation from the principle of natural evolutionnature being unpredictablewould send out intolerable alarms that illinformed consensus you mentioned would rally round the cause inflamed by gids mongrels wed have a police state gideon logan nodded his large black head in agreement a smile creasing his lips oh theyd stomp around the campfires pulling in all the goodthinking people and burn the asses off the body politic he paused looking at the woman across the table there are no shortcuts margaret erics right about that i wasnt talking melodrama insisted lowell no rifle shots in dallas or deranged kids with hangups i only meant time have we the time if we use it correctly we do said jacob mandel the key factor is the candidate then lets get to him interrupted the whitehaired samuel winters as you all know our colleague mr varak has completed his search and is convinced hes come up with our man i wont bore you with his many eliminations except to say that if theres not complete unanimity among us well examine themevery one hes studied our guidelinesthe assets we seek and the liabilities we wish to avoid in essence the talents were convinced must be there in my judgment hes unearthed a brilliant if totally unexpected prospect i wont talk for our friendhe does that very well for himselfbut id be remiss if i did not state that in our numerous conferences hes shown the same dedication to us that his uncle anton varak was said to have given to our predecessors fifteen years ago winters paused his penetrating grey eyes levelled in turn at each person around the table perhaps it takes a european deprived of his liberties to understand us understand the reasons for our being we are the inheritors of inver brass resurrected in death by those who came before us we ourselves were to be selected by those men should their attorneys determine that our lives continued in the way they envisaged when the sealed envelopes were given to each of us each of us understood we sought no further advantages from the society we live in coveted no benefits or positions beyond those we already possess through whatever abilities we had aided by luck inheritance or the misfortune of others we had reached a freedom granted to few in this terribly troubled world but with this freedom comes a responsibility and we accept it as did our predecessors years ago it is to use our resources to make this a better country and through that process hopefully a better world winters leaned back in the armchair his palms upturned as he shook his head his voice tentative even questioning lord knows no one elected us no one anointed us in the name of divine grace and certainly no bolts of lightning struck down from the heavens revealing any olympian message but we do what we do because we can do it and we do it because we believe in our collective dispassionate judgment dont be defensive sam interrupted margaret lowell gently we may be privileged but were also diverse we dont represent any single colour of the spectrum im not sure how to take that margaret said gideon logan his eyebrows arched in mock surprise as the members of inver brass laughed dear gideon replied lowell i never noticed palm beach at this time of year youre positively sunburned someone had to tend your gardens madame if you did im no doubt homeless conceivably yes a consortium of puerto rican families has leased the property madame a commune actually quiet laughter rippled across the table im sorry samuel our levity isnt called for on the contrary jacob mandel broke in its a sign of health and perspective if we ever walk away from laughter especially over our foibles we have no business here if youll forgive me the elders in the european pogroms taught that lesson they called it one of the principles of survival they were right of course agreed sundstrom still chuckling it puts a distance however brief between people and their difficulties but may we get to the candidate im absolutely fascinated sam says hes a brilliant choice but totally unexpected i would have thought otherwise givenas peg saidthe time factor i thought hed be someone in the wings on the political wings of a pegasus if you will i really must read one of his books someday interrupted mandel again again softly he sounds like a rabbi but i dont understand him dont try said winters smiling kindly at sundstrom the candidate repeated sundstrom do i gather that varak has prepared a presentation with his usual regard for detail answered winters moving his head to his left indicating the glowing red light on the walled console behind him along the way hes unearthed some rather extraordinary information relating to events that took place a year ago almost to the day oman asked sundstrom squinting above the light of his brass lamp memorial services were held in over a dozen cities last week let mr varak explain said the whitehaired historian as he pressed an inlaid button on the surface of the table the low sound of a buzzer filled the room seconds later the library door opened and a stocky blond man in his mid to late thirties walked into the shadowed light and stood in the frame he was dressed in a tan summer suit and a dark red tie his broad shoulders seemed to stretch the fabric of his jacket were ready mr varak please come in thank you sir milos varak closed the door shutting out the dim light of the hallway beyond and proceeded to the far end of the room standing in front of the lowered silver screen he nodded courteously acknowledging the members of inver brass the glare of the brass lamps that reflected off the glistening table washed over his face heightening the prominent cheekbones and the broad forehead below the full head of neatly combed straight blond hair his eyelids were vaguely sloped bespeaking a slavic ancestry influenced by the tribes of eastern europe the eyes within them were calm knowing and somehow cold may i say it is good to see all of you again he said his english precise in his voice the accent of prague its good to see you milos countered jacob mandel saying the name with the proper czech pronunciation which was meelos the others followed with brief utterances varak sundstrom leaned back in his chair you look well milos gideon logan nodded he looks like a football player margaret lowell smiled dont let the redskins see you they need linebackers the game is far too confusing for me madame for them too ive told everyone about your progress said winters adding softly as you believe your progress to be before revealing the identity of the man youre submitting to us would you care to review the guidelines i would sir varaks eyes roamed around the table as he collected his thoughts to begin with your man should be physically attractive but not pretty or feminine someone who meets the maximum requirements of your imagemakersanything less would present too many obstacles for the time we have therefore a man men identify with the masculine virtues of this society and women find appealing nor should he be an ideologue unacceptable to vocal segments of the electorate further he must give the appearance of being what you call his own man above being bought by special interests and with a background to support that judgment naturally he should have no damaging secrets to hide finally the superficial is a most vital aspect of the search our man must have those appealing personal qualities that can help propel him into the political spotlight through accelerated public exposure a figure of real or projected warmth and quiet humour with documented acts of courage in his past but nothing he would exploit to overshadow the president his people wouldnt accept that said eric sundstrom in any event they wont have a choice sir answered varak his voice softly convincing the manipulation will take place in four stages within three months our basically anonymous man will rapidly become visible within six months he will be relatively well known and at the end of the year he will have a recognition quotient on a par with the leaders of the senate and the house the same demographics targeted these may be considered phases one through three the fourth phase several months before the conventions will be capped by appearances on the covers of time and newsweek as well as laudatory editorials in the major newspapers and on tv with the proper financing in the required areas all this can be guaranteed varak paused then added guaranteed that is with the proper candidate and i believe weve found him the members of inver brass stared at their czech coordinator in mild astonishment then cautiously looked at one another if we have offered margaret lowell and he comes down off the mountain ill marry him so will i said gideon logan mixed marriages be damned forgive me interrupted varak i did not mean to romanticize the prospect hes quite a normal person the qualities i attributed to him are mostly a result of the confidence born of his wealth which he earned by extremely hard work and taking risks in the right places at the right times hes comfortable with himself and others because he seeks nothing from others and knows what he is capable of himself who is he asked mandel may i show him to you said varak speaking respectfully without replying as he took a remote control unit from his pocket and stepped away from the screen its possible some of you may recognize him and i shall have to take back my remark about his anonymity a bolt of light shot out from the console and the face of evan kendrick filled the screen the photograph was in colour accentuating kendricks deep tan as well as the stubble of a beard and the strands of light brown hair that crept down over his ears and the back of his neck he was squinting into the sun looking across water his expression at once studious and apprehensive he looks like a hippie said margaret lowell the circumstances may explain your reaction answered varak this was taken last week the fourth week of an annual journey he makes down the rivers of white water in the rocky mountains he goes alone without company or a guide the czechoslovakian proceeded to advance the slides giving each a beat of several seconds the photographs showed kendrick in various scenes of riding the rapids on several occasions strenuously balancing his pvc craft and careening between the treacherous intrusion of jagged rocks surrounded by sprays of wild water and foam the mountain forests in the background served to emphasize the perilous smallness of man and his vessel against the unpredictable massiveness of nature wait a minute cried samuel winters now peering through tortoiseshell glasses hold that one he continued studying the photograph you never said anything about this to me hes rounding the bend heading towards the base camp below the lava falls correct sir then he must have passed through the class five rapids above yes sir without a guide yes hes crazy several decades ago i rode those waters with two guides and i was frightened to death why would he do it hes been doing it for yearswhenever he came back to the united states came back jacob mandel leaned forward until about six years ago he was a construction engineer and developer his work was centered on the eastern mediterranean and the persian gulf that part of the world is as far removed from the mountains and the rivers as one can imagine i think he simply found a certain relief with the change of scenery hed spend a week or so on business then head out to the northwest alone you say said eric sundstrom not in those days sir hed frequently take a female companion then hes obviously not a homosexual observed the only female member of inver brass i never meant to imply that he was nor did you mention anything about a wife or a family which id think would be an important consideration you simply said he now travels alone on what are obviously holidays hes a bachelor madame that could be a problem inserted sundstrom not necessarily sir we have two years to address the situation and given the probability factors a marriage during an election year might have a certain appeal with the most popular president in history in attendance no doubt said gideon logan chuckling its not beyond possibility sir my god youre covering the bases milos a moment please mandel adjusted his steelrimmed glasses you say he worked in the mediterranean six years ago he was in production then he sold the company and left the middle east why was that a tragic accident occurred that took the lives of nearly all his employees and their entire families the loss profoundly affected him was he responsible continued the stockbroker not at all another firm was charged with using inferior equipment did he in any way profit from the tragedy asked mandel his gentle eyes suddenly hard on the contrary sir i checked that out thoroughly he sold the company for less than half its market value even the attorneys for the conglomerate that bought him out were astonished they were authorized to pay three times the price the eyes of inver brass returned to the large screen and the photograph of a man and his craft careening around a wild bend in the rapids who took these asked logan i did sir replied varak i tracked him he never saw me the slides continued and suddenly there was an abrupt change the prospect was no longer seen in the rugged clothes of the white water rapids or in daysend fatigues and tshirts around a campfire cooking alone over the flames he was now photographed cleanshaven his hair cut and combed and dressed in a dark business suit walking up a familiar street an attaché case in his hand thats washington said eric sundstrom now its the steps leading up to the rotunda added logan with the next slide hes on the hill interjected mandel i know him said sundstrom the fingers of his right hand pressing into his temples i know the face and theres a story behind that face but i dont know what it is not the story im about to tell you sir all right milos margaret lowells voice was adamant enoughs enough who the hell is he his name is kendrick evan kendrick hes the representative from the ninth district of colorado a congressman exclaimed jacob mandel as the photograph of kendrick on the capitols steps remained on the screen ive never heard of him and i thought i knew just about everyone up there by name of course not personally hes relatively new sir and his election was not widely covered he ran on the presidents party line because in that district the opposition is nonexistentwinning the primary is tantamount to election i mention this because the congressman does not appear to be philosophically in tune with numerous white house policies he avoided national issues during the primary are you suggesting gideon logan asked he has true independence and integrity in a very quiet way yes quiet and new and with a somewhat less than imposing constituency said sundstrom from that point of view your anonymitys safe too safe perhaps theres nothing more dismissible in political prime time than a newly elected unheardof congressman from an unknown district denvers in the first boulder the second and the springs in the fifth wheres the ninth southwest of telluride near the utah border replied jacob mandel shrugging as if apologizing for his knowledge there were some mining stocks very speculative that we looked into several years ago but that man on the screen is not the congressman we met and who tried rather desperately to persuade us to underwrite the issues did you underwrite them sir asked varak no we did not answered mandel frankly the speculation went beyond the calculated risks of venture capital what you call in america a possible scam we had no proof milos we just backed away but the congressional representative from that district did his best to enlist your support indeed he did that is why evan kendrick is now the congressman sir oh eric interrupted gideon logan shifting his large head to look at the academic inventor of space technology you said you knew him at least his face i do im sure i do now that varaks told us who he is i think i met him at one of those interminable cocktail parties in washington or georgetown and i distinctly remember that someone said there was quite a story behind him that was it i never heard the story it was simply a statement but milos said that whatever story you had in mind wasnt the one he was going to tell us said margaret lowell isnt that right she added looking at varak yes madame the remark made to professor sundstrom undoubtedly concerned the nature of kendricks election he literally bought it in anger burying his opponent under an avalanche of local advertising and a series of expensive rallies that were more public circuses than political assemblies it was said that when the incumbent complained that the election laws were being violated kendrick confronted him with his attorneysnot to discuss the campaign but instead his opponents performance in office the complaints instantly stopped and kendrick won handily one could say he puts his money where his indignation is remarked winters quietly however you have a far more fascinating bit of information for us mr varak and since ive heard it ill repeat what i said before its extraordinary please go on yes sir the czech pressed the remote control and with a muted slap the next photograph appeared on the screen kendrick and the rotunda steps disappeared replaced by an overview of hysterical crowds racing down a narrow street flanked by buildings of obviously islamic character past shops with signs in arabic above them oman said eric sundstrom glancing at winters a year ago the historianspokesman nodded the slides followed quickly one after the other depicting scenes of chaos and carnage there were bulletridden corpses and shellpocked walls torn down embassy gates and rows of kneeling terrified hostages behind a rooftop screen of latticework there were closeups of shrieking young people brandishing weapons their mouths gaping in triumph their zealous eyes wild suddenly the rushing slides stopped and the attention of inver brass was abruptly riveted on a slide that seemed to have little relevance it showed a tall darkskinned man in long white robes his head covered by a ghotra his face in profile walking out of a hotel then the screen was split a second photograph showing the same man rushing across an arab bazaar in front of a fountain the photographs remained on the screen the bewildered silence was broken by milos varak that man is evan kendrick he said simply bewilderment gave way to astonishment except for samuel winters the others leaned forward beyond the glare of the brass lamps to study the magnified figure on the screen varak continued these photographs were taken by a case officer of the cia with a fourzero clearance whose assignment was to keep kendrick under surveillance wherever possible she did a remarkable job she margaret lowell arched her brows in approval a middle east specialist her fathers egyptian herm other an american from california she speaks arabic fluently and is used extensively by the agency in crisis situations over there over there whispered mandel stunned what was he doing over there just a minute said logan his dark eyes boring into varaks stop me if im wrong young man but if i remember correctly there was an article in the washington post last year suggesting that an unknown american had interceded in masqat at the time a number of people thought that it might have been the texan ross perot but the story never appeared again it was dropped youre not wrong sir the american was evan kendrick and with pressure from the white house the story was killed why he could have made enormous political mileage out of itif indeed his contribution led to the settlement his contribution was the settlement then i certainly dont understand remarked logan quietly as he looked at samuel winters no one does said the historian theres no explanation just a buried file in the archives that milos managed to obtain apart from that document theres nothing anywhere to indicate a connection between kendrick and the events in masqat theres even a memo to the secretary of state disavowing any such connection interrupted varak it does not reflect well on the congressman in essence it suggests that he was a selfserving opportunist a politician who wished to further himself by way of the hostage crisis because he had worked in the arab emirates and especially oman and was trying to insert himself for publicity purposes the recommendation was not to touch him for the safety of the hostages but they obviously did touch him exclaimed sundstrom touch him and use him he couldnt have got in there if they hadnt all commercial flights were suspended good lord he must have been flown over under cover and just as obviously hes no selfserving opportunist added margaret lowell we see him here in front of our eyes and milos tells us he was instrumental in bringing the crisis to an end yet hes never uttered a word about his involvement wed all know about it if he had and theres no explanation asked gideon logan addressing varak none acceptable sir and ive gone to the source the white house said mandel no the man who had to be aware of his recruitment the one who ran the nerve centre here in washington his name is frank swann how did you find him i didnt sir kendrick did but how did you find kendrick pressed margaret lowell like mr logan i too remembered that story of an american in masqat that was so abruptly dropped by the media for reasons i cant really explain i decided to trace itprobably thinking it might involve someone highly placed someone we should consider if there was any credence to the story varak paused a slight uncharacteristic smile creasing his lips frequently the most obvious security measures trip up those wishing to be secure in this case it was the department of states entrance logs since the killings several years ago all visitors without exception must sign in and sign out passing through metal detectors among the thousands who did so during the time of the hostage crisis was the unlikely name of a freshman congressman from colorado seeing a mr swann neither meant anything to me of course but our computers were better informed mr swann was the state departments foremost expert on southwest asia and the congressman was a man who had made his wealth in the emirates bahrain and saudi arabia in the panic of the crisis someone had forgotten to remove kendricks name from the logs so you went to see this swann said mandel removing his steelrimmed glasses i did sir what did he tell you that i was completely mistaken that they had rejected kendricks offer to help because he had nothing to contribute he added that kendrick was only one of dozens of peoplepeople who had worked in the arab emirateswho had made similar offers but you didnt believe him broke in margaret lowell i had a very good reason not to congressman kendrick never signed out after his visit to the state department that afternoon it was wednesday august and his name is nowhere in the departure logs he was obviously taken out by special arrangement which normally signifies the start of a cover usually a deep cover consular operations said sundstrom states covert link to the cia a reluctant but necessary compromise added winters toes get stepped on in the dark needless to say mr varak pursued his inquiries at both state and langley the hero of oman revealed said gideon logan softly staring at the figure on the screen my god what a hook a crusading congressman above reproach chimed in mandel a proven foe of corruption a man of courage said mrs lowell who risked his life for two hundred americans he couldnt have known and sought nothing for himself when he could have had anything he wanted completed sundstrom certainly anything in politics tell us everything youve learned about evan kendrick if you will mr varak said winters as he and the others reached for their lined yellow pads before i do so replied the czech a slight hesitancy in his voice i must tell you that i flew out to colorado last week and encountered a situation i cant fully explain at this time id rather say so now an elderly man is living in kendricks house on the outskirts of mesa verde ive learned that his name is emmanuel weingrass an architect with dual citizenship in both israel and the united states and that he had major surgery a number of months ago since then he has been convalescing as the congressmans guest whats the significance asked eric sundstrom im not sure there is any but three facts are worth noting first as nearly as i can determine this weingrass appeared out of nowhere shortly after kendricks return from oman second theres obviously a close relationship between the two of them and thirdsomewhat disturbingthe old mans identity as well as his presence in mesa verde is a closely guarded but poorly kept secret weingrass himself is the offender here whether through age or by nature hes quite gregarious among the workmen especially the hispanics thats not necessarily against him said logan smiling he could have been part of the oman operation offered margaret lowell and thats not negative either hardly agreed jacob mandel sundstrom spoke again he must have considerable influence with kendrick he said writing on his pad wouldnt you say milos i would assume so my only point is that i want you to know when i dont know something id say hes an asset stated samuel winters from any point of view proceed mr varak yes sir knowing that nothing must leave this room ive prepared the congressmans dossier for slide projection the czech pressed the remote control unit and the dual photographs of the disguised kendrick on the violenceridden streets in masqat were supplanted by a typewritten page the letters large the lines triplespaced each slide continued varak represents approximately a quarter of a normal page all negatives naturally were destroyed in the laboratory downstairs ive done my best to study the candidate as thoroughly as possible but i have omitted certain points that might interest some of you so do not hesitate to question me on them i will watch you and if each in turn will nod his head when youve finished reading and making your notes i will know when to advance the slide for the next hour or so what you will see is the life of congressman evan kendrickfrom his birth to last week with each slide eric sundstrom was the first to nod his head margaret lowell and jacob mandel vied for the honour of being last but then they made nearly as many notes as did gideon logan the spokesman samuel winters made almost none he was convinced three hours and four minutes later milos varak snapped off the projector two hours and seven minutes after that moment the questions ended and varak left the room to paraphrase our friend out of context said winters a nod from each of you signifies consent shake your head if its negative well start with jacob slowly pensively one by one the members of inver brass nodded their consent it is agreed then continued winters congressman evan kendrick will be the next vice president of the united states he will become president eleven months after the election of the incumbent the code name is icarus to be taken as a warning a fervent prayer that he will not like so many of his predecessors try to fly too close to the sun and crash into the sea and may god have mercy on our souls the icarus agenda chapter representative kendrick from colorados ninth congressional district sat at his office desk watching his sternfaced secretary as she kept chattering away about priority mail house agendas prefloor position papers and social functions he really must attend his chief aides judgment notwithstanding her lips opened and closed with the rapidity of machinegun fire the nasal sounds emanating not much lower in the decibel count there congressman thats the schedule for the week its really something annie but cant you simply send out a blanket letter to everyone saying ive got a social disease and dont want to infect any of them evan stop it cried ann mulcahy oreilly a very determined middleaged veteran of washington youre being sloughed off around here and i wont have it you know what theyre saying here on the hill they say you dont give a damn that you spent a bundle of money just to meet girls as rich as yourself do you believe that annie how the hell could i you never go anywhere never do anything id praise the saints if you got caught naked in the reflection pool with the biggest tootsie in washington then id know you were doing something maybe i dont want to do anything damn it you should ive typed your views on a dozen issues and theyre light years better than those of per cent of the clowns here but nobody pays any attention theyre buried because theyre not popular annie im not popular they dont want me in either camp the few who notice me on both sides have pinned so many labels on me they cancel themselves out they cant pigeonhole me sot hey bury me which isnt very difficult because i dont complain god knows i dont agree with you a lot of the time but i know a mind at work when i see it forget it congressman what are your replies later has manny called i put him off twice i wanted to get in my session with you kendrick leaned forward his light blue eyes cold bordering on anger dont ever do that again annie theres nothing so important to me as that man in colorado yes sir oreilly lowered her eyes im sorry said evan quickly that wasnt called for youre trying to do your job and im not much help sorry again dont apologize i know what youve been through with mr weingrass and what he means to youhow often did i bring your work to the hospital i had no right to interfere on the other hand i am trying to do my job and youre not always the most cooperative boss on the hill there are other hills id rather be on im aware of that so well cross out the social functions youd probably do yourself more harm than good anyway ann oreilly got out of the chair and placed a folder on kendricks desk but i think you should look at a proposal from your senatorial colleague from colorado i think he wants to chop off the top of a mountain and put in a reservoir in this town that usually means a lake followed by highrise condominiums that transparent son of a bitch said evan whipping open the folder ill also get mr weingrass on the phone for you still mr weingrass asked evan turning over pages you wont relent ive heard him tell you to call him manny dozens of times oh now and then i do but its not easy why because he yells mother of god no you cant take offence at that if youre married to a twotoilet irish detective twotoilet kendrick looked up an old boston expression but no its not the yelling what then a whimsy of humour he keeps repeating he keeps saying to me over and overespecially when i call him by his first namekid he says i think weve got a vaudeville act here well call it mannys irish annie what do you say and i say not a hell of a lot manny and he says leave my friend the animal and fly away with me hell understand my undying passion and i say to him that the tt cop doesnt understand his own dont tell your husband offered kendrick chuckling oh but i did all he said was that hed buy the airline tickets of course he and weingrass got drunk a couple of times got drunk i didnt even know theyd met my faultto my undying regret it was when you flew to denver about eight months ago i remember the state conference and manny was still in the hospital i asked you to go see him take him the paris tribune and i brought paddy with me during the evening visiting hours im no centrefold but even im not walking these streets at night and the tt cops got to be good for something what happened they got along like a shot and a beer i had to work late one night that week and paddy insisted on going to the hospital himself evan shook his head slowly im sorry annie i never knew i didnt mean to involve you and your husband in my private life and manny never told me probably the listerine bottles the what same colour as light scotch ill get him on the phone emmanuel weingrass leaned against the formation of rock on top of a hill belonging to kendricks acre spread at the base of the mountains his shortsleeved checked shirt was unbuttoned to the waist as he took the sun breathing the clear air of the southern rockies he glanced at his chest at the scars of the surgery and wondered for a brief moment whether he should believe in god or in evan kendrick the doctors had told himmonths after the operation and numerous postop checkupsthat they had cut out the dirty little cells that were eating his life away he was clean they pronounced pronounced to a man who on this day on this rock was eighty years of age with the sun beating down on his frail body frail and not so frail for he moved better spoke bettercoughed practically not at all yet he missed his gauloise cigarettes and the monte cristo cigars he enjoyed so much so what could they do stop his life a few weeks or months before a logical ending he looked over at his nurse in the shade of a nearby tree next to the everpresent golf cart she was one of the roundtheclock females who accompanied him everywhere and he wondered what she would do if he propositioned her while leaning casually against the boulder such potential responses had always intrigued him but generally the reality merely amused him beautiful day isnt it he called out simply gorgeous was the reply what do you say we take all our clothes off and really enjoy it the nurses expression did not change for an instant her response was calm deliberate even gentle mr weingrass im here to look after you not give you cardiac arrest not bad not bad at all the radio telephone on the golf cart hummed the woman walked over to it and snapped it out of its recess after a brief conversation capped with quiet laughter she turned to manny the congressmans calling you mr weingrass you dont laugh like that with a congressman said manny pushing himself away from the rock fivell get you twenty its annie glocamorra telling lies about me she did ask if id strangled you yet the nurse handed the phone to weingrass annie this womans a letch we try to be of service said evan kendrick boy that girl of yours gets off the phone pretty damned quick forewarned forearmed manny you called is everything all right i should only call in a crisis you rarely call period that privilege is almost exclusively mine what is it you got any money left i cant spend the interest sure why you know the addition we built on the west porch so you got a view of course ive been playing with some sketches i think you should have a terrace on top two steel beams would carry the load maybe a third if you went for a glassblocked steam bath by the wall glassblocked hey that sounds terrific go ahead good ive got the plumbers coming out in the morning but when its done then i go back to paris whatever you say manny however you said youd work up some plans for a gazebo down by the streams where they merge you said you didnt want to walk that far ive changed my mind it would be a good place for a person to get away and think that excludes the owner of this establishment youre all heart im coming back next week for a few days i cant wait said weingrass raising his voice and looking over at the nurse when you get here you can take these heavybreathing sex maniacs off my hands it was shortly past pm when milos varak walked down the deserted hallway in the house office building he had been admitted by prearrangement a late night visitor of one congressman arvin partridge of alabama varak reached the heavy wooden door with the brass plate centred in the sculptured panel and knocked within seconds it was opened by a slender man in his early twenties whose eyes looked out anxiously from large tortoiseshell glasses whoever he was he was not the gruff savvy chairman of the partridge gang that investigative committee determined to find out why the armed services were getting so little for so much not in terms of toilet seats and pipe wrenches those were too blatant to be taken seriously and might even be correctable diversions what concerned the birdsanother sobriquetwere the per cent overruns and the restricted degree of competitive bidding in defence contracts what they had only begun to uncover of course was a river of corruption with so many tributaries there werent enough scouts to pursue them in the canoes available im here to see congressman partridge said the blond man his czech accent not lost on but conceivably misconstrued by the slender young man at the door did you began the apparent congressional aide awkwardly i mean when you saw the guards downstairs if youre asking me whether or not i was checked for firearms of course i was and you should know it they called you from security the congressman please hes expecting me certainly sir hes in his office this way sir the nervous aide led milos to a second large dark door the younger man knocked congressman tell him to come in ordered the loud southern voice from inside and you stay out there and take any calls i dont care if its the speaker or the president im not here go right in said the aide opening the door varak was tempted to tell the agitated young man that he was a friendly liaison from the kgb but decided against it the aide was there for a reason few phone calls came to the house office building at this hour milos stepped inside the large ornate room with the profusion of photographs on the desk walls and tables all in one way or another attesting to partridges influence patriotism and power the man himself standing by a curtained window was not as impressive as he appeared in the photographs he was short and overweight with a puffed angry face below a large head of thinning dyed hair ah dont know what youre sellin blondie said the congressman walking forward like an enraged pigeon but if its what i think it is ill take you down so fast youll wish you had a parachute im not selling anything sir im giving something away something of considerable value in fact muleshit you want some kind of fuckin coverup and im not givin it my clients seek no coverup and certainly i dont but i submit congressman you may bull i listened to you on the phoneyou heard something somebody mentioned drugs and id better listenso i made some damn clear inquiries and found out what i had to know what i knew was the truth were clean here clean as a bama stream now i want to find out who sent you what thief in what larcenous boardroom thought he could scare me with this kind of crap i dont think youd want this kind of crap made public sir the information is devastating information words innuendo rumours gossip like that black kid who tried to indict the whole gawdamned congress with his lies no rumours no gossip said milos varak reaching into the breast pocket of his jacket only photographs the czech from inver brass threw the white envelope on the desk what partridge went instantly to the envelope he sat down and tore it open pulling the photographs out one by one and holding them under the greenshaded desk lamp his eyes widened as his face went white then bloodred in fury what he saw was beyond anything he might have imagined there were various couples trios and quartets of partly and fully naked young people using straws with white powder strewn on tables hastily taken blurred shots of syringes pills and bottles of beer and whisky finally clear photographs of several couples making love cameras come in so many sizes these days said varak microtechnology has produced them as small as buttons on a jacket or a shirt oh jesus christ cried partridge in agony thats my house in arlington and thats congressman bookbinders home in silver springs as well as the houses of three other members of your committee your work takes you out of washington a great deal of the time who took these asked partridge barely audible i wont answer that except to give you my word that the person is thousands of miles away without the negatives and no chance of returning to this country one could say a university exchange student in political science weve achieved so much and now its all down the goddamned drain oh god why congressman inquired varak sincerely these young people arent the committee theyre not your attorneys or your accountants or even senior aides theyre children whove made terrible mistakes in the headstrong environment of the most powerful capital in the world get rid of them tell them their lives and careers are ruined unless they get help and straighten out but dont stop your committee nobody will ever believe us again said partridge staring straight ahead as if speaking to the wall were as rotten as everyone we go after were hypocrites nobody has to know shit exploded the congressman from alabama pouncing on the phone and pressing a button holding it down beyond the point where his call was answered get in here he screamed the young aide came through the door as partridge rose from the desk you fancyschool son of a bitch i asked you to tell me the truth you lied no i didnt yelled back the young man his eyes watering behind the tortoiseshell glasses you asked me whats going onwhat is going onand i told you nothingnothing is going on a couple of us got busted three four weeks ago and it scared all of us okay we were dumb stupid we all agreed but we didnt hurt anyone but ourselves we quit the whole scene and a hell of a lot more than that but you and your hotshots around here never noticed your snotty staff works us eighty hours a week then calls us dumb kids while they use the stuff we feed em to get in front of the cameras well what you never noticed is that youve got a whole new kindergarten class here now the others all quit and you never even noticed im the only one left because i couldnt get out youre out now youre gawdamned right emperor jones who the allusion would grab you said the young man dashing out of the door and slamming it behind him who was that asked varak arvin partridge junior replied the congressman quietly and sat down his eyes on the door hes a thirdyear law student at virginia they were all law students and we worked their asses off around the clock for spit and little thanks but we were giving them something too and they betrayed the trust we placed in them by giving it which was experience theyd never get anywhere else not in the courts or in the law books nowhere but here my son split legal and grammatical hairs and he knows it he lied to me about something that can destroy all of us ill never trust him again im sorry its not your problem snapped partridge his reflective voice suddenly gone all right trash boy he continued harshly what do you want from me to keep this committee together you said no coverup but i suppose there are a couple of dozen ways of saying it without saying it ill have to weigh the pluses and the minuses wont i there are no negatives for you sir said varak taking out several folded sheets of paper then unfolding them and placing them on the desk in front of the congressman they comprised a resume a small identification photograph in the upper righthand corner of the first page my clients want this man on your committee youve got something on him broke in partridge absolutely nothing compromising hes above reproach where such matters are concerned to repeat my clients seek no coverups no extortion no committee bills sent out or blocked for passage this man does not know my clients nor do they personally know him and hes completely unaware of our meeting tonight then why do you want him with me because my clients believe he will be an excellent addition to your committee one man cant do a damn thing you know that dont you certainly if hes planted to get information were leakproof partridge glanced at the snapshots under the greenshaded lamp he turned them over and slapped them down on the desk at least we were varak leaned over and took the photographs do it congressman put him on the committee or as you said so much down the drain when hes in his chair these will be returned to you along with the negatives do it partridges eyes were on the snapshots in the blond mans hand as it happens theres a vacancy bookbinder resigned yesterdaypersonal problems i know said milos varak the congressman looked up into his visitors eyes who the hell are you someone devoted to his adopted country but im not important that man is partridge glanced down at the resume in front of him evan kendrick colorados ninth he read ive barely heard of him and what i did hear doesnt raise any pimples hes a nobody a rich nobody that will change sir said varak turning and heading for the door congressman congressman yelled evan kendricks chief aide racing out of the office and running down the house corridor to catch his employer what is it asked evan pulling his hand away from the elevator button and looking bemused as the breathless young man skidded to a stop in front of him its not like you to raise your voice above a very confidential whisper phil did colorados ninth get buried by a mud slide it may have just been dug out of a longstanding one from your viewpoint that is do tell congressman partridge alabamas partridge hes rough but a good man he takes chances i like what he does he wants you to do it with him do what be on his committee what its a tremendous step forward sir its a lousy step backward disagreed kendrick his committee members are on the nightly news every other week and theyre fill for sunday mornings when our newest congressional comets arent available its the last thing i want forgive me congressman but its the first thing you should take said the aide calming down his eyes locked with evans why the young man named phil touched kendricks arm moving him away from the elevators gathering crowd youve told me youre going to resign after the election and i accept that but youve also told me that you want a voice in the appointment of your successor i intend to have evan nodded his head now in agreement i fought that lousy machine and i want it kept out christ theyd sell every last mountain in the south rockies as a uranium mine if they could get one government explorationleaked naturally you wont have any voice at all if you turn partridge down why not because he really wants you why im not sure im only sure he doesnt do anything without a reason maybe he wants to extend his influence west build a base for his own personal advancementwho knows but he controls a hell of a lot of state delegations and if you insult him by saying no thanks pal hell consider it arrogance and cut you off both here and back home i mean he is one macho presence on the hill kendrick sighed his brow wrinkled i can always keep my mouth shut i guess it was the third week after congressman evan kendricks appointment to the partridge committee a totally unexpected assignment that thrilled no one in washington except ann mulcahy oreilly and by extension her husband patrick xavier a transplanted police lieutenant from boston whose abilities were sought and paid for by the crimeridden capitals authorities the reasoning behind the chairmans action was generally assumed to be that the old pro wanted the limelight focused on him not on the other members of the committee if that assumption was correct partridge could not have made a better choice the representative from colorados ninth district rarely said anything during the twiceweekly televised hearings other than the words i pass mr chairman when it was his turn to question witnesses in fact the longest statement he made during his brief tenure with the birds was his twentythreesecond response to the chairmans welcome he had quietly expressed his astonishment at having been honoured by selection and hoped that he would live up to the chairmans confidence in him the television cameras had left his face midway through his remarksin precisely twelve secondsfor the arrival of a uniformed janitor who walked through the chambers emptying ashtrays ladies and gentlemen said the hushed voice of the announcer even throughout such hearings as these the government does not overlook basic precautions what oh yes congressman owen canbrick has completed his statement however on tuesday of the fourth week a most abnormal thing happened it was the morning of that weeks first televised hearing and interest ran higher than usual because the primary witness was the representative of the pentagons office of procurement the man was a youngish balding full colonel who had aggressively made a name for himself in logistics a totally committed soldier of unshakeable convictions he was bright fast and blessed with an acerbic wit he was arlingtons big gun where the snivelling pennypinching civilians were concerned there were many who could not wait for the clash between colonel robert barrish and the equally bright equally fast and certainly equally acerbic chairman of the partridge committee what was abnormal that morning however was the absence of congressman arvin partridge of alabama the chairman did not show up and no amount of phone calls nor a platoon of aides rushing all over the capital could unearth him he had simply disappeared but congressional committees do not revolve solely around chairmen especially not where television is concerned so the proceedings went forward under the lack of leadership provided by a congressman from north dakota who was nursing the worst hangover of his life a most unusual malady as the man was not known to drink he was considered a mild abstemious minister of the gospel who took to heart the biblical admonition of turning swords into ploughshares hew as also raw meat for the lion that was colonel robert barrish and to finish my statement before this civilian inquisition i state categorically that i speak for a strong free society in lethal combat with the forces of evil that would rip us to shreds at the first sign of weakness on our part are our hands to be shackled over minor academic fiduciary procedures that have only the barest relationship to the status quo ante of our enemies if i understand you said the blearyeyed temporary chairman let me assure you that no one here is questioning your commitment to our nations defence i would hope not sir i dont think hold it soldier said evan kendrick at the far end of the panel i beg your pardon i said wait a minute will you please my rank is colonel in the united states army and i expect to be addressed as such said the officer testily evan looked hard at the witness momentarily forgetting the microphone ill address you any way i like you arrogant bastard cameras jolted bleeps filled audios everywhere but too late for the exclusion unless youve personally amended the constitution which i doubt youve ever read continued kendrick studying the papers in front of him chuckling quietly as he recalled his meeting with frank swann at the state department before he went to masqat inquisition my ass i resent your attitude a lot of taxpayers resent yours too interrupted evan looking at barrishs service record and remembering frank swanns precise words over a year ago let me ask you colonel have you ever fired a gun im a soldier weve both established that havent we i know youre a soldier we inquisitorial civilians are paying your salaryunless you rented the uniform the congressional chamber rippled with quiet laughter what i asked you was whether you had ever fired a gun countless times have you several not countless and never in uniform then i think the question is closed not entirely did you ever use a weapon for the purpose of killing another human being whose intention was to kill you the subsequent silence was lost on no one the soft reply was registered on all i was never in combat if thats what you mean but you just said you were in lethal combat et cetera et cetera which conveys to everyone in here and the audience out there that youre some kind of modernday davy crockett holding the fort at the alamo or a sergeant york or maybe an indiana jones blasting away at the bad guys but thats all wrong isnt it colonel youre an accountant whos trying to justify the theft of millionsmaybe billionsof the taxpayers money under the red white and blue flag of super patriotism you son of a how dare you the jolting cameras and the bleeps again came too late as colonel barrish rose from his chair and pounded the table the committee is adjourned yelled the exhausted chairman adjourned goddamn it in the darkened control room of one of washingtons network stations a greyhaired newscaster stood in a corner studying the congressional monitor as most of america had seen him do countless times he pursed his lips in thought then turned to the assistant beside him i want that congressmanwhoever the hell he ison my show next sunday the upset woman in chevy chase cried into the phone i tell you mother i never saw him like that before in my life i mean it he was positively drunk thank god for that nice foreigner who brought him home he said he found him outside a restaurant in washington barely able to walkcan you imagine barely able to walk he recognized him and being a good christian thought hed better get him off the streets whats so insane mother is that i didnt think he ever touched a drop of alcohol well obviously i was wrong i wonder how many other secrets my devoted minister has this morning he claimed he couldnt remember anythingnot a thing he said oh my sweet jesus mother he just walked in the front doormomma hes throwing up all over the rug where the hell am i whispered arvin partridge sr shaking his head and trying to focus his eyes on the shabby curtained windows of the motel room in some rats nest thats not far off the mark said the blond man approaching the bed except that the rodents who frequent this place usually do so for only an hour or two you screamed the representative from alabama staring at the czech what have you done to me not to you sir but for you answered varak fortunately i was able to extricate you from a potentially embarrassing situation what partridge sat up and swung his legs over the bed although not yet oriented he realized he was fully clothed where how one of my clients was dining at the carriage house in georgetown where you met the congressman from north dakota when the unpleasantness started he called me again fortunately i live in the area and was able to get there in time incidentally youre obviously not registered here wait a minute yelled partridge muleshit that meeting between the holy roller and me was a setup his office gets a call that i want to meet him on urgent committee business and my office gets the same we got that pentagon prick barrish coming in the morning so we both figure wed better see each other i ask him whats going on and he asks me the same i wouldnt know anything about that sir hogshit what unpleasantness you overindulged rabbitshit i had one fuckin martini and the sky padre had lemonade if thats the truth you both have odd tolerances you fell over the table and the minister tried to drink the salt the chairman of the partridge committee glared at the czech finns he said quietly you dosed us both with mickey finns before last night i never set foot inside that restaurant youre also a liar a hell of an experienced one good christ what time is it partridge whipped his wrist up to look at his watch varak interrupted the hearing is over shit the minister was not terribly effective but your new appointee made an indelible impression sir im sure youll see portions of his performance on the evening news certain words deleted of course oh my god whispered the congressman to himself he looked up at the czech from inver brass what did they say about me about why i wasnt there your office issued a statement that was perfectly acceptable you were on a fishing boat on marylands eastern shore the engine failed and you had to drop anchor a mile from the marina its been substantiated there are no problems my office issued a statement like that on whose authorization your sons hes a remarkably forgiving young man hes waiting outside in your car the redhaired salesman in the saab showroom fairly glowed in astonishment as he signed the papers and counted out ten onehundred dollar bills well have the car ready for you by three oclock this afternoon thats nice said the buyer who had listed his profession on the financeloan agreement as a bartender currently employed at the carriage house in georgetown the icarus agenda chapter zero hour mr kendrick said colonel robert barrish smiling pleasantly into the camera his voice the soul of reason we must be prepared for it and with preemptive escalation we push it farther and farther away or conversely overstock the arsenals to the point where one miscalculation blows up the planet oh please admonished the army officer condescendingly that line of rationalization has long since been rendered modus non operand were the professionals you mean our side of course i mean our side what about the enemy arent they professionals too if youre attempting to lateralize our enemies technological commitments with ours i think youll find youre as misinformed about that as you are about the cost control effectiveness of our system i take that to mean theyre not as good as we are a sagacious assessment congressman beyond the superiority of our moral commitmenta commitment to godthe high tech training of our armed forces is the finest on earth if youll forgive me here i must say as part of a great team that im immensely proud of our splendid fellows and girls golly gee so am i said evan a minor smile on his lips but then i must say here colonel that ive lost your line of reasoning or was it preemptive escalation i thought your comment about professionalism was in response to my remark about the possibility of miscalculation with all those arsenals so full it was you see mr kendrick what im patiently trying to explain to you is that our weapons personnel are locked into manuals of procedures that eliminate miscalculation we are virtually failsafe we may be agreed evan but what about the other guy you saidi think you saidthat he wasnt so smart that there was no lateralization whatever that means suppose he miscalculates then what he would never have the opportunity to miscalculate again with minimum loss to ourselves we would take out hold it soldier interrupted kendrick his tone suddenly harsh issuing no less than an order back up with minimum loss to ourselves what does that mean im sure youre aware that im not at liberty to discuss such matters i think you damn well better does minimum loss mean just los angeles or new york or maybe albuquerque or st louis since were all paying for this minimumloss umbrella why not tell us what the weathers going to be like if you think im going to endanger national security on network television well congressman im genuinely sorry to say it but i dont think you have any right representing the american people the whole bunch of them never thought i did i was told this programme was between you and methat i insulted you on television and that you had the right to reply in the same arena its why im here so reply colonel dont keep throwing pentagonese slogans at me i have too much respect for our armed services to allow you to get away with that if by slogans youre criticizing the selfless leaders of our defence establishmentmen of loyalty and honour who above all want to keep our nation strongthen i pity you oh come off it i havent been here that long but among the few friends ive made are some brass over in arlington who probably wince when you drag out your modus non operandis what im patiently trying to explain to you colonel is that you dont have a blank cheque any more than i do or my neighbour down the street does we live with realities then let me explain the realities broke in barrish let me finish said evan now smiling gentlemen gentlemen said the familiar newscaster im not casting any doubts on your commitment colonel kendrick interrupted youre doing your job and protecting your turf i understand that evan picked up a piece of paper but when you said in the hearingi wrote this downminor academic fiduciary procedures i wondered what you meant are you really above accountability if you believe that tell it to joe smith down the street whos trying to balance the family budget that same joe smith will get on his knees to us when it dawns on him that were ensuring his survival i think i just heard a lot of groans over in arlington colonel joe smith doesnt have to get on his knees to anyone not here youre taking my remarks out of context you know perfectly well what i meant congressman partridge no colonel hes the other guy im the sub who was sent in at left guard left is certainly right thats an interesting statement may i quote you i know about you said barrish ominously threateningly dont talk to me about the guy down the street pretending youre like everyone else barrish paused then as if he could no longer control himself shouted youre not even married thats the most accurate statement youve made here no im not but if youre asking me for a date id better check with my girl no contest the pentagons big gun backfired the powder burns all over his face on national television who the hell is he asked mr joseph smith of cedar street in clinton new jersey i dont know replied mrs smith in front of the television next to her husband hes kind of cute though isnt he i dont know about cute but he just told off one of those snotty officer types who used to give me a lot of shit in nam hes my buddy hes good said inver brasss eric sundstrom rising and turning off the set in his flat overlooking new yorks gramercy park he drained his glass of montrachet and looked over at margaret lowell and gideon logan both sitting in chairs across the room he has a quick mind and stays ice cold i know that cobra barrish he likes nothing better than drawing blood in the spotlight kendrick buried him with his own bullshit our mans kind of cute too added mrs lowell what well hes attractive eric thats hardly a liability hes funny said logan and thats a decided asset he has the ability and the presence to shift rapidly from the serious to the amusing and thats no small talent he did the same thing during the hearing its not accidental kennedy had the same gift he saw humorous ironies everywhere the people like that still i think i see a grey cloud in the distance whats that asked sundstrom a man with such quick perceptions will not be easy to control if hes the right man said margaret lowell and we have every reason to believe he is that wont matter gideon suppose hes not suppose theres something we dont know we will have launched him not the political process far uptown in manhattan between fifth and madison avenues in a brownstone town house that rose six storeys high the whitehaired samuel winters sat opposite his friend jacob mandel they were in winters large topfloor study several exquisite gobelin tapestries were hung on various wall spaces between the bookshelves and the furniture was equally breathtaking yet the room was comfortable it was used it was warm the masterpieces of the past were there to serve not merely to be observed using the remote control the aristocratic historian snapped off the television set well asked winters i want to think for a moment samuel mandels eyes strayed around the study youve had all this since you were born said the stockbroker making a statement yet youve always worked so hard i chose a field where having money made things much easier replied winters ive occasionally felt rather guilty about that i could always go where i wanted gain access to archives others couldnt study as long as i wished whatever contributions ive made have been minor compared with the fun ive had my wife used to say that the historian glanced at the portrait of a lovely darkhaired woman dressed in the style of the forties it was hung behind the desk between two huge windows overlooking seventythird street a man working could turn and gaze at it easily you miss her dont you terribly i come up and talk with her frequently i dont think i could go on without hannah yet oddly enough considering what she went through in germany i pray to god she leaves me first i believe the death of another loved one would be too great a pain for her to bear alone does that sound awful of me it sounds remarkably generouslike everything you say and do old friend and also because i know so well what you would face by yourself youd do it better than i jacob nonsense it must be your temple when were you last in church samuel lets see my son was married in paris when i broke my leg and couldnt attend and my daughter eloped with that charming heliumhead who makes far more money than he deserves writing those films i dont understandso it must have been in fortyfive when i got back from the war st john the divine of course she made me go when all i wanted to do was get her undressed oh youre outrageous i dont believe you for a minute youd be wrong he could be dangerous said mandel suddenly changing the subject and reverting to evan kendrick winters understood his old friend had been talking but he had also been thinking in what way everything weve learned about himand i doubt theres much more to knowwould seem to negate any obsession for power without that wheres the danger hes fiercely independent all to the good he might even make a fine president no ties to the tubthumpers the yeasayers and the sycophants weve both seen him blow the first category away the rest are easier then im not being clear said mandel because its not yet clear to me or im being stupid jacob what are you trying to say suppose he found out about us suppose he learned he was code name icarus the product of inver brass thats impossible thats not the question leap over the impossibility intellectuallyand the young man has an intellectwhat would be his response remember now hes fiercely independent samuel winters brought his hand to his chin and stared out of the window overlooking the street and then his gaze shifted to the portrait of his wife i see he said uncertain images coming into focus from his own past hed be furious hed consider himself part of a larger corruption irrevocably tied to it because he was manipulated hed be in a rage and in that rage pressed mandel what do you think he would do incidentally exposing us in the long run is irrelevant it would be like the rumours of the trilateral commission promoting jimmy carter because henry luce put an obscure governor of georgia on the cover of time there was more truth than not in those rumours but nobody cared what would kendrick do winters looked at his old friend his eyes widening my god he said quietly hed run in disgust does that sound familiar samuel it was so many years ago things were different i dont think they were that different far better than now actually not different i wasnt in office it was yours for the taking the brilliant immensely wealthy dean from columbia university whose advice was sought by successive presidents and whose appearances before the house and senate committees altered national policies you were tapped for the governorship of new york literally being swept into albany when you learned only weeks before the convention that a political organization unknown to you had orchestrated your nomination and your inevitable election it was a total shock id never heard of it or them yet you presumedrightly or wronglythat this silent machine expected you to do its bidding and you fled denouncing the whole charade in disgust it was against every precept of an open political process id ever advocated fiercely independent added the stockbroker and what followed was a power vacuum there was political chaos the party in disarray the opportunists moved in and took over and there were six years of draconian laws and corrupt administrations from the lower to the upper hudson are you blaming me for all that jacob its related samuel thrice caesar refused the crown and all hell broke loose are you saying that kendrick might refuse to assume the office presented to him you did you walked away in outrage because people unknown to me were committing enormous sums of money propelling me into office why if they were genuinely interested in better government and not private interest why didnt they come forward why dont we samuel winters looked hard at mandel his eyes sad because were playing god jacob we must for we know what others dont know we know what will happen if we dont proceed our way suddenly the people of a great republic dont have a president but a king the emperor of all the states of the union what they dont understand is whats behind the king those jackals in the background can only be ripped out by replacing him no other way i understand im cautious because im afraid then we must be extraordinarily careful and make certain evan kendrick never learns about us its as simple as that nothings simple objected mandel hes no fool hes going to wonder why all the attention is raining down on him varak will have to be a master scenarist each sequence logically unalterably leading to the next i wondered too admitted winters softly once again glancing at the portrait of his late wife jennie used to say to me its too easy sam everyone else is out there busting his britches to get a few lines in the newspapers and you get whole editorials praising you for things were not even sure you did its why i started asking questions how i found out what had happened not who but how and then you walked away of course why i mean really why you just answered that jacob i was outraged despite everything you might have contributed well obviously is it fair samuel to say you were not gripped by the fever to win that office again obviously whether admirable or not ive never had to win anything as averell once said fortunately or unfortunately ive not had to depend on my current job to eat that sums it up i guess the fever samuel the fever you never felt the hunger you never had must somehow grip kendrick in the final analysis he has to want to win desperately need to win the fire in the belly said the historian we all should have thought of it first but the rest of us simply assumed hed leap at the opportunity god we werecow not the rest of us protested the stockbroker holding up the palms of his hands i didnt think about it until i walked into this room an hour ago suddenly the memories came back memories of you and yourfierce independence from being the bright hope an extraordinary asset you became a morally outraged liability who walked away and made room for all the sleazeballs in and out of town youre hitting home jacob i should have stayed ive known it for years my wife in a fit of anger once called me a spoiled goody twoshoes she claimed like you i think that i could have prevented so much if i accomplished nothing else yes you could have samuel harry truman was right its the leaders who shape history there could have been no united states without thomas jefferson no third reich without adolf hitler but no man or woman becomes a leader unless he or she wants to theyve got to have a burning need to get there and you think our kendrick lacks it i suspect he does what i saw on that television screen and what i saw five days ago during the committee hearing was an incautious man who didnt give a damn whose bones he rattled because he was morally outraged brains yes courage certainly even wit and appealall of which we agreed had to be part of the ideal composite we sought but i also saw a streak of my friend samuel winters a man who could walk away from the system because he didnt have the fever in him to go after the prize is that so bad jacob not with regard to me i was never that important really but is it so healthy for all officeseekers to be on fire you dont turn over the store to parttime management not if its your major investment the people rightly expect a fulltime landlord and they sense it when the call isnt basically there aggressively there they want their moneys worth well said winters his tone mildly defensive i believe the people were not totally unimpressed with me and i wasnt burning up with fever on the other hand i didnt make too many gaffes good lord you never had the chance to your campaign was a television blitzkrieg with some of the best photography ive ever seen your handsome countenance a decided asset of course i had three or four debates you know three actually with wart hogs samuel they were buried by congenial classthe people love that they never stop searching the heavens now the television screens for that king or that prince to come along and show them the way with comforting words its a goddamned shame abraham lincoln would have been considered an awkward hick and stayed in illinois or worse said jacob mandel chuckling abraham the jew in league with the antichrists sacrificing gentile infants and when he grew the beard absolute confirmation agreed winters smiling and getting out of his chair a drink he asked knowing his friends answer and heading for the bar beneath a french tapestry on the right wall thank you the usual please of course the historian poured two drinks in silence one bourbon one canadian both with ice only he returned to their chairs and handed the bourbon to mandel all right jacob i think ive put it all together i knew you could pour and think at the same time said mandel smiling and raising his glass your health sir lchaim replied the historian so somehow some way this fever you speak of this need to win the prize must be instilled in evan kendrick without it hes not credible and without him gideons mongrelsthe opportunists and the fanaticsmove in i believe that yes winters sipped his drink his eyes straying to a goblin tapestry philip and the knights at crecy werent defeated by the english bowmen and the welsh long knives alone they had to contend with what saintsimon described three hundred years later as a court bled by the vile bourgeois corrupters your erudition is beyond me samuel how do we instil this fever in evan kendrick its so terribly important that we do i see it so clearly now i think we start with milos varak annie mulcahy oreilly was beside herself the standard four telephone lines in the congressional office were usually used for outgoing calls this particular congressman did not normally receive many incoming ones today however was not only different it was crazy in the space of twentyfour hours the smallest most underworked staff on the hill became the most frenzied annie had to call her two filing clerks who never came in on monday come on annie it ruins a decent weekend to get their bouffant heads down to the office she then contacted phillip tobias the bright if frustrated chief aide and told him to forget his tennis game and drag his promotional ass downtown or shed kill him what the hell happened you didnt see the foxley show yesterday no i was sailing why should i have he was on it what that cant happen without my approval they must have called him at home the son of a bitch never told me he didnt tell me either but i saw his name in the posts late listings jesus get me a tape annie please only if you come down and help us man the phones dearie shit im a lady you prick dont talk to me that way im sorry im sorry annie please the tape finally and only because she was desperate and only because her husband patrick xavier oreilly had mondays off because he worked the highcrime shift on saturdays she called the twotoilet irish detective and told him that if he did not come down to help out shed file a complaint against him for rapewhich was only wishful thinking she added the only person she was unable to reach was the congressman from colorados ninth district i am so very very sorry mrs oreilly said the arab husband of the couple who took care of kendricks house and who annie suspected was probably an unemployed surgeon or an exuniversity president the congressman said he would be away for a few days i have no idea where he is thats a lot of crap mr sahara you flatter me with dimensions madame that tool you reach that hornedtoad servant of the public and tell him were going apeshit down here and its all because of his appearance on the foley show he was remarkably effective was he not you know about it i saw his name in the washington posts late listings madame also in the times of new york and los angeles and the chicago tribune he gets all those papers no madame i do but hes perfectly welcome to read them glory be to god the pandemonium in the outside office had become intolerable annie slammed down the phone and ran to her door she opened it astonished to see evan kendrick and her husband shoving their way through a crowd of reporters congressional aides and various other people she did not know come in here she yelled once inside the secretarial office and with the door closed mr oreilly spoke im her paddy he said out of breath nice to meet you congressman youre my blocking back pal replied kendrick shaking hands and quickly studying the large broadshouldered redhaired man with a paunch four inches larger than his considerable height should permit and a vaguely florid face that held a pair of knowing intelligent green eyes im grateful we got here at the same time in all honesty we didnt sir my crazy lady called over an hour ago and i was able to get here in maybe twenty twentyfive minutes i saw the brouhaha in the corridor and figured you might show up i waited for ya you might have let me know you lousy mick weve been going crazy in here and be slapped with a felony charge darlin he really is twotoilet irish congressman hold it you two ordered evan glancing at the door what the hell are we going to do about this whats happened you went on the foxley show said mrs oreilly we didnt i make it a point never to watch those programmes mumbled kendrick if i do im expected to know something now a lot of people know about you you were damn good congressman added the dc detective a couple of boys in the department called and asked me to tell annie to thank youi told you annie first i havent had the chance and second with all this confusion i probably would have forgotten but i think evan that your only clean way is to go out there and make some kind of statement wait a minute interrupted kendrick looking at patrick oreilly why would anyone in the police department want to thank me the way you stood up to barrish and clobbered him i gathered that but whats barrish to them hes a pentagon hustler with friends in high places also a ballbreaker if youve spent a few sleepless nights on stakeout and instead of being thanked youre dumped on what stakeout what happened mister kendrick broke in annie thats a zoo out there youve got to show yourself say something no i want to hear this go on mrmay i call you patrick or pat paddy fits better the police officer patted his stomach thats what im called im evan drop the congressmani want to drop it completely please go on how was barrish involved with the police i didnt say that now he himself is cleaner than an irish bagpipe which actually isnt too lovely inside but hes purer than a bleached sheet in the noonday sun men in your line of work dont thank people for clobbering clean laundry well it wasnt the biggest thing that ever went down truth be told by itself it was minor but something might have come out of it if we could have followed up the boys were tracking a mozzarella known to launder cash through miami and points southeast like the cayman islands on the fourth night of the stakeout at the mayflower hotel they thought they had him you see one of those bally shoe types went to his room at one oclock in the morning with a large briefcase one oclock in the morningnot exactly the start or the shank of the business day right not exactly well it turned out that the bally shoes had legitimate investments with the mozzarella and the pentagon logs showed that hed been in a procurements conference until almost eleventhirty and further he had to catch a plane to los angeles at eight in the morning so the one oclock was explained what about the briefcase we couldnt touch it much offence was taken in high dudgeon and lots of national security was thrown around you see someone made a phone call but not to a lawyer said evan instead to one colonel robert barrish of the pentagon bingo our noses were shoved in dirt for impugning the motives of a fine loyal american who was helping to keep the great us of a strong the boys were reamed good but you think otherwise you think a lot more than legitimate investments happened in that room if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck and looks like a duck its usually a duck but not the pair of bally shoes he wasnt a duck he was a slaptailed weasel whose name was stricken from our list of ducks thanks paddy all right mrs oreilly what do i say out there whatever i suggest our boy phil tobias will probably object to you should know that hes on his way here you called off his monday morning tennis thats courage beyond the call of duty hes sweet and hes smart evan but i dont think his advice can help you now youre on your own remember those vultures out there are convinced youve been grandstanding all last weekrunning a parlay from the committee hearing to the foxley show if you had ciphered out no one would give a damn but you didnt you took on a heavyweight and made him look like a fasttalking thug and that makes you news they want to know where youre going then what do you suggest you know where im going annie what do i say ann mulcahy oreilly looked into kendricks eyes whatever you want to congressman just mean it the plaint of the swan my swan song annie only youll know that when you get out there the undisciplined uproar in the outer office was compounded by the sudden eruption of strobe flashes and the shifting blinding floodlights of the television crews swinging their lethal minicams in the crowd questions were shouted and outshouted several of the more prominent newspeople were arrogantly demanding their rights for the closest most prominent positions so the congressman from colorados ninth district simply walked to his receptionists desk moved the blotter and the telephone console aside and sat on top he smiled gamely held up both hands several times and refused to speak gradually the cacophony subsided broken now and then by a strident voice answered by the silent stare of mock surprise on the part of the shocked representative finally it was understood congressman evan kendrick was not going to open his mouth unless and until he could be heard by everyone silence descended thanks very much said evan i need all the help i can get to figure out what i want to saybefore you say what you want to say which is different because youve got it all figured out congressman kendrick shouted an abrasive television journalist obviously upset by his status in the second row is it true oh come on will you broke in evan firmly give me a break friend youre used to this im not thats not the way you came over on television sir replied the erstwhile anchorman that was onetoone as i see it this is one against the whole colosseum wanting a lions dinner let me say something first okay of course sir im glad it wasnt you last week stani think your name is stan it is congressman you would have had my head along with your brandy youre very kind sir no kidding it is a compliment isnt it yes congressman it is thats our job i respect that i wish to hell youd do it more often what one of the most respected members of my staff continued kendrick quickly explained to me that i should make a statement thats kind of awesome if youve never been asked to make a statement before you did run for office sir interrupted another television reporter very obviously moving her blonde hair into her cameras focus certainly statements were required then not if the incumbent represented our districts version of planet of the apes check it out ill stand by that now may i go on or do i simply go out ill be quite honest with you i really dont give a damn go on sir said the gentleman often referred to as stantheman a broad grin on his telegenic face okay my very valued staff member also mentioned that some of you if not all of you might be under the impression that i was grandstanding last week grandstanding as i understand the term it means calling attention to oneself by performing some basically melodramatic actwith or without substancethat rivets the attention of the crowds watchingin the grandstandson the person performing that act if that definition is accurate then i must decline the title of grandstanderif its a wordbecause im not looking for anyones approval again i really dont care the momentary shock was dispelled by the congressmans palms pressing the air in front of him im quite sincere about that ladies and gentlemen i dont expect to be around here very long do you have a health problem sir shouted a young man from the back of the room do you want to arm wrestle no i have no such problem that im aware of i was a collegiate boxing champion sir added the youthful reporter in the rear unable to contain himself amid humorous boos from the crowd sorry sir he said embarrassed dont be young fella if i had your talent id probably challenge the head of pentagon procurements and his counterpart in the kremlin and wed solve everything the oldfashioned way one challenger from each side and save the battalions but no i dont have your talent and i also have no problems of health then what did you mean asked a respected columnist from the new york times im flattered youre here said evan recognizing the man i had no idea i was worth your time i think you are and my times not that valuable where are you coming from congressman im not certain but to answer your first question im not sure i belong here as to your second question since im not sure i should be here im in the enviable position of saying what i want to say without regard to the consequencesthe political consequences i guess that is news said the acerbic stantheman writing in his notebook your statement sir thanks i think id like to get it over with like a lot of people i dont like what i see ive been away from this country for many years and maybe you have to get away to understand what weve gotif only to compare it with what others havent got theres not supposed to be an oligarchy running this government and yet it seems to me that one has moved in i cant put my finger on it or them but theyre there i know it so do you they want to escalate always escalate always pointing to an adversary who himself has escalated to the top of his economic and technological ladder where the hell do we stop where do they stop when do we stop giving our children nightmares because all they hear is the goddamned promise of annihilation when do their kids stop hearing it or do we just keep going up in this elevator designed in hell until we cant come down any longer which wont make much difference anyway because all the streets outside will be in flames forgive me i know its not fair but i suddenly dont want any more questions im going back to the mountains evan kendrick got off the desk and walked swiftly through the stunned crowd to his office door he opened it quickening his steps and disappeared into the hallway hes not going to the mountains whispered patrick xavier oreilly to his wife that lad is staying right here in this town oh shussh cried annie tears in her eyes hes just cut himself off from the entire hill maybe the hill lass but not from us hes put his nottoodelicate finger on it they all make the money and were scared shitless watch him annie care for him hes a voice we want to hear the icarus agenda chapter kendrick wandered the hot torpid streets of washington his shirt open his jacket slung over his shoulder not having any idea where he was going only to clear his head by putting one foot ahead of the other in aimless sequence more often than he cared to count he had been stopped by strangers whose comments were pretty equally divided but slightly weighted in his favour a fact he was not sure he liked hell of a job you did on that doubletalking prick senator im not a senator im a congressman thank you i guess who do you think you are congressman whateveryourname is trying to trip up a fine loyal american like colonel barrish goddamned leftwing bachelorfairy can i sell you some perfume the colonel bought some disgusting hey man i dig your mtv you move good and you sing in a high register that mother would send all the brothers back to nam for raw meat i dont think he would soldier theres no discrimination in him were all raw meat because youre clever doesnt make you right sir and because he was trickedadmittedly by his own wordsdoesnt make him wrong hes a man committed to the strength of our nation and you obviously are not i think im committed to reason sir that doesnt exclude our countrys strength at least i would hope not i saw no evidence of that sorry its there thank you congressman for saying what so many of us are thinking why dont you say it im not sure everywhere you turn someones shouting at us to stand tough i was a kid at bastogne in the bulge and nobody had to tell me to be tough i was toughand damned scared too it just happened i wanted to live but things are different now its not men against men or even guns and planes its machines flying through the air punching big holes in the earth you cant aim at them you cant stop them all you can do is wait i wish youd been at the hearing you just said it better than i ever could with better credentials he really did not want to talk any more he was talked out and strangers in the streets were not helping him find the solitude he needed he had to think sort things out for himself decide what to do and decide quickly if only to put the decision behind him he had accepted the partridge committee assignment for a specific reason he wanted a voice in his districts selection of the man who would succeed him and his aide phil tobias had persuaded him that accepting partridges summons would guarantee him a voice but what evan wondered was did he really give a damn to a degree he had to admit that he did but not because of any territorial claim he had walked into a minor political arena an angry man with his eyes open could he simply close up shop because he was irritated by a brief flurry of public exposure he did not wear a badge of morality on his lapel but there was something inherently distasteful to him about someone who gave a commitment and walked away from it because of personal inconvenience on the other hand in the words of another era he had thrown out the rascals who had been taking colorados ninth district to the cleaners he had done what he wanted to do what more could the voters of his constituency want from him he had awakened them at least he thought he had and had spared neither words nor money in trying to do so think he really had to think he would probably keep the colorado property for some future time as yet unconsidered he was fortyone in nineteen years he would be sixty what the hell did that matter it did matter he was heading back to southwest asia to the jobs and the people he knew best how to work with but like manny he was not going to live out his last years or with luck a decade or two in those surroundings manny emmanuel weingrass genius brilliance personified autocrat renegade totally impossible human beingyet the only father he had ever known he never knew his own father that faraway man had died building a bridge in nepal leaving a humorously cynical wife who claimed that having married an outrageously young captain in the army corps of engineers during the second world war she had fewer episodes of connubial bliss than catherine of aragon hey yelled a rotund man who had just walked out of the small canopied door of a bar on sixteenth street i just seen you you were on tv sittin on a desk it was that allday news programme boring i dont know what the hell you said but some bums clapped and some other bums gave you raspberries it was you you must be mistaken said kendrick hurrying down the pavement good lord he thought the cable news people had rushed to air the impromptu press conference in short order he had left his office barely an hour and a half ago someone was in a hurry he knew that cable needed constant material but with all the news floating around washington why him in truth what bothered him was an observation made by young tobias during evans early days on the hill cables an incubating process congressman and we can capitalize on it the networks may not consider you important enough to cover but they scan cables snippets all the time for whats offbeat the unusualtheir own fill we can create situations where the cboys will take the bait and in my opinion mr kendrick your looks and your somewhat oblique observations then lets never make the mistake mr tobias of ever calling the cboys okay the interruption had deflated the aide who was only partially mollified by evans promise that the next inhabitant of his office would be far more cooperative he had meant it he meant it now but he worried that it might be too late he headed back to the madison hotel only a block or so away where he had spent sunday nightspent it there because he had had the presence of mind to call his house in virginia to learn whether his appearance on the foxley show had created any interruptions at home only if one wishes to make a telephone call evan dr sabri hassan had replied in arabic the language they both spoke for convenience as well as for other reasons it never stops ringing then ill stay in town i dont know where yet but ill let you know why bother sabri had asked you probably wont be able to get through anyway im surprised that you did now well in case manny calls why not call him yourself and tell him where you are so i will not have to lie the journalists in this city cannot wait for an arab to lie they pounce upon us the israelis can say that white is black or sweet is sour and their lobby convinces congress its for your own good it is not so with us cut it out sabri we must leave you evan were no good to you we will be no good to you what the hell are you talking about kashi and i watched the programme this morning you were most effective my friend well talk about it later he had spent the afternoon watching baseball and drinking whisky at sixthirty he had turned on the news one network after another only to see himself in brief segments from the foxley show in disgust he had switched to an arts channel that showed a film depicting the mating habits of whales off the coast of tierra del fuego he was amazed he fell asleep today instinct told him to keep his room key so he rushed through the madisons lobby to the elevators once inside the room he removed his clothes down to his shorts and lay on the bed and whether it was a symptom of a repressed ego or sheer curiosity he turned on the remote control unit and switched the channel to cable news seven minutes later he saw himself walking out of his office ladies and gentlemen you have just seen one of the most unusual press conferences this reporter has ever attended not only unusual but unusually onesided this fastterm representative from colorado has raised issues of obvious national importance but refuses to be questioned as to his conclusions he simply walks away on his behalf it should be said that he denies grandstanding because he apparently is not sure he intends to remain in washingtonwhich we assume means governmentnevertheless his statements were provocative to say the least the videotape suddenly stopped replaced by the live face of an anchorwoman we switch now to the department of defense where we understand that an under secretary in charge of strategic deterrence has a prepared statement its yours steve another face this a darkhaired bluntfeatured reporter with too many teeth who peered into a camera and whispered under secretary jasper hefflefinger who manages to be hauled out whenever someone attacks the pentagon has rushed into the breach opened by congressmanwhohenry of wyomingwhatcolorado here is under secretary hefflefinger another face a jowled but handsome man a strong face with a shock of silver hair that demanded attention and with a voice that would be envied by the most prominent radio announcers of the late thirties and forties i say to the congressman that we welcome his comments we want the same thing sir the avoidance of catastrophe the pursuit of liberty and freedom he went on and on saying everything but also saying nothing never once addressing the issues of escalation and containment why me shouted kendrick to himself why me to hell with it with everything he shut off the television set reached for the phone and called colorado hi manny he said hearing weingrasss abrupt hello boy are you something yelled the old man into the phone i brought you up right after all stow it manny i want out of this shit you want what did you see yourself on tv thats why i want out forget the glassedin steam bath and the gazebo down by the streams well do it later lets you and i head back to the emiratesby way of paris naturallymaybe a couple of months in paris if you like okay not okay you meshuga clown you got something to say you say it i taught you alwayswhether we lost a contract or notto say what you believed was right okay okay maybe we fudged a little on time but we delivered and we never charged for extensions even when we had to pay manny that has nothing to do with whats going on here its got everything youre building something and speaking of building guess what my boy what ive started the terrace steam bath and ive handed over the plans for the gazebo down by the streams nobody interrupts emmanuel weingrass until his designs are completed to his satisfaction manny youre impossible i may have heard that before milos varak walked down a gravelled path in rock creek park towards a bench that overlooked a ravine where offshoot waters of the potomac rushed below it was a remote peaceful area away from the concrete pavements above favoured by the summer tourists wishing to get away from the heat and hustle of the streets as the czech expected the speaker of the house of representatives was already there sitting on the bench his thatch of white hair concealed by an irish walking cap the visor half over his face his long painfully thin frame covered by an unnecessary raincoat in the sweltering humidity of an august afternoon in washington the speaker wanted no one to notice him it was not his normal proclivity varak approached and spoke mr speaker im honoured to meet you sir son of a bitch you are a foreigner the gaunt face with the dark eyes and arched white brows was an angry face angry and yet defensive the latter trait obviously repulsive to him if youre some fucking communist errand boy you can pack it in right now ivan im not running for another term im out finished kaput come january and what happened thirty or forty years ago doesnt mean doodlely shit you read me bom youve had an outstanding career and have been a positive force for your country siralso my country now as to my being a russian or an agent from the eastern bloc ive fought both for the past ten years as a number of people in this government know the graniteeyed politician studied varak you wouldnt have the guts or the stupidity to say that to me unless you could back it up he intoned in the pungent accent of a northern new englander still you threatened me only to get your attention to persuade you to see me may i sit down sit said the speaker as if addressing a dog he expected to obey him varak did so maintaining ample space between them what do you know about the events that may or may not have taken place some time back in the fifties it was march to be exact replied the czech on that day a male child was born in belfasts lady of mercy hospital to a young woman who had emigrated to america several years before she had returned to ireland her explanation indeed a sad one her husband had died and in her bereavement she wanted to have their child at home among her family his gaze cold and unflinching the speaker said so i think you know sir there was no husband over here but there was a man who must have loved her very much a rising young politician trapped in an unhappy marriage from which he could not escape because of the laws of the church and his constituents blind adherence to them for years this man who was also an attorney sent money to the woman and visited her and the child in ireland as often as he could as an american uncle of course you can prove who these people were interrupted the ageing speaker curtly not hearsay or rumour or questionable eyewitness identification but written proof i can with what how letters were exchanged liar snapped the septuagenarian she burned every damned one before she died im afraid she burned all but one said varak softly i believe she had every intention of destroying it too but death came earlier than she expected her husband found it buried under several articles in her bedside table of course he doesnt know who e is nor does he want to know hes only grateful that his wife declined your offer and stayed with him these past twenty years the old man turned away the hint of tears welling in his eyes sniffed away in selfdiscipline my wife had left me then he said barely audible our daughter and son were in college and there was no reason to keep up the rotten pretence any longer things had changed outlooks changed and i was as secure as a kennedy in boston even the ladidas in the archdiocese kept their mouths shutcourse i let a few of those sanctimonious bastards know that if there was any church interference during the election id encourage the black radicals and the jews to raise hell in the house over their holy taxexempt status the bishop damn near threw up in apoplexy screaming all kinds of damnation at me for setting a hellfire public example but i settled his hash i told him my departing wife had probably slept with him too the whitehaired speaker with the deeply lined face fell silent mother of god he cried to himself the tears now apparent i wanted that girl back im sure youre not referring to your wife you know exactly whom i mean mr noname but she couldnt do it a decent man had given her a home and our son a name for nearly fifteen years she couldnt leave himeven for me ill tell you the truth i kept her last letter too both letters were our last to each other well be joined in the hereafter heaven she wrote me but no further on this earth my darling what kind of crap was that we could have had a life a goddamned good part of life if i may sir i think it was the expression of a loving woman who had as much respect for you as she did for herself and her son you had children of your own and explanations from the past can destroy the future you had a future mr speaker i would have chucked it all in she couldnt let you do that any more than she could destroy the man who had given her and the child a home and a name the old man pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his eyes his voice suddenly reverting to its harsh delivery how the hell do you know about all this it wasnt difficult youre the leader of the house of representatives the second in line for the presidency and i wanted to know more about you forgive me but older people speak more freely than younger onesmuch of it is due to their unrecognized sense of importance where socalled secrets are concernedand of course i knew that you and your wife both catholics had been divorced considering your political stature at the time and the power of your church that had to be a momentous decision hell i cant fault you there so you looked for the older people who were around at the time i found them i learned that your wife the daughter of a wealthy real estate developer who wanted political influence and literally financed your early campaigns had a less than enviable reputation before and after mr noname only i was the last to find out but you did find out said varak firmly and in your anger and embarrassment you sought other companionship at the time you were convinced you couldnt do anything about your marriage so you looked for surrogate comfort is that what its called i looked for someone who could be mine and you found her in a hospital where you went to give blood during a campaign she was a certified nurse from ireland who was studying for her registry in the united states how the hell old people talk pee wee mangecavallo whispered the speaker his eyes suddenly bright as if the memory brought back a rush of happiness he had a little italian place a bar with good sicilian food about four blocks from the hospital no one ever bothered me therei dont think they knew who i was that guinea bastard he remembered mr mangecavallo is over ninety now but he does indeed remember you would take your lovely nurse there and he would close up his bar at one oclock in the morning and leave you both inside asking only that you kept the tarantellas on the jukebox really quiet a beautiful person with an extraordinary memory for one of his age but without im afraid the control he had as a younger man he reminisces at length rambles actually saying things over his chianti that perhaps he would never have said even a few years ago at his age hes entitled and you did confide in him mr speaker interrupted varak no not really disagreed the old politician but pee wee put things together it wasnt hard after she left for ireland i used to go back there for a couple of years quite frequently id drink more than i usually did because nobody like i said knew me or gave a damn and pee wee always got me home without incident as they say i guess maybe i talked too much you went back to mr mangecavallos establishment when she married oh yes that i did i remember it as if it were yesterdayremember going inside no memory at all of coming out mr mangecavallo is quite lucid about that day names a country a city a dateof severance you called it i went to ireland the speaker snapped his head towards varak his unblinking eyes angry and questioning what do you want from me its all over all in the past and you cant hurt me what do you want nothing that you would ever regret or be ashamed of sir the most stringent background examination could be made and you could only applaud my clients recommendation your clients recommendation some kind of house assignment yes sir the horseshit aside why would i agree to whatever the hell youre talking about because of a detail in ireland you are not aware of whats that youve heard of the killer who calls himself tammy osheary the provisional wing commander of the irish republican army a pig a blot on every irish clans escutcheon hes your son a week had passed and for kendrick it was further proof of the quick passage of fame in washington the partridge committees televised hearings were suspended at the request of the pentagon who issued dual statements that it was revising certain financial indepth records as well as the fact that colonel robert barrish had been promoted to brigadier general and posted to the island of guam to oversee that most vital outpost of freedom one joseph smith of cedar street in clinton new jersey whose father had been with the th in guam roared with laughter as he poked his wifes left breast in front of the television screen hes been hosed babe and that whatshisface did it hes my buddy but as all brief periods of euphoria must come to an abrupt end so did the temporary relief felt by the representative of the ninth congressional district of colorado jesus christ yelled phil tobias chief aide to the congressman as he held his hand over the telephone its the speaker of the house himself no aide no secretary but him maybe you should let the other himself know about it said annie oreilly he called on your line not mine dont talk sweetie just push the button and announce its out of your league but it isnt right his people should have called me do it tobias did it kendrick yes mr speaker you got a few minutes to spare asked the new englander the wordspare emerging asspayyah well of course mr speaker if you think its important i wouldnt call a shithead freshman direct if i didnt think it was important then i can only hope that a shithead speaker has a vital issue to discuss replied kendrick if he doesnt ill charge my hourly consultation rate to his state is that understood mr speaker i like your style boy were on different sides but i like your style you may not when im in your office i like that even better astonished kendrick stood in front of the desk staring in silence at the evasive eyes of the gauntfaced whitehaired speaker of the house the old irishman had just made an extraordinary statement which should have been at the very least a proposal but was instead a bombshell in evans path of retreat from washington dc the subcommittee on oversight and evaluation said kendrick in quiet anger of intelligence thats it answered the speaker glancing down at his papers how dare you you cant do that its done your appointments announced without my consent i dont need it i dont say you had the clearest sailing with your own party leadersyoure not the most popular fella on your side of the fencebut with a little persuasion they agreed youre kind of a symbol of independent bipartisanship symbol what symbol im no symbol you got a tape of the foxley show its nonhistory its forgotten or that little rhubarb you pulled in your office the next morning that fella from the new york times did a hell of a column on you made you out like some kind ofhat was it i reread it yesterdaya reasoned voice among the babel of mad crows all that was weeks ago and nobodys mentioned anything of substance since then ive faded you just sprang back to full flower i refuse the appointment i dont care to be burdened by secrets involving national security im not staying in government and i consider it an untenable position to be placed ina dangerous situation to put it bluntly you publicly refuse and your party will wash you out of its hairpublicly theyll call you a few names like a rich mistake and irresponsible and revive that jackass you buried with your money he and his little machine are missed around here the speaker paused chuckling they beavered away for everybody with nice little perks like private jets and fancy suites from hawaii to the south of france owned by the mining boys didnt make a damn bit of difference what party you were with they just wanted a few addendums on legislationcouldnt care less where they come from hell congressman you refuse you could be doing all of us a favour you really are a shithead mr speaker im pragmatic son but youve done so many decent things they came from being practical interrupted the old pol they dont get done with buckets of vinegar they go down easier with pitchers of warm syrup like sweet vermont syrup get my drift do you realize that with one statement you just condoned political corruption the hell i did i just condoned the acceptance of minor greed as part of the human condition in exchange for major legislation that helps the people who really need it i got those things through shithead by blinking my eyes to incidental indulgences when those who got em knew my eyes werent closed you rich son of a bitch you wouldnt understand sure we got a few millionaires around here but most arent they live on yearly salaries that youd piss away in a month they leave office because they cant put their two or three kids through college on what they make forget vacations so youre goddamned right i blink all right shouted kendrick i can understand that but what i cant understand is your appointing me to oversight theres nothing in my background that qualifies me for such an assignment i could name thirty or forty others who know a lot more than i dowhich isnt hard because i dont know anything they follow these things they love being on the inside of that dumb businessi repeat i think its a dumb business call on one of them theyre all salivating at the chance that kind of appetite isnt what were lookin for son said the speaker in his now heavily pronounced down home down east accent that belied decades of sophisticated political negotiations in the nations capital good healthy scepticism like what you showed that doubletalking colonel on the foxley show thats the ticket youll make a real contribution youre wrong mr speaker because i have nothing to contribute not even the slightest interest barrish was using and abusing generalities arrogantly refusing to talk straight only talk down it was entirely different i repeat i have no interest in oversight well now my young friend interests change with conditions like in the banks somethin happens and the rates go up or down accordingly and some of us are more familiar than others with certain troubled areas of the worldyou certainly qualify in that regard as that beautiful book says talents buried in the ground dont do anybody a cow dungs worth of good but if theyre brought up into the light they can flourish like your new flowering if youre referring to the time i spent in the arab emirates please remember i was a construction engineer whose only concerns were jobs and profits is that so the average tourist knew more about the politics and cultures of those countries than i did all of us in construction kept pretty much to ourselves we had our own circles and rarely stepped outside them i find that hard to believedamn near impossible in fact i got the congressional background report on you young fella and i tell ya it blew my good new england socks off here you are right here in washington and you built airfields and government buildings for the arabs which certainly means you had to have a hell of a lot of conversations with the high muckymucks over there i mean airfields thats military intelligence son then i learn you speak several arab languages not one but several its one language the rest are simply dialects i tell you youre invaluable and its no less than your patriotic duty to serve your country by sharing what you know with other experts im not an expert besides broke in the speaker leaning back in his chair his expression pensive under the circumstances what with your background and all if you refused the appointment itd look like you had somethin to hide somethin maybe we ought to look into you got somethin to hide congressman the speakers eyes were suddenly levelled at evan something to hide he had everything to hide why did the speaker look at him like that no one knew about oman about masqat and bahrain no one would ever know that was the agreement theres not a damn thing to hide but theres everything to let hang out said kendrick firmly youd be doing the subcommittee a disservice based on a misplaced appraisal of my credentials do yourself a favour call one of the others the beautiful book that most holy of books has so many answers doesnt it asked the speaker aimlessly his eyes once again straying many might be called but few are chosen isnt that right oh for gods sake that might well be the case young fella broke in the old irishman nodding his head only time will tell wont it meanwhile the congressional leadership of your party has decided that youre chosen so youre chosenunless youve got something to hide something we ought to look into now skedaddle ive got work to do skedaddle get the fuck out of here kendrick the icarus agenda chapter the two bodies of congress the senate and the house have several committees of matching purpose with similar or nearly similar names there is senate appropriations and house appropriations the senate foreign relations and the house foreign affairs the senate select committee on intelligence and the house permanent select committee on intelligence this last with a powerful subcommittee on oversight and evaluation this counterpartism is one more example of the republics effective system of checks and balances the legislative branch of government actively reflecting the current views of a far wider spectrum of the body politic than either an entrenched executive branch or the lifetenured judiciary must negotiate within itself and reach a consensus on each of the hundredfold issues presented to its two deliberative arms the process is patently frustrating patently exasperating and generally fair if compromise is the art of governance within a pluralistic society no one does it better or with more aggravation than the legislative branch of the united states government with its innumerable often insufferable and frequently ridiculous committees this assessment is accurate a pluralistic society is indeed numerous usually insufferable to wouldbe tyrants and almost always ridiculous in the eyes of those who would impose their will on the citizenry one mans morality should never by way of ideology become anothers legality as many in the executive and the judiciary would have it more often than not these quasizealots grudgingly retreat in the face of the uproars emanating from those lowerclass troublesome committees on the hill despite infrequent and unforgivable aberrations the vox populi is usually heard and the land is better for it but there are some committees on capitol hill where voices are muted by logic and necessity these are the small restricted councils that concentrate on the strategies formed by the various intelligence agencies within the government and perhaps because the voices are essentially quiet and the members of these committees are examined in depth by stringent security procedures a certain aura descends over those selected to the select committees they know things others are not privileged to know they are different conceivably a better breed of men and women there also exists a tacit understanding between the congress and the media for the latter to restrain themselves in areas concerning these committees a senator or a congressman is appointed but his or her appointment does not become a cause celebre yet neither is there secrecy the appointment is made and a basic reason given both the act and reason stated simply without embellishment in the case of the representative from the ninth district of colorado one congressman evan kendrick it was put forth that he was a construction engineer with extensive experience in the middle east especially the persian gulf since few knew little or anything about the area and it was accepted that the congressman had been an executive employed somewhere in the mediterranean years ago the appointment was considered reasonable and nothing unusual was made of it however editors commentators and politicians are keenly aware of the nuances of growing recognition for recognition accompanies power in the district of columbia there are committees and then again there are committees a person appointed to indian affairs is not in the same league with another sent to ways and meansthe first does the minimum to look after a discarded basically disenfranchised people the latter explores the methods and procedures to pay for the entire government to stay in business nor is environment on a par with armed servicesthe formers budgets are continuously abusively reduced while the expenditure on weaponry reaches beyond all horizons the allocation of moneys is the mothers milk of influence yet simply put few committees on the hill can match the nimbus the quiet mystique that hovers over those associated with the clandestine world of intelligence when sudden appointments are made to these select councils eyes watch colleagues whisper in cloakrooms and the media is poised at the ready in front of word processors microphones and cameras usually nothing comes of these preparations and the names fade into comfortable or uncomfortable oblivion but not always and had evan kendrick been aware of the subtleties he might have risked telling the crafty speaker of the house to go to hell however he was not aware and it would not have made any difference if he had been the progress of inver brass was not to be denied it was sixthirty in the morning a monday morning the early sun about to break over the virginia hills as kendrick naked plunged into his pool trusting that ten or twenty laps in the cold october water would remove the cobwebs obscuring his vision and painfully spreading through his temples ten hours ago he had been drinking far too many brandies with emmanuel weingrass in colorado while sitting in a ridiculously opulent gazebo both laughing at the visible streams rushing below the glass floor soon you will see whales manny had exclaimed like you promised the kids in that half driedup river wherever it was we had lousy bait i should have used one of the mothers that black girl she was gorgeous her husband was a major a big major in the army engineers he might have objected their daughter was a beautiful child she was killed with all the others oh christ manny why its time for you to go i dont want to go you must you have a meeting in the morning already two hours ahead of us i can skip it ive skipped one or two others one and at great harm to my wellbeing your jet is waiting at the airfield in mesa verde youll be in washington in four hours as he swam through the water each length faster than the last he thought of oversights morning conference admitting to himself that he was glad manny had insisted he return to the capital the subcommittees meetings had fascinated himfascinated him angered him astonished him appalled him but most of all fascinated him there were so many things going on in the world that he knew nothing about both for and against the interests of the united states but it wasnt until his third meeting that he understood a recurring error in his colleagues approach to the witnesses from the various intelligence branches the mistake was that they would look for flaws in the witnesses arguments for carrying out certain operations when what they should have been questioning were the operations themselves it was understandable for the men who were paraded in front of oversight to plead their casesexclusively men which should have been a cluewere softspoken professionals from a violent clandestine world who played down the melodrama associated with that world they delivered their esoteric jargon quietly swelling the heads of those listening it was heady stuff to be a part of that global underground even in a consulting capacity it fed the adolescent fantasies of mature adults there were no colonel robert barrishes among these witnesses instead they were a stream of attractive welldressed consistently modest and moderate men who appeared before the subcommittee to explain in coldly professional terms what they could accomplish if moneys were provided and why it was imperative for the nations security that it be done more often than not the question was can you do it not whether it was right or even if it made sense these lapses of judgment occurred often enough to disturb the congressman from colorado who had briefly been part of that savage violent world the witnesses dealt with he could not romanticize it he loathed it the terrible breathless fear that was part of the terrifying game of taking and losing human life in shadows belonged to some dark age where life itself was measured solely by survival one did not live in that kind of world one endured it with sweat and with hollow pains in the stomach as evan had endured his abrupt exposure to it yet he knew that world went on inhabitants of it had saved him from the sharks of qatar nevertheless during the coming sessions he probed asking harsher and harsher questions he understood that his name was being quietly electrically emphatically bounced around the halls of congress the central intelligence agency even the white house who was this agitator this troublemaker he did not give a damn they were legitimate questions and he would ask them who the hell was sacrosanct who was beyond the laws there was a commotion above him wild gestures and shouts he dimly perceived through the water rushing past his face in the pool he stopped at midlength and shook his head while treading water the intruder was sabri but it was a sabri hassan he rarely saw the ever calm middleaged phd from dubai was beside himself fiercely trying to control his actions and his words but only barely succeeding you must leave he shouted as evan cleared his ears of water what what oman masqat the story is on all the channels all the stations there are even photographs of you dressed as one of usin masqat both the radio and the television keep interrupting programmes to report the latest developments it was just released within the past few minutes newspapers are holding up their late morning editions for further details jesus christ roared kendrick leaping out of the pool as sabri threw a towel around him the reporters and the rest of those people will undoubtedly be here in a matter of minutes said the arab i took the phone off the hook and kashi is loading our carforgive me the car you most generously provided us forget that stuff yelled evan starting towards the house whats your wife doing with the car putting in your clothes enough for several days if necessary your own car might be recognized ours is always in the garage i assumed you wanted some time to think some time to plan a couple of murders agreed evan dashing through the patio door and up the back staircase dr hassan following closely how the hell did it happen goddamn it i fear its only the beginning my friend what asked kendrick racing into the huge master bedroom overlooking the pool and going to his bureau where he hurriedly opened drawers whipping out socks underwear and a shirt the stations are calling all manner of people for their comments theyre most laudatory of course what else could they say said evan putting on his socks and shorts while sabri unfolded his laundered shirt and handed it to him that they were all rooting for their terrorist buddies in palestine kendrick put on the shirt and ran to his closet yanking out a pair of trousers sabris wife kashi walked through the door anahdsfa she exclaimed asking to be pardoned and turning away no time for eltakaled kashi cried the congressman telling her to forget her traditions how are you doing with the clothes they might not be your choices dear evan but they will cover you replied the sweetfaced anxious wife it also occurred to me that you could call us from wherever you are and i can bring things to you many people on the newspapers know my husband but none know me i am never in evidence your choice not mine said kendrick putting on a jacket and returning to the bureau for his wallet money clip and lighter we may be closing up this place kashi and heading out to colorado out there you can be my official hostess oh thats foolish dear evan giggled mrs hassan its not proper youre the professor sabri added kendrick rapidly running a comb through his hair when are you going to teach her when will she listen our women must have advantages we men know nothing about lets go the keys are in the car dear evan thanks kashi said kendrick going out the door and down the staircase with sabri tell me continued evan as both men crossed through the portico into the large garage that housed his mercedes convertible and hassans cimarron cadillac how much of the story do they have i can only compare what ive heard with what emmanuel told me for you have said literally nothing its not that i wanted to keep anything from you please evan interrupted the professor how long have i known you you are uncomfortable praising yourself even indirectly praise hell exclaimed kendrick opening the garage door i blew it i was a dead man with a bleeding pig strapped to my back about to be dropped over the shoals of qatar others did it not me they saved my overachieving ass without you they could have done nothing forget it said evan standing by the door of the cadillac how much have they learned in my opinion very little not an iota of what emmanuel told me even discounting his natural exaggerations the journalists are scratching for details and apparently those details are not forthcoming that doesnt tell me much why did you say it was only the beginning when we left the pool because of a man who was interviewedroused willingly out of his house obviouslya colleague of yours on the house intelligence subcommittee a congressman named mason mason said kendrick frowning hes got a big profile in tulsa or phoenixi forget whichbut hes a zero a few weeks ago there was a quiet movement to get him off the committee thats hardly the way he was presented evan im sure it wasnt what did he say that you were the most astute member of the committee you were the brilliant one whom everyone looked up to and listened to bullshit i talked some and asked a few questions but never that much and in the second place i dont think mason and i ever said more than hello to each other its bullshit its also all over the country the sound of one then two cars screeching to a stop in front of the house broke through the silence of the enclosed garage good christ whispered evan im cornered not yet said dr hassan kashi knows what to do she will admit the early arrivals speaking hebrew incidentally and usher them into the solarium she will pretend not to understand them and thus will stall themfor only a few minutes of course go evan take the pasture road south until you reach the highway in an hour ill replace the phone call us kashi will bring you whatever you need kendrick kept dialling repeatedly punching the button down with each repeated busy signal until finally to his relief he heard the sound of a ring congressman kendricks residence its me sabri now i am truly astonished you got through im also delighted for i can once again take the telephone off the hook how are things going calamitously my friend also at your office and at your home in colorado all are under siege how do you know here no one will leave and like you emmanuel finally reached us with a great deal of profanity he claimed to have been trying for nearly half an hour ive got ten minutes on him what did he say the house is surrounded crowds everywhere apparently the newspaper and television people all flew into mesa verde where most were stranded as three taxis could hardly accommodate such numbers all this must blow mannys mind what blows his mind as you phrase it is the lack of sanitary facilities what he refused to offer them and then observed acts of necessity on all sides of the house that caused him to rush to your shotgun rack oh my god theyre pissing all over the lawnhis landscaping ive heard emmanuels tirades many times in the past but never anything like this during his outburst however he did manage to tell me to call mrs oreilly at your office as she was not able to get through here what did annie say for you to stay out of sight for a while butin her wordsfor gods sake call her i dont think so said evan thoughtfully the less she knows the better at this point where are you asked the professor at a motel outside woodbridge off route ninetyfive its called the three bears and im in cabin its the last one on the left nearest the woods by which description i assume you need things food no doubt you cannot go outside and be seen and there cant be room service at a motel with cabins no not food i stopped at a diner on the way down no one recognized you there were cartoons on the television set then what do you need wait until the late editions of the morning papers come out and send jim the gardener into washington to pick up as many different ones as he can lay his hands on especially the majors theyll have their best people on the story and theyll reach other people ill make out a list for him then kashi will bring them to you it was not until onethirty in the afternoon that sabris wife arrived at the motel in woodbridge virginia evan opened the door of cabin grateful to see that she had driven the gardeners pickup truck he had not thought of the diversion but his two friends from dubai had known better than to drive his mercedes past the crowds around his house while kendrick held the door kashi made rapid second and third trips back to the vehicle for along with the pile of newspapers from all over the country she brought food there were sandwiches encased in plastic wrap two quarts of milk in an ice bucket four hot plates equally divided between western and arab dishes and a bottle of canadian whisky kashi im not going to be here for a week said kendrick this is for today and tonight dear evan you are under a great deal of stress and must eat the box on the table has silverware and metal stands under which you place the sterno solid fuel for heat there are also place mats and linen but if i may if you must leave here abruptly please call so i may retrieve the silverware and the linen why will the quartermaster throw us in the brig i am the quartermaster dear evan thanks kashi you look tired ya sahbee you have not rested no ive been watching that damned television and the more i watch the angrier i get rests hard to come by when youre furious as my husband says and i agree with him you are very effective on television he also says we must leave you why he said that to me several weeks ago and i dont know why of course you do we are arabs and you are in a city that distrusts us you are in a political arena now that does not tolerate us and we will not bring harm to you kashi this isnt my arena im getting out im sick of it you say this is a city that doesnt trust you why should you be any different this town doesnt trust anybody its a city of liars and shills and phonies men and women wholl climb over any back with their cleats on to get a little closer to the honey theyre messing around with a damn good system sucking the blood out of every vein they can tap proclaiming the patriotic holiness of their causes while the country sits by and applauds what it doesnt know its paying for thats not for me kashi im out youre upset tell me about it kendrick rushed to the bed and the pile of newspapers dear evan broke in the arab wife as firmly as kendrick had ever heard her speak he turned several papers in his hands those articles will offend you she continued her dark eyes levelled at his and to speak truthfully there were parts that offended sabri and myself i see said kendrick quietly studying her all arabs are terrorists im sure its here in very bold print very pointedly yes but thats not your point no i said you would be offended but the word is not strong enough you will be incensed but before you do anything you cannot take back please listen to me for gods sake what is it kashi thanks to you my husband and i have attended numerous sessions of your senate and your house of representatives also because of you weve been privileged to witness legal arguments before the justices of your supreme court theyre not all exclusively mine so what we saw and heard was remarkable issues of state even laws openly debated not by simple petitioners but by learned men you see the bad side the evil side and no doubt what you say has truth but isnt there another truth weve watched many impassioned men and women stand up for what they believe without fear of being shunned or silenced shunned they can be not silenced ever still they do take risks for their causes often profound risks hell yes they go public for their beliefs yes kendrick let the word evaporate into the air kashi hassans point was clear it was also a warning to him in his moment of selfconsuming fury then there are good people in what you called a pretty damn good system please remember that evan please do not diminish them dont what i express myself poorly forgive me i must go kashi walked rapidly to the door then turned i beg you ya sahbee if in your anger you feel you must do something drastic in the name of allah call my husband first or if you wish emmanuel however without prejudice for i love our jewish brother as i love you but my husband might be somewhat more composed you can count on it kashi went out the door and kendrick literally pounced on the newspapers turning each over on the bed their front pages in succeeding rows the headlines visible if a primal scream could have lessened the pain his voice would have shattered the glass of the suffocating cabins windows new york times new york tuesday october congressman evan kendrick of colorado said to have been instrumental in oman crisis outwitted arab terrorists secret memorandum indicates washington post washington dc tuesday october kendrick of colorado revealed as us secret weapon in oman tracked down arab terrorists connection los angeles times los angeles tuesday october declassified records show kendrick colorado rep key to oman solution palestinian terrorists had arab backing still classified chicago tribune chicago tuesday october capitalist kendrick cut shackles off hostages held by communist terrorists killer arabs everywhere in disarray over revelations new york post new york tuesday october evan the mensch of oman stuck it to the arabs move in jerusalem to make him honorary citizen of israel new york demands a parade usa today wednesday october commando kendrick did it arab terrorists want his head we want a statue kendrick stood over the bed his downcast eyes shifting rapidly from one blacklettered headline to another his mind drained of all thought but a single question why and as the answer eluded him another question gradually came into focus who the icarus agenda chapter if there was an answer to either question neither would be found in the newspapers they were packed with authoritative and highly placed and even confidential sources most countered by no comment and we have nothing to say at this time and the events in question are being analysed all of which were evasive statements of confirmation what had started the furore was a maximumclassified interdivision memorandum under the letterhead of the department of state it had surfaced unsigned from buried files and was presumably leaked by an employee or employees who felt a great injustice had been done to a man under the unreasonable strictures of national security paranoid fear of terrorist reprisals undoubtedly heading the list copies of the memorandum had been sent out in concert to the newspapers wire services and tv networks all arriving between and am eastern daylight time accompanying each memorandum were three different photographs of the congressman in masqat deniabihty denied it was planned thought evan the timing was chosen to startle the nation as it woke up across the country bulletins mandatory throughout the day why what was remarkable were the facts revealedas remarkable for what they omitted as for those they paraded they were astonishingly accurate down to such points as his having been flown to oman under deep cover and spirited out of the airport in masqat by intelligence agents who had provided him with arab garments and even the skindarkening gel that made his features compatible with the area of operations christ area of operations there were sketchy often hypothesized details of contacts he made with men he had known in the past the names scissored outblack spaces in the memorandum for obvious reasons there was a paragraph dealing with his voluntary internment in a terrorist compound where he nearly lost his life but where he learned the names he had to know in order to trace the men behind the palestinian fanatics at the embassy specifically one namename scissored out a black space in the copy he had tracked down that manscissored out a black spaceand forced him to dismantle the terrorist cadre occupying the embassy in masqat that pivotal man was shotdetails scissored out a black paragraph and evan kendrick representative from the ninth district of colorado was returned under protective cover to the united states experts had been summoned to examine the photographs each print was subjected to spectrographic analysis for authenticity with respect to the age of the negative and the possibility of laboratory alterations everything was confirmed even down to the day and the date extracted from x magnification of a newspaper carried by a pedestrian in the streets of masqat the more responsible papers noted the lack of alternative sources that might or might not lend credibility to the facts as they were sketchily presented but none could question the photographs or the identity of the man in them and that man congressman evan kendrick was nowhere to be found to confirm or deny the incredible story the new york times and the washington post unearthed what few friends and neighbours they could find in the capital as well as in virginia and colorado none could recall having seen or heard from the congressman during the period in question fourteen months agonot that they would necessarily have expected to which in itself meant that they probably would have remembered if he had been in touch with them the los angeles times went further and without revealing its sources ran a telephone check on mr kendrick apart from calls to various local shops and a certain james olsen a gardener only five possibly relevant calls were made from the congressmans residence in virginia over a fourweek period three were to the arabian studies departments at georgetown and princeton universities one to a diplomat from the arab emirate of dubai who had returned home seven months before and the fifth to an attorney in washington who refused to talk to the press relevance be damned the bird dogs were pointing even though the quarry had disappeared the less responsible papers which meant most of those without the resources to finance extensive investigations and all of the tabloids which did not care a whit about verification if they could spell it had a pseudojournalistic field day they took the exposed maximumclassified memorandum and used it as a springboard for the wild waters of heroic speculation knowing their issues would be grabbed by their unsceptical readership words in print are more often than not words of truth to the uninformeda patronizing judgment to be sure but all too true what was missing in every one of the stones however were truths deep truths that went beyond the astonishingly accurate revelations there was no mention of a brave young sultan of oman who had risked his life and lineage to help him or of the omanis who had guarded him both at the airport and in the back streets of masqat or of a strange and strikingly professional woman who had rescued him in a congested concourse of another airport in bahrain after he had been nearly killed who had found him sanctuary and a doctor who ministered to his wounds above all there was not a word about the israeli unit led by a mossad officer who had saved him from a death that still made him shiver in horror or even of another american an elderly architect from the bronx without whom he would have been dead a year ago his remains expunged by the sharks of qatar instead a common theme ran through all the articles everything arab was tainted with the brush of inhuman brutality and terrorism the very word arab was synonymous with ruthlessness and barbarism not a vestige of decency allowed to a whole people the longer evan studied the newspapers the angrier he became suddenly in a burst of fury he swept them all off the bed why who and then he felt a hollow terrible pain in his chest ahmat oh my god what had he done would the young sultan understand could he understand by omissionby silencethe american media had condemned the entire country of oman leaving to insidious speculation its arab impotence in the face of terrorists or worse its arab complicity in the wanton savage killing of american citizens he had to call his young friend reach him and tell him that he had no control over what had happened kendrick sat on the edge of the bed he grabbed the telephone while reaching into his trousers pocket for his wallet balancing the phone under his chin as he extracted his credit card not remembering the sequence of numbers to reach masqat he dialled for an operator suddenly the dial tone disappeared and for a moment he panicked his eyes wide glancing around at the windows yeah twentythree came the hoarse male voice over the line i was trying to call the operator you dial even an area code you get the board here i i have to make an overseas call stammered evan bewildered not on this phone you dont on a credit card how do i get an operatorim charging it to my credit card number ill listen in till i hear you give the number and its accepted for real understand he did not understand was it a trap had he been traced to a rundown motel in woodbridge virginia i dont really think thats acceptable he said haltingly its a private communication fancy that replied the voice derisively then go find yourself a pay phone theres one at the diner about five miles down the road tata asshole ive been stuck enough wait a minute all right stay on the line but when the operator clears it i want to hear you click off okay well actually i was gonna call louella parsons who forget it asshole im dialling people who stay all day are either sex freaks or shooting up somewhere in the far reaches of the persian gulf an englishspeaking arabicaccented operator volunteered that there was no exchange in masqat oman with the prefix dial it please insisted evan adding a more plaintive please eight rings passed until he heard ahmats harried voice iwah its evan ahmat said kendrick in english i have to talk to you talk to me exploded the young sultan youve got the balls to call me you bastard you know then aboutwhat theyre saying about me know one of the nicer things about being a rich kid is that ive got dishes on the roof that pick up whatever i want from wherever i want ive even got an edge on you ya shaikh have you seen the reports from over here and the middle east from bahrain and riyadh from jerusalem and tel aviv obviously not ive only seen these theyre all the same garbage a nice pile for you to sit on do well in washington just dont come back here but i want to come back i am coming back dont not to this part of the world we can read and we can hear and we watch television you did it all by yourself you stuck it to the arabs get out of my memory you son of a bitch ahmat out evan i would never have believed it of you do you become powerful in washington by calling us all animals and terrorists is that the only way i never did that i never said it your world did the way it keeps saying it again and again and again until its pretty fucking obvious you want us all in chains and the latest goddamned scenario is yours no protested kendrick shouting not mine read your press watch it thats the press not you and me you are youone more arrogant bastard within your blind holierthanthou judaeochristian hypocrisiesand i am me an islamic arab and you wont spit on me any longer i never would never could nor on my brothers whose lands you decreed should be stolen from them forcing whole villages to abandon their homes and their jobs and their insignificantly small businessessmall and insignificant but theirs for generations for christs sake ahmat youre sounding like one of them no kidding said the young sultan both anger and sarcasm in his words by them i assume you mean like a kid from one of those thousands upon thousands of families marched under guns into camps fit for pigs for pigs not families not for mothers and fathers and children good gracious mr allknowing eminently fair american if i sound like one of them gosh im sorry and ill tell you what else im sorry about i got here so late i understand so much more today than i did yesterday what the hell does that mean i repeat read your press watch your television listen to your radio are you superior people getting ready to nuke all the dirty arabs so you wont have to contend with us any more or are you going to leave it to your cool pals in israel who tell you what to do anyway youll simply give them the bombs now just hold it cried kendrick those israelis saved my life youre damned right they did but you were incidental you were just a bridge to what they really flew in here for what are you talking about i might as well tell you because no one else will nobodys going to print that they didnt give a shit about you mr hero that unit came here to get one man out of the embassy a mossad agent a highranking strategist posing as a naturalized american under contract to the state department oh my god whispered evan did weingrass know if he did he kept his mouth shut he forced them to go after you in bahrain thats how they saved your life it wasnt planned they dont give a goddamn about anyone or anything but themselves the jews just like you mr hero damn it listen to me ahmat im not responsible for whats happened here for whats been printed in the papers or whats on television its the last thing i wanted bullshit broke in the young harvard alumnus and sultan of oman none of it could have been reported without you i learned things i had no idea about who are these intelligence agents of yours running around my country who are all those contacts you reached mustapha for one killed who flew you in under cover without apprising me i run the goddamn place who has the right am i a fucking aggie in the game of marbles ahmat i dont know about these things i only knew i had to get there and im incidental wasnt i to be trusted of course not im an arab now thats bullshit you were being protected from what an americanisraeli coverup oh for christs sake stop it i didnt know anything about a mossad agent at the embassy until you just told me if i did i would have told you and while were at it my sudden young fanatic i had nothing to do with the refugee camps or marching families into them under guns you all did shouted the sultan of oman one genocide for another but we had nothing to do with the other out the line went dead a good man and a good friend who had been instrumental in saving his life was gone from his life as were his plans to return to a part of the world he dearly loved before he showed himself in public he had to find out what had happened and who had made it happen and why he had to start somewhere and that somewhere was the state department and a man named frank swann a frontal assault on state was of course out of the question the minute he identified himself alarms would go off and insofar as his face was seen repeatedly ad nauseam on television and half washington was searching for him his every move had to be carefully thought out first things first how to reach swann without swann or his office knowing it his office evan remembered a year ago he had walked into swanns office and spoken to a secretary giving her several words in arabic so as to convey the urgency of his visit she had disappeared into another office and ten minutes later he and swann were talking in the underground computer complex that secretary was not only efficient but also exceedingly protective as apparently were most secretaries in serpentine washington and since that protective secretary was very much aware of one congressman kendrick whom she had spoken to a year ago she just might be receptive to another voice also protective of her boss it was worth a try it was also the only thing he could think of he picked up the phone dialled the area code for washington and waited for the hoarse manager of the three bears motel to come on the line consular operations director swanns office said the secretary hi this is ralph over in id began kendrick ive got some news for frank whos this its okay im a friend of franks i just want to tell him that there may be an interdivision meeting called for later this afternoon another one he doesnt need that hows his schedule overworked hes in conference until four oclock well if he doesnt want to be put on the grill again maybe he should have a short day and drive home early drive him hell parachute into the jungles of nicaragua but he wont take chances in washington traffic you know what i mean things are a little jumpy around here he could be put on the spit hes been on it since six this morning just trying to help out a buddy actually hes got a doctors appointment said the secretary suddenly he does he does now thanks ralph i never called you of course not sweetie someone in id was just checking schedules evan stood in the crowd waiting for a bus at the corner of twentyfirst street within clear sight of the entrance to the department of state after speaking to swanns secretary he had left the cabin and driven rapidly up to washington stopping briefly at a shopping mall in alexandria where he bought dark glasses a widebrimmed canvas fishing hat and a soft cloth jacket it was in the afternoon if the secretary had pursued her protective inclinations frank swann deputy director of consular operations would be coming out of the huge glass doors within the next fifteen or twenty minutes he did at and in a hurry turning left on the pavement away from the bus stop kendrick rushed out of the crowd and started after the man from the state department staying thirty feet behind him wondering what means of transportation the nondriving swann would take if he intended to walk kendrick would stop him somewhere they could talk undisturbed he was not going to walk he was about to take a bus heading east on virginia avenue swann joined several others waiting for the same vehicle now lumbering rapidly down the street towards the stop evan hurried to the corner he could not allow the cons op director to get on that bus he approached swann and touched his shoulder hello frank said kendrick pleasantly taking off the dark glasses you shouted the astonished swann startling the other passengers as the doors of the bus cracked open me admitted evan quietly i think wed better talk good christ youve got to be out of your mind if i am youve driven me there even if you dont drive it was as far as their brief conversation got for suddenly an odd voice filled the street echoing off the side of the bus its him roared a strangelooking dishevelled man with wide popping eyes and long wild hair that fell over his ears and his forehead see look its him commando kendrick i seen him all day long on the televisioni got seven televisions in my apartment nothin goes on i dont know about its him before evan could react the man grabbed the fishing hat off his head hey shouted kendrick see look him lets get out of here cried swann they started running up the street the oddlooking man in pursuit his baggy trousers flopping in the wind he created evans hat in his hand his arms flailing hes following us said the cons op director looking back hes got my hat said kendrick two blocks later a doddering bluehaired lady with a cane was climbing out of a cab there yelled swann the taxi dodging traffic they raced across the wide avenue evan climbed in the near door as the man from the state department ran around the back to the far side he helped the elderly passenger out and inadvertently kicked the cane with his foot it fell to the pavement so did the bluehaired lady sorry dear said swann jumping into the back seat lets go yelled kendrick hurry up get out of here you clowns hold up a bank or somethin said the driver shifting into gear youll be richer for it if youll just hurry added evan im hurryin im hurryin i aint got no pilots licence i gotta stay earthbound yknow what i mean as one kendrick and swann whipped around to look out of the rear window back at the corner the oddlooking man with the wild hair and baggy trousers was writing something down on a newspaper evans hat now on his head the name of the company and the cabs number said the cons op director quietly wherever were going well have to switch vehicles at least a block behind this one why not the switch but the block away so our driver doesnt see which cab we get into you even sound like you know what youre doing i hope you do replied swann breathlessly taking out a handkerchief and wiping his sweatdrenched face twentyeight minutes and a second taxi later the congressman and the man from the department of state walked rapidly down the street in a rundown section of washington they looked up at a red neon sign with three letters missing it was a seedy bar that belonged in its environs they nodded to each other and walked inside somewhat startled by the intensely dark interior if only in contrast to the bright october day out in the street the single glaring blaring source of light was a television set bolted into the wall above the shabby distressed bar several hunchedover dishevelled blearyeyed patrons confirmed the status of the establishment both squinting in the receding dim wash of light kendrick and swann moved towards the darker regions to the right of the bar they found a frayed booth and slid in opposite each other you really insist we talk asked the greyhaired swann breathing deeply his face flushed and still perspiring i insist to the point of making you the newest candidate for the morgue watch it im a black belt in what swann frowned i was never quite sure but it always works in the movies when they show us doing our thing i need a drink you signal a waiter said kendrick ill stay in the shadows shadows questioned swann raising his hand cautiously for a heavy black waitress with flaming red hair wheres any light in here when did you last do three pushups in succession mr karate kid sometime in the sixties early i think thats when they replaced the light bulbs in this place now about me how the hell could you you liar how the hell could you think i would cried the man from state suddenly silent as the grotesque waitress stood by the table arms akimbo whatll you have he asked evan nothing thats not nice here or healthy i suspect two ryes double thank you canadian if you have it forget it said the waitress forgotten agreed swann as the waitress left his eyes again on kendrick youre funny mr congressman i mean really hilarious consular operations wants my head the secretary of state has put out a directive that makes it clear he doesnt know who i am that vacillating academic fleabag and the israelis are screaming because they think their precious mossad may be compromised by anyone digging and the arabs on our payroll are bitching because theyre not getting any credit and at threethirty this afternoon the presidentthe goddamned presidentis chewing me out for dereliction of duty let me tell you he intoned that phrase just like he knew what the hell he was talking about which meant i knew there were at least two other people on the line youre running im running damn near thirty years in this dumb business thats what i called it interrupted evan quickly quietly sorry you should be said swann without missing a beat because whos going to do this shit except us bastards dumber than the system you need us charlie and dont you forget it the problem is we dont have much to show for it i mean i dont have to rush home to make sure the pool in my backyard has been treated for algae because of the heat mainly because i dont have a pool and my wife got the house in the divorce settlement because she was sick and tired of my going out for a loaf of bread and coming back three months later with the dirt of afghanistan still in my ears oh no mr undercover congressman i didnt blow the whistle on you instead i did my best to stop the blowing i havent got much left but i want to stay clean and get out with what i can you tried to stop the blowing the whistle low key very offhand very professional i even showed him a copy of the memo i sent upstairs rejecting you him swann looked forlornly at kendrick as the waitress brought their drinks and stood there tapping the tabletop while the man from state reached into his pocket glanced at the bill and paid it the woman shrugged at the tip and walked away him repeated evan go ahead said swann his voice flat drinking a large portion of his whisky drive another nail in what difference does it make theres not that much blood left i assume that means you dont know who he is who him is oh ive got a name and a position and even a firstrate recommendation well he doesnt exist what you heard me he doesnt exist pressed a frustrated kendrick well one of them does but not the man who came to see me swann finished his first drink i dont believe this neither did ivy thats my secretary ivy the terrible what are you talking about asked kendrick plaintively ivy got a call from senator allisons office from a guy she used to date a couple of years ago hes one of the senators top aides now he asked her to set up an appointment for a staffer doing some confidential work for allison so she did well he turns out to be a blond spook with an accent i placed somewhere in middle europe but hes for real he had you down cold if youve got a scar that only your mother knows about believe me he has a closeup of it thats crazy broke in evan softly i wonder why so did i i mean the questions he asked were loaded with pd i beg your pardon prior data on you he was giving almost as much as he could get from me he was so pro i was ready to offer him a eurojob on the spot but why we as i said i wondered too so i asked ivy to check with allisons office to begin with why would a laidback senator have that kind of ss what not what you think superspook come to think of it i suppose theres a connection will you please stick to the point sure said swann drinking his second whisky ivy calls her old boyfriend and he doesnt know what shes talking about he never made any call to her and he never heard of any staffer namedwhatever his name was but she had to know who she was talking to for gods sake his voicethe small talk what they said to each other her old beau had a strong southern accent and was suffering from laryngitis when he phoned her thats what ivy claimed but the cracker who really called her knew the places they wenteven down to a couple of motels in maryland that ivy would rather not have her husband know about christ its an operation kendrick reached over and took swanns drink why why did you just take my whisky i dont have a swimming pool remember or even a house suddenly the blaring television set above the bar burst forth with the sharply consonanted name of kendrick both men snapped their heads over to the source their eyes wide unbelieving newsbreak the story of the hour perhaps the decade yelled a tv journalist among a crowd of leering faces peering into the camera for the last twelve hours all washington has been trying to find congressman evan kendrick of colorado the hero of oman but to no avail the worst fears of course centre around the possibility of arab retaliation were told the government has directed the police the hospitals and the morgues to be on the alert yet only minutes ago he was seen on this very street corner specifically identified by one kasimir bolabola slawski where are you from sir jersey city replied the wildeyed man with kendricks hat on his head but my roots are in warsaw gods holy warsaw you were born in poland then not exactly in newark but you saw congressman kendrick positively he was talking to a greyhaired man a couple blocks back outside a bus then when i shouted commando kendrick its him they started running i know i got television sets in every room including the toilet i never miss anything when you say a couple of blocks back sir youre actually referring to a corner two and a half streets from the department of state are you not you betcha were certain added the sincerely confidential newscaster looking into the camera that the authorities are checking state to see if any such person as our witness has described could be a part of this extraordinary rendezvous i chased them yelled the witness in baggy pants removing evans hat i got his hat see its the commandos own hat but what did you hear mr bolaslawski back by the bus i tell you things are not always what they seem you cant be too careful before they ran away the man with grey hair gave commando kendrick an order i think he had a russian accent maybe jewish the commies and the jewsyou cant trust em you know what i mean they never seen the inside of a church they dont know what the holy mass is the television channel abruptly switched to a commercial extolling the virtues of an underarm deodorant i surrender said swann forcibly taking his drink back from evan and swallowing it whole now im a mole a russian jew from the kgb who doesnt know what mass is anything else you want to do for me no because i believe you but you can do something for me and its in both our interests ive got to find out whos doing this to me whos done what youre being blamed for and why and if you do find out interrupted swann leaning forward youll tell me thats in my interest my only interest right now ive got to get off this hook and put someone else on it youll be the first to know what do you want a list of everyone who knew i went to masqat thats not a list its a tight little circle swann shook his head not so much to be negative as to explain there wouldnt have been that if you hadnt said you might need us if it came down to something you couldnt handle i made it clear we couldnt afford to acknowledge you because of the hostages how tight is the circle everything was verbal you understand understood how tight nonoperational was restricted to that unmitigated prick herbert dennison the ballbreaking white house chief of staff then to the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs i was the liaison to all four and you can rule them out they all had too much to lose and nothing to gain by your surfacing swann leaned back in the booth frowning the operational section was on a strict needtoknow basis there was lester crawford at langley les is the cias analyst for covert activities in the area and at the end his station chief in bahrainsomethingorother graysonjames grayson thats it he was kicking up a fuss about letting you and weingrass out of his area thinking the company had gone nuts and was ploughing right into one oft hose caughtintheact situations caughtintheact cia get it id rather not then there were four or five onscene arabs the best we and the company have each of whom studied your photograph but werent given your identity they couldnt tell what they didnt know the last two did know who you were one was on the scene the other here at ohiofourzero running the computers the computers asked kendrick printouts you were programmed only on his you were zapped from the central unit his names gerald bryce and if hes the whistleblower ill turn myself in to the fbi as mr bolaslawskis jewish mole for the soviets hes bright and quick and a whiz with the equipment no one better hell run cons op some day if the girls leave him alone long enough to punch a clock a playboy landsakes reverend shall we go to vespers the kids twentysix and better looking than he has a right to be hes also unmarried and one hell of a cocksmanothers talk about it he never does i think thats why i like him there arent too many gentlemen left in this world i like him already who was the last person the one on the scene who knew me frank swann leaned forward fingering his empty glass staring at it before raising his eyes to kendrick i thought you might have figured that out for yourself what why adrienne rashad doesnt mean a thing she used a cover adrienne a woman swann nodded evan frowned then suddenly opened his eyes wide his brows arched khalehla he whispered the man from the state department nodded again she was one of you well not one of mine but one of us christ she got me out of the airport in bahrain that big son of a bitch macdonald slammed me into the concourse traffici was damn near killed and didnt know where i was she got me out of therehow the hell she did it i dont know i do said swann she threatened to blow the heads off a few bahrainian police unless they passed her code name up the line and got clearance to take you out she not only got clearance but also a car from the royal garage you say she was one of us but not one of you what does that mean shes agency but shes also special a real untouchable she has contacts all over the gulfs and the mediterranean the cia doesnt allow anyone to mess with her without her my cover might have been blown at the airport without her you would have been a target for every terrorist walking around bahrain including the mahdis soldiers kendrick was briefly silent his eyes wandering his lips parted a memory did she tell you where she hid me she refused she could do that i told you shes special i see said evan softly i think i do too said swann what do you mean by that nothing she got you out of the airport and roughly six hours later made contact is that unusual under the circumstances you could say it was extraordinary her job was to keep you under surveillance and to immediately report any drastic moves on your part directly to crawford at langley who was to contact me for instructions she didnt do that and in her official debriefing she omitted any reference to those six hours she had to protect the place where we were hiding of course it had to be royal and nobody screws around with the emir or his family of course kendrick again was silent and again he looked into the dark regions of the decrepit bar she was a nice person he said slowly hesitantly we talked she understood so many things i admired her hey come on congressman swann leaned over his empty glass you think its the first time what two people in a hairy situation a man and a woman neither one knowing whether he or shell see another day or another week so they get together its natural so what thats offensive as hell frank she meant something to me all right ill be blunt i dont think you meant anything to her shes a professional whos gone through a few black wars in her aoo her what will you please speak english or arabic if you like but something that makes sense area of operations they used that in the newspapers not my fault if it was up to me id neutralize every bastard who wrote those articles please dont tell me what neutralize means i wont im only telling you that in the field we all slip now and then when were exhausted or just plain scared we take a few hours of secure pleasure and write it off as a long overdue bonus would you believe we even have lectures on the subject for people we send out i believe it now to be honest with youthe circumstances crossed my mind at the time good write her off shes strictly mediterranean and hasnt anything to do with the local scene for starters youd probably have to fly to north africa to find her so all ive got is a man named crawford in langley and a station chief in bahrain no youve got a blond man with a middleeuropean accent operating here in washington operating very deep he got information somewhere and not from me not from ohiofourzero find him swarm gave evan the standard private numbers at both his office and his apartment and rushed out of the dark seedy bar as if he needed air kendrick ordered a rye from the heavy black waitress with the flaming red hair and asked her where the pay telephone was if it existed she told him if you slam it twice on the lower left corner youll get your quarter back offered the woman if i do ill give it to you okay said evan give it to your friend replied the woman crumbs in suits never leave no tips white or black makes no difference kendrick got up from the booth and walked cautiously to the dark wall and the phone it was time to call his office he could not put any more pressure on mrs ann mulcahy oreilly squinting he inserted the coin and dialled congressman kendricks its me annie broke in evan my god where are you its after five and this place is still a madhouse thats why im not there before i forget cried mrs mulcahy breathlessly manny called a while ago and was very emphatic but not loudwhich i think means hes as serious as he can be what did he say that youre not to reach him on the colorado line what he told me to say allcott massghoul whatever the hell that is its very clear annie weingrass had said alkhatt mashghool arabic for the line is engaged a simple euphemism for tampered with or tapped if manny was right a trace could be lasered out and the origin of any incoming call identified in a matter of moments i wont make any calls to colorado added evan he said to tell you that when things calm down hell drive to mesa verde and call me here and give me a number where you can reach him ill check back with you now then mr superman is it true what everyones saying did you really do all those things in oman or wherever it is only a few of them they left out a lot of people who should have been included someones trying to make me out to be something im not how are you handling things the standard no comment and our boss is out of town answered oreilly good glad to hear it no congressman its not good because some things cant be handled standardwise we can control the loonies and the press and even your peers but we cant control sixteen hundred the white house the obnoxious chief of staff himself we cant say no comment to the presidents mouthpiece what did he say he gave me a telephone number youre to call its his private line and he made sure i understood that less than ten people in washington had it i wonder if the presidents one of them interrupted kendrick only half facetiously he claimed he is and in point of fact he said its a direct presidential order that you call his chief of staff immediately a direct what presidential order will somebody please read those clowns the constitution the legislative branch of this government does not take direct orders from the executive presidential or otherwise his choice of words was stupid i grant you went on ann oreilly quickly but if youll let me finish telling you what he said you might be more amenable goon he said they understood why you were keeping out of sight and that theyd arrange an unmarked pickup for you wherever you say now may i speak as your elder here in funny town sir please you cant keep on running evan sooner or later youll have to show up and its better that you know whats on their minds over there before you do like it or not theyre on your case why not find out how theyre coming down it could avoid a disaster whats the number the icarus agenda chapter herbert dennison white house chief of staff closed the door of his private bathroom and reached for the bottle of maalox which he kept in the righthand corner of the marble counter in precise sequence he ingested four swallows of the chalklike liquid knowing from experience that it would eliminate the hot flashes in his upper chest years ago in new york when the attacks had begun he had been so frightened that he could barely eat or sleep so convinced was he that after surviving the hell of korea he was going to die in the street of cardiac arrest his then wifethe first of threehad also been beside herself unable to decide whether to get him first to a hospital or to their insurance agent for an expanded policy without his knowing about it she accomplished the latter and a week later herbert bit the bullet and admitted himself to the cornell medical center for a thorough examination relief came when the doctors pronounced his heart as strong as a young bulls explaining to him that the sporadic fits of discomfort were brought about by periodic spasms of excess acid produced no doubt by anxiety and tension from that day forward in bedrooms offices cars and briefcases bottles of the white pacifying liquid were always available to him tension was a part of his life the doctors diagnosis had been so accurate that over the years he could reasonably predict when give or take an hour or two the acid attacks would grip him during his days on wall street they invariably came with wild fluctuations in the bond market or when he fought with peers who were continually trying to thwart him in his drive for both wealth and position they were all pukey shits thought dennison fancy boys from fancy fraternities who belonged to fancy clubs that wouldnt spit on him much less consider him for membership who gave a nuns fart those same clubs let in yids and niggers and even spies these days all they had to do was speak like fairy actors and buy their clothes from paul stuart or some french faggot well he had spat on them he broke them he had the gut instincts of a street fighter in the market and he had cornered so much made so much that the fucking firm had to make him president or he would have walked out taking millions with him and he had shaped up that corporation until it was the sharpest most aggressive firm on the street he had done so by getting rid of the whining deadwood and that stupid corps of socalled trainees who ate up money and wasted everybodys time he had two maxims that became corporate holy writ the first was beat last years figures or beat feet out of here the second was equally succinct you dont get trained here you get here trained herb dennison never gave a damn whether he was liked or disliked the theory that the end justified the means suited him splendidly thank you he had learned in korea that softnosed officers were often rewarded with gi caskets for their lack of harsh discipline and harsher authority in the field he had been aware that his troops hated his proverbial guts to the point where he never dropped his guard against being fragmented by a us grenade and whatever the losses he was convinced they would have been far greater had the looseygoosies been in charge like the crybabies on wall street we want to build trust herb continuity or the youngster of today is the corporate officer of tomorrowa loyal one crap you didnt make profits on trust or continuity or loyalty you made profits by making other people money that was all the trust and continuity and loyalty they looked for and he had been proved right swelling the client lists until the computers were ready to burst pirating talent from other firms making damn sure he got what he paid for or the new boys too were out on their backsides sure he was tough perhaps even ruthless as many called him both to his face and in print and yes he had lost a few good people along the way but the main thing was that in general he was right he had proved it in both military and civilian life and yet in the end in both the creeps had dumped him in korea the regimental co had damned near promised him the rank of full colonel upon discharge it never happened in new yorkchrist if possible it was worsehis name had been floated around as the newest member of the board of directors for wellingtonmidlantic industries the most prestigious board in international finance it never happened in both cases the oldschooltie fraternities had shot him down at the moment of escalation so he took his millions and said screw all of you again he had been right for he found a man who needed both his money and his considerable talents a senator from idaho who had begun to raise his startlingly sonorous impassioned voice saying things herb dennison fervently believed in yet a politician who could laugh and amuse his growing audiences while at the same time instructing them the man from idaho was tall and attractive with a smile that had not been seen since eisenhower and shirley temple full of anecdotes and homilies that espoused the old values of strength courage selfreliance and above allfor dennisonfreedom of choice herb had flown down to washington and a pact was made with that senator for three years dennison threw in all his energies and several millionplus additional millions from numerous anonymous men for whom he had made fortunesuntil they had a war chest that could buy the papacy if it were more obviously on the market herb dennison belched the chalkywhite liquid pacifier was working but not rapidly enough he had to be ready for the man who would walk into his office in a matter of minutes he took two more swallows and looked at himself in the mirror unhappy at the sight of his progressively thinning grey hair that he combed straight back on both sides the sharply defined parting on the left the top of his head consistent with his nononsense image peering into the glass he wished his greygreen eyes were larger he opened them as wide as he could they were still too narrow and the slight wattle under his chin reinforced the hint of jowls reminding him that he must get some exercise or eat less neither of which appealed to him and why with all the goddamned money he paid for his suits didnt he look more like the men in the ads his british tailors sent him still there was about him an imposing air of strength emphasized by his rigid posture and the thrust of his jaw both of which he had perfected over the years he belched again and swallowed another mouthful of his personal elixir goddamn kendrick son of a bitch he swore to himself that nobodysuddenlysomebody was the cause of his anger and discomfort well if he was to be honest with himself and he always tried to be honest with himself if not always with others it was not the nobodysomebody by himself it was the bastards effect on langford jennings president of the united states shit piss and vinegar what did langford have in mind in his thoughts herb had actually pulled himself short substituting the president for langford and that made him angrier still it was part of the tension part of the distance that white house authority demanded and dennison hated it after the inauguration and three years of calling him by his first name jennings had spoken quietly to his chief of staff during one of the inaugural balls spoken to him in that soft jocular voice that dripped with selfdeprecation and good humour you know i dont give a damn herb but i think the officenot me but the officesort of calls for you to address me as mr president dont you think so too damn that had been that what did jennings have in mind the president had casually agreed with everything herb had proposed concerning the kendrick freak but the responses had been too casual bordering on disinterest and that bothered the chief of staff jenningss mellifluous voice sounded unconcerned but his eyes did not convey any lack of concern at all every now and then langford jennings surprised the whole goddamned bunch of them at the white house dennison hoped this was not one of those frequently awkward times the bathroom telephone rang its proximity causing the chief of staff to spill maalox over his savile row jacket awkwardly he grabbed the phone off the wall with his right hand while turning on the hot water tap with his left and dousing a washcloth under the stream as he answered he frantically rubbed the wet cloth over the white spots grateful that they disappeared into the dark fabric yes congressman kendrick has arrived at the east gate sir the strip search is in progress the what theyre checking him for weapons and explosives jesus i never said he was a terrorist hes in a government car with two secret service personnel sir you did indicate a strong degree of apprehension and displeasure send him up here at once he may have to get dressed sir shit six minutes later a quietly furious evan kendrick was ushered through the door by an apprehensive secretary rather than thanking the woman evans expression conveyed another message more like get out of here lady i want this man to myself she left quickly as the chief of staff approached his hand extended kendrick ignored it ive heard about your fun and games over here dennison said evan his voice a low icelike monotone but when you presume to search a member of the house whos here at your invitationthats what it had better be you fucker you dont give orders to meyouve gone too far a complete foulup of instructions congressman my god how can you think anything else with you very easily too many of my colleagues have had too many runins with you the horror stories are rampant including the one in which you threw a punch at the member from kansas who i understand flattened you on the floor thats a lie he disregarded white house procedures for which im responsible i may have touched him merely to keep him in place but thats all and thats when he took me by surprise i dont think so i heard he called you a twobit major and you went up distortion complete distortion dennison winced the acid was erupting look i apologize for the strip search dont it didnt happen i accepted removing the jacket figuring that was standard but when the guard mentioned my shirt and trousers my far brighter escorts moved in then what the hell are you so uptight about that you even considered it and if you didnt that youve created a mentality here that would i could defend that accusation but i wont bother now were going into the oval office and for christs sake dont confuse the man with all that proarab bullshit remember he doesnt know what happened and it wont do any good trying to explain ill clarify everything for him later how do i know youre capable of that what you heard me how do i know youre either capable or reliable what are you talking about i think youd clarify whatever you want to clarify telling him whatever you want him to hear who the hell are you to talk to me this way someone probably as rich as you are also someone whos getting out of this town as im sure swann told you so your political benediction is meaningless to mei wouldnt accept it in any event you know something dennison i think youre a bona fide rat not the cute mickey mouse variety but the original animal an ugly scavenging longtailed rodent who spreads a lousy disease its called nonaccountability you dont spare words do you congressman i dont have to im leaving but he isnt and i want him strong persuasive hes taking us into a new era were standing tall again and its about time were telling the crumbs of this world to shit or get off the pot your expressions are as banal as you are what are you some fucking ivy leaguer with a degree in english get with it congressman were playing hardball here this is if people in this administration move their bowels or theyre out got that ill try to remember while youre at it remember he doesnt like dissent everythings cool got that no waves at all everybodys happy got that you repeat yourself dont you i get things done kendrick thats the name of the hardball game youre a lean mean machine you are so we dont like each other so what its no big deal ive got that agreed evan lets go not so fast said kendrick firmly turning away from dennison and walking to a window as if the office were his not that of the presidents man whats the scenario that is the term isnt it what do you mean what do you want from me asked kendrick looking out at the white house lawn since youre doing the thinking why am i here because ignoring you would be counterproductive really kendrick turned again to face the white houses chief of staff counterproductive youve got to be acknowledged is that clear enough he cant sit on his ass and pretend you dont exist right oh i see say that during one of his entertaining although not terribly enlightening press conferences someone brings up my name which is inevitable now he cant very well say that hes not sure whether i play for the jets or the giants can he you got it lets go ill shape the conversation you mean control it dont you call it what you like congressman hes the greatest president of the twentieth century and dont you forget it my job is to maintain the status quo its not my job the hell it isnt its all our jobs i was in combat young fella and i watched men die defending our freedoms our way of life i tell you it was a goddamned holy thing to see and this man this president has brought those values back those sacrifices we prize so much hes moved this country in the right direction by the sheer force of his will his personality if you like hes the best but not necessarily the brightest interrupted kendrick that doesnt mean shit galileo would have made a lousy pope and a worse caesar i suppose youve got a point i certainly do now the scenariothe explanationis simple and all too damned familiar some son of a bitch leaked the oman story and you want it forgotten as soon as possible i do dennison paused studying evans face as if it were decidedly unattractive thats based directly on what that jerk swann told the chairman of the joint chiefs why is swann a jerk he didnt leak the story he tried to throw off the man who came to see him he let it happen he was the co of that operation and he let it happen and ill see him hung wrong past tense what never mind but just to make sure were both using the same scenario why do i want everything forgotten as soon as possible because there could be reprisals against your lousy arab friends over there thats what you told swann and thats what he told his superiors you want to change it no of course not said kendrick softly the scenarios the same good well schedule a short ceremony showing him thanking you on behalf of the whole damn country no questions just a restricted photo session and then you fade dennison gestured to the door both men started towards it you know something congressman remarked the chief of staff his hand on the knob your showing up like this has ruined one of the best whispering campaigns any administration could ask forpublic relationswise that is a whispering campaign yeah the longer we kept quiet deflecting questions on the basis of national security the more people thought the president forced the oman settlement all by himself he certainly conveyed that said evan smiling not unkindly as if he admired a talent he did not necessarily approve of i tell you he may not be an einstein but hes still a fucking genius dennison opened the door evan did not move may i remind you that eleven men and women were murdered in masqat that two hundred others will have nightmares for the rest of their lives thats right replied dennison and he said itwith goddamned tears in his eyes he said they were true american heroes as brave as those who fought at verdun omaha beach panmunjom and danang the man said it congressman and he meant it and we stood tall he said it as he narrowed the options making his message clear agreed kendrick if any one person was responsible for saving those two hundred and thirtysix hostages it must have been him so never mind lets get this over with youre a fruitcake congressman and youre right you dont belong in this town evan kendrick had met the president of the united states only once the meeting lasted for approximately five perhaps six seconds during a white house reception for the freshmen congressmen of the chief executives party it had been mandatory for him to attend according to ann mulcahy oreilly who practically threatened to blow up the office if evan refused to go to the affair it was not that kendrick disliked the man he kept telling annie it was just that he did not agree with a lot of things langford jennings espousedperhaps more than a lot maybe most and in answer to mrs oreillys question as to why he had run on the ticket he could only reply that the other party did not stand a chance of being elected the predominant impression evan had while briefly shaking hands with langford jennings in that reception line was more in the abstract than in the immediate yet not totally so the office was both intimidating and overwhelming that a single human being could be entrusted with such awesome global power stretched any thinking mans mind to its limits a miscue during some horrible miscalculation could blow up the planet yet yet despite kendricks personal evaluation of the man himself which included a less than brilliant intellect and a proclivity for oversimplification as well as tolerance for such zealous clowns as herbert dennison there was about langford jennings a striking image that was larger than life an image that the ordinary citizen of the republic desperately longed for in the presidency evan had tried to understand the gossamer veil that shielded the man from closer scrutiny and had finally come to the conclusion that scrutiny itself was irrelevant compared to his impact the same might be said of nero caligula any number of mad authoritarian popes and emperors and the ultimate villains of the twentieth century mussolini stalin and hitler yet this man displayed none of the evil inherent in those others instead he conveyed a strong pervasive trustworthiness that seemed to radiate from his inner self jennings was also blessed with a large attractive physique and a much larger belief and the purity of his belief was everything to him he was also one of the most charming ingratiating men kendrick had ever observed damn its good to meet you evan may i call you evan mr congressman of course mr president jennings came around the desk in the oval office to shake hands gripping kendricks left arm as their hands clasped ive just finished reading all that secret stuff about what you did and i tell you im so proud there were a lot of others involved sir without them id have been killed i understand that sit down evan sit sit the president returned to his chair herbert dennison remained standing what you did evan as a single individual will be a textbook lesson for generations of young people in america you took the whip in your hands and made the damn thing snap not by myself sir theres a long list of people who risked their lives to help meand several lost their lives as i said id be dead if it werent for them there were at least a dozen omanis from the young sultan down and an israeli commando unit that found me when i literally had only a few hours to live my execution was already scheduled yes i understand all that evan interrupted langford jennings nodding and frowning compassionately i also understand that our friends in israel insist that there must be no hint of their involvement and our intelligence community here in washington refuses to risk exposing our personnel in the persian gulf the gulf of oman mr president im on your side said jennings grinning his famous selfdeprecating grin that had charmed a nation im not sure i know one from the other but ill learn tonight as my hatchet cartoonists would balloon it my wife wont give me my cookies and milk till i get it all straight that would be unfair sir its a geographically complex part of the world for someone not familiar with it yes well somehow i think even i might master it with a couple of grammar school maps i never meant to imply its okay evan its my fault i slip now and then the main issue here is what do we do with you what do we do given the restrictions placed on us for the sake of protecting the lives of agents and subagents who are working for us in an explosive part of the globe id say those necessary restrictions call for keeping everything quiet classified its a little late for that evan broke in jennings national security alibis can only go so far beyond a certain point you arouse too much curiosity thats when things can get stickyand dangerous also added herbert dennison gruffly breaking his silence as i mentioned to you congressman the president cant simply ignore you it wouldnt be the generous or patriotic thing to do now the way i see itand the president agrees with mewell schedule a short photo session here in the oval office where youll be congratulated by the president along with a series of shots showing you both in whatll look like confidential conversation thatll be consistent with the intelligence greyout required by our counterterrorist services the country will understand that you dont tip off your tactics to those arab scumballs without a lot of arabs i wouldnt have got anywhere and you goddamned well know it said kendrick his angry eyes rigid on the chief of staff oh we know it evan interrupted jennings his own eyes obviously amused by what he observed at least i know it by the way herb i had a call from sam winters this afternoon and i think he has a hell of an idea that wouldnt violate any of our security concerns and as a matter of fact could explain them samuel winters is not necessarily a friend countered dennison hes withheld a number of policy endorsements we could have used with congress then he didnt agree with us does that make him an enemy hell if it does youd better send half the marine guards up to our family quarters come on herb sam winters has been an adviser to presidents of both parties for as long as i can remember only a damn fool wouldnt accept calls from him he should have been routed through me you see evan said the president his head askew grinning mischievously i can play in the sandbox but i cant choose my friends thats hardly what i it certainly is what you meant herb and thats okay with me you get things done around herewhich you constantly remind me of and thats okay too what did mr wintersprofessor winterssuggest asked dennison the academic title spoken sarcastically well hes a professor herb but hes not your average runofthemill teacher is he i mean if he wanted to i suppose he could buy a couple of pretty decent universities certainly the one i got out of could be his for a sum he wouldnt miss what was his idea pressed the chief of staff anxiously that i award my friend evan here the medal of freedom the president turned to kendrick thats the civilian equivalent to the congressional medal of honor evan i know that sir i neither deserve it nor want it well sam made a couple of things clear to me and i think hes right to begin with you do deserve it and whether you want it or not id look like a mean chintzy bastard not awarding it to you and that fellas i will not accept is that clear herb yes mr president said dennison his voice choked however you should know that although representative kendrick is standing unopposed for reelection to guarantee you a congressional seat he intends to resign his office in the near future theres no point since he has his own objections in focusing more attention on him the point herb is that i wont be a chintzy bastard anyway he looks as if he could be my younger brotherwe could get mileage out of that sam winters brought it to my attention the image of a gogetting american family he called it not bad wouldnt you say its not necessary mr president rejoined dennison now frustrated his hoarse voice conveying the fact that he could not push much farther the congressmans fears are valid he thinks there could be reprisals against friends of his in the arab world the president leaned back in his chair his eyes fixed blankly on his chief of staff that doesnt wash with me this is a dangerous world and well only make it more dangerous by knuckling under to such speculative crap but in that vein ill explain to the countryfrom a position of strength not fearthat i wont permit full disclosure of the oman operation for reasons of counterterrorist strategy you were right about that part herb actually sam winters said it to me first also i will not look like a chintzy bastard it simply isnt me understood herb yes sir evan said jennings the infectious grin again creasing his face youre my kind of man what you did was terrificwhat i read about itand this president wont stint by the way sam winters mentioned that i should say we worked together what the hell my people worked with you and thats the gospel truth mr president schedule it herb i looked at my calendar if that doesnt offend you next tuesday ten oclock in the morning that way well hit all the tv stations nightly news and tuesdays a good night but mr president began a flustered dennison also herb i want the marine band in the blue room ill be damned if ill be a chintzy bastard its not me a furious herbert dennison walked back to his office with kendrick in tow for the purpose of carrying out the presidential order work out the details for the award ceremony in the blue room on the following tuesday with the marine band so intense was the chief of staffs anger that his large firm jaw was locked in silence im really on your case arent i herbie said evan noting the bulllike quality of dennisons stride youre on my case and my name isnt herbie oh i dont know you looked like a herbie back there the man cut you down didnt he there are times when the president is inclined to listen to the wrong people kendrick looked over at the chief of staff as they marched down the wide hallway dennison ignored the tentative greetings of numerous white house personnel heading in the opposite direction several of whom stared wideeyed at evan obviously recognizing him i dont get it said kendrick our mutual dislike aside whats your problem im the one being stuck where i dont want to be not you why are you howling because you talk too goddamned much i watched you on the foxley show and that little display in your office the next morning youre counterproductive you like that word dont you ive got a lot of others i can use im sure you do then again i may have a surprise for you another one what the hell is it wait till we get to your office dennison ordered his secretary to hold all calls except those on priority red she nodded her head rapidly in obedient acknowledgment but in a cowed voice explained you have more than a dozen messages now sir nearly every one is an urgent callback are they priority red the woman shook her head what did i just tell you with these courteous words the chief of staff propelled the congressman into his office and slammed the door shut now whats this surprise of yours you know herbie i really must give you some advice replied evan walking casually over to the window where he had stood previously he turned and looked at dennison you can be rude to the help as much as you like or as long as theyll take it but dont you ever again put your hand on a member of the house of representatives and shove him into your office as if you were about to administer a strap i didnt shove you i interpreted it that way and thats all that matters you have a heavy hand herbie im sure my distinguished colleague from kansas felt the same way when he decked you on your ass unexpectedly herbert dennison paused then laughed softly the prolonged deep chuckle was reflective neither angry nor antagonistic more the sound of relief than anything else he loosened his tie and casually sat down in a leather armchair in front of his desk christ i wish i were ten or twelve years younger kendrick and id whip your taili could have done it even at that age at sixtythree however you learn that caution is the better part of valour or whatever it is i dont care to be decked again its a little harder to get up these days then dont ask for it dont provoke it youre a very provocative man sit down congressmanin my chair at my desk go on go ahead evan did so how does it feel you get a tingling in your spine a rush of blood to your head neither its a place to work yeah well i guess were different you see down the hall is the most powerful man on earth and he relies on me and to tell you the truth im no genius either i just keep the booby hatch running i oil the machinery so the wheels turn and the oil i use has a lot of acidity in it just like me but its the only lubricant ive got and it works i suppose theres a point to this said kendrick i suppose there is and i dont think youll be offended since ive been heresince weve been hereeverybody bows like gooks in front of me saying all kinds of flattering things with big smilesonly with eyes that tell me theyd rather put a bullet in my head ive been through it before it doesnt bother me but here you show up and you tell me to go fuck off now thats really refreshing i can deal with that i mean i like your not liking me and my not liking youdoes that make sense in a perverse sort of way i suppose but then youre a perverse man why because id rather talk straight than in circles pointless lip service and asskissing drivel only waste time if i could get rid of both wed all accomplish ten times what we do now did you ever let anyone know that ive tried congressman so help me god ive tried and you know something nobody believes me would you if you were they probably not and maybe if they did the booby hatch would turn into a registered loony bin think about it kendrick theres more than one side to my perversity im not qualified to comment on that but this conversation makes things easier for me easier oh that surprise youre going to lay on me yes agreed evan you see up to a point ill do what you want me to dofor a price its my pact with the devil you flatter me i dont mean to im not given to asskissing drivel either because it wastes my time as i read you im counterproductive because ive made some noise about several things i feel pretty strongly about and what youve heard goes against your grain am i right so far right on the tiny tin dime kiddo you may look different but to me theres a lot of that stringy longhaired protest crap in you and you think that if im given any kind of platform there might be more to come and that really frosts your apricots right again right in the flys asshole i dont want anything or anyone to interrupt his voice his comments hes taken us out of the pansy patch were riding a strong chinook wind and it feels good i wont try to follow that you probably couldnt but basically you want two things from me continued evan rapidly the first is for me to say as little as possible and nothing at all that calls into question the wisdom emanating from this booby hatch of yours am i close you couldnt get closer without being arrested and the second is in what you said before you want me to fadeand fade fast how am i doing youve got the brass ring all right ill do bothup to a point after this little ceremony next tuesday which neither of us wants but we lose to the man my office will be flooded with demands from the media newspapers radio television the weekly magazinesthe whole ball of wax im news and they want to sell their merchandise youre not telling me anything i dont know or dont like interrupted dennison ill turn everything down said kendrick flatly i wont grant any interviews i wont speak publicly on any issue and ill fade just as fast as i can id kiss you right now except that you mentioned something kind of counterproductive like up to a point what the hell does that mean it means that in the house ill vote to my conscience and if im challenged on the floor ill give my reasons as dispassionately as i can but thats in the house off the hill im not available for comment we get most of our pr flak off the hill not on it said the white house chief of staff reflectively the congressional record and cables cspan cameras dont put a dent in the daily news and dallas under the circumstances thanks to that smooth son of a bitch sam winters your offer is so irresistible i wonder what the price is you have a price i assume i want to know who blew the whistle on me who leaked the oman story so very very professionally you think i dont erupted dennison bouncing forward id have the bastards deepsixed fifty miles off newport news in torpedo cans then help me find out thats my price take it or take me replaying the foxley show all over the country calling you and your crowd exactly what i honestly think you are a bunch of bumbling neanderthals faced with a complicated world you cant understand youre the fucking expert hell no i just know that youre not i watch and i listen and see you cutting off so many people who could help you because theres a zig or a zag in their stripes that doesnt conform to your preconceived pattern and i learned something this afternoon i saw it heard it the president of the united states talked to samuel winters a man you disapprove of but when you explained why you didnt like him that he withheld endorsements that could help you with congress langford jennings said something that impressed the hell out of me he said to you that if this sam winters disagreed with some policy or other it did not make him an enemy the president frequently doesnt understand who his enemies are he spots ideological allies quickly and sticks by themsometimes too long franklybut often hes too generous to detect those who would erode what he stands for thats about the weakest and most presumptuous argument ive ever heard herbie what are you shielding your man from diverse opinions lets go back to your big surprise congressman i like the topic better im sure you do what do you know that we dont that can help us find out who leaked the oman story essentially what i learned from frank swann as head of the ohiofourzero unit he was the liaison to the secretaries of defense and state as well as the chairman of the joint chiefs all of whom knew about me he told me to rule them out as possible leaks however far out interrupted dennison theyve got softboiled eggs all over their faces they cant answer the simplest questions which makes them look like prime idiots incidentally theyre not idiots and theyve been around long enough to know what maximumclassified is and why its there what else then apart from you and frankly i rule you out only because my surfacing is about as counterproductive as your fractured grey cells could conjure that leaves three other people who are they the first is a man named lester crawford at the central intelligence agency the second the station chief in bahrain james grayson the last is a woman adrienne rashad whos apparently special property and operates out of cairo what about them according to swann theyre the only ones who knew my identity when i was flown over to masqat thats our personnel said dennison pointedly what about your people over there i cant say its impossible but i think its remote the few i reached except for the young sultan are so removed from any contact with washington that id have to consider them last if at all ahmat whom ive known for years certainly wouldnt for a lot of reasons starting with his throne and equally important his ties with this government of the four men i spoke to on the telephone only one responded and he was killed for itundoubtedly with the consent of the others they were frightened out of their skins they didnt want anything to do with me no acknowledgment of my presence in oman whatsoever and that included anyone they knew who did meet me and who might make them suspect youd have to have been there to understand they all live with the terrorist syndrome with daggers at their throatsand at the throat of every member of their families thered been reprisals a son killed a daughter raped and disfigured because cousins or uncles called for action against the palestinians i dont believe any of those men would have spoken my name to a deaf dog christ what kind of a world do those goddamned arabs live in one in which the vast majority try to survive and make lives for themselves and their children and we havent helped you bigoted bastard dennison cocked his head and frowned i may have deserved that shot congressman ill have to think about it not so long ago it was fashionable not to like jews not to trust them and now thats changed and the arabs have taken their place in the scheme of our dislikes maybe its all bullshit who knows but what i want to know now is who sprung you out of the top secret woodwork you figure its someone from our ranks it has to be swann was approachedfraudulently approached as it turns outby a blondhaired man with a european accent who had indepth data on me that information could only have come from government filesmy congressional background check probably he tried to tie me in with the oman situation but swann firmly denied it saying he had specifically turned me down however frank had the impression that the man wasnt convinced we know about the blond spook broke in dennison we cant find him but he dug and found someone else someone who confirmed either intentionally or unintentionally what he was tracking down if we rule you out and if we also rule out state defense and the joint chiefs it has to be crawford grayson or the rashad woman cross out the first two said the white house chief of staff early this morning i grilled crawford right here in this office and he was ready to challenge me to a game of saigon roulette for even suggesting the possibility as far as grayson is concerned i spoke to him in bahrain five hours ago and he damned near had apoplexy thinking we even considered him the leak he read the blackoperations book to me as if i were the dumbest kid on the block who should be thrown into solitary for calling him on an unsecured line in foreign territory like crawford graysons an old line professional neither would risk throwing away his lifes work over you and neither could be tricked into doing it kendrick leaned forward in dennisons chair his elbows on the desk he stared at the far wall of the office a rush of conflicting thoughts racing through his mind khalehla born adrienne rashad had saved his life but had she saved it only to sell him she was also a close friend of ahmat who could be damaged by his association with her and evan had hurt the young sultan enough without adding a turned intelligence agent to the list yet khalehla had understood him when he needed understanding she was kind when he needed kindness because he was so afraidboth for his life and for his inadequacies if she had been tricked into revealing him and he exposed her ineptness she was finished in a job she intensely believed in yet if she had not been tricked if for reasons of her own she had exposed himthen all he would expose was her betrayal which was the truth dupe or liar whichever it was he had to find out for himself without the spectre of official scrutiny above all dupe or liar he had to know who she had contacted or who had contacted her for only the who could answer the why he had been exposed as evan of oman and that he had to learn then out of the seven of you theres only one unaccounted for the woman agreed dennison nodding his head ill put her on a revolving spit over the hottest goddamn fire you ever saw no you wont countered kendrick you and your people wont get near her until i give you the wordif i give it and were going to go one step farther no ones to know youre flying her back hereunder cover i think is the term absolutely no one is that understood who the hell are you weve been through this herbie remember next tuesday in the blue room with the marine band and all those reporters and television cameras ill have a great big platform to climb on if i want to and express a few opinions believe me youll be among the first targets decked ass and all shit may the one being blackmailed be so bold as to ask why this female spook gets preferred treatment sure replied evan his gaze settled on the chief of staff that woman saved my life and youre not going to ruin hers by letting her own people know youve got her under your welladvertised white house shotgun youve done enough of that around here all right all right but lets get one thing clear if shes the sieve you turn her over to me thatll depend said kendrick sitting back on what for christs sake on the how and the why more riddles congressman not for me answered evan suddenly rising from the chair get me out of here dennison also since i cant go home either to my house in virginia or even out to colorado without being swamped can someone in this booby hatch rent me a lodge or a cabin in the country under another name ill pay for a month or whatevers necessary i just want a few days to figure things out before i go back to the office its been taken care of said the chief of staff abruptly actually it was jenningss ideato put you on ice over the weekend in one of those sterile houses in maryland what the hell is a sterile house please use language i can understand lets put it this way youre the guest of the president of the united states in a place no one can find that is reserved for people we dont want found it dovetailed with my considered opinion that langford jennings should make the first public statements about you youve been seen here and as sure as rabbits have little rabbits the wordll get out youre the scenario writer what do we saywhat do you say since im in isolation thats easy your safety its the presidents primary concern after conferring with our counterterrorist experts dont worry our writers will come up with something thatll make the women cry into their handkerchiefs and the men want to go out and march in a parade and since jennings has the last word in these things itll probably include some whackedup image of a powerful knight of the round table looking after a brave younger brother who carried out a joint dangerous mission shit and if theres any truth to the reprisal theory added kendrick itll make me a target thatd be nice agreed dennison nodding again call me when youve made arrangements for the rashad woman evan sat in a long leather chair in the study of the impressive sterile house on marylands eastern shore in the township of cynwid hollow outside within the walls of the floodlit grounds guards moved in and out of the lights as they patrolled every foot of the acreage their rifles at the ready their eyes alert kendrick snapped off the third replay he had watched on television of president langford jenningss suddenly called press conference regarding one congressman evan kendrick of colorado it was more outrageous than dennison had projected filled with gutwrenching pauses accompanied by a constant series of wellrehearsed grins that so obviously conveyed the pride and the agony beneath the surface of the smile the president once again said everything in general terms and nothing specificexcept in one area until all proper security measures are in place i have asked congressman kendrick a man we are all so proud of to remain in protective seclusion and with this request i hereby give dire warning should cowardly terrorists anywhere make any attempt on the life of my good friend my close colleague someone i look upon no less than i would a younger brother the full might of the united states will be employed by ground sea and air against determined enclaves of those responsible determined oh my god a telephone rang evan looked around trying to find out where it was it was across the room on a desk he swung his legs down and walked to the startlingly intrusive instrument yes shes flying over on military transport with a senior attaché from the embassy in cairo shes listed as a secretarial aide the names unimportant the eta is seven oclock in the morning our time shell be in maryland by ten at the latest what does she know nothing you had to say something insisted kendrick she was told it was new and urgent instructions from her government instructions that could be transmitted only in person over here she bought that nonsense she didnt have a choice she was picked up at her flat in cairo and has been in protective custody ever since have a lousy night you bastard thanks herbie evan hung up the phone both relieved and frightened by the prospect of tomorrow mornings confrontation with the woman he had known as khalehla a woman he had made love to in a frenzy of fear and exhaustion that impulsive act and the desperation that led to it must be forgotten he had to determine whether he was remeeting an enemy or a friend but at least there was now a schedule for the next twelve or fifteen hours it was time to call ann oreilly and through her contact manny it did not matter who knew where he was he was the official guest of the president of the united states the icarus agenda chapter emmanuel weingrass sat in the red plastic booth with the stocky moustached owner of the mesa verde cafe the past two hours had been stressful for manny somewhat reminiscent of those crazy days in paris when he had worked with the mossad the current situation was nowhere near as melodramatic and his adversaries were hardly lethal but still he was an elderly man who had to get from one place to another without being seen or stopped in paris he had to run a gauntlet of terrorist scouts without being noticed from sacrecoeur to the boulevard de la madeleine here in colorado he had to get from evans house to the town of mesa verde without being stopped and locked up by his team of nurses all of whom were charging about because of the activity outside how did you do it asked gonzalezgonzalez the cafes owner as he poured weingrass a glass of whisky civilized mans second oldest need for privacy geegee the toilet i went to the toilet and climbed out a window then i mingled with the crowd taking pictures with one of evans cameras like a real photographer you know until i got a taxi here hey man interrupted gonzalezgonzalez those cats are making dinero today thieves they are i climbed in and the first thing the goniff said to me was one hundred dollars to the airport mister so i said to him taking off my hat the state taxi commission will be interested to hear about the new verde rates and he says to me oh its you mr weingrass just a joke mr weingrass and i then tell him charge em two hundred and take me to geegees both men broke into loud laughter as the pay telephone on the wall beyond the booth erupted in a staccato ring gonzalez placed his hand on mannys arm let garcia get it he said why you said my boy called twice before garcia knows what to say i just told him tell me hell give the congressman the number of my office phone and tell him to call back in two minutes geegee what the hell are you doing a couple of minutes after you came in a gringo i dont know arrived so what you get plenty of people in here you dont know he doesnt belong here manny he aint got no raincoat or no hat or no camera but he still dont belong here hes got on a suitwith a vest weingrass started to turn his head donti ordered gonzalez now gripping weingrasss arm every now and then he looks over here from his table hes got you on his mind so what do we do just wait and get up when i tell you to the waiter named garcia hung up the pay phone coughed once and went over to the darksuited redhaired stranger he leaned down and said something close to the welldressed customers face the man stared coldly at his unexpected messenger the waiter shrugged and crossed back to the bar the man slowly unobtrusively put several bills on the table got up and walked out by the nearby entrance now whispered gonzalezgonzalez rising and gesturing for manny to follow him ten seconds later they were in the owners dishevelled office the congressman will call back in about a minute said geegee indicating the chair behind a desk that had seen better days decades before youre sure it was kendrick asked weingrass garcias cough told me yes what did he say to the guy at the table that he believed the message on the telephone must be for him since no other customer fitted his description what was the message quite simple amigo it was important for him to contact his people outside just that he left didnt he that tells us something doesnt it like what una he has people to reach no dos they are either outside this grand establishment or he can talk to them by other means of communication namely a fancy telephone in an automobile yes tres he did not come in here in his alsofancy suit to have a texmex beer that practically chokes himas my fine sparkling wine chokes you no cuatro he is no doubt federal government asked manny astonished personally of course i have never been involved with illegal immigrants crossing the borders from my beloved country to the south but the stories reach even such innocents as myself we know what to look for my friend comprende hermano i always said said weingrass sitting behind the desk find the classiest nonclass joints in town and you can learn more about life than in all the sewers of paris paris france means a great deal to you doesnt it manny its fading amigo im not sure why but its fading somethings happening here with my boy and i cant understand it but its important he means much to you also yes he is my son the telephone rang and weingrass yanked it up to his ear as gonzalezgonzalez went out of the door airhead is that you what have you got out there manny asked kendrick over the line from the sterile house on marylands eastern shore a mossad unit covering you far more effective answered the old architect from the bronx there are no accountants no cpas counting the shekels over an egg cream now you what the hell happened i dont know i swear i dont know evan recounted his day in detail from sabri hassans startling news about the oman revelations while he was in his pool to his hiding out in a cheap motel in virginia from his confrontation with frank swann of the state department to his arrival at the white house under escort from his hostile meeting with the white house chief of staff to his eventual presentation to the president of the united states who proceeded to louse up everything by scheduling an award ceremony in the blue room next tuesdaywith the marine band finally to the fact that the woman named khalehla who had first saved his life in bahrain was in reality a case officer in the central intelligence agency and was being flown over for him to question from what youve told me she had nothing to do with exposing you why not because you believed her when she said she was an arab filled with shame you told me that in some ways airhead i know you better than you know yourself you are not easily fooled about such matters its what made you so good with the kendrick group for this woman to expose you would only add to her shame and further inflame the crazy world she lives in shes the only one left manny the others wouldnt they couldnt then there are others beyond others for gods sake uio these were the only people who knew i was there you just said this swann told you a blond creep with a foreign accent figured you were in masqat where did he get his information no one can find him not even the white house maybe i know people who can find him interrupted weingrass no manny insisted kendrick firmly this isnt paris and those israelis are way off limits i owe them too much although some day id like you to explain to me the interest they had in a certain hostage at the embassy i was never told said weingrass i knew there was an initial plan the unit had trained for and i assumed it was designed to reach someone inside but they never discussed it in front of me those people know how to keep their mouths shut whats your next move tomorrow morning with the rashad woman i told you after that you havent been watching television im at geegees he only allows videotapes remember hes got a replay on one of the eightytwo series and most everyone at the bar thinks its today whats on television the president he announced that im in protective seclusion sounds like jail to me in a way it is but the prisons tolerable and the wardens given me privileges do i get a number i wouldnt know it theres nothing printed on the phone only a blank strip but ill keep you informed ill call you if i move nobody could trace this line and it doesnt matter if they did okay now let me ask you something did you mention me to anyone good god no you may be in the classified oman file and i did say that a lot of other people deserved credit beside myself but i never used your name why im being followed what its a wrinkle i dont like geegee says the clown on my tail is federal and that there are others with him maybe dennison picked you out from the file and assigned you protection from what even in paris im vaulttightif i wasnt id have been dead three years ago and what makes you think im in any file outside the unit no one knew my name and none of our names were used in that conference the morning we all left finally airhead if im being protected itd be a good idea to let me know about it because if im dangerous enough to warrant that kind of protection i might just blow the head off someone i dont know protecting me as usual said kendrick you may have an ounce of logic in your normal pound of implausibility ill check on it do that i may not have too many years left but i wouldnt want them cut short by a bullet in my headfrom either side call me tomorrow because now ive got to get back to the coven before the inhabitants report my departure to the head police warlock give my regards to geegee added evan and tell him that when im home hes to stay the hell out of the importing business also thank him manny kendrick hung up the phone his hand still on it he picked it up and dialled operator said a somewhat hesitant female voice after more unanswered rings than seemed normal im not sure why began evan but i have an idea that youre not an ordinary runofthemill operator for the bell telephone company sir it doesnt matter miss my name is kendrick and i have to reach mr herbert dennison the white house chief of staff as soon as possibleits urgent im asking you to do your best to find him and have him call me within the next five minutes if thats impossible ill be forced to call my secretarys husband whos a lieutenant on the washington police and tell him im being held prisoner at a location im fairly certain i can identify accurately sir please i think im being reasonable and very clear interrupted evan mr dennison is to contact me within the next five minutes and the countdowns begun thank you operator have a good day again kendrick hung up the phone but now he removed his hand and walked over to a wall bar which held an ice bucket and assorted bottles of expensive whisky he poured himself a drink looked at his watch and proceeded towards a large casement window that looked out on the rear floodlit grounds he was amused at the sight of a croquet lawn bordered by white wroughtiron furniture he was less amused by the sight of a marine guard dressed in the casual unmilitary uniform of the estates staff he was pacing a garden path near the stone wall his uncasual very military repeating rifle angled in front manny was right he was in jail moments later the telephone rang and the congressman from colorado walked back to it hello herbie how are you how am i you son of a bitch im in the goddamned shower thats how i am wet what do you want i want to know why weingrass is being followed i want to know why his name ever surfaced anywhere and youd better have a damn good explanation like his personal wellbeing back up ingrate said the chief of staff curtly what the hell is a weingrass something put out by manischewitz emmanuel weingrass is an architect of international renown hes also a close friend of mind and hes staying at my house in colorado and for reasons that i dont have to give you his being there is extremely confidential where and to whom have you circulated his name i cant circulate what ive never heard of you fruitcake youre not lying to me are you herbie because if you are i can make the next few weeks very embarrassing for you if i thought that lying would get you off my back id go to the well but i havent got any lies where a weingrass is concerned i dont know who he is so help me you read the debriefing reports on oman didnt you its one file and buried of course i read it weingrasss name never appeared no and id remember if it did its a funny name not to weingrass kendrick paused but not long enough for dennison to interrupt could anyone in the cia or nsa or any of those outfits put a guest of mine under surveillance without informing you no way shouted the white house suzerain where you and the troubles youve laid on us are concerned no one moves sideways for an inch without my knowing about it one last question in the oman file was there any mention of the person flying back with me from bahrain it was dennisons turn to pause youre a little obvious congressman youre a little closer to those softboiled eggs over your face if you think im bad news for you and your man now dont even speculate on the architects connection leave it alone ill leave it alone agreed the chief of staff with a name like weingrass i can make another connection and it scares me like the mossad good now just answer my question what was in the file about the flight from bahrain to andrews the cargo consisted of you and an old arab in western clothes a longtime subagent for cons op who was being flown over for medical treatment his name was ali somethingorother state cleared him and he vanished thats straight kendrick no one in this government is aware of a mr weingrass thanks herb thanks for the herb is there anything i can do evan stared at the casement window then at the floodlit grounds and the marine guard outside and everything the scene represented im going to do you a favour and say no he said softly at least for now but you can clarify something for me this phone has a tap on it doesnt it not the usual variety theres a little black box like those on aircraft it has to be removed by authorized personnel and the tapes processed under the strictest security measures can you stop the operation for say thirty minutes or so until i contact someone youd want it that way believe me ill accept that sure theres an override on the line our people use it a lot when theyre in those houses give me five minutes and call moscow if you like five minutes may i go back to my shower now try bleach this time kendrick replaced the phone and took out his wallet slipping his index finger under the flap behind his colorado drivers licence he removed the scrap of paper with frank swanns two private telephone numbers written on it and again looked at his watch he would wait ten minutes and hope that the deputy director of consular operations was at one place or the other he was at his apartment of course after curt greetings evan explained where he waswhere he thought he was hows protective seclusion asked swann sounding weary ive been to several of those places when weve interrogated defectors i hope youve got one with stables or at least two pools one inside naturally theyre all alike i think the government buys them as political payoffs for the rich who get tired of their big houses and want to buy new ones gratis i hope somebodys listening i dont have a pool any more theres a croquet lawn ive seen that small time what have you got to tell me am i any closer to getting off the hook maybe at least ive tried to take some heat off you frank ive got to ask you a question and we can both say anything we like use any names we like theres no tap on the phone here now who told you that dennison and you believed him incidentally i couldnt care less if this transcripts given to him i believe him because he has a clue as to what im going to say and wants to put a couple of thousand miles between the administration and what were going to talk about he said were on an override hes right hes afraid of some loose cannon hearing your words what is it manny weingrass and through him linkage to the mossad i told you thats a nono broke in the deputy director okay were really on override go ahead dennison told me that the oman file lists the cargo on the plane from bahrain to andrews air force base on that last morning as consisting of me and an old arab in western clothing who was a subagent for consular operations and who was being brought over here for medical treatment interrupted swann after years of invaluable cooperation our clandestine services owed ali saada and his family that much youre sure that was the wording who would know it better i wrote it you then you knew it was weingrass it wasnt difficult your instructions relayed by grayson were pretty damned clear you demandeddemanded mind youthat an unnamed person accompany you on that plane back to the states i was covering for the mossad obviously and so was i you see bringing someone in like that is against the rulesforget the lawunless hes on our books so i put him on the books as someone else but how did you know it was manny that was the easiest part i spoke to the chief of the bahrainian royal guards who was assigned as your covert escort the physical description was probably enough but when he told me that the old bastard kicked one of his men in the knee because he let you stumble getting into the car to the airport i knew it was weingrass his reputation as they say has always preceded him i appreciate your doing that said evan softly both for him and for me it was the only way of thanking you that i could think of then i can assume that no one in washington intelligence circles knows that weingrass was involved in oman absolutely forget masqat hes a nonperson hes just not among the living over here dennison didnt even know who he was of course not hes being followed frank out in colorado hes under someones surveillance not ours eight hundred and ninetyfive feet due north of the sterile house on the waters of chesapeake bay was the estate of dr samuel winters honoured historian and for over forty years friend and adviser to presidents of the united states in his younger days the immensely wealthy academic was considered an outstanding sportsman trophies for polo tennis skiing and sailing lined the shelves of his private study attesting to his former skills now there remained for the ageing educator a more passive game that had been a minor passion with the winters family for generations initially making its appearance on the lawn of their mansion in oyster bay during the early twenties the game was croquet and whenever any member of the family built a new property among the first considerations was a proper lawn for the very official course that never deviated from the y foot dimensions prescribed by the national croquet association in so one of the sights that caught the eye of a visitor to dr winters estate was the croquet lawn to the right of the enormous house above the waters of the chesapeake its charm was enhanced by the many pieces of white wroughtiron furniture that bordered the course areas of respite for those studying their next moves or having a drink the scene was identical with the croquet course at the sterile house feet to the south of winters property and it was only fitting that it should be for all the land upon which both mansions stood originally belonged to samuel winters five years agowith the silent resurrection of inver brassdr winters had quietly donated the south estate to the united states government for use as a safe or sterile house in order to deter the amiably curious and divert hostile probes by potential enemies of the united states the transaction was never revealed according to the property records filed in the town hall of cynwid hollow the house and grounds still belonged to samuel and martha jennifer winters the latter deceased and for it the familys accountants annually paid the inordinately high shoreline taxes refunded secretly by a grateful government if any of the curious friendly or unfriendly alike inquired into the activity at this aristocratic compound they were invariably told that it never stopped that cars and caterers carried and cared for the great and the near great of the academic world and industry all representing the varied interests of samuel winters a squad of strong young gardeners kept the place immaculate and also served as staff seeing to the needs of the constant stream of visitors the image conveyed was that of a multimillionaires multipurpose think tank in the countrysidefar too open to be anything but what it purported to be to maintain the integrity of that image all bills were sent to samuel winters accountants who promptly paid them with duplicates of these payments forwarded to the historians personal lawyer who in turn had them handdelivered to the department of state for covert reimbursement it was a simple arrangement and beneficial to all concerned as simple and as beneficial as it was for dr winters to suggest to president langford jennings that congressman evan kendrick might simply benefit from a few days out of the media limelight at the safe house south of his property since there was no activity there at the time the president gratefully concurred he would have herb dennison take care of the arrangements milos varak removed the large antiimpedance earphones from his head and shut down the electronic console on the table in front of him he swung his chair to the left snapped a switch on the nearby wall and instantly heard the quiet gears that lowered the directional dish on the roof he then got out of the chair and wandered aimlessly around the sophisticated communications equipment in the soundproof studio in the cellars of samuel winters house he was alarmed what he had overheard on the telephone intercept from the sterile house was beyond his understanding as the state departments swann so unequivocally confirmed no one in the washington intelligence community was aware of emmanual weingrass they had no idea that the old arab who had flown back from bahrain with evan kendrick was weingrass in swanns words his thank you to evan kendrick for the congressmans efforts in oman was to get weingrass secretly out of bahrain and with equal secrecy into the united states by using a disguise and a cover the man and the cover had bureaucratically disappeared weingrass was virtually a nonperson also swanns deception was mandatory because of weingrasss mossad connection a deception thoroughly understood by kendrick in point of fact the congressman himself had taken extreme measures to conceal the presence and the identity of his elderly friend milos had learned that the old man had been entered into the hospital under the name of manfred weinstein and put in a room in a private wing with its own secluded entrance and that upon release he had been flown to colorado in a private jet to mesa verde everything was private weingrasss name was never recorded anywhere and during the months of his convalescence the irascible architect only infrequently left the house and never for places where the congressman was known damn thought varak except for kendricks close personal circle that excluded everyone but a trusted secretary her husband an arab couple in virginia and three overpaid nurses whose generous salaries included total confidentiality emmanuel weingrass did not exist varak walked back to the console table disengaged the record button rewound the tape and found the words he wanted to hear again then i can assume that no one in washington intelligence circles knows that weingrass was involved in oman absolutely forget masqat hes a nonperson hes just not among the living over here dennison didnt even know who he was of course not hes being followed frank out in colorado hes under someones surveillance not ours not ours whose that question was what alarmed varak the only people who knew that there was an emmanuel weingrass who had been told how much that old man meant to evan kendrick were the five members of inver brass could one of them milos did not want to think any more at the moment it was too painful for him adrienne rashad was snapped awake by the sudden turbulence encountered by the military aircraft she looked across the aisle in the dimly lit cabin with its lessthanfirstclass accommodation the attaché from the embassy in cairo was obviously upsetafraid to be precise yet the man was experienced enough with such transport to bring along a comforting friend specifically an outsized leatherbound flask which he literally ripped out of his briefcase and drank from until he was aware that his cargo was looking at him sheepishly he held up the flask towards her she shook her head and spoke over the sound of the jet engines just potholes she said hey pals cried the voice of the pilot over the intercom sorry about the potholes but im afraid this weathers unavoidable for about another thirty minutes or so we have to stick to our channel and away from commercial routes you should have flown the friendly skies buddies hang on the attaché drank once again from the flask this time longer and more fully than before adrienne turned away the arab in her telling her not to observe a mans fear the western woman in her makeup saying that as an experienced military flier she should allay her companions fear the synthesis in her won the argument she smiled reassuringly at the attaché and returned to her thoughts that had been broken off by sleep why had she been so peremptorily ordered back to washington if there were new instructions so delicate that they could not be put on scramblers why hadnt mitchell payton called her with at least a clue it wasnt like uncle mitch to permit any interference with her work unless he told her something about it even with the oman mess last year and if ever there was a priority situation that was it mitch had sent sealed instructions to her by diplomatic courier telling her without explanation to cooperate with the state departments consular operations no matter how offended she might be she had and it had offended her indeed now out of the blue she had been ordered back to the states virtually incommunicado without a single word from mitchell payton congressman evan kendrick for the past eighteen hours his name had rolled across the world like the sound of approaching thunder one could almost see the frightened faces of those who had been involved with the american looking up at the sky wondering if they should run for cover run for their lives under the threat of the impending storm there would be vendettas against those who had aided the interfering man from the west she wondered who had leaked the storyno leaked was too innocuous a wordwho had exploded the story the cairo papers were filled with it and a quick check confirmed that throughout the middle east evan kendrick was either a holy saint or a hideous sinner canonization or an agonizing death awaited him depending upon the stance of those judging him even within the same country why was it kendrick himself who had done this had this vulnerable man this improbable politician who had risked his life to avenge a terrible crime decided after a year of humility and selfdenial to strike out for a political prize if so it was not the man she had known so briefly yet so intimately fourteen months ago with reservations but not regret she remembered they had made loveimprobably frenetically perhaps inevitably under the circumstancesbut those transient moments of splendid comfort were to be forgotten if she had been brought back to washington because of a suddenly ambitious congressman they had never existed the icarus agenda chapter kendrick stood by the windows overlooking the wide circular drive in front of the sterile house dennison had called him well over an hour ago with word that the plane from cairo had landed and the rashad woman been taken to a waiting government car she was on her way to cynwid hollow under escort the chief of staff wanted evan to know that the cia case officer had strenuously objected when she was not permitted to make a telephone call from andrews air force base she kicked up a stink and refused to get in the car dennison had complained she said she hadnt heard directly from her superiors and the air force could go pound sand goddamned bitch i was on my way to work and they reached me on the limo phone you know what she said to me who the hell are you thats what she said to me then to twist the knife she holds the phone away and asks out loud whats a dennison its that modest low profile you keep herb did anybody tell her the bastards laughed thats when i told her she was under the presidents orders and she either got in that car or she could spend five years in leavenworth its a mens prison i know that heh shell be there in an hour or so remember if shes the sieve i get her maybe ill get a presidential order and ill read it on the nightly news with footnotes shit kendrick had started to leave the window for another cup of coffee when a nondescript grey car appeared at the base of the circular drive it swept around the curve and stopped in front of the stone steps where an air force major swiftly got out of the far backseat he walked rapidly round and opened the curbside door for his official passenger the woman evan had known as khalehla emerged into the morning sunlight squinting at the brightness disturbed and unsure she was hatless her dark hair hanging to her shoulders over a white jacket above green slacks and lowheeled shoes under her right arm she clutched a large white handbag as kendrick watched her the memory of that late afternoon in bahrain came back to him he recalled the shock he had felt when she walked through the door of the bizarre royal bedroom amused that he had raced back for the cover of the bed sheet and how despite his panic bewilderment and painor perhaps adding to all threehe had been struck by the cool loveliness of her sharply defined euroarabian face and the glare of intelligence in her eyes he had been right she was a striking woman who carried herself erect almost defiantly even now as she walked towards the massive door of the sterile house where inside she would face the unknown kendrick observed her dispassionately there was no rush of remembered warmth in his reaction to her only cold intense curiosity she had lied to him that late afternoon in bahrain lied both by what she said and what she did not say he wondered if she would lie to him again the air force major opened the door of the enormous living room for adrienne rashad she walked in and stopped standing motionless staring at evan by the window there was no astonishment in her eyes just that frigid glare of intellect ill be going said the air force officer thank you major the door closed and kendrick stepped forward hello khalehla it was khalehla wasnt it whatever you say she replied calmly but then it isnt khalehla is it its adrienneadrienne rashad whatever you say she repeated thats a little redundant isnt it and all this is very stupid congressman did you have me flown back here to give you another testimonial because if you did i wont do it testimonial thats the last thing i want good im glad for you im sure the representative from colorado has all the endorsements he needs so theres no need for someone whose life and the lives of a great many colleagues depend on anonymity to step forward and add to your swelling cheers thats what you think i want endorsements cheers what am i to think that you took me away from my work exposed me to the embassy and the air force probably crippled a cover ive developed over the past several years just because i went to bed with you it happened once but i assure you it will never happen again hey wait a minute bright lady protested evan i wasnt looking for any fast action for christs sake i didnt know where i was or what had happened or what would happen next i was scared stiff and knew i had things to do that i didnt think i could do you were also exhausted added adrienne rashad i was too it happens thats what swann said that bastard no hold it frank swanns not a bastard shall i use another word like pimp an unconscionable pimp youre wrong i dont know what your business was with him but he had a job to do like sacrificing you maybe i admit the thoughts not too attractive but he was pretty well boxed in then forget it congressman why am i here because i have to learn something and youre the only one left who can tell me what is it who broke the story on me who violated the agreement i made i was told that those who knew i went to oman and they were damn few a tight little circle they called itnone of them would have any reason to do it and every reason in the world not to apart from swann and his computer chief whom he swears by there were only seven people in the entire government who knew six have been checked out all absolutely negative youre the seventh the only one left adrienne rashad stood motionless her face passive her eyes furious you ignorant arrogant amateur she said slowly her voice acid you can call me any goddamned names you like began evan angrily but im going to may we go for a walk congressman broke in the woman from cairo crossing to a large bay window on the other side of the room that looked over a dock to the rocky shoreline of the chesapeake what the air in here is as oppressive as the company id like to take a walk please rashad raised her hand and pointed outside she then nodded her head twice as if reinforcing a command all right mumbled kendrick bewildered theres a side entrance back there i see it said adriennekhalehla moving towards the door at the rear of the room they walked outside on to a flagstone patio that joined a manicured lawn and a path leading down to the dock if there had been boats lashed to the pilings or secured to the empty moorings bouncing on the water beyond they had been removed for the autumn winds keep up your harangue congressman continued the undercover case officer for the cia you shouldnt be deprived of that just hold it miss rashad or whatever the hell your name is evan stopped on the white concrete path halfway to the shoreline if you think what im talking about amounts to a harangue youre sadly mistaken for gods sake keep walking youll get all the conversation you want more than you want you damn fool the bay shore to the right of the dock was a mixture of dark sand ands tones so common to the chesapeake to the left was the boathouse also common what was not common however except to the larger estates was a profusion of tall trees some fifty yards both north and south of the dock and the boathouse they provided a measure of privacy more in appearance than in reality but the sight of them had appealed to the field agent from cairo she headed to the right over the sand and the stones close to the gently lapping waves they passed the border of trees and kept going until they reached a large rock that rose out of the ground by the waters edge above the immense house could not be seen thisll do said adrienne rashad do exclaimed kendrick what was that little exercise all afeowf and while were at it lets get a couple of things straight i appreciate the fact that you probably saved my lifeprobably not by any manner of means provablebut i dont take orders from you and in my considered opinion im not a damn fool and regardless of my amateur status youre answering to me im not answering to you check and double check lady are you finished i havent even begun then before you do let me address the specifics youve just raised that little exercise was to get us out of there i presume you know its a safe house certainly and that anything you say in every room including the toilet and the shower is recorded well i knew the telephone was thank you mr amateur i dont have a damn thing to hide keep your voice down talk into the water as i am what why electronic voice surveillance the trees will distort sound because theres no direct visual beam what lasers have improved the technology what shut up whisper i repeat i havent got a damn thing to hide maybe you do but i dont really asked rashad leaning against the huge rock and talking down into the small slowly encroaching waves you want to involve ahmat ive mentioned him to the president he should know how much help that kid was oh ahmat will appreciate that and his personal doctor and his two cousins who helped you and protected you and elbaz and the pilot who flew you to bahrain they could all be killed apart from ahmat i never mentioned anyone specifically names are irrelevant functions arent for christs sake it was the president of the united states and contrary to rumours he does communicate beyond a microphone of course do you know who he talks to do you know them personally do you know how reliable they are in terms of maximum security does he do you know the men who are on the listening devices up in that house of course not what about me im a field officer with an acceptable cover in cairo would you have talked about me i did but only to swann im not referring to what you did with someone in authority who knew everything because he was the control im talking about up there if you started questioning me up in that house mightnt you have brought up any or all the people ive just mentioned and to break the bank mr amateur isnt it conceivable that you might have mentioned the mossad evan closed his eyes i might have he said softly nodding if wed got into an argument an argument was unavoidable which is why i got us out and came down here everyone up there is on our side protested kendrick im sure they are agreed adrienne but we dont know the strengths or the weaknesses of people weve never met and cant see do we youre paranoid it goes with the territory congressman furthermore you are a damn fool as i think ive amply demonstrated by your lack of knowledge about safe houses ill skip the question as to who gives orders to whom because its irrelevant and go back to your first point in all likelihood i did not save your life in bahrain but instead because of that bastard swann put you in an untenable position we and certain pilots call the point of no return you were not expected to survive mr kendrick and i did object to that why because i cared because ue that too is irrelevant you were a decent man trying to do a decent thing for which you werent equipped as it turned out there were others who helped you far more than i ever could i sat in jimmy graysons office and we were both relieved when we got word you were airborne out of bahrain gray son he was one of the seven who knew i was there not until the last hours he didnt said rashad even i wouldnt tell him it had to come from washington in white house language he was put on the spit yesterday morning for what to see if he was the one who leaked my name jimmy thats even more stupid than thinking it was me grayson wants a directorship so badly he can taste it also he doesnt care to have his throat slit and his body mutilated any more than i do you say those words very easily they come quickly to you maybe too quickly about jimmy no about yourself i see the woman who had called herself khalehla moved away from the rock you think ive rehearsed all thiswith myself of course because i damn well couldnt reach anyone else and of course im half arab you walked into the room up there as if you expected to see me i wasnt any surprise to you i did and you werent why and why not on both counts process of elimination i supposeand an arrangement a man i know who protects me from real surprises for the last day and a half youve been hot news throughout the mediterranean congressman and a lot of people are shaking including myself not only for myself but for many others i used and misused to keep you in sight someone like me builds a network based on trust and right now that trust my most vital commodity has been called into question so you see mr kendrick youve wasted not only my time and my concentration but a great deal of the taxpayers money to bring me back here for a question any experienced intelligence officer could answer you could have sold me sold my name for a price for what my life for the lives of those i used to track you men who are important to me and the work i dowork i think has real value which i tried to explain to you in bahrain you really believe that oh jesus i dont know what to believe admitted evan expelling his breath and shaking his head everything i wanted to do everything id planned has been thrown out in the garbage ahmat doesnt want to see me again i cant go backthere or anywhere else in the emirates or the gulfs hell see to it you wanted to go back more than anything i wanted to take up my life again where i did my best work but first i had to find and get rid of a son of a bitch whod crippled everything killed for the sake of killingso many the mahdi interrupted rashad nodding ahmat told me you did it ahmats young and hell change in time hell understand what you did for everyone over there and be grateful but you just answered a question you see i thought that you might have blown the story yourself but you didnt did you me youre out of your mind im getting out of here in six months theres no political ambition then christ no im packing it in im leaving only now i have nowhere to go someones trying to stop me making me into something im not what the hell is happening to me offhand id say you were being exhumed being what by whom by someone who thinks you were slighted someone who believes you deserve public acclaim prominence which i dont want and the president isnt helping hes awarding me the medal of freedom next tuesday in the goddamned blue room with the whole marine band i told him i didnt want it and the son of a bitch said i had to show up because he refused to look like a chintzy bastard what kind of reasoning is that very presidential rashad suddenly stopped lets walk she said quickly as two whitesuited members of the staff appeared at the base of the dock dont look around be casual well just stroll down this poor excuse for a beach may i talk asked kendrick as he fell in step not anything germane wait till we get around the bend why can they hear us possibly im not really sure they followed the curve of the shoreline until the trees obscured the two men on the dock the japanese have developed directional relays although ive never seen one continued rashad aimlessly then she stopped again and looked up at evan her intelligent eyes questioning you spoke to ahmat she asked yesterday he told me to go to hell but not to go back to oman ever you understand that ill check with him dont you evan was suddenly astonished then angry she was questioning him accusing him checking up on him i dont give damn what you do my only concern is what you may have done youre convincing kahlehlaexcuse me miss rashadand you may believe what you say but the six men who knew about me had everything to lose and not a goddamned thing to gain by saying that i was in masqat last year and i had nothing to lose but my life and the lives of those ive cultivated throughout the sector some of whom incidentally are very dear to me stop that tired old argument congressman you sound ridiculous youre not only an amateur youre insufferable you know its possible you could have made a mistake cried kendrick exasperated id almost be willing to give you the benefit of the doubt i implied as much to dennison and told him i wouldnt let him hang you for it oh youre too kind sir no i meant it you did save my life and if you made a slip and dropped my name dont compound your asininity rashad broke in its far far more likely that any five of the others might have made a slip like that than either grayson or myself we live in the field we dont make that kind of mistake lets walk said evan no guards in sight only his doubts and his confusion forcing him to move his problem was that he believed her believed what manny weingrass said about her she had nothing to do with exposing you it would only add to her shame and further inflame the crazy world she lives in and when kendrick protested that the others couldnt have manny had added then there are others beyond others they came to a rough track that led up through the trees apparently to the stone wall bordering the estate shall we explore asked evan why not said adrienne coldly look he continued as they climbed the wooded slope side by side say i believe you thank you so much all right i do believe you and because i do im going to tell you something that only swann and dennison know the others dont at least i dont think they do are you sure you should i need help and they cant help me maybe you can you were therewith meand you know so many things i dont know how events are kept quiet how secret information is passed to those who should have it procedures like that i know some not all by any means im based in cairo not here but go ahead some time ago a man came to see swann a blond man with a european accent who had a great deal of information about mefrank called it pd prior data said rashad interrupting its also called privileged detail and usually comes from the vaults vaults what vaults its the vernacular for classified intelligence files go on after impressing frank really impressing him he came right out and made his point he told swann that he had concluded that id been sent to masqat by the state department during the hostage crisis what she exploded her hand on kendricks arm who was he nobody knows no one can find him the identity he used to get to frank was false good christ whispered rashad as she looked up at the ascending path bright sunlight broke through the wall of trees above well stay here for a moment she said quietly urgently sit down they both lowered themselves on to the track surrounded by thick trunks and foliage and pressed the woman from cairo well swann tried to throw him off he even showed him a note to the secretary of state that we both mocked up rejecting me obviously the man didnt believe frank and kept digging deeper and deeper until he got it all what came out yesterday morning was so accurate it could only have come from the oman filefrom the vaults as you call them i know that whispered rashad her anger indelibly mixed with fear my god someone was reached one of the sevensix he amended quickly who were they i dont mean swann and his ohiofourzero computer man but apart from dennison grayson and me the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs none of them could even be approached what about the computer man his name is bryce gerald bryce and hes young frank swore by him but thats only his judgment i doubt it frank swanns a bastard but i dont think he could be fooled that way someone like bryce is the first person youd think of and if hes smart enough to run that kind of operation he knows it he also knows he could face thirty years in leavenworth evan smiled i understand dennison threatened you with five years there i told him it was a mens prison said adrienne responding with a grin so did i said kendrick laughing so then i said if he had any more goodies in store for me i wouldnt get in cleopatras barge never mind the government car why did you get in sheer curiosity its the only answer i can give you i accept it so where are we the seven are out and a blond european is in i dont know suddenly rashad touched his arm again ive got to ask you some questions evan evan thank you im sorry congressman that was a slip dont be please i think were entitled to first names now you stop but do you mind if i call you khalehla im more comfortable with it so am i the arab part of me has always resented the deniability of adrienne ask your questionskhalehla at least youre not pronouncing it cawleyla all right when did you decide to come to masqat considering the circumstances and what you were able to do you were late getting there kendrick took a deep breath id been riding the rapids in arizona when i reached a base camp called lava falls and heard a radio for the first time in several weeks i knew i had to get to washington evan recounted the details of those frantic eight hours going from a comparatively primitive campsite in the mountains to the halls of the state department and finally down to the sophisticated computer complex that was ohiofourzero thats where swann and i made our agreement and i was off and running lets go back a minute said khalehla only at that moment taking her eyes off kendricks face you hired a river plane to take you to flagstaff where you tried to charter a jet to dc is that right yes but the charter desk said it was too late you were anxious suggested the field agent probably angry you must have thrown your weight around a bit a congressman from the great state of colorado et cetera more than a bitand lots more of the et cetera you reached phoenix and got the first commercial flight out how did you pay for your ticket credit card bad form said khalehla but you had no reason to think so how did you know whom to reach at the state department i didnt but remember id worked in oman and the emirates for years so i knew the sort of person i wanted to find and since i had inherited an experienced dc secretary who had the instincts of an alley cat i told her what to look for i made it clear that it would undoubtedly be someone in the states consular operations middle east or southwest asia sections most americans whove worked over there are familiar with those peoplefrequently up to their teeth so this secretary with the instincts of an alley cat began calling around asking questions that must have raised a few eyebrows did she keep a list of whom she called i dont know i never asked her everything was kind of frantic and i kept in touch with her on one of those airtoground phones during the flight from phoenix by the time i landed she had narrowed the possibilities down to four or five men but only one was considered an expert on the emirates and he was also a deputy director of cons op frank swann it would be interesting to know if your secretary did keep a list said khalehla arching her neck thinking ill phone her not from here you wont besides im not finished so you went to state to find swann which means you checked in with security naturally did you check out well no not actually not at the lobby desk instead i was taken down to the parking area and driven home in a state department car to your house yes i was on my way to oman and had to get some things together what about the driver interrupted khalehla did he address you by name no never but he did say something that shook me i asked him if he wanted to come in for a snack or coffee while i packed and he said i might get shot if i got out of this car or words to that effect then he added youre from ohiofourzero which means he wasnt said rashad quickly and you were in front of your house yes then i stepped out and saw another car about a hundred feet behind us at the curb it must have been following us there are no other houses on that stretch of road an armed escort khalehla nodded swann covered you from minuteone and he was right he didnt have the time or the resources to trace everything that had happened to you minusone evan was bewildered would you mind explaining that minusone is before you reached swann a rich angry congressman using a chartered plane to flagstaff makes a lot of noise about getting to washington hes turned down so he flies to phoenix where he no doubt insists on the first flight out and pays with a credit card and starts calling his secretary who has the instincts of an alley cat telling her to find a man he doesnt know but is sure exists at the department of state she makes her callsfrantically i think you saidreaching a number of people who have to wonder why she gets you a narroweddown quorumwhich means shes reached a lot of her contacts who could give her the information and who also had to wonder why and you turn up at state demanding to see frank swann am i right in your state of mind did you demand to see him yes i was given a runaround told he wasnt there but i knew he was my secretary had confirmed it i guess i was pretty adamant finally they let me go up to his office then after you talked with him he made his decision to send you to masqat so that tight little circle you spoke of wasnt very little or very tight evan you did what anyone else would do under the circumstancesunder the stress you felt you left a number of impressions during that agitated journey from lava falls to washington you could easily be traced back through phoenix to flagstaff your name and your loud insistence on fast transportation remembered by a lot of people especially because of the time of night then you show up at the state department where you made more noisesincidentally checking in with security but not checking outuntil you were permitted to go up to swanns office yes but let me finish please interrupted khalehla again youll understand and i want us both to have the full picture you and swann talk make your agreement of anonymity and as you said youre off and running to masqat the first leg was made to your house with a driver who was not part of ohiofourzero any more than the guards in the lobby the driver was simply assigned by a dispatcher and the guards on duty were merely doing their jobs theyre not in the rarefied circles nobody up there brings them in on top secret agendas but theyre human they go home and talk to their wives and their friends because something different happened in their normally dull jobs they might also answer questions casually put to them by people they thought were government bureaucrats and one way or another they all knew who i was as did a lot of other people in phoenix and flagstaff and one thing was clear to all of them this important mans upset this congressmans in a hell of a hurry this big shots got a problem do you see the trail you left yes i do but who would look for it i dont know and that troubles me more than i can tell you troubles you whoever it was has blown my life apart who would do it someone who found an opening a gap that led to the rest of the trail from a remote campsite called lava falls to the terrorists in masqat someone who picked up on something that made him want to look farther perhaps it was the calls your secretary made or the commotion you caused at the state departments security desk or even something as crazy as hearing the rumour that an unknown american had interceded in omanit wasnt crazy at all it was printed and squashedbut it could have started somebody thinking then the other things fell in place and you were there evan put his hand over hers on the dirt path i have to know who it was khalehla i have to know but we do know she said softly correcting herself her voice flat as if seeing something she should have seen before a blond man with a european accent why kendrick removed his hand as the word exploded from his throat khalehla looked at him her gaze compassionate yet beneath her concern was that cold analytical intelligence in her eyes the answer to that has to be your overriding concern evan but i have another problem and its why im frightened i dont understand whoever the blond man was whoever he represents he reached way down deep in our cellars and took out what he should never have been given im stunned evan petrified and those words arent strong enough for the way i feel not only by whats been done to you but by whats been done to us weve been compromised penetrated where such penetration should have been impossible if theywhoever they arecan dig you up out of the deepest most secure archives we have they can learn a lot of other things no one should have access to where people like me work that can cost a great many livesvery unpleasantly kendrick studied her taut striking face seeing the fear in her eyes you mean that dont you you are frightened so would you be if you knew the men and women who help us who trust us who risk their lives to bring us information every day they wonder if something they did or didnt do will trip them up a lot of them have committed suicide because they couldnt stand the strain others have gone mad and disappeared into the deserts preferring to die at peace with their allah rather than go on but most do go on because they believe in us believe that were fair and really want peace they deal with gunwielding lunatics at every turn and bad as things are its only through them that theyre not worse with a great deal more blood in the streets yes im frightened because many of those people are friendsof mine and my father and mother the thought of their being betrayed as you were betrayedand thats what you were evan betrayed makes me want to crawl out on the sands and die like those weve driven mad because someone way down deep is opening our most secret files to others outside all he or she needed in your case was a name your name and people are afraid for their lives in masqat and bahrain how many other names can be fed how many other secrets learned evan reached over not covering her hand but now holding it gripping it if you believe that why dont you help me help you i have to know whos doing this to me and you have to know whos over there or down there making it possible id say our objectives dovetail wouldnt you ive got dennison in a vice he cant squirm out of and i can get you a quiet white house directive to stay over here actually hed jump at the chance to find a leak its an obsession with him khalehla frowned it doesnt work that way besides id be out of my class im very good where i am but out of my element my arab element im not first rate number one countered kendrick firmly i consider you first rate because you saved my life and i consider my life relatively important and two as i mentioned you have expertise in areas i know nothing about procedures covert avenues of referrali learned that one as a member of the select committee on intelligence but i havent the vaguest idea what it means hell lady you even know what the cellars are when i always thought they were the basements in a suburban development which thank god i never had to build please you said in bahrain that you wanted to help me help me now help yourself adrienne rashad replied her dark eyes searching his coldly i could help but there might be times when youd have to do as i tell you could you do that im not wild about jumping off bridges or tall buildings it would be in the area of what youd say and to whom id want you to say it there might also be times when i wouldnt be able to explain things to you could you accept that yes because ive watched you listened to you and i trust you thank you she squeezed his hand and released it id have to bring someone with me why first of all its necessary id need a temporary transfer and he can get it for me without giving an explanationforget the white house its too dangerous too unstable second he could be helpful in areas way beyond my reach who is he mitchell payton hes director of special projectsthats a euphemism for dont ask can you trust him i mean totally no doubts at all no doubts at all he processed me into the agency thats not exactly a reason the fact that ive called him uncle mitch since i was six years old in cairo is however he was a young operations officer posing as an instructor at the university he became a friend of my parentsmy father was a professor there and my mothers an american from california so was mitch will he give you a transfer yes of course youre sure of that he has no choice i just told you someones giving away a part of our soul thats not for sale its you this time whos it going to be next the icarus agenda chapter mitchell jarvis payton was a trim sixtythreeyearold academic who had been sucked into the central intelligence agency thirtyfour years before because he fitted a description someone had given to the personnel procurement division at the time that someone had disappeared into other endeavours and no job had been listed for payton only the requirementsmarked urgent however by the time his prospective employers realized that they had no specific employment for the prospect it was too late he had been signed up by the agencys aggressive recruiters in los angeles and sent to cia headquarters in langley virginia for indoctrination it was an embarrassing situation as dr payton in a rush of personal and patriotic fervour had submitted his resignation effective immediately to the state education authorities it was an inauspicious beginning for a man whose career would develop so auspiciously mj as he had been called for as long as he could remember had been a twentynineyearold associate professor with a doctorate in arabian studies from the university of california where he subsequently taught one bright morning he was visited by two gentlemen from the government who convinced him that his country urgently needed his talents what the specifics entailed they were not at liberty of course to disclose but insofar as they represented the most exciting sphere of government service they assumed that the position was overseas in the area of his expertise the young bachelor had leaped at the opportunity and when faced with perplexed superiors in langley who wondered what to do with him he adamantly suggested that he had cut his ties in la because he had at least assumed that he would be sent to egypt so he had been sent to cairowe cant get enough observers in egypt who understand the goddamned language as an undergraduate he had studied american literature chosen because payton did not think there was a hell of a lot of it it was for this reason that an employment agency in rome in reality a cia subsidiary had placed him at the cairo university as an arabicspeaking instructor of american literature there he had met the rashads a lovely couple who became an important part of his life at paytons first faculty meeting he sat beside the renowned professor rashad and in their preconference smalltalk he learned that rashad had not only gone to university in california but had married a classmate of mjs a deep friendship blossomed as did mjs reputation within the central intelligence agency through talents he had no idea he possessed and which at times actually frightened him he discovered that he was an exceptionally convincing liar they were days of turmoil of rapidly shifting alliances that had to be monitored the spreading american penetration kept out of sight he was able through his fluent arabic and his understanding that people could be motivated with sympathetic words backed up with money to organize various groups of opposing factions who reported on each others movements to him in return he provided funds for their causesminor expenditures for the then sacrosanct cia but major contributions to the zealots meagre coffers and through his efforts in cairo washington averted a number of potentially explosive embarrassments so typically of the oldschooltie network in dcs intelligence community if a good fellow did such a fine job where he was forget the convergence of specific factors that made him good where he was and bring him back to washington to see what he could do there mj payton was the exception in a long line of failures he succeeded james jesus angleton the grey fox of clandestine operations as the director of special projects and he never forgot what his friend rashad told him when he reached his ascendancy you never could have made it mj if you had married you have the selfconfidence of never having been manipulated perhaps yet a test of manipulation had come full force to him when the headstrong daughter of his dear friends had arrived in washington as adamant as he had ever seen her a terrible thing had happened in cambridge massachusetts and she was determined to devote her lifeat least a part of her lifeto lessening the fires of hatred and violence that were ripping her mediterranean world apart she never told uncle mitch what had happened to hershe did not have to reallybut she would not take no for an answer she was qualified she was as fluent in english and french as she was in arabic and she was currently learning both yiddish and hebrew he had suggested the peace corps and she had slammed her bag down on the floor in front of his desk no im not a child uncle mitch and i dont have those kinds of benevolent impulses im concerned only with where i come from where i was born if you wont use me ill find others who will they could be the wrong others adrienne then stop me hire me ill have to talk to your parents you cant hes retiredtheyre retired and they live up north in baltimonthesea theyd only worry about me and in their worrying cause problems find me translating jobs or a floating consultants position with exporterscertainly you can do that good god uncle mitch you were a smalltime instructor at the university and we never said anything you didnt know my dear the hell i didnt the whispers around the house when a friend of uncle mitchs was coming and how i had to stay in my room and then one night when suddenly three men came all wearing guns on their belts which id never seen those were emergencies your father understood then you understand me now uncle mitch i have to do this all right consented mj pay ton but you understand me young lady youll be put through a concentrated course in fairfax virginia in a compound thats not on any map if you fail i cant help you agreed had said adrienne khalehla rashad smiling do you want to bet not with you you young tigress come on lets go to lunch you dont drink do you not really i do and i will but i wont bet you and it was good for paytons wallet that he did not bet candidate no finished the excruciating tenweek course in fairfax virginia at the head of her class womens liberation be damned she was better than twentysix men but then her uncle mitch thought she had a motive the others did not have one half of her was arab all that was more than nine years ago but now on this friday afternoon nearly ten years later mitchell jarvis payton was appalled field agent adrienne rashad currently on duty in the west mediterranean sector cairo post had just called him from a pay telephone at the hilton hotel here in washington what in the name of god was she doing here on whose authority was she removed from her post all officers attached to special projects especially this officer had to have their orders cleared through him it was incredible and the fact that she would not come out to langley but instead insisted on meeting him at an outoftheway restaurant in arlington did not calm mjs nerves especially after she said to him its absolutely vital that i dont run into anyone i know or who might know me uncle mitch apart from the ominous tone of her statement she had not called him uncle mitch in years not since she was in college his unrelated niece was a troubled woman milos varak got off the plane at durango colorado and walked across the terminal to the counter of the car rental agency he produced a false drivers licence and a correspondingly false credit card signed the lease agreement accepted the keys and was directed to the lot where the car awaited him in his briefcase was a detailed map of lower southwest colorado listing such things as the wonders of the mesa verde national park as well as descriptions of hotels motels and restaurants the majority of which were found in and around such cities as cortez hesperas marvel and farther east durango the least detailed area was a dot called mesa verde itself the designation of town did not apply it was a geographical location more in peoples minds than on the books a general store a barber shop a small outlying private airport and a cafe called geegees constituted its industry one passed through mesa verde one did not live there it existed for the convenience of farmers field hands and those inveterate travellers who invariably got lost by taking the scenic routes to new mexico and arizona the anomaly of the airport was for the benefit of those dozen or so privileged landowners who had built estates for themselves in the back country and simply wanted it they rarely if ever saw the stretch of road with the general store the barber shop and geegees their necessities were flown in from denver las vegas and beverly hillsthus the airport the exception here was congressman evan kendrick who had surprisingly run for political office he had made the mistake of thinking that mesa verde could produce votes which it would have done if the election had been held south of the rio grande varak however very much wanted to see that stretch of road the locals referred to as mesa verde or just plain verde as emmanuel weingrass called it he wanted to see how the men dressed how they walked what the stresses of field work had done to their bodies their muscles their posture for the next twentyfour or at most fortyeight hours he would have to blend in milos had a job to do that in one sense saddened him beyond measuring the pain but it was something he had to do if there was a traitor to inver brass within inver brass varak had to find him or her after an hour and thirtyfive minutes of driving he found the cafe named geegees he could not go inside dressed as he was so he parked the car removed his jacket and strolled into the general store across the street aint seen you before said the elderly owner turning his head as he stacked bags of rice on a shelf always nice to see a new face you headin for new mex ill put you on the right road no need to buy anythin i keep tellin people that but they always feel they got to part with cash when all they want is directions youre most kind sir said milos but im afraid i must part with cashnot mine of course my employers im to purchase several bags of rice it was omitted from the delivery from denver oh one of the biggies in the hills take what you like sonfor cash of course at my age i dont carry out i wouldnt think of it sir hey youre a foreign fella aint cha scandinavian replied varak im just temporary filling in while the chauffeur is ill milos picked up three bags of rice and carried them to the counter the owner followed towards the cash register who you work for the kendrick house but he doesnt know me hey isnt that somethin about young evan our own congressman the heero of oman i tell ya makes a man stand tall like the president says he come in here a couple a timesthree four maybe nicest fella youd want to meet real

somethin else he certainly is thatll be six dollars and thirtyone cents son skip the penny if you aint got it im sure i have varak reached into his pocket does mr manny come in here often some maybe two three times a month drives in with one of them nurses of his then as soon as she turns her back he splits over to geegees hes some fella heres your change son thank you milos picked up the bags of rice and turned towards the door but was suddenly stopped by the owners next words i figure those girls snitched on him though cause evan must be gettin a little stricter lookin after his ol pal but i guess you know that yes of course said varak looking back at the man and smiling how did you find out yesterday replied the owner what with all the fuss out at the house manny got jakes cab to bring him down to geegees i saw him so i went to the door and shouted to him about how great the news was yknow he yelled back something like my sugar or something and went inside thats when i saw this other car comin real slow down the street with a guy talkin on a telephoneyou know one of them car telephones he parked across from geegees and just stayed there watchin the door then later he was on that telephone again and a few minutes after that he got out and went into gonzalezs place no one else had gone in so thats when i figured he was keepin tabs on manny ill tell them to be more careful said milos still smiling but just to make sure were talking about the same man or one of them what did he look like oh he was city all right fancy duds and slickdown hair dark hair then no sorta reddish oh him said varak convincingly approximately my size nope id say a mite taller maybe more than a mite yes of course agreed the czech i imagine we often think of ourselves as taller than we are hes somewhat slender or perhaps its his height thats him broke in the owner not much meat on his bones not like you no sirree then he was driving the brown lincoln looked blue to me and big but i dont know one car from another these days all look the same like unhappy bugs well thank you sir ill certainly tell the team to be more discreet we wouldnt want manny upset oh dont worry about me tellin him manny had a big operation and if young evan thinks he needs closer watchin im for it i mean ol manny hes a pistolgeegee even waters his whisky when he can get away with it thank you again ill inform the congressman of your splendid cooperation thought you didnt know him when i meet him sir goodbye milos varak started the hired car and drove down the stretch of road leaving behind the general store the barber shop and geegees cafe a tall slender man with neatly combed reddish hair and driving a large blue car the hunt had begun i dont believe it whispered mitchell jarvis payton believe mj said adrienne rashad over the redchecked tablecloth at the rear of the italian restaurant in arlington what did you really know about oman it was a fourzero operation run by state and liaisoned by lester crawford who wanted a list of our best people with the widest range of contacts in the southwest basin thats all i knew there may be others more qualified than you but not where contacts are concerned you must have assumed the operation involved the hostages of course we all did and to tell you the truth i was torn your friendship with ahmat and his wife was no secret to me and i had to assume that others also knew you see i didnt want to submit your name to les but your past work with projects called for it and your ties to the royal family demanded it also i realized that if i left you out for personal reasons and you ever learned about it youd have my head i certainly would have ill confess to a minor sin however said payton smiling a sad smile when it was all over i walked into crawfords office and made it clear that i understood the rules but i must know that you were all right he looked up at me with those fish eyes of his and said you were back in cairo i think it bothered him even to tell me that and now you tell me that the whole damned operation was blown open by one of us a fourzero strategy cant be unsealed for years often decades there are records going back to world war two that wont see the light of day until the middle of the next century if then who controls those records mj those files theyre carted off to oblivionstored in warehouses around the country controlled by government custodians with armed guards and alarm systems so hightech they reach instantly back to washington alerting us here as well as the departments of state and defense and the white house strategy rooms of course for the past twenty years or so with the proliferation of sophisticated computers most are stored in data banks with access codes that have to be coordinated between a minimum of three intelligence services and the oval office where original documents are considered vital theyre sealed and packed off payton shrugged his palms upturned oblivion my dear its all foolproof theft proof it obviously isnt disagreed the field agent from cairo it is when those records reach the level of security controls countered mj so i think youd better tell me everything you know and everything the congressman told you because if what you say is true weve got a bastard somewhere between the decision to go maximum and the data banks adrienne khalehla rashad leaned back in the chair and began she withheld nothing from her once and always uncle mitch not even the sexual accident that had occurred in bahrain i cant say im sorry professionally or otherwise mj we were both stretched and scared and frankly hes a hell of a decent manout of his depth but kind of fine i guess i reconfirmed it this morning in maryland in bed good lord no in what he said what hes reaching for why he did what he did why he even became a congressman and now wants out as ive told you im sure hes got warts all over him but hes also got a good anger i think i detect certain feelings in my niece that ive wanted to see for a long long time oh theyre there id be a hypocrite to deny them but i doubt that theres anything permanent in a way were alike im projecting but i think were both too consumed with what we have to do as two separate people and only then interested in what the other wants yet i like him mj i really do like him he makes me laugh and not just at him but with him thats terribly important said payton wistfully his smile and his gentle frown even sadder than before ive never found anyone who could genuinely make me laugh not with her of course its a flaw in my own makeup im too damned demanding and worse off for it you have no flaws or warts insisted rashad youre my uncle mitch and i wont hear of it your father always made your mother laugh i envied them at times despite the problems they faced he did make her laugh it was a defence mechanism mother thought he could say divorce three times and shed have to split rubbish he adored her then as deftly as if they had not strayed from the masqat crisis payton returned to it why did kendrick insist on anonymity in the first place i know youve told me but run it by me again will you you sound suspicious and you shouldnt be its a perfectly logical explanation he intended to go back and take up where he left off fivesix years ago he couldnt do that with the baggage of oman around his neck he cant do it now because everyone wants his head from the palestinian fanatics to ahmat and all those who helped him and are frightened to death that theyll be exposed whats happened to him during the past two days proves that he was right he wants to go back and now he cant no one will let him again payton frowned the sadness gone replaced by a cold curiosity that bordered on doubt yes i understand that my dear but then you have only his word that he wanted to go backwants to go back i believe him said rashad he may believe it himself offered the director of special projects now as it were having had second thoughts provoked by thinking things through thats cryptic as hell mj what do you mean it may be a minor point but i think its worth considering a man who wants to fade from washington really fade and not open a law office or a public relations firm or some other such gratuity for the government service he sought doesnt usually do battle with pentagon heavyweights in televised committee hearings or go on a sunday network programme that reaches the broadest audience in the country or hold a provocative personal press conference guaranteed to get wide exposure nor does he continue to be a bete noire on a select subcommittee for intelligence asking hard questions that may not promote his name in the publics eyes but certainly circulates it around the capital taken collectively those activities arent the mark of a man anxious to leave the political arena or the rewards it can offer theres a certain inconsistency wouldnt you say adrienne rashad nodded i asked him about all that at first accusing him of even wanting another onthescene testimonial from me and suffering from a bad case of political ambition he blew up denying any such motives insisting vehemently that he wanted only to get out of washington could these be his second thoughts suggested payton i ask it kindly because any sane person would have them say this very successful individualand hes nothing if not an individualist ive seen that for myselfgets a touch of our potomac virus and tells himself to go for it use all the marbles hes got including what he did in oman then he wakes up and thinks my god what have i done what am i doing here i dont belong among these people it wouldnt be the first time you know weve lost a great many good men and women in this city who came to that same conclusionthey didnt belong here most are fiercely independent people who believe in their judgments generally borne out by success in one field or another unless they want power for the sheer sake of a driving egowhich your instincts about kendrick would seem to dismiss and i trust your instinctsthese people have no patience with the mazes of endless debate and compromise that are the byproducts of our system could our congressman be someone like that offhand id say its his profile to a capital p but again its only instinct so isnt it possible that your attractive young man oh come on mj interrupted rashad thats so antediluvian i substitute it for a term i refuse to use with my niece i accept your version of courtesy propriety my dear but isnt it possible that your friend woke up and said to himself ive made a terrible mistake making a hero out of myself and now ive got to undo it it would be if he was a liar which i dont think he is but you do see the inconsistency of his behaviour dont you hes acted one way and then claims to be the opposite youre saying that hes protesting too much and im saying that he isnt because hes not lying either to himself or to me im exploring every avenue before we look for a bastard whoif youre rightwas contacted by another bastard a blondhaired one did kendrick tell you why he publicly took on the pentagon as well as the entire defence industry to say nothing of his less public but wellcirculated criticisms of our own intelligence services because he was in a position to say those things and he thought they should be said just like that thats his explanation yes but he had to seek the positions that gave him the opportunity to speak in the first place good lord the partridge committee then the select subcommittee for intelligence theyre politically coveted chairs to say the very least for every one of those seats there are four hundred congressmen whod sell their wives for the assignment they dont just fall into a members lap they have to be worked for fought for how does he explain that he cant they just fell into his lap and rather than fighting for them he fought to stay off them i beg your pardon exclaimed mj payton astonished he said that if i didnt believe him i should talk to his chief aide who had to strongarm him into taking the partridge assignment and then see the speaker of the house himself and ask that conniving old irish bastard what evan told him to do with his subcommittee he didnt want either job but it was explained to him that if he didnt take them he wouldnt have a damn thing to say about his successor in colorados ninth thats important to him its why he ran for office he got rid of one party sleazeball and didnt want another taking his place payton slowly leaned back in his chair bringing his hand to his chin his eyes narrowed over the years adrienne rashad had learned when to be silent and not interrupt her mentors thinking she did both now prepared for any of several responses but not the one she heard this is a different ball game my dear if i remember correctly you told kendrick that you thought he was being exhumed by someone who believed he deserved acclaim for what he did it goes far deeper than that im afraid our congressman is being programmed good lord for what i dont know but i think wed better try to find out very quietly very cautiously were dealing with something rather extraordinary varak saw the large dark blue car it was parked off the winding treelined road cut out of a forest several hundred yards west of kendricks house and it was empty he had passed the congressmans impressive hedgebound grounds still under minor siege by a few obstinate hopeful reporters with a camera crew and intended to head north to a motel on the outskirts of cortez the sight of the blue vehicle however changed his mind the czech continued around the next bend and drove his car into a cluster of wild brush that fronted the trees on the seat beside him was his attaché case he opened it and took out the items he thought he might need several imperative several hopeful he put them in his pockets got out of the car closed the door quietly and walked around the curve and back to the blue sedan he approached the far door nearest the woods and studied the vehicle for trapstrips that would set off an alarm if someone tampered with the lock or with pressure on the doors even light beams that extended from the front to the rear spoked wheels activated by solid objects breaking the beams he found two out of three with one so serious that it told him something there were secrets in that automobile far more valuable than clothes or jewelry or even confidential business papers a row of tiny holes had been drilled and painted over along the lower frames of the windows they were jets that released a nonlethal vapour that would immobilize an intruder for a considerable length of time they had been conceived and perfected initially for diplomats in troubled countries where it was nearly as important to question assailants as to save lives they could be set off by chauffeurs during an assault or by alarms when the car was unoccupied they were now being marketed among the rich throughout the world and it was said that the suppliers of the mechanisms could not keep up with the demand varak looked around and quickly walked to the rear of the blue car reached into his pocket and dropped to the ground in the vicinity of the exhaust he crawled under the car and instantly went to work less than ninety seconds later he emerged stood up and ran into the woods the hunt had begun and the waiting began fortyone minutes later he saw the tall slender figure walking down the road the man was in a dark suit his coat open a waistcoat showing his hair was neatly combed and more red than brown someone in charge thought milos should be given a lesson in basic cosmetic tactics one never permitted an employee to go out in the field with red hair its as simply foolish the man proceeded to unlock first the right front door then rounded the bonnet and unlocked the drivers side however before opening it he crouched out of sight where there was apparently a third release stood up and climbed inside he started the car the powerful engine coughed repeatedly then suddenly there was a loud rattling from beneath the chassis and an expulsion of fumes followed by the sound of crashing metal the silencer and exhaust pipe had blown apart accompanied by an explosion of vapour on all sides of the car varak lowered himself a handkerchief over his face and waited for the clouds to disappear clinging to the trees as they rose to the sky slowly he stood up the driver a surgical mask on his face and a gun in his hand also watched the rising clouds as he spun repeatedly around in the seat checking every direction for an assault none came and his confusion was obvious he picked up the car telephone then hesitated and milos understood if the problem was a simple mechanical failure and he contacted his controls say or or miles away he would be severely criticized he replaced the phone and put the car into gear the sound was so thunderous he stopped instantly one did not call attention to such a vehicle anywhere any time one chose another alternative like calling a garage and being towed in for a simple exterior repair and yet so another period of waiting began it lasted nearly twenty minutes despite his red hair the man was a professional apparently convinced that no attack was forthcoming he cautiously got out of the car and walked to the rear gun in one hand a torch in the other he continued to look around in all directions as varak crept silently forward in the undergrowth the redheaded surveillance suddenly crouched throwing the beam of light into the undercarriage milos knew he had only seconds to reach the edge of the road before the man discovered the heatexpanding plastic inserted in the exhaust or noticed the markings on the silencer made by the small diamondedged knifesaw the moment came as varak briefly parted the foliage eight feet from the crouching peering man christ exploded the slender welldressed redhead leaping back spinning first to his right then to his left his automatic levelled his back now to milos the czech raised a third item he had taken from his attaché case it was a copropelled dart gun once again he parted the leaves in front of him and quickly fired the narcotic dart hit its mark embedding itself in the back of the mans neck the redhaired surveillance whipped violently around dropping the torch as he desperately tried to reach behind him and rip out the offending needle the more frenzied his movements the more rapidly the blood rushed to his head rushing also the circulation of the serum it took eight seconds the man fell to the ground struggling against the inevitable effects finally lying immobile on the country road varak walked out of the woods and swiftly pulled the redhead back into them returning for the mans gun and his light he proceeded to search the man for undoubtedly false identification cards they were not false the unconscious figure beneath him was a special agent for the federal bureau of investigation among his id papers was the unit to which he had been assigned two months and ten days agoone day after the meeting of inver brass at cynwid hollow maryland milos removed the dart carried the man out to the road and placed him behind the wheel of the blue car he concealed the torch and the gun beneath the seat closed the door and walked back to his rented car around the bend he had to find a telephone and reach a man at the federal bureau in washington theres no information on that unit said varaks contact at the fbi it came down through administration circles its origin in california in san diego i think theres no california white house now objected milos but theres another house in case youve forgotten what before i go on checkman were going to need some data from you it concerns an operation out of prague thats gathering fruit over here its minor but irritating will you help us certainly ill find out whatever i can now what is the house in san diego california that can cause the bureau to form a special unit simple checkman it belongs to the vice president of the united states it is agreed then congressman evan kendrick will be the next vice president of the united states he will become president eleven months after the election of the incumbent in silence varak hung up the phone the icarus agenda chapter it had been five weeks since the calamitous ceremony in the white houses blue room a calamity compounded by ringmaster dennisons incessant attempts to focus everyones attention on the presenter of the medal of freedom award and not on the recipient the conductor of the marine band had misread his instructions instead of playing a haunting pianissimo of america the beautiful under the presidents peroration he plunged into a fortissimo version of the stars and stripes all but drowning out the chief of state it was only when congressman kendrick stepped up to receive the award and express his thanks that the band struck the chords of the song in a low swelling pianissimo adding emotional impact to the recipients selfeffacing words to the ringmasters fury kendrick had refused to read the brief speech given to him by dennison ten minutes before the ceremony thus instead of extolling the presidents secret but extraordinary assistance he thanked all those he could not mention by name for saving his life and bringing about the solution of the masqat crisis this particular moment was embarrassingly punctuated by a loud whispered shit from the ranks of langford jenningss aides on the platform the final insult to the ringmaster was brought about solely by himself during the short photo session where no questions were permitted because of antiterrorist strategies herbert dennison absently withdrew a small bottle of maalox from his pocket and drank from it suddenly cameras were aimed at him strobes exploding as the president of the united states turned and glared it was too much for the acidprone chief of staff he spilled the chalkwhite liquid over his dark jacket at the end langford jennings his arm around evans shoulders had walked out of the room and into the carpeted hallway that went beautifully congressman exclaimed the president except for a certain asshole whos supposed to run these things he has a lot of pressure on him sir i wouldnt be too harsh on herb said jennings quietly confidentially and have to do what he does no way i gather he gave you something to read and you wouldnt do it im afraid he did and i wouldnt good it would have looked like a damned cheap setup thanks evan i appreciate it youre welcome said kendrick to this large charismatic man who kept surprising him the ensuing five weeks had been as evan thought they would be the media clamoured for his attention but he kept his word to herbert dennison and would continue to keep it he refused all interviews claiming simply that to accept one would make him feel obliged to accept all and that would mean he could not adequately serve his constituency a constituency incidentally he continued to hold the november election in colorados ninth district was merely a ritual under the circumstances the opposition could not even find a candidate yet in terms of the media some were more succinct than others you big son of a bitch had teased the acerbic ernest foxley of the foxley show i gave you your first break your first decent exposure i dont think you understand kendrick said i never wanted any breaks any exposure after a pause the commentator replied you know what i believe you why is that because im telling you the truth and youre good at what you do thank you young man ill pass the word and try to call off the hounds but dont give us any more surprises okay there were no surprises to give anyone thought kendrick angrily driving through the virginia countryside in the early december afternoon his house in fairfax had become a virtual base of operations for khalehla the property given a large measure of sophistication by way of the central intelligence agencys mitchell payton the director of special projects had first ordered the construction of a high brick wall that fronted the grounds admittance achieved through a wide white wroughtiron gate electronically operated surrounding the property an equally tall mesh fence was placed deep in the earth the green metal so thick it would take an explosive a blow torch or a furiously manipulated hacksaw to break through the invading sounds heard easily by a unit of guards payton then had a continuously swept telephone installed in evans study with extension lights in various other rooms that told whoever saw them to reach that instrument as quickly as possible a communicating computer had been placed alongside the phone and was hooked up to a modem connecting it solely to the directors private office when he had information he wanted khalehla or the congressman to evaluate it was immediately transmitted all printouts to be shredded and burned in accordance with the presidents publicly stated instructions special projects had moved swiftly at the beginning and assumed responsibility for all security measures mounted to protect the hero of oman from terrorist reprisals kendrick was impressed initially because of the security arrangements in the space of one hour after a presidential limousine had driven him away from the estate in maryland mitchell payton had total control of his movements in a sense of his life the communications equipment came later quite a bit later the delay due to khalehlas obstinacy she had resisted the idea of moving into kendricks house but after eighteen days of hotel living and numerous awkward outoftheway meetings with evan and her uncle mitch the latter had put his foot down damn it my dear theres no way i can justify the cost of a safe house solely for one of my people nor would i list the reason if i could and i certainly cant install the equipment we need in a hotel also ive passed the official word from cairo to dc that youve resigned from the agency we cant afford you in the sector any longer so i really dont think you have a choice ive been trying to convince her kendrick had interrupted in the private room of a restaurant across the maryland border if shes worried about appearances ill put it in the congressional record that my aunts in town how about an older aunt with a face lift oh you bloody fool all right ill do it what equipment evan asked turning to payton what do you need nothing you can buy answered the cia director and items only we can install the next morning a telephone repair truck had drawn up at the house it was waved on to the grounds by the agency patrols and men in telephone company uniforms went to work while over twenty stonemasons were completing the wall and ten others finishing the impenetrable fence linemen climbed successive poles from a junction box pulling wires from one to another and sending a separate cable to kendricks roof still others drove a second truck around the rear drive and into the attached garage where they uncrated the computer console and carried it into the downstairs study three hours and twenty minutes later mitchell paytons equipment was in place and functioning that afternoon evan had picked up khalehla in front of her hotel on nebraska avenue hello there auntie i want a dead bolt on the guest room door she had replied laughing as she threw her soft nylon bag into the rack behind the seat and climbed in dont bother i never mess with older relatives you already have but not now she had turned to him adding with gentle yet firm sincerity i mean that evan this isnt bahrain were in business together not bed okay thats why you wouldnt move in before of course you dont know me very well kendrick had said after a few moments of silence in the traffic thats part of it which leads me to a question ive wanted to ask you but i thought you might take it the wrong way go ahead when you walked into that house in maryland last month among the first things you mentioned was bahrain yet later you told me the house was wired that anything we said would be heard why did you say it then because i wanted the subject dispensed with as rapidly and as thoroughly as possible meaning that otherspeople cleared to read the transcriptswould assume or suspect what happened yes and i wanted my position clear which was not supine my following statements were consistent case closed said evan heading into the beltway towards virginia thanks by the way ive told the hassans all about yousorry not all of course they cant wait to meet you theyre your couple from dubai arent they far more than a couple old friends from long ago i didnt mean it in a belittling sense hes a professor isnt he with luck hell have a post at either georgetown or princeton next spring there was a little matter of papers which weve managed to clear up incidentally small world department he reveres your father he met him once in cairo so be prepared for a lot of reverence thatll pass quickly laughed khalehla hell learn soon enough that im neither in his or dads league you can use a computer though cant you well yes i can i frequently have to i cant sabris wife kashi cant and certainly he cant so maybe youre way out of our league flattery doesnt suit you evan remember the dead bolt on the door they had arrived at the house where khalehla was warmly greeted by kashi hassan an instant friendship was formed as was a tradition among arab women wheres sabri kendrick had asked i want him to meet khalehla hes in your study dear evan hes instructing a gentleman from the central intelligence agency how to operate the computer in case of an emergency it had been over three weeks since the khalehlalangley axis had been in full operation and they were no closer to learning anything new than they had been since the sterile house in maryland scores of people who even might have had the slightest possible access to the oman file were put under paytons intelligence microscopes every step in the maximumclassified procedure was studied for flaws in personnel none were found the file itself was written by the state departments frank swann in tandem with the agencys lester crawford the mechanics involving a single word processor the typing done in shifts of words per typist with all proper names omitted inserted later solely by swann and crawford the decision to go to maximum classification had been reached by overview on the basis of a summary without details but with the highest recommendations of the secretaries of state and defense and the joint chiefs as well as the central intelligence agency it was all accomplished without kendricks name or the identities or nationalities of other individuals or military units the basic information had been submitted to the select committees of the senate and the house for approval at the conclusion of the crisis sixteen months before both congressional approvals were instantly forthcoming it was also assumed that the washington post press leak concerning an unknown american in masqat had come from an indiscreet member of these committees who how why they were back where they had started by all the rules of logic and elimination the oman file was beyond reach yet it had been stolen theres something not logical payton had pronounced a hole in the system and were missing it no kidding agreed kendrick paytons decision regarding evans sudden appointments to both the partridge committee and the select subcommittee for intelligence had floored kendrick neither the manipulative partridge nor the equally manipulating speaker of the house should be approached directly why not evan had objected if he was the one being programmed he had every right to confront those who were willing accessories no congressman payton had said if they were blackmailed into appointing you you can be sure theyll stonewall and send out alarms our blond european and whomever he works for will go farther underground we dont stop them we simply cant find them i remind you its the why that concerns us why are you a relatively apolitical freshman representative from an obscure district in colorado being pushed into the political centre its died down a lot you dont watch television very much said khalehla two cable networks did retrospectives on you last week what i didnt tell you there was no point it would only have made you angry kendrick lowered the mercedes window and stuck out his arm the government mobile unit behind him was new and the turn in the country road ahead was halfway around a long wooded curve the turn itself close to a blind one he was warning his guards and he supposed there was a minor irony in that his thoughts returned to the lousy enigma as he and khalehla had come to call the whole elusive mess that had screwed up his life mitch paytonit was now mitch and evanhad driven over from langley the other evening were working on something new the director of special projects had said in the study on the assumption that swanns european had to reach a great many people in order to compile the information he had on you were assembling some data ourselves it may offend you but we too are going back over your life how many years we picked you up when you were eighteenthe chances of anything before then having relevance is remote eighteen christ isnt anything sacred do you want it to be if so ill call it off no of course not its just kind of a shock you can get that sort of information its nowhere near as difficult as people think credit bureau personnel files and routine background checks do it all the time whats the point several possibilitiesrealistically two i suppose as i mentioned the first is our doggedly curious european if we could put together a list of people he had to contact in order to learn about you wed be closer to finding him and i think we all agree hes the linchpin the second possibility is something we havent attempted in trying to unearth the vanishing blond man and whoevers behind him weve concentrated on the events in oman and the file itself weve restricted our microscopes to government oriented areas where else would we look kendrick had asked your personal life im afraid there could be something or someone in your own past an event or people that you knew an incident perhaps that galvanized friends or conceivably enemies who wanted to advance your position orconverselymake you a target and make no mistake congressman you are a potential target nobodys kidding about that but mj broke in khalehla even if we found people who either liked or hated him theyd have to be washington connected mr jones from ann arbor michiganfriend or enemycouldnt just go to the maxclassified data banks or the archives and say by the way theres a certain file id like to have a copy of so i can mock up a fake memorandum for the newspapers i dont understand neither do i adrienneor should i call you khalehla which will take some getting used to theres no reason for you to call me khalehla dont interrupt said evan smiling khalehlas just fine he added yes well i really dont understand continued payton but as i told you theres a hole in the system a gap weve missed and we have to try everything then why not go after partridge and the speaker of the house pressed kendrick if i could do what i did in masqat they cant be so tough to break down not yet young man the timing isnt right and the speakers retiring now i dont understand mj means hes working on both khalehla had explained evan braked the mercedes around the long curve in the virginia woods and waited until he saw the mobile unit in his rearview mirror he then turned right into the pasture road that was the back way to his house the guards would admit him he wanted to hurry now it was why he had taken the short cut khalehla had called him at the office and told him mitchell paytons list had arrived over the computer printout his past was about to be presented to him milos varak walked down the boarded path towards the enormous beach fronting the hotel del coronado three miles over the bridge from san diego he had worked diligently for weeks to find a crack through which he could penetrate the ranks of the vice president of the united states most of the time was spent in washington the administrations secret service was not easily invaded until he found a man a dedicated man with a strong physique and a disciplined mind but with an unacceptable avocation that if exposed would destroy his assets as well as his career and undoubtedly his life he was a wellcompensated procurer for various highranking members of the government he had been primed for his work by the elders of his family who had spotted his potential and sent him to the finest parochial schools and through a major universitymajor but not rich for that image would be incorrect the elders wanted a fine looking upstanding wellgroomed young man placed in a position to dispense favours in return for certain accommodations and what better favours were there than below a weak mans belt and how better to reach accommodations than the knowledge thereof the elders were pleased had been pleased for a number of years this man came from the mafia he was mafia he served the mafia varak approached the lone figure in a raincoat by the rocks of a jetty several hundred yards from the high imposing wire fence of the naval air station thank you so much for seeing me said milos pleasantly i thought you had an accent on the phone said the wellspoken welltrained darkfeatured man are you a redbird courier because if you are youve reached the wrong swallow a communist im the farthest thing from it im so american your consiglieri could present me to the vatican thats insulting to say nothing of being totally inaccurate you made several very stupid statements so stupid that you provoked my curiosity which is why im here for whatever reason im grateful that you are the bottom line was pretty clear interrupted the secret service agent you threatened me sir im sorry you were offended i never meant to threaten you i merely said that i was aware of certain additional services you provided stop being so polite theres no reason to be discourteous said varak courteously i simply wanted you to understand my position you dont have a position corrected the government man with emphasis our records are unblemished if you get my point the czech shifted his feet in the sand and waited while the roar of a jet passing over from the naval air station diminished in the sky youre saying that there are no records and your point is that you wont discuss anything concrete because you think i may be wearing a recording device varak unbuttoned his jacket separating it be my guest search me personally i wouldnt care to have my voice on the same tape with yours please go ahead i will of course remove my weapon and hold it in my hand but i wont stop you the white house guardian was sullen hesitant youre too accommodating he said standing motionless on the other hand added milos quickly we can dispense with this awkwardness if youd just read something ive prepared for you the czech released his jacket reached into his pocket and pulled out several sheets of folded paper he snapped them open and handed them to the secret service agent as the man read his eyes narrowed and his lips parted frozen into the start of a snarl in seconds a reasonably strong and attractive face became ugly youre a dead man he said quietly that could be shortsighted dont you think because if i am surely so are you the capos would descend like a pack of wild dogs while the dons drinking their fine red wine as if it were your blood waited to hear of your very unpleasant death records what are those names dates times locationsand correspondingly opposite each entry the results of your sexual merchandise or rather blackmailed into being results bills amended contracts awarded government projects voted up or down according to their allocations id say its quite a record and where does it all lead back to let me guess the most unlikely source one can imagine an unpublished telephone number listed under a false name and address but located in the apartment of a member of the governments secret service those girls are dead the boys are dead dont blame them they had no more of a choice than you do now believe me its better to assist me than to oppose me i have no interest in your extracurricular activities you provide a service and if you didnt somebody else would for roughly the same results all i want from you is information and in exchange ill burn every copy of those pages of course you have only my word for it but as im likely to call upon your expertise again id be stupid to release them and i assure you im not stupid obviously not agreed the mafia soldier his voice barely audible why throw a gun away when you can still use it im glad you understand my position what sort of information are you looking for its innocuous nothing that will upset you lets start with the fbi unit thats been assigned to the vice president arent you people doing your job do you need a special task force from the bureau it hasnt anything to do with us were in place for protection theyre investigative you cant protect unless you investigate its different levels we come up with something we turn it over to the bureau what did you come up with that called for this unit we didnt answered the man a couple of months ago a series of threats were made against viper and viper the vice president its not a very flattering code name its not in general use either just among the detail i see go onthese threats who made them thats what the units all about theyre trying to find out because theyre still being made how phone calls telegrams pasteup lettersthey come from different places which keep the feds in the air a lot tracing them down without success not yet then theyre a roving task force here one day somewhere else the next are their movements coordinated from washington when vipers there sure when hes out here its here and when hes on the road its wherever hes at the units controlled by his personal stuff otherwise too much time is wasted checking back and forth with dc you were out here five weeks ago werent you around then yes we just got back ten days ago he spends a lot of time out here as he likes to say the president covers the east and he covers the west and hes got the better deal because he gets away from funny town thats a foolish statement for a vice president to make thats viper but thats not to say hes a fool hes not why do you call him viper as long as you want it straight i guess we dont like him or the crowd he pals around withespecially out here those bastards treat us like puerto rican houseboys the other afternoon one of them said to me boy get me another g and t i told him id better check with my superiors in the secret service to see if i was assigned to him werent you afraid the vicevipermight take offence christ he doesnt mess with us like the fed unit we only answer to his staff chief whos he not he she weve got another code for her its not as good as viper but it fits we call her dragon bitchdame bountiful in the logs which she likes tell me about her said varak the antennae of an adult lifetime picking up a signal her names ardis vanvlanderen and she came on board about a year ago replacing a hell of a good man who was doing a hell of a good job so good he got a terrific offer from one of vipers friends shes in her forties and one of those tough executive ladies who looks like she wants to cut your balls off when you go into her office just because youre a male an unattractive woman then i wouldnt say that shes got a decent enough face and a foxy body but itd be hard to work up a letch for her unless you like the type my guess is she screws by numbers is she married theres a gonzo who comes around saying hes her husband but nobody pays much attention to him what does he do whats his business hes palm springs social set stocks and bonds when they dont interfere with his golf thats the way i read him thats significant money hes a heavy contributor and never misses a super bash at the white house you know the type wavy white hair and a big gut with lots of shiny teeth in a tuxedo they always get their pictures taken dancing if he could read a whole book through in english theyd probably make him the ambassador to the court of st jamessi take it back with his money half a book varak studied the secret service guard the man was obviously relieved at being asked such innocuous questions his answers were more complete than they had to be bordering on the false confidentiality of gossip i wonder why someone like that would send his wife out to work even if it is for the vice president i dont think he has anything to say about it you dont send a sharp item like her anywhere she doesnt want to go besides one of the maids told us shes wife number three or four so maybe vanvlanderen learned to let em hang loose and do their thing and you say she does it well like i said very sharp very pro viper doesnt make a move without her whats he like viper suddenly another jet took off from the naval air station the roar of the engines thunderous vipers viper said the mafia plant when the earthshaking noise had vanished orson bollingers a party glad hander with an insiders grasp of every fucking thing that goes on and nothing goes on that doesnt serve the boys in the back rooms of california because they take care of him youre very astute i observe you do a great deal more than that only id suggest you be more cautious in the future if i can find you others might too how goddamn you how diligence and over the weeks watching for a mistake someone had to make it could have been one of the others in your detail or something elsewere all human none of us lives in a freezerbut it turned out to be you you were tired or perhaps you had that extra drink or simply felt you were too secure whatever the reason you made a phone call to brooklyn new york obviously not the way you were supposed to make it not from an untraceable pay telephone frangie whispered the capo supremo your cousin joseph fingers frangiani second underboss of the ricci family in brooklyn inheritors of the genovese interests it was all i needed amico you foreign lowlife son of a bitch dont waste obscenities on me one last question and why not be civil what cried the furious man from the mafia his black eyebrows arched his right hand instinctively reaching behind his jacket stop roared the czech one inch more and youre dead wheres your gun choked the agent without a breath i dont need it replied varak his eyes boring in on his wouldbe killer and im sure you know that slowly the secret service man brought his right hand in front of him one question thats all he said his animus with himself reflected in his face youve got one last question this ardis vanvlanderen how was her appointment as the vice presidents chief of staff explained to you words must have been said reasons given after all youre bollingers personal security and you worked well with her predecessor were his security not corporate executives explanations werent required nothing was said its an unusual position for a woman plenty was said so we wouldnt miss the point but no explanation bollinger called everybody together and told us how pleased he was to announce the appointment of one of the most talented executives in the country someone who was assuming the job at such personal sacrifice that we should all thank the powers that be for her patriotism the her was the first inkling we had that it was a woman interesting phrase powers that be he talks that way and he doesnt make a move without her i dont think hed dare shes heavy metal and she keeps the house in order whose order what never mind thats all for now amico please be so kind as to leave first will you ill call you if i need you the mafioso the hot ancestral blood of the mediterranean rushing to his head jabbed his index finger at the czech and spoke in a hoarse voice youll stay out of my fucking life if you know whats good for you i hope to stay as far away from you as possible signore mezzano dont you call me a pimp ill call you anything i like but as to whats good for me ill be the judge of that now fila capisce milos varak watched his reluctant informer walk over the sand in silent fury until the mezzano disappeared into the maze of beach accesses towards the hotel the czech let his mind wander she came on board about a year ago hes a heavy contributor viper doesnt make a move without her it was thirteen months ago that inver brass had begun the search for a new vice president of the united states the incumbent considered a pawn of the presidents unseen contributorsmen who intended to run the country it was past four oclock in the morning and khalehla would not stop she kept pressing evan changing cassettes on the recorder and repeating names over and over again insisting that wherever he recognized anything at all he describe in detail everything he could remember the computer printout from mitchell paytons office at the central intelligence agency included selected names with corresponding occupations marriages divorces and deaths in each case the individual listed had either spent considerable time with kendrick or had been present during a period of high activity and could conceivably have been instrumental in his academic or career decisions where the hell did he get these people asked evan pacing the study i swear i dont remember half of them and most of the other half are blurs except for old friends ill always remember and none of them could be remotely connected with whats happening christ i had three roommates in college two others in graduate school and a sixth shared an apartment with me in detroit when i worked in a lousy job over here later there were at least two dozen others i tried unsuccessfully to raise backing from for the middle east and some of them are on that listwhy i dont know but i do know all those lives are being lived in the suburbs with green lawns and country clubs and colleges they can barely afford for their kids they have nothing to do with now then lets go over the kendrick group again there is no kendrick group broke in evan angrily they were killed blown away drowned in concrete manny and i are all thats left you know that im sorry said khalehla gently sitting on the couch drinking tea the printout was on the coffee table in front of her i meant the dealings you had over here in the states while there was the kendrick group weve gone over them there werent that manymostly in hightech equipment lets go over them again its a waste of time but go ahead sonar electronics palo alto california read khalehla her hand on the printout the representative was a man named carew screw carew said kendrick chuckling that was mannys comment we bought some sounding devices that didnt work and they still wanted payment after we sent them back drucker graphics boston the representative a g r shulman anything gerry shulman good man good service we worked with them for years never a problem morseland oil tulsa the rep was someone named arnold stanhope i told you about himthem tell me again we did preliminary surveying for them in the emirates they kept wanting more than they were willing to pay for and since we were growing we could afford to drop them was there acrimony sure there always is when chisellers find out they cant do business as usual but there wasnt anything silence couldnt cure besides they found some other jokers a greek outfit who caught on to them and delivered a survey that must have been made on the floor of the oman gulf freebooters every one of you said khalehla smiling and lowering her hand on the printout off shore investments limited headquarters nassau the bahamas contact ardis montreaux new york city they funnelled a lot of capital to you which we never touched because it was a sham interrupted evan sharply it better damn well say that there it says here skip it what i wrote it its what you said before skip it whats off shore investments limited was corrected kendrick it was a high class boilerplate operation on the international scalehigh class and international but still boilerplate build a company up with large swiss accounts and hot air then sell off and switch the assets leaving the buyers with a balloon full of helium you got mixed up with something like that i didnt know it was something like that i was a lot younger and impressed as hell that they wanted to list us as part of their structure even more impressed with the money they banked for us in zurich impressed that is until manny said lets try to get some just for the hell of it he knew exactly what he was doing we couldnt pull out two francs off shores signatures controlled all withdrawals all assignments a dummy setup and you were the dummies thats it how did you get involved we were in riyadh and montreaux flew over and conned me i hadnt learned that there werent any shortcutsnot that kind ardis montreaux ardis thats an odd name for a man because its not a manshes not a man shes a lot tougher a woman believe it with your innate scepticism she must have been very persuasive she had the words she also wanted our heads when we pulled out she claimed we were costing them millions weingrass asked her whose millions this time perhaps we should skip it evan broke in firmly she married an english banker and lives in london shes faded how do you know showing minor embarrassment kendrick answered quickly and quietly she called me a couple of times as a matter of fact to apologize skip it sure khalehla went on to the next firm on the printout as she spoke she wrote two words after off shore investments limited check out ardis montreaux frazierpyke vanvlanderen born ardisolda wojak in pittsburgh pennsylvania walked into the marble foyer of the suite at the westlake hotel in san diego she threw her sable stole over the back of a velour chair and raised her voice her speech a cultivated midatlantic rather more nasal stage british than oldmoney american but still afflicted with the harsh tones of pittsburghs monongahela slavic in the upper registers andyboy im home weve got less than an hour to get up to la jolla so move it sweetie andrew vanvlanderen heavyset with stark white wavy hair and dressed in a tuxedo walked out of the bedroom a drink in his hand im ahead of you babe ill be ready in ten minutes said ardis peering into a foyer mirror and fingering the curls of her perfectly coiffed frosted brown hair she was closing in on fifty and of medium height but gave the impression of being younger and taller due to erect posture a slender figure topped by generous breasts and a wellcoordinated face punctuated by large penetrating green eyes why not call for the car sweetie the car can wait so can la jolla weve got to talk oh the vice presidents chief of staff looked over at her husband you sound serious i am i had a call from your old boyfriend which one darling the only one who counts good god he called here i told him to that was dumb andyboy just plain dumb ardis vanvlanderen walked rapidly angrily out of the foyer and down into the sunken living room she sat in a red silk wingbacked chair and abruptly crossed her legs her large eyes riveted on her husband take risks with moneyon commodities or futures or your stupid horses or any goddamned thing you like but not where im concerned is that understood darling listen bitchdragon bitchwith what ive paid out if i want firsthand information im going to get it is that understood all right all right cool off andy you start a rhubarb and then you tell me to cool it im sorry ardis arched her neck back into her chair breathing audibly through her open mouth her eyes briefly closed in seconds she opened them levelled her head and continued really im sorry its been a particularly rotten orson day whats viper done now asked vanvlanderen drinking be careful with those names said his wife laughing softly we wouldnt want our allamerican gorillas to learn theyre being bugged whats bollingers problem hes feeling insecure again he wants a written ironclad guarantee that hell be on the ticket next july or we settle ten million on him in a swiss account vanvlanderen coughed a swallow of whisky into his glass ten million he gasped who the fuck does that comedian think he is the vice president of the united states with a few secrets in his skull replied ardis i told him we wouldnt accept anyone else but it wasnt good enough i think he senses that jennings doesnt consider him a worldbeater and would let him go our beloved telegenic wizard langford jennings hasnt a goddamned thing to say about it is orson right does jennings dislike him dislikes too strong he just dismisses him thats what i hear from dennison that ones got to go one of these days herbs going to get more curious than we want him forget him interrupted mrs vanvlanderen forget dennison and bollinger and even your stupid horses what did my straying cat hunting old boyfriend have to say that was so important you had him call here relax he phoned from my washington attorneys office we share the same firm there remember but first lets not forget orson give him his guarantee a simple sentence or two and ill sign it itll make him happy and happy is better are you crazy cried ardis bouncing forward in the chair not at all to begin with hell be on the ticket or hell just disappear like former vice presidents usually do oh my said ardis drawing out the word my in admiration youre my kind of fella andyboy you think so clearly so succinctly long years of learning babe now what did mixedup old dimples have to say whos after his sensitive skin now not his ours which is his and dont you forget it its why im here lover why he introduced us and brought us together he wants us to know that the little group of deluded super people are moving into high gear during the next three months their congressman will start getting editorials in progressively stronger papers the theme will be examining his positions and hell pass all the exams the point of course is to create a ground swell our cupid is worried very worried and to tell you the truth im sweating a few bullets myself those benevolent lunatics know what theyre doing this whole thing could get out of control ardis weve got millions riding on the next five years im goddamned worried over nothing said his perfectly coiffed wife getting out of her chair she stood for a moment and looked at vanvlanderen her wide green eyes only partially amused since you figure to save ten million on bollinger one way or the otherand my way is better certainly safer than any alternativei think its only reasonable that you bank an equal amount for me dont you darling somehow i fail to see the overpowering reason it could be your undying love for me or perhaps one of the more extraordinary coincidences of my career floating among the rich the beautiful the powerful and the politically ambitious especially in the area of government largess hows that again i wont recite the litany of why were all doing what were doing or even why ive cast my not inconsiderable talents with you but i will now let you in on a little secret ive kept all to myself for lo these many weeks im fascinated said vanvlanderen putting his drink down on a marble table and closely observing his fourth wife what is it i know evan kendrick you what our brief association goes back a number of years more than i care to dwell on frankly but for a few weeks we had something in common outside the obvious what oh the sex was pleasant enough but immaterial to both of us we were young people in a hurry with no time for attachments do you remember off shore investments if he was part of that outfit we can nail him with fraud certainly enough to take him out if he climbs on board was he he was but you cant he pulled out in loud moral indignation which was the start of that houseofcards collapse and i wouldnt be too anxious to nail off shores principals unless youre tired of me sweetie you i was the main missionary i recruited the components ill be damned vanvlanderen laughed as he picked up his drink and raised the glass to his wife those thieves sure as hell knew whom to hire for the right jobs wait a minute you knew kendrick well enough to sleep with the son of a bitch and you never said anything i had my reasons they better be damned good exploded the presidents heavy contributor because if theyre not i may just break your ass you bitch suppose he saw you recognized you remembered off shore and put two and two together and got four i dont take those kinds of chances its my turn to say relax andy countered the contributors wife the people around a vice president arent news or even newsworthy whens the last time you can recall the name of any individual on a vice presidents staff theyre a grey amorphous grouppresidents wont have it any other way besides i dont think my names even been in the papers except as mr and mrs vanvlanderen guests at the white house kendrick still thinks im frazierpyke a bankers wife living in london and if you remember although both of us were invited to the medal of freedom ceremony you went alone i begged off those arent reasons why didnt you tell me because i knew what your reaction would betake her out of the picturewhen i realized i could be far more useful to you in it how for christs sake because i knew him i also knew i had to get up to date on him but not with some private investigating firm that could end up burning us later so i took the official high road the federal bureau of investigation the threats against bollinger theyll stop tomorrow except for one man wholl continue here on a special basis the unit will be recalled to washington those mockedup threats were the paranoid fantasies of a harmless lunatic i invented who supposedly fled the country you see sweetie i found out what i had to know which is theres an old israeli jew named weingrass whom kendrick worships hes the father evan never had and when there was the kendrick group he was called the companys secret weapon munitions hardly darling laughed ardis vanvlanderen he was an architect a damned good one and did pretty spectacular work for the arabs what about him hes supposed to be in paris but hes not hes living in kendricks house in colorado with no passport entry or any official immigration status so the soontobeanointed congressman brought the old man back for an operation that saved his life so emmanuel weingrass is going to have a medical relapse that will kill him kendrick wont leave his side and when its over itll be too late i want the ten million andyboy the icarus agenda chapter varak studied the members of inver brass each face around the table reflected in the light of the brass lamp in front of him or her the czechs concentration was strained to the limit because he had to focus on two levels the first was the information he delivered the second was on the immediate reaction of each face to certain facts within that information he had to find one pair of eyes that were suspect and he could not find them that was to say there were no momentary flashes of astonishment or fear on the faces of the members as he gradually logically approached the subject of the current vice president of the united states and his staff touching ever so lightly on the innocuous details he had learned from a mafia plant in the secret service there was nothing only blank riveted stares so while he spoke with conviction and conveyed roughly per cent of the truth he kept watching their eyes the second level of his mind recalling the salient facts of the life behind each face reflected in the light and as he looked at each face its features heightened by the chiaroscuro wash from the lamps he felt as he always did that he was in the presence of very formidable people yet one was not one had revealed the existence of emmanuel weingrass in mesa verde colorado a secret unknown to the most clandestine departments in washington one of those shadowed faces in front of him was a traitor to inver brass who samuel winters old money from an american dynasty going back to the railroad and oil barons of the late american nineteenth century an honoured scholar satisfied with his privileged life an adviser to presidents regardless of party a great man at peace with himself or was he jacob mandel a venerated financial genius who had designed and implemented reforms that revitalized the securities and exchange commission into a viable and far more honorable asset to wall street from lower east side yiddish poverty to the halls of merchant princes and it was said that no decent man who knew him could call him an enemy like winters he wore his honors well and there were few he had not attained or were there others he strove for secretly margaret lowell again aristocratic old money from the new yorkpalm beach orbit but with a twist that was virtually unheard of in those circles she was a brilliant attorney who eschewed the rewards of estate and corporate law for the pursuit of advocacy she worked feverishly in the legal vineyards on behalf of the oppressed the dispossessed and the disenfranchised both theorist and practitioner she

technology holder of over twenty hugely remunerative patents on which the vast majority of proceeds were given away to engineering and medical institutions for the advancement of those sciences his was a towering intellect concealed within a cherubic face with tousled red hair an impish smile and a ready sense of humouras if he were embarrassed by his gifts even quick to feign mild offence if they were singled out or was it all pretence the guilelessness a sham of someone nobody knew gideon logan perhaps the most complex of the quintet and because he was a black man again perhaps understandable he had made several fortunes in property never forgetting where he came from hiring and nursing along black firms in his developments it was said that he quietly did more for civil rights than any single corporation in the country the current administration as well as its predecessor had offered him a variety of cabinet posts all of which he refused believing he could achieve more as a respected independent force in the private sector than if he were identified with a political party and its practices a nonstop worker he apparently permitted himself only one indulgence a luxurious oceanfront estate in the bahamas where he spent infrequent weekends fishing on his fortysixfoot bertram with his wife of twelve years or was the legend that was gideon logan incomplete the answer was yes several years of his whirlwind meteoric life were simply unknown it was as if he had not existed milos asked margaret lowell her elbow forward on the table her head resting on the extended fingers of her hand how in heavens name has the administration managed to keep the threats against bollinger quiet especially with a bureau unit exclusively assigned to him strike margaret lowell she was opening the obvious can of worms in which was found the vice presidents chief of staff i must assume its through the direction of mrs vanvlanderen her executive expertise as it were watch the eyes the muscles of their facesthe jaws nothing they reveal nothing yet one of them knows who i realize shes andrew vanvlanderens wife said gideon logan and andyboy as hes called is one hell of a fund raiser but why was she appointed to begin with strike gideon logan he was stirring up the worms perhaps i can answer that replied jacob mandel before she married vanvlanderen she was a headhunters dream she turned around two companies that i know of from bankruptcy into profitable mergers im told shes distastefully aggressive but no one can deny her managerial talents shed be good in that job shed keep the political sycophants at bay strike jacob mandel he had no compunction about praising her i ran across her once said eric sundstrom emphatically and in plain words she was a bitch i assigned a patent to johns hopkins medical and she wanted to broker the damn thing what was there to broker asked the attorney lowell absolutely nothing answered sundstrom she tried to convince me that such large grants required an overseer to make sure the money went where it was supposed to go and not for new jockstraps she probably had a point said the lawyer nodding as if from experience not for me not the way she talked and the med schools president is a good friend of mine shed have driven him up the wall so often he would have returned the patent shes a bitch a real bitch strike eric sundstrom he had no compunction whatsoever about damning her i never met her interjected samuel winters but she was married to emory frazierpyke a finetuned banker in london you remember emory dont you jacob certainly he played polo and you introduced me as a silent branch of the rothschildswhich unfortunately i think he believed someone told me continued winters that poor frazierpyke lost a considerable amount of money in a venture she was associated with but came away with a wife it was the offshore investments crowd some finetuning he had added mandel goniffs every one of them he should have checked with his polo ponies or even the silent rothschild perhaps he did she didnt last long and old emory has always been a stickler for the straight and narrow she could have been a thief too strike samuel winters the traitor in inver brass would not raise the speculation in one way or another commented varak without emphasis you are all at least aware of her then i wasnt said margaret lowell bordering on the defensive but after hearing the others i can tell you who else knows heraware is a touch too dull my exhusband the alley cat it was the frazierpyke that did it walter sundstroms voice and expression were both humorously questioning my boy made so many business trips to london i thought he was advising the crown and he frequently mentioned that this frazierpyke was his banker over there then one morning the maid phoned me at the office saying that casanova had an urgent call from an fp in london but she didnt know where he was she gave me the number and i called saying to somebodyi assumed a secretarythat m lowell was on the line for fp i was subsequently greeted by an exuberant voice virtually yelling at me dahling ill be in new york tomorrow and we can have five full days together i said how nice and hung up she travels in the right circles for her purposes said gideon logan chuckling andyboy vanvlanderen will keep her in blue chips and sables until he gets bored varak had to change the subject quickly if he was right about there being a traitor around the table and he was rightwhatever was said about ardis vanvlanderen would get back to her and he could not permit anything further from everyones reactions he said pleasantly aimlessly we can assume that there are some opportunists who are immensely capable however its not important watch them every face she serves the vice president well but thats essentially immaterial to us back to our candidate everything proceeds on schedule the midwest newspapers starting with chicago will be the first to speculate on his credentials both in columns and editorials theyve all been provided with extensive background material on kendrick as well as tapes of the partridge committee the foxley show and his own quite remarkable press conference from this core the word will spread both east and west how were they approached milos asked the spokesman samuel winters the newspapers and the columnists i mean a legitimate ad hoc committee that weve formed in denver the seed when planted grew quickly the colorado branch of the party was enthusiastic especially as the money was contributed by donors who insisted on remaining anonymous the state functionaries see a potentially viable candidate and the wherewithal to launch him as well as the attention it focuses on colorado win or lose they cant lose that wherewithal could be a legal problem said margaret lowell nothing significant madam its provided in sequences no amount over the legal limit as mandated by the election lawswhich are quite obscure if not mystifying in my opinion if i need a lawyer ill call you milos added lowell smiling and sitting back in her chair ive furnished each of you with a copy of the names of the newspapers their editorial writers and the columnists involved in this phase to be burned in our coal stove broke in winters softly of course naturally most certainly came the chorus of quiet replies which was the liar tell me varak said the brilliant cherubic sundstrom according to everything we know everything youve brought us our candidate hasnt displayed an iota of that fireinthebelly we hear so much about isnt it terribly important doesnt he have to ultimately want the job hell want it sir as weve learned hes what might be called a closet activist who runs out of the closet when the conditions call for his abilities good lord samuel hes a rabbi too hardly mr mandel replied the czech permitting himself a tight grin what i mean to say no doubt poorly the words are lovely milos thank you sir youre too kind but what im trying to say is that on two dramatic occasions in his lifeone extraordinarily dangerous to him personallyhe chose to take the most difficult course of action because he felt he could effect a change for the better the first was his decision to replace a corrupt congressman the second of course was oman in short words he must once again be convinced that his person and his abilities are neededuniquely needed for the good of the country thats a tall order said gideon logan hes obviously a man of realistic sensibilities who makes a pretty fair appraisal of his qualifications his bottom line may be im not qualified how do we overcome that varak looked around the table his expression that of a man trying to be understood i suggest symbolically sir hows that asked mandel removing his steelrimmed glasses for example the current secretary of state although he is frequently maligned by his colleagues and the white house staff as a stubborn academic is the most reasoned voice in the administration i know privately that he has managed to block a number of rash actions recommended by the presidents advisers because the president respects him he damn well should exclaimed margaret lowell i think the european alliance would fall apart without him offered winters there wouldnt be an alliance without him agreed mandel anger on his normally passive face hes a beacon of rationality in a sea of belching neanderthals if i may sir could your use of the word beacon be construed as a symbol thats logical answered gideon logan our secretary of state is by all means a symbol of intelligent moderation the nation too respects him he intends to resign said varak simply what sundstrom sat forward his loyalty to jennings wouldnt permit it his sense of integrity shouldnt permit him to stay said winters with finality out of loyalty however explained varak hes agreed to attend the middle east nato conference at the un mission on cyprus in three weeks its both a show of unity and a way of giving the presidents men time to find a replacement who will be acceptable to the congress then he leaves for pressing personal reasons the main one being his frustration with the national security council which continues to undercut him has he explained that to the president asked lowell according to my source he has not replied varak as mr mandel has pointed out hes a rational man he understands that its easier and far better for the country to replace one person than an entire council of presidential advisers tragic said winters yet inevitable i imagine but how does the secretary of state relate to evan kendrick i fail to see the connection its in the symbol itself said eric sundstrom hes got to understand its importance am i right milos yes sir if kendricks convinced that its crucial for the country to have a strong vice president whos perceived by our allies and enemies alike as a voice of reason within an imperial presidencywhere the benign emperor frequently has no clothesand that the world will breathe easier for it then in my judgment hell again make the difficult choice and be available from all weve learned i suppose he would agreed gideon logan but who the hell is going to convince him of that the only man hell listen to said milos varak wondering if he was about to sign a death warrant emmanuel weingrass ann mulcahy oreilly was a washington secretary not easily disturbed over the years since she and paddy moved down from boston she had worked for the bright and the unbright the wouldbe good and the wouldbe thieves nothing much surprised her any more but then she had never worked for anyone like congressman evan kendrick he was the alltime reluctant resident of washington its most persistently unwilling politician and a perversely demurring hero he had more ways to elude the ineluctable than a cat with nine lives cubed and he could vanish with the agility of the invisible man yet his proclivity for disappearing notwithstanding the congressman always left open lines of communication he would either call in on a fairly regular basis or leave a number where he could be reached however for the past two days there had been no word from kendrick and no number at which he could be found those two facts by themselves would not normally have alarmed mrs oreilly but two others did throughout the daysince ninetwenty that morningneither the house in virginia nor the home in colorado could be reached by telephone in both cases the operators in virginia and colorado reported disruptions of service and that status was still unchanged at nearly seven oclock in the evening that disturbed annie oreilly so quite logically she picked up the phone and dialled her husband at police headquarters oreilly said the gruff voice detective squad paddy its me hi tiger do i get beef stew im still at the office good ive got to talk to evan manny called me a couple of days ago about some lowgrade licence plates thats the point interrupted mrs oreilly i want to talk to him too but it seems i cant annie told her husband about the strange coincidence of both the congressmans phones in virginia and colorado being out of order simultaneously and that he had neither checked in with her for the past two days nor left an alternative number where she could reach him and thats not like him paddy call congressional security said the detective firmly in a pigs ass i will you whisper that lads name to security all the bells go off and you know what he thinks about those bells hed have my head in a basket if theres even a halfway decent explanation what do you want me to do can you take a quiet looksee over in fairfax darlin sure ill call kearns in arlington and have him send a radio car out there whats the address again no paddy said mrs oreilly quickly i can hear the bells already thats the police what the hell do you think i do for a living ballet i dont want the police involved what with reports and all the agencys got guards out there and i could get my broadside in a wringer i meant you lover youre a friend in the area who just happens to be a cop doing a favour for your wife who just happens to be kendricks secretary thats a lot of justhappens tiger what the hell i like beef stew with extra potatoes paddy and onions lots more onions the biggest i can find im on my way and paddy if that shrinking violet has had both phones taken off the hook you tell him i know about his girlfriend from egypt and i just might leak it if he doesnt call me what girlfriend from button it ordered mrs oreilly manny let it drop yesterday when he was a mite squiffed and couldnt find his broth of a boy either hurry along now ill wait for the call here what about my beef stew ive got one frozen lied the lass born ann mary mulcahy thirtyeight minutes later after taking two wrong turns in the dark virginia countryside detective first grade oreilly found the road that led to kendricks house it was a road he had travelled over exactly four times but never at night each trip had been made to see old weingrass after he got out of the hospital and to bring him a freshly reminted bottle of listerine since his nurses kept the scotch whisky beyond his reach paddy had righteously figured that if manny who was about to be eighty and who should have croaked on the operating table wanted to go out a little pickled who was to call it a sin christ in all his glory turned water into wine so why shouldnt a miserable sinner named oreilly turn a little pint of mouthwash into scotch both were for good christian causes and he was only following the holy example there were no streetlamps on the back country road and were it not for the wash of his headlights paddy would have missed the brick wall and the white wroughtiron gate then he understood why there were no lights on in the house beyond to all intents and purposes it was closed up deserted shut down while its owners were away yet its owner was not away and even if he were there was the arab couple from a place called dubai who kept the place open and ready for the owners return any change in that routine or the dismissal of the agency guards would certainly be conveyed to annie oreilly the congressmans number one girl in the office paddy stopped the car on the side of the road he snapped open the glove compartment removed a torch and got out instinctively he reached under his jacket and felt the handle of his revolver in his shoulder holster he approached the gate expecting at any moment floodlights to be tripped on or the screeching sounds of multiple sirens to suddenly fill the quiet night those were the ways of agency controls methods of total protection nothing oreilly arced his arm slowly through the bars of white wrought iron nothing he then placed his hand on the centre plate between the two joining gates and pushed both opened and still nothing he walked inside pushing the thumb of his left hand against the switch of the torch his right hand reaching beneath his jacket what he saw in seconds under the roving beam caused him to spin away crouching into the wall his weapon yanked out of the holster holy mary mother of god forgive me for my sins he whispered ten feet away lay the dead body of a young businesssuited guard from the central intelligence agency sickeningly drenched in blood from the throat above his head nearly severed from the rest of him oreilly pressed his back against the brick wall instantly extinguishing the light trying to calm his all too experienced nerves he was familiar with violent death and because he was he knew that there was more to be found he rose slowly to his feet and began his search for death knowing also that the killers had disappeared he found three other corpses each mutilated each life taken in shock each positioned at degrees of the compass for protection jesus how he bent down and examined the body of the fourth man what he found was extraordinary lodged in the guards neck was a snappedoff needle it was the remnants of a dart the patrol had been immobilized by a narcotic and then without defences obscenely killed they never knew what happened none of them knew patrick oreilly walked slowly cautiously to the front door of the house once again knowing that caution was irrelevant the godawful terrible deeds had been done there was nothing left but to total the casualties there were six each throat was slit each corpse covered with drying blood each face in torment yet the most obscene of all were the naked bodies of kendricks couple from dubai the husband was on top of his wife in the coital position both redsoaked faces pressed against each other and on the wall scratched in human blood were the words death to gods traitors death to the fornicators of the great satan where was kendrick mother of god where was he oreilly raced back through the house going from the cellar to the attic and room to room turning on every switch he could find until the entire estate was a blaze of light there was no sign of the congressman paddy ran out of the house through the attached garage noting that evans mercedes was gone the cadillac empty he began searching the grounds again crisscrossing every foot of woods and foliage within the fenced compound nothing there were no signs of struggle no broken shrubbery no breaks in the fence or scratches on the newly constructed brick wall forensic the departments forensic division would find evidence no he was thinking police procedures and this was beyond the policefar far beyond oreilly ran back to the white wroughtiron gate now awash with light and raced to his car he leaped inside and disregarding the radio yanked the police cellular phone from its recess under the dashboard he dialled only at that moment realizing that his face and shirt were drenched with sweat in the cold night air congressman kendricks office annie let me do the talking broke in the detective rapidly softly and dont ask questions i know that tone of voice paddy so i have to ask one is he all right theres no sign of him his cars gone hes not here but others are no more questions tiger but ive got one for you and by the saints youd better be able to answer it what whos evans contact at the agency he deals directly with the unit no someone else higher up there has to be somebody wait a minute cried annie her voice rising of course there is he just doesnt talk about him a man named payton a month or so ago he told me that if this payton ever called i was to put him through immediately and if evan wasnt here i was to find him youre sure hes with the cia yes yes i am said mrs oreilly thoughtfully one morning he called me from colorado saying he needed this paytons number and where i could find it in his deskin the bottom drawer of his desk under a cheque book it was a langley exchange would it be there now ill look hold on the wait of no more than twenty seconds was nearly unbearable for the detective made worse by the sight of the large brightly lit house beyond the open gate it was both an invitation and a target paddy yes ive got it give it to me quickly she did so and oreilly issued an order that was not to be disobeyed stay in the office until i call you or pick you up understood is there a reason lets say i dont know how far up or down or sideways this kind of thing reaches and i happen to like beef stew oh my god whispered annie oreilly did not hear his wife he had disconnected the line and within seconds was dialling the number annie had given him after eight agonizing rings a womans voice came over the phone central intelligence agency mr paytons office are you his secretary no sir this is the reception desk mr payton has gone for the day listen to me please said the washington detective with absolute control its urgent that i reach mr payton immediately whatever the regulations they can be broken can you understand me girl its an emergency please identify yourself sir hells fire i dont want to but i will im lieutenant patrick oreilly detective first grade district of columbia police department youve got to find him for me suddenly startlingly a male voice was on the line oreilly the man said like in oreilly the secretary of a certain congressman the same sir you dont answer your goddamned phoneexcuse my language this is a trunk line to my apartment mr oreilly you may switch systems operator thank you sir there was a snap over the phone yes mr oreilly were alone now im not im in the company of six corpses thirty yards from my car what get out here mr payton kendricks house and if you dont want headlines call off any relieving unit thats heading here secure said the stunned director of special projects the relief comes on at midnight its covered by the men inside theyre dead too theyre all dead mitchell payton crouched beside the dead body of the guard nearest the gate wincing under the beam of oreillys light good god he was so young theyre all so young were sir said the detective flatly theres no one alive outside or inside ive turned off most of the lights but ill escort you through of course i must of course but i wont unless you tell me where congressman kendrick isif he is or whether he was supposed to be here which would mean he probably isnt i can and obviously should call the fairfax police am i clear sir gaelically clear lieutenant for the time being this must remain an agency problema catastrophe if you like am i clear answer my question or rest assured ill do my sworn duty and call fairfax headquarters where is congressman kendrick his cars not here and i want to know whether i should be relieved by that fact or not if you can find any relief in this situation youre a very strange man i mourn these people these strangers to me as ive mourned hundreds like em in my time but i know evan kendrick now if you have the information i want it this very moment or i go to my vehicle and radio my report to the police in fairfax for gods sake dont you threaten me lieutenant if you want to know where kendrick is ask your wife my wife the congressmans secretary in case its slipped your mind you fancy rumbugger exploded paddy why the hell do you think im out here to pay a twotoilet social call on my old society chum the millionaire from colorado im here chauncyboyo because annie hasnt heard from evan in two days and since nine oclock this morning both his phone here and in mesa verde dont ring now thats what you might call a coincidence isnt it both his telephones payton snapped his head around peering above dont bother said oreilly following the directors gaze one lines been cut and expertly spliced into another the thick cable to the roofs intact good christ in my opinion you need his immediate help kendrick where the hell is he the bahamas nassau in the bahamas why did you think my wife his secretary knew that and youd better have a good goddamned reason for thinking so dan fancy because if this is some kind of spook shit to involve annie mulcahy in one of your fuckups ill have more blue jackets swarming around here than youve ever seen i thought so because he told me lieutenant oreilly said payton his voice cold his eyes straying his thoughts apparently racing he never told her obviously agreed the cia director now staring at the house however he was explicit the day before yesterday he said that on the way to the airport he would stop at his office and leave the information with his secretary ann oreilly he stopped he went up to his office the mobile unit confirmed it what time was that around fourthirty if i remember the mobiles logs wednesday yes annie wasnt there every wednesday she leaves at four oclock in the afternoon and kendrick knows it its her crazy aerobics class he obviously forgot not likely come with me sir i beg your pardon out to my car we have work to do here lieutenant and i have several calls to makefrom my car alone youre not doing a damn thing until i speak to congressman kendricks secretary sixtyfive seconds later with payton standing by the open door the voice of patrick oreillys wife came over the cellular phones speaker congressman kendricks annie interrupted her husband after you left the office wednesday afternoon who was there only phil tobias its slow these days the girls left earlier phil who tobias hes evans chief aide and washer of the bottles he never said anything to you yesterday or today about seeing kendrick i mean he hasnt been here paddy he didnt show up today or yesterday i left half a dozen messages on his answering machine but i havent heard from him the highhog pr brat that he is ill talk to you later tiger stay where you are understood oreilly replaced the phone and turned in his seat looking up at the man from the central intelligence agency you heard sir i think an apology from yours truly is in order you have it mr payton i neither seek it nor want it lieutenant weve botched up so damned much in langley that if someone thinks that his wife may be caught in one of our bungles i cant fault him for telling us off im afraid that was it who goes after tobias you or me i cant deputize you oreilly theres no provision for it in the law and frankly there are specific provisions against it but i can ask for your help and i desperately need it i can cover for tonight on the basis of genuine national security youre off the hook for not reporting but where this tobias is concerned i can only plead for what asked the detective getting out of the car and quietly closing the door to keep me informed you dont have to plead for that before any official report is released added payton that youve got to plead for said paddy studying the director to begin with i couldnt guarantee it if hes spotted in switzerland or floats up in the potomac i wouldnt necessarily know about it were obviously thinking along the same lines however you have whats referred to as clout lieutenant forgive me but ive had to learn about everyone around evan kendrick the district of columbia police department virtually bribed you to come to washington twelve years ago from boston grade pay nothing shady grade pay nearly equivalent to chief of detectives a position you turned down four years ago because you didnt want the desk holy jesus ive had to be thorough and since your wife works for the congressman i believe a man in your position could insist on being informed if and when anything relevant to phillip tobias comes down as he also works or worked in kendricks office i suppose i could thats my girl but it leads me to a question or two go right ahead any questions you have may help me why is evan in the bahamas i sent them there them the egyptian woman old weingrass told my wife she works for us she was part of oman theres a man in nassau who fronted a company that kendrick was briefly associated with years ago hes not terribly reputable and neither was the firm but we felt he was worth checking out for what purpose the director of special projects looked over the roof of the car at evan kendricks house at the now dimly lit windows and what they held beyond the glass all that will come later oreilly i wont hold anything back i promise you but from what youve described to me i have work to do i have to reach the shroud squad and that can only be done at my car the shroud squad what the hell is that a group of men neither of us would care to be a part of they pick up corpses they can never testify about forensically examine evidence theyve been sworn not to reveal theyre necessary and i respect every one of them but i wouldnt be one of them suddenly the staccato grating ring of the detectives cellular telephone erupted it had been tripped to emergency the sound echoing throughout the still cold night bouncing off the brick wall each echo receding into the woods beyond oreilly yanked open the door and grabbed the phone pulling it to his ear yes oh jesus paddy screamed ann mulcahy oreilly her voice amplified over the speaker they found him they found phil he was down under the boilers in the basement good christ paddy they say his throat was cut jesus mary and joseph hes dead paddy when you say they exactly who do you mean tiger harry and sam from night maintenancethey just called me scared out of their skins and told me to phone the police you just did annie tell them to stay where they are theyre not to touch anything or say anything until i get there understood not say anything its a quarantine ill explain later now call csecurity and have five men armed with shotguns posted outside the office say your husbands a police officer and he made the request because of personal threats against him understood yes paddy replied mrs oreilly in tears oh holy jesus hes dead the detective spun around in his seat the cia director was running to his car the icarus agenda chapter it was fourseventeen in the afternoon colorado time and emmanuel weingrasss patience had run out it had been close to eleven oclock in the morning when he personally discovered that the phone was not working subsequently learning that two of the nurses had known it several hours earlier when they tried to place calls one of the girls had driven into mesa verde to use the grocery store phone and report the disruption of service to the telephone company she returned with the assurance that the problem would be repaired as soon as possible possible had now dragged out over five hours and that was unacceptable to manny a renowned congressmanto say nothing of the national hero that he wasdemanded far better treatment it was an affront weingrass had no intention of tolerating and although he said nothing to his coven of witches he had bad thoughtslike disturbing thoughts hear this you prognosticators for the thane of cawdor he shouted at the top of his lungs in the glassenclosed veranda at the two nurses playing gin rummy what in heavens name are you talking about manny asked the third from a chair by the arch in the living room lowering her newspaper macbeth you illiterate im laying down the law the laws the only thing you could handle in that department methuselah gin so little you know about the bible miss erudite i will not remain beyond reach of the outside world any longer one of you will either drive me into town where i can call the president of this mishegoss telephone company or i will urinate all over the kitchen youll be in a straitjacket first said one of the girls playing cards wait a minute countered her partner he can call the congressman and he could put on some pressure i really have to reach frank hes flying out tomorrowi told youand i havent been able to make a reservation at the motel in cortez im for it said the nurse in the living room he can call from abe hawkinss grocery store knowing you dears sex will out said manny but we call from the phone in geegees office i dont trust anyone named abraham he probably sold weapons to the ayatollah and forgot to make a profit ill just get a sweater and my jacket ill drive offered the nurse in the living room dropping the newspaper beside the chair and rising put on your overcoat manny its cold and theres a strong wind from the mountains weingrass muttered a minor epithet as he passed the woman and headed for his bedroom in the south wing of the first floor once out of sight in the stone hallway he hastened his pace he had more to retrieve than a sweater inside his large room redesigned by him to include sliding glass doors across the south wall opening on to a flagstone terrace he walked rapidly to the tallboy grabbing and dragging a chair from his desk to the high chest of drawers cautiously holding on to the knobs he climbed on the chair reached over the curlicued top of the imposing piece of furniture and removed a shoe box he lowered himself back to the floor carried the box to the bed and opened it revealing a calibre automatic and three clips of shells the concealment was necessary evan had given orders that his shotgun case was to be locked and all ammunition removed and that no handguns were permitted in the house the reasons had been too painful for either man to bring up kendrick believed with more logic than less that if his old friend thought the cancer had returned he would take his own life but for emmanuel weingrass after the life he had led to be without a weapon was anathema geegee gonzalez had remedied the situation and manny had only once smashed open the shotgun case and that was when the media had descended on them pissing all over the grounds he slapped in one clip put the other two into his pockets and carried the chair back to the desk he went to his cupboard took a long heavyknit sweater from the shelf and slipped it on it covered the protrusions effectively he then did something he had not done since the redesigned room had been built not even when the reporters and the television crews had assaulted them he inspected the locks on the sliding doors crossed to a red switch hidden behind the curtains and turned on the alarm he walked out of the bedroom closing the door and joined the nurse in the front hall she was holding his overcoat for him thats a handsome sweater manny i got it on sale in a monte carlo apresski shop do you always have to have a flip answer no kidding its true here put on your coat i look like a hasid in that thing a what heidi in the edelweiss oh no i think its very masculine oy lets get out of here weingrass started for the door then stopped girls he shouted his voice carrying to the veranda yes manny what please listen to me ladies im serious id feel much more comfortable what with the phone being out if you would please turn on the main alarm humour me my lovelies im a foolish old man to you i realize that but i really would feel better if you did this for me how sweet of him of course we will manny that humble crap always works thought weingrass continuing towards the door come on hurry up he said to the nurse behind him who was struggling with her parka i want to get to geegees before that phone company closes up for the month the winds from the mountains were strong the trek from the massive front door to kendricks saab turbo halfway down the circular drive was made by leaning into the gusts manny shielded his face with his left hand his head turned to the right when suddenly the wind and his discomfort became irrelevant at first he thought that the swirling leaves and erratic pockets of dust were distorting his still viable eyesightand then he knew it was not so there was movement human movement beyond the tall hedges that fronted the road a figure had rushed to the right lurching to the ground behind a particularly thick area of the foliage then another this one following the first and going farther you okay manny shouted the nurse as they approached the car this stuff is kindergarten compared with the passes in the maritime alps yelled back weingrass get in hurry up oh id love to see the alps some day so would i mumbled weingrass climbing into the saab his right hand unobtrusively slipping under the overcoat and the sweater to reach his automatic he pulled it out and lowered it between the seat and the door as the nurse inserted the key and started the engine when you get to the road turn left he said no manny youre wrong the quickest way to mesa verde is to the right i know that lovely thing but i still want you to turn left manny if youre trying to pull something at your age im going to be furious just turn left drive around the curve and stop mister weingrass if you think for an instant im getting out broke in the old architect quietly i dont want to alarm you and ill explain everything later but right now youre going to do exactly as i tell you please drive the astonished nurse did not understand mannys softspoken words but she understood the look in his eyes there were no theatrics no bombast he was simply giving her an order thank you he continued as she drove out between the wall of tall hedges and swung left i want you to take the mancos road back into verde thatll add at least ten minutes i know but its what i want you to do go directly to geegees as fast as you can and tell him to call the police manny cried the nurse interrupting as she tightly gripped the wheel im sure its nothing at all said weingrass quickly reassuringly probably just someone whose car broke down or a hiker whos lost nevertheless its better to check these things out dont you think i dont know what to think but im certainly not letting you out of this car yes you will disagreed manny casually raising the automatic as if studying the trigger housing no threat at all in his action good god yelled the nurse im perfectly safe my dear because im a cautious man to the point of cowardice stop here please the near panicked woman did as she was told her frightened eyes shifting rapidly back and forth between the weapon and the old mans face thank you said weingrass opening the door the sound of the wind sudden powerful ill probably find our harmless visitor inside having coffee with the girls he added stepping out and closing the door by pressing it shut wheels spinning the saab raced away no matter thought manny the gusts of wind covered the sound as it also covered whatever sound he made heading back towards the house unavoidable sounds as he stayed out of sight on the border of the road his feet cracking the fallen branches at the edge of the woods he was as grateful for the racing dark clouds above in the sky as he was for the dark overcoat both kept his being seen to a minimum five minutes later and several yards deeper into the woods he stood by a thick tree at midpoint opposite the wall of hedges he again shielded his face from the wind and squinting peered across the road they were there and they were not lost his disturbing thoughts had been valid and rather than being lost the intruders were waitingfor something or someone both men wore leather jackets and were crouched in front of the hedges talking rapidly to each other the man on the right constantly impatiently glancing at his wristwatch weingrass did not have to be told what that meant they were waiting for someone or more than someone awkwardly feeling his age physically but not in his imagination manny lowered himself to the ground and began prowling around on his hands and knees not sure what he was looking for but knowing he had to find it whatever it was it was a thick heavy limb newly blown down by the wind sap still oozing from the shards where it had been snapped from a larger source in the trunk it was about forty inches long it was swingable slowly more awkwardly and painfully the old man rose to his feet and made his way back to the tree where he had been standing diagonally across the road from the two intruders no more than fifty feet away it was a gamble but then so was what was left of his life and the odds were infinitely better than they were at roulette or chemin de fer the results too would be known more quickly and the gambler in emmanuel weingrass was willing to place a decent bet that one of the intruders would stay where he was out of basic common sense the aged architect moved back in the woods selecting his position as carefully as if he were refining a final blueprint for the most important client of his life he was the client was himself make total use of the natural surroundings had been axiomatic with him all his professional life he did not veer from that rule now there were two poplars both wide and about seven feet apart forming an abstract forest gate he concealed himself behind the trunk on the right gripped the heavy limb and raised it until it leaned against the bark above his head the wind careened through the trees and through the multiple sounds of the forest he opened his mouth and roared a short singsong chant onethird human twothirds animal he craned his neck and watched between the trunks and the lower foliage he could see the startled figures across the road both men spun around in their crouching positions the man on the right gripping his companions shoulder apparentlyhopefully prayed mannyissuing orders he had the man on the left got to his feet pulled a gun from inside his jacket and started for the forest across the road to mesa verde everything was timing now timing and direction the brief seductive sounds leading the quarry into the fatal sea of green as surely as the sirens lured ulysses twice more weingrass emitted the eerie calls and then a third that was so pronounced that the intruder rushed forward slapping branches in front of him his weapon levelled his feet digging into the soft earthtowards and finally into the forest gate manny pulled back on the thick heavy limb and swung it with all his strength down and across into the head of the racing man the face was shattered blood spurting out of every feature the skull a mass of broken bone and cartilage the man was dead breathlessly weingrass walked out from behind the trunk and knelt down the man was an arab the winds from the mountains continued their assault manny pulled the gun from the corpses still warm hand and even more awkwardly far more painfully edged his way back towards the road the dead intruders companion was a wild core of misdirected energy he kept spinning his head towards the woods towards the road from mesa verde and down at his watch the only thing he had not done was display a weapon and that told weingrass something else the terroristand he was a terrorist both were terroristswas either a rank amateur or a thorough professional nothing in between feeling the pounding echo in his frail chest manny permitted himself a few moments to breathe but only moments the opportunity might not come again he moved north from tree trunk to tree trunk until he was sixty feet above the anxious man who kept glancing south again timing weingrass walked as fast as he could across the road and stood motionless watching the wouldbe killer was now close to apoplectic twice he started into the road towards the woods both times returning to the hedges and crouching staring at his watch manny moved forward his automatic gripped in his veined right hand when he was within ten feet of the terrorist he shouted jezzar he roared calling the man a butcher in arabic if you move youre dead fahem the darkskinned man spun round clawing the earth as he rolled into the hedges loose dirt flying up into the old architects face through the hurling debris weingrass understood why the terrorist had not displayed a weapon it was on the ground beside him inches from his hand manny fell to his left on the road as the man grabbed the gun now lunging backwards enmeshing himself in prickly green web and fired twice the reports were barely heard they were two eerily muted spits in the wind a silencer was attached to the terrorists pistol the bullets however were not silent one shrieked through the air above weingrass the second ricocheted off the cement near his head manny raised his automatic and pulled the trigger the calm of experience despite the years steadying his hand the terrorist screamed through the rushing wind and collapsed forward into the hedge his eyes wide a rivulet of blood trickling from the base of his throat hurry up you decrepit bastard cried weingrass to himself struggling to his feet they were waiting for someone you want to be a senile ugly duck in a gallery your meshuggah head blown off would serve you right shush every bone is boiling in pain manny lurched towards the body wedged in the hedge he bent down pulled the corpse forward then gripped the mans feet and grimacing using every iota of strength that was in him dragged the body across the road and into the woods he wanted only to lie on the ground and rest to let the hammering in his chest subside and swallow air but he knew he could not do that he had to keep going he had to be ready above all he had to take someone alive these people were after his son information had to be learned all manner of death to follow he heard the sound of an engine in the distance and then the sound disappeared bewildered he sidestepped slowly cautiously between the trees to the edge of the woods and peered out a car was coming up the road from mesa verde but either it was idling or coasting or the wind was too strong it was coasting for now only the rolling tyres could be heard as it approached the wall of tall hedges barely moving finally stopping before the first entrance to the circular drive two men were inside the driver a stocky man not young but not much over forty got out first and looked around obviously expecting to be met or signalled he squinted in the dark afternoon light and seeing no one crossed the road to the wooded side and started walking forward weingrass shoved his automatic into his belt and bent down for the second killers pistol with the perforated silencer attached to the barrel it was too large for a pocket so like the arab he placed it at his feet he stood up and stepped farther back into the overgrowth he checked the weapons cylinder there were four bullets left the man approached he was now directly in front of manny yosef the name was suddenly carried on the wind half shouted by the drivers companion who had left the car and was racing down the road his quickening steps impeded by a pronounced limp manny was perplexed yosef was a hebrew name yet these killers were not israelis be quiet boy commanded the older man gruffly in arabic as his partner stopped breathlessly in front of him you raise your voice like that againanywhereill ship you back to the baaka in a coffin weingrass watched and listened to the two men no more than twenty feet away on the edge of the road he was mildly astonished but now understood the use of the arabic word walad or boy the drivers companion was a boy a youngster barely sixteen or seventeen if that youll send me nowhere answered the young man angrily a speech impediment obvious undoubtedly a harelip ill never walk properly again because of that pig i could have become a great martyr of our holy cause but for him very well very well said the older arab with a hebrew name not without a degree of compassion throw cool water on your neck or your head will explode now what is it the american radio i just heard it and i understand enough tounderstand our people at the other house no nothing like that the jews they executed old khouri they hanged him what did you expect aman forty years ago he was still working with the german nazis left in northern africa he killed jews he blew up kibbutzim even a hotel in haifa then we must kill the murderer begin and all the old men of the irgun and the stern khouri was a symbol of greatness for us oh be quiet boy those old men fought the british more than they did us neither they nor old khouri have anything to do with what we must do today we must teach a lesson to a filthy politician who pretended to be one of us he hid in our clothes and used our tongue and betrayed the friendship we offered him now boy concentrate on now where are the others they were to come out on the road i dont know they may have learned something or seen something and gone inside the house lights are being turned on now you can see through those high bushes each of us will crawl up from either side of the halfcircle entrance go through the grass to the windows we will probably learn that our comrades are having coffee with whoever is there before slicing their throats emmanuel weingrass raised the silenced pistol firming it against the trunk of a tree moving it back and forth between the two terrorists he wanted both alive the words in arabic referring to the other house so shocked him that in fury he might well blow both their heads away they wanted to kill his son if they had they would pay dearlyin agonymisguided youth or age irrelevant terrible pain would be the only consequence he levelled the weapon at the pelvic region of both killers back and forth back and forth he fired just as a sudden gust of wind swirled along the road two rounds into the older man one into the boy it was as if neither could possibly comprehend the child collapsed screaming writhing on the ground his elder companion was made of strongermuch strongerstuff he staggered to his feet turning to the source of the fire and lurched forward the stocky hulk a furious monster in pain dont come any closer yosef yelled manny exhausted beyond endurance and holding on to the tree i dont want to kill you but i will you of the hebrew name who kills jews my mother screamed the approaching giant of a man she renounced all of you you are killers of my people you take everything that is ours and spit on us i am half jew but who are the jews to kill my father and shave the head of my mother because she loved an arab i will take you to hell weingrass held on to the trunk of the tree his fingernails bleeding as he dug into the bark his long black overcoat billowing in the wind the broad dark figure lunged out of the forest darkness his enormous hands gripping the old mans throat dont screamed manny knowing instantly that there was no choice he fired the last shell the bullet penetrating the wrinkled forehead above him yosef fell away his final gesture one of defiance trembling and gasping for breath weingrass leaned against the tree staring down at the ground at the body of a man who had been in torment over an insignificant territorial arrangement that had forced humans to kill each other in that moment emmanuel weingrass came to a conclusion that had eluded him from the moment he was capable of thinking he knew the answer now the arrogance of blind belief led all the mendacities of human thought it pitted man viciously against man in the pursuit of the ultimate unknowable who had the right yosef yosef cried the boy rolling over in the undergrowth by the edge of the road where are you im hit im hit the child did not know thought weingrass from where the wounded boy lay writhing he could not see and the wind from the mountains further muffled the muted gunshot the maniacal young terrorist did not realize that his comrade yosef was dead that he alone had survived and his survival was uppermost in mannys mind there could be no new martyr for a holy cause brought on by selfinflicted death not here not now there were facts to be learned facts that could save the life of evan kendrick especially now weingrass shoved his bleeding fingers into his overcoat pocket and dropped the silenced weapon on the ground summoning what strength he had left he pushed himself away from the tree and made his way as quickly as he could south through the woods stumbling again and again his frail arms pushing the branches from his face and body he veered towards the road he reached it and saw the killers car in the darkening distance he had gone far enough he turned and started back on the mercifully smooth surfacefaster faster move your goddamned spindly legs that boy must not move he must not crawl he must not see manny felt the blood rushing to his head the pounding in his rib cage deafening there was the young arab he had movedwas moving crawling into the woods in moments he would see his dead companion it could not happen aman shouted weingrass breathlessly remembering the name used by the halfjew yosef as if it were his own ayn ent kaif elahwal he continued in arabic urgently asking the boy where he was and how he was itkallem he roared against the wind ordering the young terrorist to respond here in here yelled the teenage arab in his own language ive been shot in the hip i cant find yosef the young man rolled over on his back to greet an expected comrade who are you he screamed struggling to reach under his field jacket for a gun as manny approached i dont know you weingrass smashed his foot against the boys elbow and as the empty hand whipped out from under the cloth he stepped on it pinning it to the young arabs chest no more of that you fool of a child said manny his arabic that of a saudi officer reprimanding a lowly recruit we havent covered you to have you cause even more trouble of course you were shot and i trust you realize that you were merely wounded not killed which could have been easily managed what are you saying what were you doing shouted manny in reply running in the road raising your voice crawling around our objective like a thief in the night yosef was right you should be shipped back to the baaka yosef where is yosef up in the house with the others come ill help you join them afraid of falling over weingrass held on to the branch of a sapling as the terrorist pulled himself up gripping mannys hand first give me your weapon what they think youre stupid enough they dont want you armed i dont understand you dont have to weingrass slapped the bewildered young fanatic across the face and simultaneously shoved his right hand between the buttoned fold of the boys jacket to pull out the wouldbe killers gun it was appropriate it was a calibre pistol you can shoot gnats with this said manny grabbing the teenagers arm come along hop on one foot if its easier well paste you up what remained of the late afternoon sun was obscured by the swirling dark clouds of a gathering storm surging out of the mountains the drained exhausted old man and the wounded youngster were halfway across the road when suddenly the roar of an engine was heard and headlights of a racing vehicle caught them in the beams the car was bearing down on them thundering up from the south from mesa verde tyres shrieking the powerful car sideslipped into a skid and pounded to a stop only yards away from weingrass and his captive who were lunging towards the hedge mannys grip tightening on the arabs field jacket a man leaped from the large black car as weingrasslurching stumblingreached into his overcoat pocket for his own automatic the figure rushing towards him was a blur in the old architects eyes he raised his gun to fire manny yelled geegee gonzalez weingrass fell to the ground his hand still gripping the wounded terrorist grab him he ordered geegee with what seemed like the last breath in his lungs dont let him gohold his arms they sometimes carry cyanide the young arab was given a needle by one of the two nurses he would be unconscious until morning his bullet wound was bloody not serious the bullet itself having passed through the flesh it was cleansed the openings held together with heavy tape and the bleeding stopped he was then carried by gonzalez to a guest room his arms and legs strapped to the four corners of the bed where the nurses covered his naked body with two blankets to help prevent any possible trauma hes so terribly young said the nurse placing the pillow under the teenage arabs head hes a killer responded weingrass icily staring at the terrorists face hed kill you without thinking for an instant about the life he was takingthe way he wants to kill jews the way he will kill us if we let him live thats revolting mr weingrass said the other nurse hes a child tell that to the parents of god knows how many jewish children who were never permitted his years manny left the room to rejoin gonzalez who had hastily gone outside to drive his all too recognizable car into a garage he had returned and was pouring himself a large glass of whisky at the bar on the veranda help yourself said the architect walking into the enclosed porch and heading for his leather armchair ill put it on your bill like you do with me you crazy old man spat out geegee loco you plain loco you know that you coulda been killed muerto you comprende muerto muerto dead dead dead you old fool maybe that i could live with but not when you give me a heart attack i dont live so good with a heart attack when its fatal you comprende you know what i mean okay okay so you can have that drink on the house loco shouted gonzalez again drinking the whisky in what appeared to be a single swallow youve made your point agreed manny have another i wont start charging until the third i dont know whether to go or whether to stay said geegee once more pouring a drink the police like i told you who had time for the police and if i called them theyd come around in a month your girl the ama de cria the nurse shes calling them i only hope she found one of those payasos sometimes you gotta call durango to get someone out here the phone on the bar rangit rang but it was not the ring of a telephone instead it was a steady whirrtoned sound weingrass was so startled that he nearly fell to the floor pushing himself out of the chair you want me to get it asked gonzalez no roared manny walking rapidly unsteadily towards the bar dont bite off my cabeza hello said the old man into the phone forcing control on himself mr weingrass perhaps yes perhaps no who are you were on a laser patch into your telephone line my name is mitchell payton i know all about you interrupted manny is my boy all right yes he is ive just spoken to him in the bahamas a military aircraft has been dispatched from holmstead air force base to pick him up hell be in washington in a few hours keep him there surround him with guards dont let anyone near him then its happened out there i feel so useless so incompetent i should have posted guards how many were killed three said manny oh my god how much do the police know they dont they havent got here yet they havent listen to me mr weingrass what im about to say will appear strange if not insane to you but i know what im talking about for the time being this tragic event must be contained well have a far greater chance to catch the bastards by avoiding panic and letting our own experts go to work can you understand that mr weingrass understood and arranged answered an old man who had worked with the mossad a certain impatient condescension creeping into his voice the police will be met outside and told it was a false alarma neighbour whose car had broken down and couldnt reach us on the phone thats all i forgot said the director of special projects quietly youve been here before ive been here agreed manny without comment wait a minute exclaimed payton you said three were dead but youre talking to me youre all right the three were them not us mr cia incompetent what jesus christ he wasnt much help try abraham please be clearer mr weingrass i had to kill them but the fourths alive and under sedation get your experts out here before i kill him too the icarus agenda chapter the cia station chief in the bahamas a short deeply tanned man with broad features manoeuvred quickly from his office at the embassy on queen street an armed escort was sent by the nassau police to the cable beach hotel on the shores of bay road where four uniformed officers rapidly accompanied a tall man with light brown hair and a striking oliveskinned woman from their suite on the seventh floor to a waiting vehicle in the efficiently emptied drive outside the imposing marble lobby the hotels director of operations an alert scotsman named mcleod had mapped out a route through the service corridors where his most trusted security guards stood watch to the brightly lit entrance fronted by two enormous fountains sending floodlit sprays up into the dark sky mcleods two assistants an immense goodhumoured man with a booming laugh and the improbable name of vernal accompanied by an attractive young hostess courteously explained to those arriving and departing that the delays would be brief they persuasively explained while the fiveman motorcycle unit swept the dramatically shadowed grounds the station chief had personalized everything favours were done for him he knew by name everyone there was to know in the bahamas and they knew him in silence evan and khalehla shielded by the wall of police climbed into the government vehicle the cia man in the front seat kendrick was beyond talking khalehla could only grip his hand knowing only too well what he was experiencing clarity of thought eluded him burning sorrow and a furious anger had replaced it tears had welled in his eyes over the deaths of kashi and sabri hassan he did not have to be told of the mutilations he could easily horribly imagine what they were yet those tears had been quickly impulsively wiped away by a clenched fist a reckoning was coming that too was in his eyes in the cores of his pupils fury as you can understand congressman said the station chief turning partially around in the seat beside the driver i dont know whats going on but i can tell you that a plane from holmstead air force base in florida is on its way to take you back to washington it should arrive about five or ten minutes after we get to the airport we know that said khalehla pleasantly it would have been here by now but they said theres rotten weather in miami and several commercial flights are on the same route that probably means they wanted to stock up the aircraft properly for you siri mean the two of you of course thats most kind of them said the field agent from cairo squeezing evans hand conveying the fact that he did not have to speak if theres anything you think you might have left behind at the hotel well gladly take care of it theres nothing exclaimed kendrick whispering harshly he means weve taken care of everything thank you said khalehla pulling evans hand against her leg and grasping it even more firmly this is obviously an emergency and the congressman has a great deal on his mind may i assume weve been cleared through customs this parade is driving straight through the cargo gates replied the government man glancing briefly closely at kendrick then turning away as if he had unwittingly invaded anothers privacy the rest of the trip was made in silence until the high steel gates of the cargo terminal swung open and the procession drove through over the tarmac to the end of the first runway the f from holmstead should be landing soon said the station chief im getting out evan reached for the handle of the door and yanked it back it was locked id rather you didnt congressman kendrick let me out of this car evan its his job khalehla gently but firmly held kendricks arm he has to go by the rules do they include suffocating me im breathing fine youre not me i know darling no one can be you right now rashad angled her head and looked out of the rear window scanning the terminals buildings and the grounds our status is as clean as it could be she said turning back to the intelligence officer let him walk ill stay with him and so can the men a clean status youre one of us yes but youve already forgotten me please the flight to washingtons going to be rough enough sure were okay the guy who made up this rule isnt here he just said dont let him out of that vehicle in a very loud voice mj can be extreme mj come on lets get some air release the doors please driver thank you said evan quietly to khalehla and im sorry you dont have a damn thing to be sorry about just dont make a liar out of me and get shot it could ruin my day now im sorry its no time for dumb wisecracks wait a minute kendrick began to open the door then stopped his face inches from hers in the shadows a few moments ago you said that no one could be me right now and i agree but that said im awfully glad youre you right now they walked in a brief bahamian drizzle talking quietly the cia officer a polite distance behind the guards flanking them with ominously drawn side arms suddenly from out of the cargo area a small dark car came racing across the field its highpitched engine screaming the guards converged on evan and khalehla shoving them to the ground the cia officer throwing himself over kendrick and pulling the rashad woman into his side as quickly as the panic started it stopped there were rapid blasts of a twonote siren the car was an airport vehicle the leader of the motorcycle escort holstered his weapon and approached the uniformed man who climbed out of the small car they talked quietly and the police officer returned to the stunned americans who were getting to their feet there is an emergency telephone call for your friend sir he said to the station chief patch it out here we have no such equipment i want something better than that i was told to repeat the letters mj thats better enough said khalehla ill go with him hey come on countered the cia man there are other rules too and you know them as well as i do its a lot easier securing a single than a double ill go and take four men you stay here with the others and cover for me okay this is the meeting ground and you could have a nervous pilot on your hands looking for some special luggage mainly you the telephone was on the wall of a deserted warehouse the call was transferred and the first words kendrick heard from mitchell payton caused every muscle in his body to lock his mind on fire youve got to hear the worst there was an assault on mesa verde christ no emmanuel weingrass is all right hes all right evan is he hurt wounded no in fact he did the woundingthe killing one of the terrorists is still alive i want him shouted kendrick so do we our people are on the way out there mesa verde was the terrorists backup for fairfax wasnt it unquestionably but right now its also our only hope in tracking down the others whatever that survivor knows hell tell us keep him alive your friend weingrass has seen to it strip him for cyanide its been done he cant be left alone for a minute we know that of course you do said evan closing his eyes his face drenched with sweat and rain im not thinking i cant think hows manny taking it with considerable arrogance to be truthful thats the first decent news ive heard youre entitled to it he was truly remarkable for a man of his age he was always remarkable at any age ive got to get out there forget washington fly me directly to colorado i assumed you would make that request its not a request mitch its a demand of course its also the reason why your plane is delayed the air force has punched up the fuelling for denver and points west and is clearing a flight plan above the commercial routes the aircraft has a maximum speed of mach two point three youll be home in less than three hours and remember say nothing to anyone about fairfax weingrass has already contained mesa verde how let him tell you do you really think you can keep everything quiet i will if i have to go to the president myself and at this point i dont think theres any alternative how will you get past the palace guard im working on that theres a man i studied with years ago in my early life as a wouldbe historian weve kept in touch in a casual way and he has a great deal of influence i think you know the name its winters samuel winters winters hes the one who told jennings to give me the freedom medal in that crazy ceremony i remembered its why i thought of him have a good flight and my love to my niece kendrick walked to the warehouse door where his police escort stood two inside two outside their weapons levelled in front of them even the cias station chief who in the dim light looked as though he might be bahamian himself held a small revolver in his hand you people always carry those things asked evan without much interest ask your friend who knew that the status was clean replied the intelligence officer waving kendrick through the door youre joking she has one ask her how did she get on the plane in the states the metal detectors then customs over here one of our little secrets which isnt so secret a luggage or customs supervisor just happens to show up when were passing through and the detector is shut down for a couple of seconds and with customs an immigration inspector is alerted as to what not to find thats pretty loose said kendrick climbing into the official airport car not in nearby places like this the supervisors not only work for us but theyre monitored farther away our equipment is waiting for us inside the station chief sat beside evan in the back seat of the small car and the driver sped out to the runway the huge sleek military jet known as the f delta dart had arrived its engines idling in a bass roar as khalehla stood by a ramp of metal steps talking with an air force officer it was only as he approached the two of them that kendrick recognized the type of aircraft he was about to enter it was not a calming recognition the jet was similar to the one that had flown him to sardinia over a year ago the first leg on his journey to masqat he turned to the intelligence officer walking beside him and extended his hand thanks for everything he said im sorry i havent been more pleasant company you could have spat in my face and id still have been proud to meet you congressman i wish i could say i appreciate that what is your name call me joe sir call me joe a young man on the same type of aircraft a year ago had been called joe was another oman another bahrain in his future thank you joe were not quite finished mr kendrick one of those af boys with the rank of colonel or above has to sign a paper the signer in question was not a colonel he was a brigadier general and he was black hello again dr axelrod said the pilot of the f it seems im your personal chauffeur the large man held out his hand thats the way the powers that be like it hello general lets get one thing straight congressman i was out of line last time and you handed it to me and you were right but ill tell you now that if they transfer me to colorado ill vote for you in spadesdont take that idiomatically thanks general said evan attempting to smile however i wont be needing any more votes thatd be a damn shame ive been watching you listening to you i like the sweep of your wing and thats something i know about i think youre supposed to sign a paper i never got one in sardinia said the general officer accepting a letter of release from the cia station chief you sure youre gonna accept this lil old document from an uppity goinonfifty nigger in a generals suit mr old school tie shut your mouth boy im half paiute indian you think youve got problems sorry son the air force officer signed and his special cargo got on board what happened asked khalehla when they reached their seats why did mj call his hands shaking his voice trembling at the sudden enormity of it all at the violence and the near death of emmanuel weingrass he told her there was a pained helplessness both in his eyes and in his halting frightened spurts of explanation christ its got to stop if it doesnt ill kill everyone i care for she could only grip his hand again and let him know that she was there she could not fight the lightning in his mind it was too personal too soulracking thirty minutes into the flight evan convulsed and leaped out of his seat racing up the aisle to the toilet he retched throwing up everything he had eaten in the last twelve hours khalehla ran behind him forcing the narrow door open and grabbing his forehead holding him telling him to let it all out please coughed kendrick please get out of here why because youre so different from the rest of us you hurt but you wont cry you bottle it up until somethings got to give im not wild about pity youre not getting it either youre a grown man whos gone through a terrible loss and nearly suffered a greater oneor you the greatest one i hope im your friend evan and as a friend i dont pity youi respect you too much for thatbut i do feel for you kendrick stood up grabbing paper towels from the dispenser pale and visibly shaken you know how to make a guy feel terrific he said guiltily wash your face and comb your hair youre a mess rashad walked out of the small enclosure past two uniformed and startled flight crew the damn fool ate some bad fish she explained without looking at either man will one of you close the door please an hour passed drinks were served by the air force attendants followed by a microwaved dinner eaten heartily by the intelligence agent from cairo but barely picked at by the congressman you need food friend said khalehla this beats the hell out of any commercial menu enjoy how about you you move it around but you dont eat ill have another drink their heads snapped up with the piercing sound of a buzzer heard easily over the outside roar of the engines for evan it was deja vu a buzzer had sounded a year ago and he had been summoned to the flight deck now however the corporal who answered the intercom on the bulkhead walked back and spoke to khalehla theres a radio transmission for you miss thank you said rashad turning and seeing the alarm in kendricks expression if it was anything important theyd ask for you relax she made her way up the aisle gripping the few wellseparated seats for balance in the mild turbulence and sat in the seat in front of the bulkhead the crewman handed her the phone the spiralling cord was more than adequate for the reach she crossed her legs and answered this is pencil two bahamas who are you one of these days weve got to get rid of that garbage said mitchell payton it works mj if id used banana two how would you have responded id have called your father and told him you were a naughty girl we dont count we know each other what is it i dont want to talk to evan hes too upset to think clearly you have to ill try whats your query i want your evaluation the information you got from that fellow you went to see from the old off shore investment crowd in nassauyoure convinced hes reliable arent you his information is he isnt but he cant hide if he lied for money the mans a floating drunk who lives off whats left of his wits which may have been more acute before his brain was soaked in gin evan showed him two thousand in cash and believe me he would have given away the secrets of the drug trade for it do you recall exactly what he said about the woman ardis montreaux certainly he said that he kept track of the moneywhore as he called her because she owed him and one day he was going to collect i mean her marital status of course i remember but evan told you over the phone i heard him tell me yourself no mistakes can be made all right she divorced the banker frazierpyke and married a wealthy californian from sun francisco named von lindemann he was specific about san francisco not actually he said san francisco or los angeles i think but he was very specific about california that was the point her new husband was a californian and terribly rich and the nametry to recall precisely youre certain it was von lindemann well yes we met him in a booth at the junkanoo and there was a steel band but yes that was the name or if it isnt exact its certainly close enough banco cried payton close enough my dear she married a man named vanvlanderen andrew vanvlanderen from palm springs so blame a mouth drowned in gin were beyond gin field agent rashad andrew vanvlanderen is one of langford jenningss most distinguished contributorsread that as a mother lode for the presidential coffers thats interesting oh were even beyond interest ardisolda wojak montreaux frazierpyke vanvlanderen an admittedly gifted and obviously talented administrator is currently vice president orson bollingers chief of staff thats fascinating i think the situation calls for an informal but nonetheless quite official visit from one of our middle east specialistsyoull be in southwest colorado barely an hour away i choose you good god mj on what basis threats were supposedly made against bollinger and an fbi unit was assigned to him they kept it quiettoo quiet in my judgmentand now the units suddenly recalled the emergency declared over coinciding with the attacks on fairfax and mesa verde suggested khalehla sharply interrupting it sounds crazy i know but its there call it the twitching of an old professionals nostrils but i detect an odour of amateurish offal drifting out of san diego implicating the bureau asked rashad astonished no using it im working on an interagency interrogation i intend to interview every member of that unit you still havent answered me whats the reason for my going to san diego were not domestic the same as mine for questioning the unit with regard to those threats against bollinger were looking into the possibility of terrorist involvement the good lord knows that if were pressed to reveal tonights events we have every justification i dont know where it is my dear but somewhere in this madness theres a connectionand a blond man with a european accent khalehla glanced around the cabin as she spoke the two attendants were talking quietly in their seats and evan was staring blankly out of the window ill do it of course but youre not making my life any easier its obvious that my boy had an affair with this vanvlanderen womannot that it bothers me but it bothers him why that strikes me as an odd sort of morality it was a long time ago youre missing the point mj sex isnt the morality he was conned seduced into almost becoming an international crook and he cant forget it or forgive himself maybe then ill relieve your concerns for the time being kendrick must not be told anything about san diego at this juncture in his state of mind god knows what hed do if he even had an inkling of such a connection and we dont need any loose cannons make up something about an emergency business trip and be convincing i want you to interrogate that very odd lady from left field ill prepare a scenario for you by morning ill handle it i trust you brought your hatswitch papers out of cairo didnt you of course you may want to use them were on extremely thin ice incidentally none of our people know you nor do you know them if i come up with something ill somehow relay it through weingrass in colorado very thin ice even evan realizes that may i ask how things are going with you two i warn you im inordinately fond of him lets put it this way we had a lovely twobedroom suite at cable beach and last night i could hear him pacing the living room outside my door until all hours of the morning i damn near walked out and ordered him inside why didnt you because everythings so confusing for us so consuming for himand now tonight so horrible i dont think either of us could handle personal complications thank heavens were on a scrambler follow your instincts field agent rashad theyve served us well in special projects ill call you in the morning with instructions good hunting dear niece khalehla returned to her seat and evans anxious stare other worlds go on and theyre just as deadly im afraid she said buckling her seat belt that was the station chief in cairo two of our contacts disappeared in the sidi barrani districtits a libyan connection i told him what to look for and whom to go after how are you feeling all right he answered studying her face our distinguished passengers and our not too shabby crew came the generals deep loud voice over the intercom from the flight deck it seems were destined to repeat ourselves dr axelrod remember that southern island the pilot went on to explain that in order to avoid the excitementand publicityof an af bird dropping in at the airport of durango or cortez they were instructed to head directly into the one at mesa verde the runway was deemed officially adequate but our touchdown could be a mite rocky so when i give the word belt em up tight were starting our descent from the satellites arrival estimated in fortyfive minutesif i can find the damn place remember doctor as the general had predicted with considerable understatement the landing shook the aircraft with a series of massive vibrations the blasting eruptions of the braking jets filling the fuselage outside on the ground thanks were expressed goodbyes said and the brigadier delivered his special cargo to a field officer of the central intelligence agency khalehla and evan were ushered quickly to an armourplated vehicle flown down from denver their motorcycle escort an armed sixman contingent from the state police oblivious as to why the governors office had ordered them to the backcountry millionaires airport near the mesa verde national park let me get you current congressman said the cia man sitting as had his colleague in the bahamas in the front seat beside the driver there are five of us here but two will fly back to virginia with the prisoner and the three dead bodies im spelling things out because i was told i can speak in front of the lady that you were official miss thank you for your confidence said the unrecognized agent for special projects yes maam weve contracted half a dozen forest rangers from the park for the night each backgrounded each a combat veteran to guard your house and grounds tomorrow a unit from langley will arrive to take up their posts christ what if theres another fairfax whispered evan khalehla pressed her elbow into kendricks side coughing as she did so i beg your pardon nothing sorry go ahead a couple of pointsand i dont mind telling you that old jewish guy should be put in someones hall of fame if somebody else doesnt put him in a padded cellbut you both have to know the facts the cover weingrass worked it out before we got therewow hes a pistol noted and accepted said kendrick what are the facts the nurses know very little they think there was only one terrorist a hallucinating fanatic at that the three bodies were hidden in the woods until the police left then carried by your mexican friend gonzalez back to the garage without the nurses seeing him they were on the other side of the house on the porch with mannyjesus how did he get me to call him manny anyway gonzalez locked the doors to the garage and drove back to his restaurant mr weingrass guarantees us hell keep quiet mr weingrass is right confirmed evan we dont like the arrangement but i guess you three go back a long time we go back a long time said kendrick so the congressman shouldnt make any references to the magnitude of the assault broke in khalehla is that what youre saying thats exactly what im saying everythings containment mr kendrick thats the order from onhigh in langley as far as anyone here is concerned were just government personnel no agency no bureau no identifications offered and none asked for theyre all too frightened to look for complications which is usually the case in these situations a plane will fly in around three oclock this morning the prisoner and his dead friends will be taken back to virginia he will be sent to an interrogation clinic the others to the forensic labs manny saidexcuse me mr weingrass said i should make all this clear to you its clear thank you sir boy that manny do you know he punched me in the stomach when i told him i was taking over i mean he threw a fist into my gut standard said kendrick peering out of the tinted window at the road they were only ten minutes from the house from manny they embraced in the doorway evan holding the old man far more firmly than the other held him then weingrass gently boxed kendricks ears and spoke you never got manners from your parents behind you is a lady i want very much to meet oh sorry said evan backing away manny this is khalehla khalehla rashad old weingrass stepped forward taking khalehlas hand in his we come from a troubled land you and i you are an arab and i am a jew but there are no such distinctions in this house no preconceptions and i must tell you that i love you very much for giving such joy to my son my god you are a marvel yes agreed manny nodding twice i love you too for all that you mean to evan khalehla placed her arms around the frail eightyyearold architect her face pressed against his i feel as if ive known you all my life i sometimes have that effect on people also sometimes the opposite as if their lives had taken a sudden turn for the worse mine hasnt said khalehla releasing manny but holding his shoulders ive met the legend and he turns out to be a terrific person she added smiling warmly dont spread such disinformation miss secret agent youll ruin my reputation now to business before i take you in to the others weingrass turned in the hallway and peered around the stone archway good the girls are on the veranda giving us a few minutes to ourselves that fellow from the cia filled us in said kendrick the one who came down to the airport to meet us oh you mean joe joe theyre all joe john jimyou notice no irvings or miltonsforget it payton told me you know about the hassans he knows interrupted khalehla absently reaching for evans hand and gripping it the gesture was not lost on manny and it obviously touched him it was horrible its all horrible my lovely child animals who kill their own kashi and sabri they spoke so lovingly of you adrienne khalehla rashad and i dont have to tell you what they thought of my son so we will mourn privately each to himself and herself remembering what they meant to us but that must be later not now manny broke in kendrick i have to make arrangements ive made them therell be a private islamic service and their remains will be flown back to dubai for burial in ash sharigah the coffins will be sealed of course mr weingrass that business should have come first if you call me mister i wont love you so much all right manny mj wasnt clear mjthats payton i know i know interrupted weingrass i told him that if he got the phone fixed we could be more cordial so i think he had somebody killed and now its working were emmanuel and mitchell now and he calls too much im sorry you had a question whats my cover here i feel like an idiot but i simply dont know the field agent in the car said i was official but official what who am i to these people mitchell suggested that you say youre a representative from the state department accompanying the congressman state maybe he wants to blame somebody if things dont work out i understand its a popular pastime in washington no he isnt like that oh i do see if i have to give instructions im in a position to do it wouldnt you have to show a state department id if someone asked for it said evan well yes you mean youve got one well sort of thats illegal we wear different hats at different times evan you also have a gun that paiute indian station chief in the bahamas told me he shouldnt have you wouldnt also happen to work for the mossad would you said weingrass grinning no but you doyou have and some of my closest friends do youre in good hands bubbelah more business mitchell wants evan to look at the merchandise herethe one in the bedroom and the bodies theyre under sheets in the garage and theyre leaving by air express during the night and the nurses have no idea theyre out there said kendrick his tone disbelieving your friend payton was adamantfanatic is more like it containment containment he kept saying over and over again how are you going to get them past that group of park rangers outside theyve rented a van from durango itll be left at the airport where someone will pick it up and drive it out here then itll be backed into the garage out of sight the whole operation supervised by paytons men they seem to know what theyre doing they do said khalehla softly has anyone spoken to the girls about what theyre to say or rather what they shouldnt say i did and for once they took me seriously but i dont know how long itll last theyre still shook up and they dont know a quarter of what happened ill get them together while you and evan make your grisly rounds and back you upvery officially mjs right ill play state department why asked evan just curious to keep the agency out of it we have no jurisdiction domestically and someone might just remember it and let her imagination run rampant simpler is better very pro said weingrass approvingly so how do i introduce you im simply a miss adrienne from the department of state do you mind lying let me think said manny frowning i once told a liei believe it was in july lets go grabbing evans arm and khalehlas hand weingrass ushered them through the stone arch into the living room shouting to the three nurses on the enclosed porch beyond herewith my coven of uglies is the true warlock pay homage to the man who pays for your sexual indulgences and your excessive cases of muscatel manny they love me said weingrass quietly while striding across the floor they throw dice for my bed for gods sake be quiet darling he is a marvel he broke his leg jumping out of the truck with us above the jabal sham said kendrick staring down at the unconscious young man strapped to the bed hes only a kid but your ids positive asked the cia officer standing beside emmanuel weingrass he was with you in oman theres no doubt about it none at all ill never forget him there was a fire in him youre not likely to find in many teenagers over here except maybe in the urban rot lets go out of the back door and into the garage thats yosef said evan closing his eyes his mother was a jewand for a few hours he was my friend he protected me oh christ stop it shouted manny he came here to kill you of course he did why not i pretended to be one of them in their goddamned holy cause they shaved his mothers head can you imagine that he shouted that at me when he tried to kill me said weingrass simply if it makes you feel better i didnt want to kill him i wanted to take anyone i could alive knowing yosef you didnt have a choice i didnt these other two interrupted the impatient cia officer lifting up the sheets do you recognize them yes they were both in the compound but i never knew their names the one on the right had soiled trousers the other long ragged hair and stared like he had some kind of messianic complexi reckoned he was psychotic thats all i can tell you youve already told us what we have to know all these men that youve identified were with you in oman yes i knew each one they wanted their revenge and if i were them im not sure id feel so differently youre not a terrorist congressman what separates a terrorist from a freedom fighter for starters sir terrorists make it a point to kill innocent people ordinary men and women who just happened to be there kids with backpacks employeesyoung and old alikesimply doing their jobs wheres your case sir kendrick studied the field agent suddenly jolted remembering fairfax and the hassans i apologize for a stupid and fatuous remark i regret it deeply what the hell said the cia man shrugging off his momentary anger were all stretched and too damned many labels are thrown around anyway they returned to the house where khalehla was speaking to the nurses on the porch whatever she was saying she had the rapt attention of the three women they sat motionless in their chairs their intelligent eyes riveted on the representative from the state department evan and manny walked in and crossed quietly to the bar while the cia officer went to the guest room to check on a colleague and the prisoner ive explained everything congressman kendrick said khalehla her voice official as far as im permitted to of course and these ladies have agreed to cooperate one had a visitor arriving tomorrow but shell call and tell him theres a medical emergency and not to come thanks a lot muttered weingrass pouring himself a drink under kendricks watchful gaze now im a corpse thank you manny remarked the nurse in question drily i want to thank all of you said evan quickly washingtons convinced this is an isolated incident a young lunatic on the loose so was sirhansirhan broke in the nurse who had driven into mesa verde to reach gonzalez and the description didnt change the results ive told them the prisoner is being transferred back east under cover tonight and not to be concerned if they hear noises in the grounds or the garage very pro mumbled weingrass i only have one question said the third nurse looking at khalehla you mentioned that the quarantine was temporary well not that im about to be invited to the grand prix in monte carlo but how long is temporary too many crowds during the grand prix interjected manny drinking you cant cross the streets and the bains de mer goes crazy no more than a few days answered kendrick again speaking quickly they just want to run the usual checks and if you get that invitation manny will personally accompany you congressman try daffy duck mishegoss there was a sudden startling commotion outside shouts were heard and a horn blared get away from the windows shouted the cia agent racing through the living room on the floor everyone on the floor evan lunged towards khalehla astonished to realize she had dropped between the rugs and was rolling over and over to the base of a sliding door an automatic in her hand its okay its okay yelled a voice from the front lawn thats one of us said the man from the central intelligence agency on his knees his weapon also in his hand what the hell he got to his feet and ran into the living room with kendrick following him the massive front door opened and a startled welldressed figure walked haltingly inside escorted by a park ranger he carried a black medicine bag it was open it had been searched i never expected such a reception said the doctor i know were not always welcome but this is a bit muchcongressman its such an honour they shook hands the cia agent watching bewildered im afraid we havent met have we asked evan equally confused no we havent but were neighbours if approximately seven more miles into the hills is a neighbour my names lyons im sorry about your reception youll have to blame it on an overprotective president what is it dr lyons why are you here because he wasnt there replied the intruder smiling gamely im mr weingrasss new doctor if youll check his schedule he was to be in my office in cortez at four oclock this afternoon he never arrived and we couldnt reach him on the telephone so as this house is on the way to mine i thought id drop in and see if there was a problem the physician stopped and reached into his pocket taking out an envelope incidentally in relation to those overprotective measures heres my clearance from the walter reed hospital countersigned by the proper officials in the administration i was to show this to mr weingrass and his nurses or at least the one who accompanied him to my office hes all right isnt he manny yelled kendrick irritably weingrass appeared in the veranda archway a drink in his hand why are you screaming at me werent you supposed to be at the doctors this afternoon oh yeah somebody called last week it was my receptionist mr weingrass explained dr lyons she said you wrote it down and agreed to be there yeah well i do that now and then but i feel fine so why trouble you also youre not my doctor mr weingrass your doctor passed away several weeks ago from a cardiac seizure it was in the papers and i know you received an announcement of the funeral yeah well i dont go to those either mines overdue nevertheless as long as im here why dont we have a look what are we looking for a little tubthumping and a short blood sample for the lab i feel fine im sure you are fine agreed lyons nodding its just routine and wont take more than a couple of minutes it really is an honour to meet you congressman thanks very much go on manny do you want one of the nurses to assist you doctor it doesnt really matter so she can wax lascivious over my naked chest protested weingrass interrupting come on doc you tap around my ribs and go out and buy yourself a cadillac at least a ferrari countered lyons smiling at kendrick emmanuel weingrass and his new doctor walked down the stone hallway towards the bedroom the icarus agenda chapter it was ten minutes past one in the morning and exhaustion hung like circles of dead heavy mist throughout the house in mesa verde the cia field agent his eyes dark with fatigue walked on to the enclosed porch where evan and khalehla sat on the leather couch diagonally across from manny in his reclining chair the three nurses had left each to her own room each having been dismissed from duty for the rest of the night the presence of armed guards patrolling the grounds outside had stretched their nerves their patient would survive sleep without being looked in on every halfhour dr lyons had guaranteed it washingtons anxious announced the weary intelligence officer the schedules been moved up so im going down to the airport for the van now the plane should be here in about an hour which means we dont have much time they want that bird to come in and get out the tower down there doesnt operate all night except by prearrangement said kendrick have you thought about that hours ago in time for your flight from the bahamas the air force flew over a team of controllers from colorado springs the covers an af training manoeuvre cleared through your office nobody objects and no one questions how come because youre you sir is there anything we can do here asked khalehla quickly before evan could make a comment yes there is answered the field agent if you wouldnt mind id rather not have anyone up when i get back weve got this thing worked out by the numbers and i mean fractions so the fewer distractions the better how are you going to handle those cowboys from the park outside said weingrass grimacing but obviously not from the question he asked i put my head out the door a couple of times before these two got here and they rushed up to me like i was a runaway bear theyve been told a foreign vip is arriving to see the congressmanin fact thats the reason theyre here and since the meeting is highly confidential and in deference to the visitor who wants to keep it that way all patrols will remain out of sight theyll be on the sides of the house and down at the gazebo they bought that nonsense interjected weingrass they have no reason to question it because hes him agreed manny nodding and because theyre being paid three hundred dollars apiece for losing a nights sleep very pro mr containment youre better than i thought i have to be well if i dont see you again its been a real pleasure meeting you congressman some day ill be able to tell my kids about it no please dont get up sir ive got to run you too miss official as mr weingrass would say and you manny i tell you its been an experience i think im glad youre on our side you should be you need all the help you can get ciao young man have a good trackdown and if the odds are only five to one against you youll win thanks manny i intend to the intelligence officer turned briefly to evan and khalehla on the couch i mean that he added quietly i heard the reference to fairfax in the car and let it pass but it wasnt easy you see im the only one here who knows what happened its why i insisted on leading this team my older sisters son my nephewi brought him into the agencyhe was part of that unit i intend to have a damned good trackdown the cia man left quickly for starters sir terrorists make it a point to kill innocent people ordinary men and women who just happened to be there kids with backpacks and employeesyoung and old alikesimply doing their jobs wheres your case sir how terrible for him said khalehla he must feel such hurt such guilt which of us doesnt asked kendrick his voice floating then stopped abruptly with a sudden forced intake of air you cant blame yourself for whats happened insisted khalehla happening exclaimed kendrick its happening how the hell did these people get into the country who let them in where are our socalled brilliant security measures that can catch fifthrate soviet agents we exchange for setup reporters in moscow because its good pr but cant stop a dozen killers who come in to kill who makes it possible were trying to find out youre a little late arent you stop it ordered weingrass leaning forward punching the space in front of him with his forefinger this girl has nothing to do with what youre talking about and i wont have it i know that said kendrick reaching for khalehlas hand and she knows i know it its just that everythings so insanei feel so helpless so frightened goddamn it how many others have to be killed we cant stop these people theyre maniacs and theyre running loose and well never find them evan lowered his voice his eyes filled with pain levelled at the field agent from cairo any more than weve found the bastards who stole that theftproof oman file and splattered me all over the world how long has it beeneight ten weeks were no closer than when we began at least now we know why they did it it wasnt to make me a hero or to promote my socalled career as a political contender for christ knows what it was to set me up for the kill a vengeance death i believe is the literal arabic translation the point is were not getting anywhere listen to me said khalehla softly im going to say something i probably shouldnt but sometimes we break a rule because hope is important too other things have happened that you dont know aboutare happening as you sayand each new piece of information brings us a step closer to the truth about this whole horrible mess thats pretty cryptic young lady manny try to understand evan does because we have an agreement he knows that there are times when i cant explain things may an old man whos been a resident in your territory once or twice before ask why if you mean your work with the mossad you shouldnt have toforgive my being blunt the basis is an imperative needtoknow because what you dont know you cant reveal the amytals and the pentothals asked weingrass in the old days scopolamine come on my lovely girl were not in the back streets of marrakesh or the partisan mountains of ashot yaaqov who would use chemicals on us here im sure that young prisoner evan identified the one whos on his way to a clinic in virginia probably felt the same way within twentyfour hours his entire life will be on tape not applicable insisted weingrass perhaps not but something else is six hours ago we got a tracea possible tracethat may take us higher up in this government than any of us wishes if were wrong congressman kendrick of colorado cant be a part of it quite simply he cant know anything he has total deniability as a result neither can you manny that radio transmission on the plane said evan looking hard at khalehla there was no station chief in cairo was there khalehla shrugged releasing his hand and reaching for her drink on the coffee table in front of the couch all right no specifics continued kendrick but lets talk about the truthforget deniability which i dont give a damn about what kind of truth are you after give me an overviewive heard that word ad nauseam in washington what kind of people are doing what to whom whoever they are theyve killed my friendsour friends i have a right to know yes you do said khalehla slowly sitting rigid on the couch looking alternately at evan and emmanuel weingrass finally settling on kendrick you said it yourself questioned it yourselfpart of the truth anyway someone did let these killers in and made it possible for them to kill passports were provided without restrictions and as i can easily picture their general appearances because im one of them those false papers had to be terribly good to get past the antiterrorist experts we and our allies have at every immigration point here and abroad including the soviet union i might add beyond those papers are the logistics the lines of supply without which terrorists cant operate weapons ammunition money drivers licences and hired vehicles locations where they can hide and prepare themselves even down to the most uptodate clothing made in this country in case theyre arrested and interrogated then there are such items as train and air reservations all made in advance the tickets delivered before they walk into a terminal except when its on a platform or in a flight lounge at the last minute you see nothing is inconsequential to these people everything is vital down to the last detail for the success of any given mission khalehla paused shifting her gaze between both men someones made all of these things available to them and whoever it is or whoever they are they shouldnt be where they are in this government or have the accesses they have its more important than i can ever explain that they be found you said that about those who stole the oman file and you believe theyre the same people arent they its pretty obvious to me not to me the setup its the explanation for a revenge kill me suppose theyre separate insisted khalehla one giving birth to the other its been ten weeks remember the impetus for killing you in the heat of vengeance which is intrinsic to jaremat thaár has passed you just pointed out all the details that had to be put in place that takes time if they have the resources to do what theyve done in ten weeks they could do it in ten days evan emmanuel weingrass held up his hand palm forward it was a command for quiet and he expected to be obeyed you are now telling us that instead of one enemy my son has two the arabs from the baaka valley and someone else over here who works with them or against them are you making sense my lovely child two forces both elusive one a deadly enemy certainly the other i just dont know i only know what i sense and im not being evasive when mj doesnt have the answers he keeps blaming it on what he calls gaps i guess thats what im falling back on there are too many gaps weingrass grimaced again a silent belch filling his gaunt cheeks i accept your perceptions he said if mitchell ever throws you out ill find you reasonable employment with the mossad avoiding a certain accountant who would let you starve the old architect suddenly breathed deeply and leaned back in his chair manny what is it said khalehla her question causing kendrick to turn his head alarmed are you all right asked evan im ready for the olympics replied weingrass except that one minute im cold the next minute im hot it was all that running around in the woods like a kid lyons told me my systolic was a little high or maybe it was the other one and that i had a few bruises where i shouldnt have i told him id been bullfighting ive got to rest these bones children the old man got out of his chair would you believe khalehla that im not a kid i think youre not only very young but also remarkable extraordinary is more appropriate actually offered manny but right now i feel the effects of my virtuosity im going to bed ill get one of the nurses said kendrick starting to rise for what so she can take advantage of me ravage me i want rest boy andlet them rest evan theyve been through a lot and they dont even know what theyve been through im fine just tired try running in the olympics when youre sixty sixty shut up son i can still give you a run for your money for that lovely girl could it have been something the doctor gave you asked khalehla smiling warmly at the compliment so what did he give nothing he just took a little blood for his mishegoss laboratory and offered me some pills which i told him id throw down the toilet they were probably samples he got for nothing and then charges enough for a new wing on his fancy house ciao young things the two of them watched as the old man walked through the archway into the living room each step firmly planted ahead of the other as if he were summoning strength he did not feel do you think hes okay asked evan when weingrass was out of sight i think hes exhausted said khalehla you try doing what he did tonightforget sixty or eightytry tomorrow ill look in on him every now and then well take turns that way well both feel better without waking the nurses which is another way of saying theyll stay put and away from the windows i guess it is admitted rashad but wed still feel better even if its on both counts do you want another drink no thanks i do kendrick got up from the couch i havent finished what evan turned as khalehla rose and stood in front of him i dont want a drink but i do want you in silence kendrick looked down at her his eyes roving over her face finally settling staring into her eyes is this pity be merciful to the confused man in pain youll get no pity from me i told you that i respect you too much i told you that too as for the poor confused man in pain whos pitying whom i didnt mean it that way i know you didnt im just not sure how you meant it i told you before im not looking for any fast action not with you if its all i can have ill take it but its not what im looking for you talk too goddamned much evan you evade too much you told manny that you werent evasive but you are for at least six weeks ive tried to get near you tried to get you to talk about us tried to break down that glass wall youve erected but no dice says the bright lady because im scared damn you of what of both of us now youre the one whos talking too much well you certainly didnt talk last night you think i didnt hear you pacing up and down like an ape in a cage outside my door why didnt you open it why didnt you break it down they both laughed quietly their arms encircling each other do you want a drink no i want you there was not the frenzy of bahrain there was urgency of course but it was the urgency of lovers not of two desperate strangers grasping for release in a world gone crazy their world was not sane they were all too aware of that yet they had found a semblance of order between themselves each for the other and the discovery was splendid and warm and suddenly filled with promise where before there was only a void filled with uncertainty each for the other it was as if both were insatiable climax was followed by quiet talk and one or the other looked in on emmanuel weingrass then more talk bodies together rushing once again for the fulfilment both craved neither could stop holding the other pulling weaving rolling until the sweet juices were exhausted and still they could not let each other go until sleep came the earliest morning sun broke open the colorado day drained but strangely at peace within the warm temporary cave they had found for themselves evan reached for khalehla she was not there he opened his eyes she was not there he elbowed himself up on the pillow her clothes were draped on a chair and he breathed again he saw that the doors to both his bathroom and the clothes cupboard were open and then he remembered and laughed quietly ruefully to himself the hero of oman and the experienced intelligence agent from cairo had gone to the bahamas with one carryon bag apiece and in the rush of events had promptly left both either in a nassau police car or on an air force f neither had noticed until after their first stampeded race for the bed after which khalehla had stated dreamingly i bought an outrageous nightgown for this tripmore in hope than in realistic expectationbut i think ill put it on then both had looked at each other mouths gaped eyes widened oh my god she cried where the hell did we leave it i mean them the two of them did you have anything incriminating in yours only the nightieit wasnt right for rebecca of sunnybrook farm oh good lord a couple of real pros we are i never claimed to be one did you have dirty socks and a sex manualmore in hope than in realistic expectation they had fallen back into each others arms the humour of the situation telling them something else about themselves youd wear that nightgown for roughly five seconds before i tore it off and then youd have to charge the government for the loss of personal property i just saved the taxpayers at least six dollars come here one of them had checked on manny neither could remember which kendrick got out of bed and went to his closet he owned two bathrobes one was missing so he went into his bathroom to make himself feel and look reasonably presentable after a shower and a shave he applied too much cologne but then he reflected it had not hurt him nearly twenty years ago in college with an emptyheaded cheerleader had it been that long ago since impressions mattered to him he put on his second bathrobe walked out of the room and down the stone hallway to the arch khalehla was sitting at the heavy pine table with the black leather top in the living room talking quietly into the telephone she saw him and smiled briefly concentrating on the person at the other end of the line its all clear she said as evan approached ill be in touch goodbye khalehla got up from the table the outsized bathrobe draped strikingly revealingly around her body she pulled the folds of fabric together and came to him suddenly reaching out and placing her hands on his shoulders kiss me kendrick she ordered gently arent i supposed to say that they kissed until khalehla understood that in another moment they would be heading back to the bedroom okay okay kong ive got things to tell you kong i wanted you to break down a door remember good heavens you forget things i may be incompetent but i hope not inadequate youre probably right about the first but youre definitely not inadequate my darling do you know how much i love to hear you say that what my darling its an expression evan at this moment i think id kill if i thought you used it with anyone but me please have you do you youre asking me if i just like to sleep around occasionally arent you said khalehla calmly removing her arms from him thats pretty rough no of course not since were talking and ive been doing a lot of thinking lets tackle this ive had attachments as youve had and ive called several darling even dearest i suppose but if you want to know the truth you insufferable egotist ive never called anyone my darling does that answer your question you rat itll do said evan grinning and reaching for her no please evan talking is safer i thought you just gave me an order to kiss you what changed you had to talk and i had to start thinking again and i dont think im ready for you why not because im a professional and i have work to do and if im screwed up with youfiguratively and literallyi cant do it again why not because you idiot im very close to being in love with you thats all im asking for because i do love you oh those words are so easy so facile but not in my business not in the world i live in the word comes down have soandso killed or let him be killedwhichever it is it solves a multitude of problems and what happens if it turns out to be you my darling could you do it if you were me could it really ever come down to that it has it might its called thirdparty omission as in what do i knowbut they know what ill permit you see youre one human beingterrific or despicable depending on the point of viewand by giving you away we might save two hundred or four hundred people on a plane because they couldnt get you unless we gave you away before a flight oh my little world is filled with benignly neglected morality because all we deal with is malignant immorality why stay in it why not get out khalehla paused looking at him her eyes unwavering because we save lives she answered finally and every now and then something happens that reduces the malignancy showing it for what it is and peace is just a little closer more often than not weve been a part of that process youve got to have a life beyond that a life of your own oh i will one day because one day i wont be useful any more at least not where i want to be ill be a known commodityfirst youre suspected then youre exposed and then youre useless and thats when youd better get out of town my superiors will try to persuade me i can be valuable in other posts theyll dangle the bait of a pension in front of me and a nice choice of sectors but i dont think ill bite according to that scenario what will you do good lord i speak six languages fluently and read and write four coupled with my background id say my qualifications are ample for any number of jobs that sounds reasonable except for one thing theres a missing ingredient what are you talking about me thats what im talking about oh come on evan no said kendrick shaking his head no more oh come on or please evan i wont settle for that i know what i feel and i think i know what you feel and to disregard those feelings is both stupid and a waste i told you im not ready i never thought id ever be ready interrupted kendrick his voice soft and flat you see ive done some thinking too and ive been pretty harsh on myself ive been selfish most of my life ive always loved the freedom i have to go and do what ive wanted to dobadly or well it didnt make much difference so long as i could do it selfsufficient i guess is the termself self self then you come along and blow the whole damn thing to pieces you show me what i dont have and by showing me you make me feel like an idiot i have no one

easier very nice came the sonorous voice from the stone archway manny cried khalehla releasing evan pushing him away and looking over his shoulder how long have you been there asked kendrick harshly snapping his head around i came in on the begging and grovelling replied weingrass in a scarlet bathrobe it always works boy the strongmanonhisknees bit never fails youre impossible shouted evan hes adorable im both but keep your voices down youll wake up the coven what the hell are you doing out here at this hour this hour is eight oclock in washington said khalehla how are you feeling ahnnh answered the old man flicking the palm of his right hand as he walked into the living room i slept but i didnt sleep you know what i mean and you clowns didnt help opening the door every five minutes you also know what i mean it was hardly every five minutes said khalehla youve got your wristwatch ive got mineso what did my friend mitchell say thats the eight oclock in washington if im not mistaken youre not agreed the intelligence officer from cairo i was about to explain some explanation the violins were in full vibrato manny shut up let her talk i have to leavefor a day perhaps two where are you going asked kendrick i cant tell you that my darling the icarus agenda chapter welcome to stapleton airport in denver ladies and gentlemen if you need information regarding connecting flights our personnel will gladly assist you inside the terminal the time here in colorado is five minutes past three in the afternoon among the disembarking passengers spilling out of the exit ramp were five priests whose features were caucasian but whose skin was darker than that of most white occidentals they moved together and talked quietly among themselves their english stilted yet understandable they might have been from a diocese in southern greece or from the aegean islands or possibly sicily or egypt they might have been but they were not they were palestinians and they were not priests instead they were killers from the most radical branch of the islamic jihad each held a small carryon bag of soft black cloth together they walked into the terminal making for a newsstand la exclaimed one of the younger arabs under his breath as he picked up a newspaper and scanned the headlines laish iskut whispered an older companion pulling the young man away and telling him to be quiet if you speak speak english there is nothing they still report nothing something is wrong we know something is wrong you fool said the leader known throughout the terrorist world as ahbyahd the name meaning the whitehairedone despite the fact that his closecropped prematurely grey head was more saltandpepper than white thats why were here carry my bag and take the others to gate number twelve ill meet you there shortly remember if anyone stops you you do the talking explain that the others do not speak english but dont elaborate i shall give them a christian blessing with the blood of allah all over their throats keep your tongue and your knife to yourself no more washingtons ahbyahd continued across the terminal glancing around as he walked he saw what he had to find and approached an inquiry desk a middleaged woman looked up at him smiling pleasantly at his obviously bewildered expression may i help you father i believe this is where i was instructed to be replied the terrorist humbly we have no such fine arrangements on the island of lyndos we try to be of service perhaps you have a a notice for mefurther instructions im afraid the name is demopolis oh yes said the woman opening the top righthand drawer of the desk father demopolis youre certainly a long way from home the franciscan retreat an opportunity of a lifetime to visit your splendid country here we are the woman pulled out a white envelope and handed it to the arab it was delivered to us around noon by a charming man who made a most generous contribution to our charity box perhaps i may add my gratitude said ahbyahd feeling the small hard flat object in the centre of the envelope as he reached for his wallet oh no i wouldnt hear of it weve been paid handsomely for such a little thing as holding a letter for a man of the cloth you are very kind madam may the lord of hosts bless you thank you father i appreciate that ahbyahd walked away quickening his steps veering to a crowded corner of the airport terminal he tore open the envelope taped to the blank card inside was a key to a storage locker in cortez colorado their weapons and explosives had been delivered on schedule as well as money articles of clothing an untraceable hired car alternative passports of israeli origin for nine maronite priests and airline tickets to riohacha colombia where arrangements had been made to fly them to baracoa cuba and points east their rendezvous for the trip homehome yet not home not the baaka that was not homewas a motel near the airport in cortez a flight the next morning would take them to los angeles where nine holy men would be assistance precleared on avianca for riohacha everything had gone according to scheduleschedules worked out once the amazing offer had reached the baaka valley in lebanon find him kill him bring honour to your cause well give you everything you need but never our identities yet had those so precise schedules those so precious gifts borne fruit ahbyahd did not know he could not know and it was why he had called a relay telephone number in vancouver canada demanding that new and lethal supplies be added to the cortez delivery it had been nearly twentyfour hours since the attack on the house in fairfax virginia and close to eighteen hours after the storming of the hated enemys home in colorado their mission had been conceived as a combined assault that would stun the western world with blood and death avenging the brothers who had been killed proving that the ultimate security ordered by the president of the united states for a single man was no match for the skills and the commitments of a dispossessed people operation azra demanded the life of an ordained american hero an impostor who had claimed to be one of them who had broken bread and sorrow with them and who finally had betrayed them that man had to die along with all who surrounded him protected him a lesson had to be taught that most loathsome of enemies had not been found in fairfax it was presumed that yosefs unit would find him and kill him at his house in the western mountains yet there was nothing nothing the five of them from command one had waited in their adjoining hotel roomswaiting waiting for the telephone to ring and to hear the words spoken operation azra is now complete the hated pig is dead nothing and most strange of all there were no screaming headlines in the newspapers no shocked anguished men or women on television revealing yet another triumph for the holy cause what had happened ahbyahd had gone over every step of the mission and could fault none every conceivable problem but one had been anticipated and solutions found in advance either through the byways of official corruption in washington or with sophisticated technology and bribed or blackmailed telephone technicians in virginia and colorado the one unforeseen and unforeseeable problem was a suddenly suspicious aide to the despicable politician who quite simply had to be killed quickly ahbyahd had sent the one priest of their small brigade who had not been in oman to kendricks office late on wednesday afternoon before the attack on fairfax the purpose was merely to crosscheck the latest intelligence that confirmed the american congressmans presence in the capital the priests cover was immaculate his papersreligious and officialwere in order and he brought with him greetings from numerous old friends each of them a living person from kendricks past the priest had been caught reading a secretarys desk diary while waiting for the aide to come out into the deserted office the aide had promptly gone back inside their priest had quietly opened the door and heard the young man on the telephone asking for congressional security he had to die quickly efficiently taken under a gun to the bowels of the massive capitol building and dispatched swiftly yet even that death had not been made public what had happened what was happening the martyrs of the holy mission would not could not return to the baaka valley without the trophy of vengeance they so desperately sought and so richly deserved it was unthinkable if there was no rendezvous in cortez blood would flow over blood at a place called mesa verde the terrorist put the key in his pocket threw the blank card and the envelope on the terminal floor and started towards gate twelve sweetie shouted ardis vanvlanderen walking into the living room from the office she had made for herself from a guest room in san diegos westlake hotel what is it babe asked her husband sitting in a velour armchair in front of a television set your problems are over those zillions of millions are safe for the next five years keep building your missiles and superduper sonics until the cows shit uranium i mean it lover your worries are over i know that babe said andrew vanvlanderen without moving his eyes fixed on the screen ill see it and hear it any time now what are you talking about she stopped and stood motionless staring down at her husband theyve got to release it soon they cant keep it quiet much longer jesus its been damn near twentyfour hours i have no idea what that muddled mind of yours is conjuring but i can tell you that emmanuel weingrass is on his way out there was a certain doctor for hire hes been injected hes out now sos kendrick what i couldnt wait for you lovernone of us could there were better ways more logical waysexpected ways what the hell have you done given an aggrieved people the opportunity to avenge themselves on someone who screwed them to hell and back i found the survivors i knew where to look andyboy said ardis sitting down opposite her husband her large green eyes fixed on his distracted face i repeat she added quietly what have you done removed an obstacle that would have weakened the military strength of this country to an unacceptable degreeturning the most powerful giant of the free world into a pitiful dwarf and in doing so cost me personally in the neighbourhood of eight hundred million dollarsand cost our group billions oh my god you couldnt waityou couldnt wait you dealt with the arabs mr president i need these few days pleaded mitchell payton sitting forward on a straightbacked chair in the upstairs living quarters of the white house it was one fiftyfive in the morning langford jennings sat in the corner of the couch dressed in pyjamas and a bathrobe his legs crossed a slipper dangling from one foot his steady questioning gaze never leaving the cia directors face i realize that by coming directly to you ive broken several hundred valid restrictions but im as alarmed as ive ever been in my professional life years ago a young man said to his commander in chief that there was a cancer growing on the presidency this is a far older man saying essentially the same thing except that in this case any knowledge of the diseaseif it exists as i believe it doeshas been kept from you youre here dr payton said jennings his resonant voice flat the fear unmistakable yes dr paytonive had to learn a few things quicklybecause sam winters made it clear to me that if you said you were alarmed most other men would be in shock from what youve told me i understand what he means im in shock im grateful for an old acquaintances intercession i knew hed remember me i wasnt sure hed take me seriously he took you seriously youre sure youve told me everything the whole rotten mess everything i know sir everything weve pieced together admitting of course that i have no smoking gun thats not the most favourite phrase around these premises in all candour mr president if i thought those words had any application whatsoever to these premises i wouldnt be here i appreciate your honesty jennings lowered his head and blinked then raised it frowning and spoke pensively youre right theres no application but why are you so sure my opponents ascribe all manner of deceits to me arent you infected because looking at you and knowing what i know about you i cant imagine that youre an ardent supporter of mine i dont have to agree with everything a man believes to think decently of him which means im okay but you wouldnt vote for me right again may i speak in candour sir the secret ballot is sacred after all in all candour sir said the president a slow smile creasing his lips no i wouldnt vote for you answered payton returning the smile iq problems good god no history shows us that an overinvolved mind in the oval office can be consumed by an infinity of details above a certain level an immensity of intellect is irrelevant and frequently dangerous a man whose head is bursting with facts and opposing facts theories and counter theories has a tendency to endlessly debate with himself beyond the point where decisions are demanded no sir i have no problem with your iq which is far more than sufficient unto the day is it my philosophy then candour candour you see i have to know right now whether im going to vote for you and it hasnt a damn thing to do with quid pro quo i think i understand that said payton nodding all right i suppose your rhetoric does bother me at times it strikes me that you reduce some very complicated issues to to simplistics offered jennings quietly todays world is as complicated and tumultuous as the act of creation itself however it came about replied payton wrong moves by only a few and were back where we started a lifeless ball of fire racing through the galaxy there are no easy answers any longer mr president you asked for candour i sure as hell got it jennings laughed softly as he uncrossed his legs and sat forward his elbows on his knees but let me tell you something doctor you try expounding on those complicated tumultuous problems during an election campaign youll never be in a position to look for the complex solutions you end up bellyaching from the stands but youre not part of the teamyoure not even in the game id like to believe otherwise sir so would i but i cant ive seen too many brilliant erudite men go down because they described the world as they knew it to be to electorates who didnt want to hear it i would suggest they were the wrong men mr president erudition and political appeal arent mutually exclusive some day a new breed of politician will face a different electorate one that will accept the realities those harsh descriptions you mentioned bravo said jennings quietly as he leaned back on the couch youve just described the reason for my being who i amwhy i do what i do what ive done all governing dr payton since the first tribal councils worked out languages over fires in their caves has been a process of transition even the marxists agree with that theres no utopia in the back of his mind thomas more knew that because nothing is as it waslast week last year last century its why he used the word utopiaa place that doesnt exist im right for my time my moment in the change of things and i hope to christ its the change you envisage if im the bridge that brings us alive to that crossing ill go to my grave a damned happy man and my critics can go to hell silence the once and former professor mitchell jarvis payton observed the most powerful man in the world his eyes betraying mild astonishment thats an extremely scholarly statement he said dont let the word get out my mandate would disappear and i need those critics forget it you pass mj im voting for you mj i told you i had to do some fast gathering and faster reading why do i pass mr president its a personal as well as a professional question if i may ask it because you didnt flinch i beg your pardon you havent been talking to lang jennings a farmer from iowa whose family made a few bucks because his daddy happened to buy fortyeight thousand acres in the mountains that developers sold their souls for youve been talking to the head boy of the western world the man who could take this planet right back to that ball of fire if i were you id be frightened confronting that fellow frightened and cautious im trying not to be both and i didnt even know about the fortyeight thousand acres you think a relatively poor man could ever be president probably not probably never power is to the rich or the damnnear broke who havent a thing to lose and a lot of clout and exposure to gain all the same dr payton you come here through a back door making an outrageous request asking me to sanction the covert domestic activities of an agency prohibited by law from operating domestically further and in the process you want me to permit you to suppress extraordinary information involving a national tragedy a terrorist massacre meant to kill a man the country owes a great deal to in essence youre asking me to violate any number of rules vital and intrinsic to my oath of office am i right so far ive given you my reasons mr president theres a web of circumstances that spreads from oman to california and its so clear that it has to be more than coincidence these fanatics these terrorists kill for one purpose that overrides all other motivation they want to focus attention on themselves they demand headlines to the point of suicide our only hope of catching them and the people here behind them is to withhold those headlines by sowing confusion and frustration someone may make a mistake in the heat of anger contact someone else they shouldnt contact breaking the chain of secrecy and there has to be a chain sir those killers got in here which took powerful connections to begin with theyre moving around from one end of the country to the other with weapons thats no simple feat considering our security procedures i have a field agent from cairo going to san diego and the best man we have in beirut heading for the baaka valley they both know what to look for jesus cried jennings leaping up from the couch and pacing the slipper falling off his foot i cant believe orson is any part of this hes not my favourite bedfellow but hes not insanehes also not suicidal he may not be a part of it sir power even a vice presidents power attracts the wouldbe powerfulor the wouldbe more powerful goddamn it shouted the president walking over to a queen anne desk on which there were scattered papers no wait a minute said jennings turning in your own words you have this web of circumstances that somehow extends from the oman crisis all the way across the world to san diego you say it has to be more than coincidence but thats all youve got you dont have that welladvertised smoking gun just a couple of people who knew each other years ago in the middle east and one who suddenly shows up where you dont expect her the woman in question has a history of borderline financial manipulations for very high stakes she would hardly be enticed by an obscure political position thats light years away from her normal compensation unless there were other considerations andyboy said the president as if to himself gladhanded andy i never knew that about ardis of course i thought she was a bank executive or something he met in england why would vanvlanderen want her to work for orson in the first place in my judgment sir its all part of the web the chain payton stood up i need your answer mr president mr president repeated jennings shaking his head as if he could not quite accept the title i wonder if that word sticks in your throat i beg your pardon you know what i mean doctor you arrive here at one oclock in the morning with this paranoid scenario asking me to commit impeachable offences then when i ask you a few questions you proceed to tell me a you wouldnt vote for me b im simplistic c at best im a predecessor of better men d i cant differentiate between coincidence and valid circumstantial evidence i never said that mr president you implied it you asked for candour sir if i thought oh come on get off it said jennings turning towards the antique desk with the papers strewn across the top are you aware that theres not a single person in the entire white house staff of over a thousand who would say those things to me that doesnt include my wife and daughter but then theyre not official staff and theyre both tougher than you are incidentally if i offended you i apologize dont please i told you that you passed and i wouldnt want to rescind i also wouldnt permit anyone but someone like you to ask me to do what youve asked me to do quite simply i wouldnt trust them youve got a green light doctor go wherever the hell the train takes you just keep me informed ill give you a sacrosanct number that only my family has i need a presidential finding of nondisclosure ive prepared one to cover your ass certainly not sir ill countersign it assuming full responsibility for the request then why to protect those below me who are involved but have no idea why payton reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a folded page of paper this makes it clear that your staff has not been consulted thanks a bunch so we both hang no mr president only myself nondisclosure is built into the statutes of the act of congress institutionalizing the cia it permits extraordinary action on the part of the agency in times of national crisis any such finding would have to have a time limit it does sir its for a period of five days ill sign it said jennings taking the paper and reaching for another on the queen anne desk and while i do i want you to read thisactually you dont have to like most computerized printouts from the press office it takes too long it came to me this afternoon what is it its an analysis of a campaign to push congressman evan kendrick on to the partys ticket next june the president paused as the vice presidential candidate he added softly may i see that please asked payton stepping forward his hand outstretched i thought you might want to said jennings handing the elongated page to the director of special projects i wondered if youd take it as seriously as sam winters took you i do sir answered payton now rapidly carefully scanning the eyeirritating computer print if theres any substance to that paranoia of yours you may find a basis there said the president watching his unexpected visitor closely my press people say it could fly fly fast and high as of next week seven respectable newspapers in the midwest will do more than raise kendricks name theyll damn near editorially endorse him three of those papers own radio and television stations in concentrated areas north and south and speaking of coincidences audio and visual tapes of the congressmans television appearances were supplied to all of them by whom i cant find it here you wont theres only a halfassed ad hoc committee in denver no ones ever heard of and they dont know anything everythings fed to chicago its incredible not really disagreed jennings the congressman could prove to be an attractive candidate theres a quiet electricity about him he projects confidence and strength he could catch onfast and high as my people say orson bollingers crowd which i suppose is my crowd could be having a collective case of the trots thats not the incredibility im talking about mr president when im presented with such an obvious connection even i have to back off its too simple too obvious i cant believe bollingers crowd could be that stupid its too incriminating entirely too dangerous youre losing me doctor i thought youd say something like aha my dear watson heres the proof but youre not are you no sir if im going to sign this goddamned impeachable piece of paper i think im entitled to know why because it really is too obvious bollingers people learn that evan kendrick is about to be launched in a nationwide campaign to replace their vice president so they hire palestinian terrorists to kill him only a maniac could invent that scenario one flaw among a hundredodd arrangements one killer taken alivewhich we have and they could be traced will be traced if youll sign that paper who will you find then what will you find i dont know sir we may have to start with that committee in denver for months kendrick has been manoeuvred into a political limelight he never soughthas run from actually now on the eve of the real push theres the obscenity of fairfax and the aborted assault on mesa verde aborted by an old man who apparently doesnt let his age interfere with his actions he killed three terrorists i want to meet him by the way interrupted jennings ill arrange it but you may regret it whats your point there are two factions two camps and neither is unsophisticated yet on the surface one may have committed an extraordinary blunder which doesnt make sense youre losing me again im lost myself mr president will you sign that paper will you give me five days i will dr payton but why do i have the feeling that im about to face a guillotine wrong projection sir the public would never allow your head to be chopped off the public can be terribly wrong said the president of the united states bending over the queen anne desk and signing the document thats also part of history professor the streetlamps along chicagos lake shore drive flickered in the falling snow creating tiny bursts of light on the ceiling of the room at the drake hotel it was shortly past two in the morning and the muscular blond man was asleep in the bed his breathing deep and steady as if his selfcontrol never left him suddenly his breathing stopped as the sharp harsh bell of the telephone erupted he bolted up to a sitting position swinging his legs out from under the loose covers to the floor and yanked the phone out of its cradle yes said milos varak no sleep in his voice we have a problem said samuel winters from his study in cynwid hollow maryland can you discuss it sir i dont see why not at least briefly and with abbreviation this line is clean and i cant imagine anyone plugging into yours abbreviations please roughly seven hours ago something horrible happened at a house in the virginia suburbs a storm broke in the czech if i understand you yes a terrible storm with enormous loss icarus varak nearly shouted he wasnt there nor was he in the mountains where a similar attempt was made but thwarted emmanuel weingrass whispered the czech under his breath he was the target i knew it would happen it wouldnt appear so but why do you say that later sir i drove down from evanston around twelvethirty i knew you were out i started calling you hours ago but didnt leave word of course is everything on schedule ahead of it but thats not what i mean there was nothing on the radio about either event and thats astonishing isnt it if things go as i expect answered winters therell be nothing for at least several days if then thats even more astonishing how do you know that sir because i believe ive arranged it a man i trust has gone privately to sixteen hundred through my intervention hes there now if theres any hope of catching those responsible he needs the blackout with enormous relief milos varak instantly understood that samuel winters was not the traitor within inver brass whoever the informer was would never prolong the hunt for killers if they were sent out by san diego beyond that truth that relief the czech coordinator had someone to confide in sir please listen to me carefully its imperativei repeat imperativethat you call a meeting tomorrow as early as possible it must be during the day sir not at night every hour will count in each of the time zones thats a startling request call it an emergency it is an emergency sir and somehow some way i must find another emergency i must force someone to make a move without specifics can you give me a reason yes the one thing we never thought could happen within the group has happened theres someone who shouldnt be there good god youre certain im certain seconds ago i eliminated you as a possibility it was in the morning california time in the eastern united states andrew vanvlanderen sat in his overstuffed velour chair his eyes glazed his heavy body weaving his white wavy hair dishevelled in a burst of frenzy he suddenly threw a thickbased glass of whisky across the space into the television set it glanced off the mahogany cabinet and dropped ineffectually on the white rug in fury he picked up a marble ashtray and heaved it into the screen of the twentyfourhour all news programme the convex glass picture shattered and the set imploded with a loud sharp report as black smoke rushed out of the electronic entrails vanvlanderen roared incoherently at nothing and everything his quivering lips trying to form words he could not find in seconds his wife ran out of the bedroom what are you doing she screamed theresaughnothing not a goddamned thing he shrieked his speech garbled his neck and face flushed the veins in his throat and forehead distended not a fucking thing whats happened whats going on they cant do this i paid them a straight two million and then without warning or the slightest indication of anything other than being in the grip of rage vanvlanderen lurched out of the chair his arms trembling his hands shaking violently pressing a wall of air he could not see through his bulging eyes and fell forward on the floor as his face crashed into the rug a furious guttural cry was the last sound from his throat his fourth wife ardis wojak montreaux frazierpyke vanvlanderen took several steps forward her face white her uplifted skin stretched to the parchment of a mask her large eyes staring down at her dead husband you son of a bitch she whispered how could you leave me with this mess whatever it is whatever the hell youve done the icarus agenda chapter ahbyahd called his four priests together in the motel room he shared with the young member of the mission who spoke fluent english and who had never been in oman it was am colorado time and the long vigil was over there would be no rendezvous command two had not made contact which meant that yosef and his men were dead there was no other explanation the hardened veteran who was half jew but with a consummate hatred of all things western and israeli would never permit a single member of his team to be taken alive it was why he had insisted that the crippled harelipped boy who would not be denied should be at his side at all times at the first sign of even conceivable capture i will put a bullet in your head child do you understand i will do it first old man i seek my glorious death far more than my miserable life i believe you you young fool but please remember the words of azra alive you can fight dead you cannot the martyred azra was right thought ahbyahd however azra had not defined the ultimate sacrifice sought by all who truly believed it was to die while fighting that was why the jihad was impervious to traps even to death and the thunderous silence that resulted from the attack on the house in virginia and the absence of yosef and his men could only be a trap it was the western way of thinking deny the accomplishment acknowledge nothing force the hunters to search farther and lead them into a trap it was so meaningless if the trap meant killing the enemy in this instance the possibility of killing a great enemy what did death matter in their martyrdom they would find an exhilaration of happiness unknown in the life they led here on earth there was no greater glory for the believer than to walk into the gentle clouds of allahs heaven with the blood of enemies on ones hands in a just war it was this reasoning that confused ahbyahd did not the christians incessantly talk about walking into the arms of christ for the causes of christ calling for wars in his name did not the jews exalt their chosen status under abrahams god to the exclusion of all others fighting for deliverance as the maccabees did dying for their beliefs atop the masada was allah to be deemed unworthy in this company who decreed it the christians and the jews ahbyahd was no scholar barely a student of such difficult subjects if the truth be known but these were things taught by the elders men steeped in the holy koran the lessons were clear their enemies were quick to invent and fight for their own grievances but quicker still to deny the pain of others the christians and the jews were very free in calling upon their almighties in any conflict that threatened them and they would certainly continue to deny the just cause of the lowly palestinian but they could not deny him his martyrdom they would not in a distant place called mesa verde thousands of kilometres from mecca my brothers began the whitehaired one facing the four men of his command in the small dingy motel room our time has come and we approach it with rapture knowing that a far better world lies before us a heaven where we will be free neither slaves nor pawns to others here on earth if through the grace of allah we survive to fight again we will bring home to our brothers and sisters the holy kill of vengeance that so justly belongs to us and the world will know that we have done it know that five men of valour penetrated and destroyed all within two fortresses built by the great enemy to stop us now we must prepare first with prayers and then with the more practical applications of our cause depending on what we learn we strike when they will least expect an attacknot with the cover of night but in sunlight by sundown we will either be with the holy hour of salat el maghreb or in the arms of allah it was shortly past noon when khalehla walked off the plane and into the lounge at san diegos international airport she was instantly aware of being watched mainly because her observer made no pretence of not doing so the nondescript overweight man in an unpressed illfitting gabardine suit was eating popcorn from a white cardboard container he nodded his head once turned and started walking down the wide crowded corridor towards the terminal it was a signal in moments rashad caught up with him slowing her pace to his at his side i gather you werent waiting to pick me up she said without looking at him if i was youd be on your knees begging me to take you home which ill probably have to do your modesty is as irresistible as you are thats what my wife says except she adds beauty what is it call langley i have a feeling that all hells broken loose but call from one of these phones not my place if its going to be my place ill wait up ahead if were a team just nod and follow me at a respectful distance naturally i think id like a name something try shapoff gingerbread said khalehla briefly shifting her eyes to glance at the field officer so highly regarded that he was practically a legend at the agency east berlin prague vienna actually interrupted the man in the dishevelled gabardine suit im a lefthanded periodontist from cleveland i guess i had a different picture of you thats why im gingerbread stupid goddamned name make your call rashad peeled off at the next pay telephone anxious and not familiar with the latest phone procedures she pushed the operator button and while feigning a bewildered french accent placed a collect call to a number she had long since committed to memory yes said mitchell payton at the other end of the line mj its me whats happened andrew vanvlanderen died early this morning killed no it was a cardiac seizure weve established that there was a fair amount of alcohol in his blood and he was a messunshaven eyes bloodshot reeking of body sweat and worsebut it was a stroke damn damn there was also an interesting set of circumstancesalways circumstances nothing clean hed been sitting in front of a television set for hours on end and obviously smashed it with a marble ashtray touchy touchy said the agent from cairo what does his wife say between excessive tears and pleas for seclusion the stoic widow claims he was depressed over heavy losses in the market and other investments which of course she insists she knows nothing about which of course she does that marriage must have been consummated above a financial statement under the mattress did you check on her information naturally his portfolio could support several small nations two of his horses even won the daily double at santa anita last week and along with a few others are galloping towards millions in stud fees so she was lying she was lying agreed payton but not necessarily about the depression lets try substituting another word rage perhaps manic rage coupled with hysterical fear something didnt happen suggested khalehla something was not made public as having happened perhaps it did perhaps it didnt perhaps it was botched perhaps and this could be the trigger perhaps several of the killers were taken alive as indeed one was in mesa verde and captured people can be made to talk volumes without knowing it precisely all thats needed is one source who can describe one location a method of travel a drop we have such a source such a person there are too many complications to hide everything whoevers behind these killings has to realize that at least suspect it that may have been on andrew vanvlanderens mind how are things going with the prisoner hes under now or as the doctors say hes being taken up hes a maniac hes tried everything from selfasphyxiation to swallowing his tongue as a result they had to inject tranquillizers before they could give him the serums slowing things a bit the doctors tell me that we should have the first reports within an hour or so what do i do now mj i cant very well barge in on the grieving widow on the contrary my dear interrupted payton thats exactly what youre going to do were going to turn this damned circumstantial liability into an asset when a person like mrs vanvlanderen accepts a position involving close ties with the potential successor to the president of the united states personal considerations become secondary youll apologize profusely of course but then stay with the scenario as weve outlined it when you think about it said khalehla given the circumstances the timing couldnt be better im the last person shell expect itll shake her up im glad you agree remember you may show compassion but the cold business of national security comes first what about shapoff are we a team only if you need him weve lent him to naval intelligence consultant status and im glad hes there but id rather you start solo work out contact arrangements i gather he hasnt been briefed no only to give you whatever assistance you may ask for i understand adrienne said the director of special projects drawing out the name theres something else you should also know we may be a step closer to our blondhaired european and equally important what hes all about who is he what did you find out we dont know who he is but id say hes working for people who want to see evan in the white house or at least closer to it my god hed never consider it in a thousand years who are these people very rich and very resourceful id guess payton briefly told her about the impending nationwide campaign to launch kendrick into the vice presidency jennings said his people are convinced it could flyfast and high were his words and in my opinion he wouldnt have the slightest objection right down to the presidents own reaction said khalehla her voice quiet floating into the pay phone every step every move that was made was thought out and analysed all but one what do you mean evans response mj hed never take it perhaps thats the shoe that hasnt dropped it would have to be an iron boot the size of the sphinxs foot then there are two groups one pushing our hero congressman on to the national ticket the other doing its damnedest to keep him off i came to the same conclusion and told the president as much go to work officer rashad call me when youre settled in your hotel i may have news from our doctors by then i dont suppose i could get in touch with my grandparents could i they live near here you know am i speaking with a twelveyear old absolutely not understood it was three oclock in the winter afternoon eastern standard time and the limousines were parked in the drive at the estate in cynwid hollow the chauffeurs smoked cigarettes talking quietly among themselves inside the conference had begun this will be a brief meeting said milos varak addressing the members of inver brass the glare of the lamps illuminating their faces in the large dimly lit study but the information was so vital i appealed to dr winters i felt it was imperative that you be apprised thats obvious said eric sundstrom testily ive left an entire laboratory not knowing what to do next you dragged me out of court milos added margaret lowell i assume youre right as you usually are i flew back from nassau said gideon logan laughing softly but then i wasnt doing anything but fishing until that damned ships phone jingled also i wasnt catching anything i wish i could say i was even that productive but i cant offered jacob mandel i was at a basketball game when the beeper went off i nearly didnt hear it in fact i think we should proceed said samuel winters an edge to his voice part impatience and part something else conceivably anger the information is devastating margaret lowell glanced over at the whitehaired historian of course we will sam were just catching our breath i may have spoken of fishing said gideon logan but my mind wasnt on fishing samuel the spokesman of inver brass nodded his tentative smile unsuccessful forgive me if i appear irritable the truth is that im frightened and so will you be then theres nothing in my laboratories as important to me right now said sundstrom gently as if rightfully rebuked please go ahead milos watch every face every pair of eyes study the muscles of their jaws and around their lids and their hairlines look for involuntary swallows and pronounced veins on their necks one of these four nearest me here knows the truth one is the traitor palestinian terrorists have struck congressman kendricks houses both in virginia and colorado there was a considerable loss of life a kind of controlled pandemonium broke out in that extraordinary room inside the estate on chesapeake bay its occupants fell back into chairs or sat forward over the table in shock throated cries came from stretched lips eyes wide in horror or narrowed in disbelief and the questions rapidly assaulted varak like the sharp reports of repeated rifle fire was kendrick killed when did it happen ive heard nothing about it was anyone taken alive this last question the questioner instantly examined by milos varak was gideon logan his dark face set in furyor was it frenzy or fear ill answer everything i can said the czech coordinator of inver brass but i must tell you that im not fully informed the word is that kendrick survived and is in protective custody the attacks took place late yesterday afternoon or possibly in the early evening possibly shouted margaret lowell yesterday why dont you know why dont we all know why doesnt the country know theres a total blackout apparently requested by the intelligence services and granted by the president obviously designed to unbalance the arabs said mandel they kill for publicity and if they dont get it they go crazier than they already are crazy people stand out and if theyre alive they have to get out of the country added sundstrom can they get out varak it would depend on the sophistication of their arrangements sir on who made it possible for them to get in were any of the palestinians taken alive persisted gideon logan i can only speculate answered the czech his eyes neutral but beneath that neutrality searching intensely i was fortunate to learn what i did before the blackout was made total the loss of life was not broken down at that point what are your speculations asked sundstrom at best there is only a to per cent chance that any of the assailants was capturedalive the figure is based on mideast statistics its customary for terrorist teams to carry cyanide capsules sewn into their lapels concealed razor blades and syringes taped to various parts of their bodies anything that facilitates taking their own lives rather than reveal information through torture or drugs remember except for the inability to kill their enemies death is no sacrifice for these people instead its a rite of passage to an afterlife of joy not overabundant for them here then its possible that one or two or more might have been captured alive pressed logan making a statement its possible depending upon how many were involved its a priority if it can be accomplished why is it so important gideon asked samuel winters because were all aware of the extraordinary measures taken to protect kendrick replied the black entrepreneur studying varaks face and i think its imperative to know how these unschooled fanatics penetrated such security any word on that milos yes sir mine and hardly official but its only a matter of days before the federal units make the connection i made what the hell is it cried margaret lowell her voice loud and sharp i assume youre all aware of andrew vanvlanderen no broke in lowell what about him asked gideon logan should we chimed in mandel he died said eric sundstrom sitting back in his chair what the word shot out three times in succession it happened early this morning in california too late for the eastern papers explained winters the cause of death was listed as a heart attack i heard it on the radio so did i added sundstrom i havent listened to a radio margaret lowell i was on a boat and then a plane gideon logan i was at a basketball game jacob mandel guiltily its not the biggest news story of the day continued sundstrom sitting forward the late editions of the post had it on page four or five i think and vanvlanderen was at least known in this town outside here and palm springs not too many people have ever heard his name whats the connection to the palestinians asked logan his dark eyes riveted on varak the alleged heart attack is open to question sir each face around the table was like granite hard immobile set as in stone slowly each looked at the others the enormity of the implication rolling over them like an immense powerful wave thats an extraordinary statement mr varak said winters quietly would you explain as you did to me please the men around vice president bollinger by and large the heaviest contributors to party funds with interests to protect are fighting among themselves ive learned that there are different factions one wants to replace the vice president with a specific candidate another wants to retain him and still another insists on waiting until the political landscape is clearer so intoned jacob mandel removing his silverrimmed glasses the one person obviously unacceptable to everyone is evan kendrick and milos said margaret lowell everything we do entails a degree of risk counsellor replied varak ive never tried to minimize that despite the fact that ive guaranteed your anonymity nevertheless to initiate the campaign for congressman kendrick we had to create a political committee through which to funnel materials and considerable funds with yourselves nowhere in evidence it took several weeks and its possible that the news reached san diego its not difficult to imagine the reactions of bollingers people especially the faction most disposed towards him kendrick is a legitimate american hero a viable candidate who could be swept on to the ticket in a wave of popularity just as we have proposed he should be those people might panic and look for quick final solutions among them would have to be the vanvlanderens and mrs vanvlanderen the vice presidents chief of staff has extensive ties in europe and the middle east good christ exclaimed sundstrom are you suggesting that vice president bollinger is responsible for these terrorist attacks these killings not directly no sir it could be more like henry iis remark within the royal court about thomas becket will no one rid me of this turbulent priest the king gave no order no instructions he simply asked a pointed question probably while laughing but his knights didnt miss the point and the point here is that powerful people were instrumental in getting those killers into the country and supplied once they were here its incredible said mandel gripping his glasses his voice a whisper just a minute interrupted gideon logan his large head at an angle his eyes still riveted on the czech youve also suggested that vanvlanderens heart attack might have been something else what makes you suspect that and if youre right how is it related to the palestinians my initial suspicions about his stroke came when i learned that within an hour of the bodys arrival at the mortuary mrs vanvlanderen gave the order for immediate cremation claiming that they had a mutual pact for the procedure said procedure eliminating any chance of an autopsy attorney lowell nodded her head clarifying the obvious whats the palestinian connection milos to begin with the timing a healthy sportsman with no history of heart disease is suddenly dead less than twentyfour hours after the attacks on kendricks homes then of course learning further about mrs vanvlanderens extensive middle east contactsthat was prompted by our brief discussion about her during the last meeting these are things the federal investigators will piece together within a matter of days and if valid probably relate them to the massacres but if vanvlanderen was dealing with the terrorists why was he killed asked a bewildered sundstrom he was the one holding the strings ill answer that eric said margaret lowell the best way to put evidence out of reach is to destroy it the courier is killed not the one who sends the message that way the instigator cant be traced too much too much cried jacob mandel such high levels of our government can be such garbage we know they can be my friend answered samuel winters otherwise we ourselves would not be doing what were doing the tragedy of it said the financier shaking his head in sorrow a nation of such promise so racked from within theyll change all the rules all the laws for what for themselves replied gideon logan quietly what do you think will happen milos asked margaret lowell if theres any substance to my speculation and the blackout runs its course i believe a cover story will be created completely omitting any reference to government officials making contact with terrorists scapegoats dead ones will be found washington cant afford to do otherwise foreign policy would be in a shambles and bollinger once again sundstrom sat back in his chair officially if the scapegoats are sufficiently convincing he could be taken as you say here off the hook thats officially not where we are concerned thats an interesting statement if not an illuminating one mr varak said winters would you mind clarifying not at all sir although i must return to chicago ive made arrangements with certain personnel at the telephone company in san diego to provide me with records of every call placed to bollingers residence his office and each member of his staff they will state all initiating numbers and times including pay phones and their locations unless im mistaken well have enough ammunition if only circumstantial to persuade the vice president to gracefully remove himself from the ticket the last car sped out of the drive as samuel winters hung up the telephone in the ornate tapestried living room and joined varak at the large front window which one is it said the czech staring out at the disappearing vehicle i think youll know before its morning in california the helicopter will be here in a few minutes the jets cleared for takeoff at fourthirty in easton thank you sir i trust we havent made all these arrangements for nothing your case was very strong milos whoever it is wont dare place a call he or she will have to appear in person is everything set at the hotel yes my driver at the airport in san diego will have the keys to the service entrance and the suite ill use the freight elevator tell me said the aristocratic whitehaired historian is it possible the scenario you presented to us this afternoon could be right could andrew vanvlanderen actually have made contact with the palestinians no sir its not possible his wife would never permit it shed have killed him herself if he tried complicated arrangements of that sort could be traced with difficulty of course but shed never take the chance shes too professional in the distance over the waters of chesapeake bay the chopping sounds of a helicopters rotors could be heard they grew louder khalehla dropped her bag on the floor threw the two boxes and the three shopping bags on the bed and followed them shoving the bags aside as her head hit the bulge of the pillows she had asked gingerbread shapoff to drop her off at a department store so she could buy some clothes since those she owned were either in cairo or fairfax or in a bahamian police car or on a us air force jet fiddledeedee she said in a weary imitation of scarlet ohara as she stared at the ceiling id like to think about everything tomorrow she continued to herself out loud but goddamn it i cant she sat up and reached for the hotel telephone studying the instructions and dialling the appropriate numbers to reach payton in langley virginia yes mj dont you ever go home are you home my dear i dont know where it is any longer but ill let you in on a secret uncle mitch uncle good heavens you must want a pony ride what is it home may end up being with a certain mutual friend of ours my you have made progress no he did he even talked about twenty or thirty years of what i dont know a real home and babies and things like that i guess then lets bring him out alive adrienne khalehla shook her head not in the negative but to bring herself back to the reality at hand the adrienne did it mj sorry dont be were entitled to our glimpses of happiness and you know i want it all for you it never happened for you though did it it was my choice field officer rashad gotcha pal or should i say sir say whatever you like but listen to me the first report is in from the clinicthe prisoner theyre apparently travelling as priests maronite priests on israeli passports that boy doesnt know very much hes an alsoran who was somehow permitted to be part of the team because of kendrick he was crippled while he was with our congressman in oman i know evan told me they were in a police truck heading down to the jabal sham to their executions they thought things get fuzzy here that youngster was told very little and rightly so hes completely unstable from what our chemists can piece together however the two teams were to make contact near an airportcommand one joining command two which presumably means the fairfax crowd was to hook up with the colorado unit out there thats a lot of arranging mj a lot of mileage theyve got savvy travel agents working on their itineraries very savvy and very hidden one might almost say bureaucratically obscured speaking of which im two floors above the grieving widow her office has been alerted shes been told to expect your call then ill straighten up and go to work incidentally i had to buy a few things to dress the part but ill be damned if ill pay for them lets say theyre not me theyre a little on the severe side i thought considering mrs vanvlanderens past associations you might be somewhat more chic well theyre not that severe i didnt think so call me when its over khalehla hung up the phone looked at it for a moment then reached down for her bag on the floor she opened it and took out a sheet of notepaper on which she had written evans telephone number in mesa verde seconds later she dialled the kendrick residence said a womans voice khalehla recognized as belonging to one of the nurses may i speak with the congressman please this is miss adrienne of the state department sure hon but youll have to hang on while i get him hes outside saying goodbye to that nice young greek who i think hes greek he knows a lot of people the congressman knew over in arabia or wherever he was what are you talking about the priest hes a young priest from get evan away screamed khalehla lurching to her feet yell for the guards the others are out there they want to kill him the icarus agenda chapter it had been so simple thought ahbyahd watching from the woods opposite the despised enemys huge house a sincere and pleasant young priest whose papers were in order and of course had no weapons on him bearing greetings from friends of the great man who could refuse him a brief audience this innocent holy man from a distant land unaware of the formalities attached to calling upon persons of importance his initial rejection had been countermanded by the enemy himself the rest was up to a highly inventive believer what remained was up to all of them they would not fail their young comrade was walking out of the house he was shaking hands with the loathsome amal bahrudi under the watchful eyes of the guards in business suits and carrying automatic weapons the believers could only estimate the size of the guard force it was a minimum of twelve men conceivably more inside with the love of allah the first assault would remove a large block of them killing most and severely wounding the rest beyond functioning their comrade was being escorted down the circular drive to the car courteously parked on the road beyond the tall hedges only moments now and the beloved allah looked favourably upon them three more guards appeared bringing the total in front of the house to seven do your work our brother drive accurately the comrade reached the car he bowed his head politely making the sign of the cross and once again shook hands his single escort now concealed from the others by the hedges he then opened the door and briefly coughed supporting himself on the back of the seat as his right arm reached down over the fabric suddenly with the swiftness and assurance of a true believer he spun around gripping a doubleedged blade in his hand and plunging it into the guards throat before the government man could see what was happening blood erupting the guard fell as the terrorist grabbed the weapon and the body simultaneously dragging the corpse across the road and into the undergrowth at the edge of the woods he looked over in ahbyahds direction nodded and raced back to the car ahbyahd in turn snapped his fingers and signalled the brothers behind him hidden among the trees the three men crept forward dressed like the whitehaired one in paramilitary clothing and gripping lightframed submachine guns grenades clipped to their field jackets the englishspeaking killer behind the wheel started the engine shifted the car into gear and drove slowly casually towards the left entrance of the circular drive then abruptly the motor suddenly roaring at its highest pitch he swung the vehicle sharply to the right and into the entrance while he reached below the dashboard and flipped a switch opening the door he aimed the car over the large front lawn towards the milling guards talking with the congressman and leaped out of the racing vehicle on to the gravel as he hit the ground he heard a womans screams through the cacophony of the thundering engine and the roars of the government patrols one of the nurses had come running out of the front door yelling incoherently at the sight of the driverless onrushing car she turned and screamed again now at kendrick who was nearest the stone entrance get away she shrieked repeating words she had heard only moments before they want to kill you the congressman raced towards the heavy door grabbing the woman by the arm and propelling her in front of him as the guards opened fire at the empty metal monster surging crazily out of control veering now into the side of the house towards the sliding glass doors of the veranda inside evan crashed his shoulder into the door slamming it shut that action and the thick steelreinforced panel of the door saved their lives the explosions came like thunderous successive combustions from some massive furnace shattering windows and walls firing curtains and furniture out in front of the house the seven guards from the central intelligence agency fell pierced by shards of glass and metal sent flying by ninety pounds of dynamite lashed to the undercarriage of the engine four were dead heads and bodies riddled two were barely alive blood streaming out of eyes and chests one his left hand no more than a bleeding stump had summoned rage his weapon on automatic fire as he lurched across the lawn towards the priestly terrorist who was laughing insanely his submachine gun spitting fire both men killed each other in the chill of the brisk colorado day under the blinding colorado sunlight kendrick lunged up against the stone wall in the hallway pressing himself into the bulging rock design he looked down at the nurse stay where you are he ordered as he inched his way towards the corner of the living room smoke was billowing everywhere carried by the breezes through the shattered windows he heard the shouts outside the guards from their flanking positions around the house were converging professionals covering each other as they moved into new positions then there were four detonations one after the othergrenades these were followed by other voices screaming in arabic death to our enemies death to a great enemy blood will be answered by blood repeated bursts from automatic weapons broke out from different directions two other grenades exploded one thrown through the smashed windows directly into the living room blowing apart the far wall evan spun around for the protection of the stone then as the debris settled he shouted manny manny where are you answer me there was no reply only the apparently perverted steady ringing of a telephone the gunfire outside escalated to deafening proportions burst upon burst bullets ricocheting off rock thumping into wood screeching wildly through the air manny had been on the porch the porch with glass doors kendrick had to get out there he had to he rushed into the smoke and fire of the living room shielding his eyes and his nostrils when suddenly a figure flew into the shattered front windows crashing through the fragments of glass the man rolled on the floor and sprang to his feet ahbyahd screamed evan paralysed you roared the palestinian his weapon levelled my life has glory glory beloved allah be praised you bring me great happiness am i worth it to you so many killed so many butchered am i really worth it does your allah demand so much death you can speak of death shrieked the terrorist azra dead yaakov dead zaya killed by jews from the skies over the baaka all the others hundreds thousandsdead now amal bahrudi such a clever traitor i take you to hell not yet came the voice half whispered half shouted from the archway leading to the porch the words were accompanied by two loud reverberating gunshots that momentarily drowned out the rapid fire outside ahbyahd the whitehaired one arched back under the impact of the powerful weapon a portion of his skull blown away emmanuel weingrass his face and shirt drenched with blood his left shoulder pressed into the interior of the arch slid to the floor manny yelled kendrick racing over to the old architect kneeling down and lifting his upper body off the hard floor where are you hit where wasnt i replied weingrass throatily with difficulty check the two girls when everything started they went to the windows i tried to stop them check them goddamn you evan looked over at the two bodies on the porch beyond them the sliding doors were no more than frames bordering sharp pointed fragments of thick glass the car bomb had done its work there was little left of two human beings but shredded skin and blood theres nothing to check manny im sorry oh you call yourself a god in your fucking heaven screamed weingrass tears welling in his eyes what more do you want you fraud the old man collapsed into unconsciousness outside the gunfire stopped kendrick prepared for the worst wrenching the magnum out of mannys hand wondering briefly who had given it to him instantly knowing it was geegee gonzalez he gently lowered weingrass and stood up he walked cautiously into the smouldering living room and was suddenly assaulted by the stench of wet smoke aware that water was showering out of the ceiling sprinklers a gunshot he dropped to the floor his eyes darting in all directions followed by his weapon four shouted a voice from beyond the shattered windows i count four one went inside yelled another approach and fire at any goddamn thing that moves christ i dont want our body count and i also dont want one of these motherfuckers to walk out alive do you understand me understood hes dead yelled evan with what voice he had left but theres another a wounded man in here hes alive and hes severely wounded and hes one of us congressman is that you mr kendrick its me and i never want to hear that title again once more the telephone started ringing evan got to his feet and headed wearily towards the charred pine desk drenched by the separated sprays from the sprinklers suddenly he saw the nurse who had saved his life walk hesitantly around the stone arch of the hallway stay out of here he said i dont want you to go out there i heard you say there was someone wounded sir thats what im trained for the telephone kept ringing him yes not the others i dont want you to see the others im no spring chicken congressman i did three tours of duty in nam but these were your friends so were countless others said the nurse no comment in her voice is it manny yes the telephone kept ringing after your call please contact dr lyons sir kendrick picked up the phone yes evan thank christ its mj i just heard from adrienne fuck off said kendrick disconnecting the line and dialling information at first the room spun around then far away thunder grew louder and bolts of lightning crashed into his mind would you please repeat that operator so im absolutely clear about what youve just said certainly sir theres no listing for a dr lyons in cortez or the mesa verde district in fact theres no one named lyonslyonsin the area that was his name i saw it on the clearance from the state department i beg your pardon nothing nothing evan slammed down the phone and no sooner had he done so than it started ringing again yes my darling are you all right your fucking mj blew it i dont know how many are dead and mannys shot up like a slaughtered pig hes not only half gone but he doesnt even have a doctor call lyons he doesnt exist how did you know about here i spoke to the nurse she said a priest was there and darling listen to me we found out only minutes ago that they were travelling as priests i called mj and hes beside himself hes got half of colorado moving in all federals and sworn to secrecy i just told him to take a hike hes not your enemy evan who the hell is for gods sake were trying to find out youre a little slow and theyre very fast what can i tell you kendrick his hair drenched and his body soaked from the sprinklers looked over at the nurse who was ministering to weingrass her eyes were filled with tears her throat holding back her hysteria from the sight of her friends on the veranda evan spoke softly tell me youre coming back to me tell me its all going to end tell me im not going mad i can tell you all of those things but you have to believe them youre alive and thats all that matters to me right now what about the others who arent alive what about manny dont they count manny said something last night that impressed me very much we were talking about the hassans sabri and kashi he said we will each remember them and mourn for them in our own ways but it must come later to some that may sound cold but not to me hes been where ive been my darling and i know where hes coming from none are forgotten but for the moment we must forget them and do what we have to do does that make sense to you my darling im trying to make sense out of it when are you coming back ill know in a couple of hours ill call you evan hung up the phone as the multiple sounds of sirens and approaching helicopters grew louder all centering on an infinitesimal spot of the earth erroneously called mesa verde in colorado its a perfectly lovely apartment said khalehla softly walking through the marble foyer towards the sunken living room of the vanvlanderen suite its convenient offered the new widow a handkerchief gripped in her hand as she closed the door and joined the intelligence officer from cairo the vice president can be quite demanding and it was either this or having to run another house when hes in california two houses are a bit muchhis and mine do sit down are they all like this asked khalehla sitting in the armchair designated by ardis vanvlanderen it was opposite the large imposing brocade sofa the lady of the house was quick to establish the pecking order of the seating arrangements no actually my husband had it remodelled to our taste the widow brought the handkerchief briefly to her face i suppose i should get used to saying my late husband she added lowering herself sadly on the couch im so sorry and to repeat what i said i apologize for intruding at such a time its unconscionable and i made that clear to my superiors but they insisted they were right affairs of state must go on miss rashad i understand im not sure i do this interview could have taken place at least tomorrow morning in my opinion but again others think otherwise thats what fascinates me said ardis smoothing the black silk of her balenciaga dress what can be so vitally important to begin with replied khalehla crossing her legs and removing a wrinkle from her dark grey suit acquired by way of san diegos robinsons what we talk about must remain between ourselves we dont want vice president bollinger unduly alarmed the agent from cairo took out a notebook from her black purse and smoothed her dark hair which was pulled back and knotted in a severe bun as i know youve been told im posted overseas and was flown back for this assignment i was told that youre an expert in middle east affairs thats a euphemism for terrorist activities im half arab i can see that youre quite beautiful youre very beautiful mrs vanvlanderen i get by as long as i dont dwell upon the years im sure were close in age lets not dwell on that either what is this problem why was it so urgent that you see me our personnel who work the baaka valley in lebanon have uncovered startling and disturbing information do you know what a hit team is mrs vanvlanderen who doesnt answered the widow reaching for a pack of cigarettes on the coffee table she extracted one and picked up a white marble lighter its a group of menusually mensent out to assassinate someone she lit the cigarette her right hand almost imperceptibly trembled so much for definitions why does it concern the vice president because of the threats that were made against him the reason for the unit you requested from the federal bureau of investigation thats all over said ardis inhaling deeply it turned out to be some kind of psychotic crank who probably didnt even own a gun but when those filthy letters and the obscene phone calls started coming in i felt we couldnt take chances its all in the report we chased him through a dozen cities until he got on a plane in toronto for cuba i understand and it serves him right he may not have been a crank mrs vanvlanderen what do you mean well you never found him did you the fbi worked up a very complete profile miss rashad he was defined as mentally deranged some kind of classic case of schizophrenia with overtones of a captain avenger complex or something equally ridiculous he was essentially harmless its a closed book wed like to reopen it why word from the baaka valley is that two or more hit teams have been dispatched over here conceivably to assassinate vice president bollinger your crank may have been the point wittingly or unwittingly but nevertheless the point the point what are you talking about i cant even understand your language except that it sounds preposterous not at all said khalehla calmly terrorists operate on the principle of maximum exposure they will frequently announce an objective a target well in advance of execution they do this in many ways many variations why would terrorists want to kill orsonvice president bollinger why did you think the threats against him should be taken seriously because they were there i could do no less and you were right agreed the intelligence officer watching the widow crushing out her cigarette and reaching for another which she promptly lit but to answer your question should the vice president be assassinated theres not only a void on a political ticket assured of reelection but considerable destabilization for what purpose maximum exposure it would be a spectacular kill wouldnt it even more so as the record would show that the fbi had been alerted and then withdrawn outsmarted by superior strategy strategy exclaimed ardis vanvlanderen what strategy a psychotic crank who wasnt a crank at all but a strategic diversion pivot attention on a harmless crank then close the book while the real killers move into place thats crazy its been repeated over and over again in the arabic mind everything progresses geometrically in stages one step leads to another the first not necessarily related to the third but the connection is there if you look for it looking back to classic cases this diversion fits the bill it wasnt a diversion there were the phone calls and the numbers were traced to different cities the pastedup letters with the filthy language classic repeated khalehla softly writing what are you doing reopening the book and noting your conviction may i ask you a question certainly replied the widow her voice controlled but tight among vice president bollingers many supportersmany friends i should sayhere in california can you think of any who might not be either what its no secret that the vice president moves in wealthy circles is there anyone with whom hes had differences or more than one a particular group perhaps over policy or procurements or government allocations good god what are you saying weve reached the bottom line mrs vanvlanderen the reason im here are there people in california who would rather have another candidate on the ticket frankly another vice president i cant believe im hearing this how dare you im not the one whos daring mrs vanvlanderen someone else is international communications no matter how obscured can ultimately be traced perhaps not at first to a specific individual or individuals but to a sector a location theres a third party or parties involved in this terrible thing and theyre here in southern california our people in the baaka have zeroed in on initial cablegrams routed through beirut from zurich switzerland original dateline san diego san diego zurich money a convergence of interests one party wants a spectacular kill with maximum exposure while the other wants the spectacular target removed but must stay as far away from the kill as possible both objectives take a great deal of money follow the money is a maxim in our work were tracing it now tracing it it will only be a matter of days the swiss banks are cooperative where drugs and terrorism are concerned and our agents in the baaka are forwarding descriptions of the teams weve stopped them before and well stop them now well find the san diego connection we simply thought you might have some ideas ideas cried the stunned widow crushing out the cigarette i cant even think its all so incredible are you certain that some enormous extraordinary error hasnt been made we dont make errors in these matters well i think thats pretty shitkicking egotistical said ardis the pennsylvanian of her youth overriding her carefully cultivated english i mean miss rashad youre not infallible in some cases we have to be we cant afford not to be now thats asinine i meani mean if there are these hit teams and if there are communications with zurich and beirut from from the san diego area anyone could have sent them giving any names they wanted to i mean they could have used my name for christs sake wed instantly discount anything like that khalehla answered the unasked whatif question as she closed her notebook and replaced it in her bag it would be a setup and far too obvious to be taken seriously yes thats what i mean a setup someone could be setting up one of orsons friends isnt that possible for the purpose of assassinating the vice president maybe thewhat did you call itthe target is somebody else isnt that possible somebody else asked the field agent nearly wincing as the intense widow grabbed another cigarette yes and by sending cablegrams from the san diego area implicating an innocent bollinger supporter that is possible miss rashad its very interesting mrs vanvlanderen ill convey your thoughts to my superiors well have to consider the possibility a double omission with a false insert what the widows scratching voice came straight from some long gone pittsburgh saloon shop talk said khalehla rising from the chair it simply means disguise the target omit the source and provide a false identity you people talk goddamned funny it serves a purpose well stay in constant touch with you and we have the vice presidents schedule our own people all counterterrorist experts will quietly supplement mr bollingers security forces at every location yeahawright mrs vanvlanderen the cigarette in her hand the handkerchief forgotten on the brocade sofa escorted rashad out of the living room and up to the door oh about the double omissioninsert theory said the intelligence officer in the marble foyer its interesting and well use it to press the swiss banks for quick action but i dont think it really holds water what all numbered swiss accounts have sealedand therefore unscalablecodes leading to points of origin they are often labyrinthine but they can be traced even the greediest mafia overlord or saudi arms merchant knows hes mortal hes not going to leave millions to the gnomes of zurich good night and again my deepest sympathies khalehla walked back to the closed door of the vanvlanderen suite she could hear a muted scream of panic wrapped in obscenities from within the sole resident of the madetomeasure apartment was going over the edge the scenario had worked mj was right the negative circumstances of andrew vanvlanderens death had been reversed what had been a liability was now an asset the contributors widow was breaking milos varak stood in a dark shopfront thirty yards to the left of the entrance to the westlake hotel ten yards from the corner where the service entrance was located on the intersecting street it was pm california time he had outraced every commercial flight across the country from washington dc maryland and virginia he was in place for the moment of revelation and equally important everything was arranged upstairs in the hotel the cleaning staff of the management a management genuinely concerned about the grieving widows sorrow included a new member experienced and instructed by the czech frequencydesigned intercepts had been placed in every room no conversation could take place without being recorded by varaks voiceactivated tapes in the adjoining suite taxis drove up to the hotel on the average of one every three minutes and milos studied each departing fare he had seen twenty to thirty losing count but not his concentration suddenly he was aware of the unusual a cab stopped on his left across the intersecting street at least a hundred feet away a man got out and varak moved farther back into the unlit recess i heard it on the radio so did i shes a bitch and if theyre alive they have to get out of the country can they get out what are your speculations its not the biggest news story of the day and bollinger the man in the top coat the lapels pulled up covering his face walked rapidly across the street towards the hotels entrance he passed within ten feet of inver brasss coordinator the traitor was eric sundstrom and he was a man in panic the icarus agenda chapter ardis vanvlanderen gasped good christ what are you doing here she cried literally yanking the rotund sundstrom through the door and slamming it shut are you out of your mind im very much in it but yours is out to lunch stupid stupid stupid what did you and that horses ass of a husband of yours think you were doing the arabs the hit teams yes goddamned fools its all preposterous screamed the widow its a horrendous mix up why would wewhy would andy want to have bollinger killed bollinger its kendrick you bitch palestinian terrorists attacked his houses in virginia and colorado theres a blackout on the news but a lot of people were killed not however the golden boy himself kendrick whispered ardis panic in her large green eyes oh my god and they think the killers are coming out here to assassinate bollinger theyve got it all backwards they sundstrom froze his face ashen what are you talking about wed both better sit down mrs vanvlanderen walked out of the foyer and down into the living room to the couch and her cigarettes the pale scientist followed then veered to a bar where there were bottles decanters glasses and an ice bucket without glancing at the labels he picked up a bottle at random and poured himself a drink who is they he asked quietly intensely as he turned and watched ardis on the couch lighting a cigarette she left about an hour and a half ago she who a woman named rashad a counterterrorist expert shes with a crossover unit cia joining up with state she never mentioned kendrick jesus theyve put it together varak said they would and they did whos varak we call him our coordinator he said theyd find out about your middle east interests my what shouted the widow her face contorted her mouth gaping that off shore company offshore investments completed ardis again stunned it was eight months of my life but thats all it was and how you have contacts throughout the whole area i have no contacts screamed mrs vanvlanderen i left over ten years ago and never went back the only arabs i know are a few high rollers i met in london and divonne rollers in bed or at the tables both if you want to know lover boy why would they think that because you gave them a damn good reason to start looking when you had that son of a bitch cremated this morning andy was there someone else hanging around here who happened to drop dead or perhaps was poisoned in a coverup what the hell are you talking about your fourth or fifth husbands body thats what im talking about no sooner does it reach the damned mortuary than youre on the phone ordering his immediate cremation you think thats not going to start people wonderingpeople who are paid to wonder about things like that no autopsy ashes somewhere over the pacific i never made such a call roared ardis leaping up from the couch i never gave such an order you did yelled sundstrom you said you and andrew had a pact i didnt say it and we didnt have one varak doesnt bring us wrong information stated the hightech scientist firmly then someone lied to him the widow suddenly lowered her voice or he was lying why would he hes never lied before i dont know said ardis sitting down and stabbing out her cigarette eric she continued looking up at inver brasss traitor why did you come all the way out here to tell me this why didnt you just call you have our private numbers varak again nobody really knows how he can do what he does still he does it hes in chicago but hes made arrangements to be given the telephone number of every incoming call to bollingers office and residence as well as the office and residence of each member of his staff under those conditions i dont make phone calls in your case it might be hard to explain to that council of senile lunatics you belong to and the only calls ive had were from the office and friends with condolences also the rashad woman none of those would interest mr varak or your benevolent society of rich misfits the rashad woman you say she didnt mention the attacks on kendricks houses assuming varaks wrong and the investigating units havent put certain facts together and come up with you and perhaps a few others out here why didnt she she had to know about them ardis vanvlanderen reached for a cigarette her eyes now betraying an unfamiliar helplessness there could be several reasons she said without much conviction as she snapped up the flame of the lighter to begin with the vice president is frequently overlooked where clearances are concerned regarding security blackoutstruman had never heard of the manhattan project then theres the matter of avoiding panic if these attacks took placeand im not ready to concede that they did your varaks been caught in one lie hes capable of another in addition if the full extent of the damage in virginia and colorado was known we might lose staff control no one likes to think he might be killed by suicidal terrorists finally i go back to the attacks themselves i dont believe they ever happened sundstrom stood motionless gripping the glass in both hands as he stared down at his former lover he did it didnt he ardis he said softly that financial megalomaniac couldnt stand the possibility that a small group of benevolent misfits might replace his man with another who could cut off his pipeline to millions and probably would the widow collapsed back into the couch her long neck arched her eyes closed eight hundred million she whispered thats what he said eight hundred million for him alone billions for all the rest of you he never told you what he was doing what he had done good christ no id have put a bullet in his head and called one of you to deepsix him in mexico i believe you will the others ardis sat up her eyes pleading oh i think so they know you i swear to you eric i didnt know a thing i said i believed you the rashad woman told me they were tracing the money he sent through zurich can they do that if i knew andrew it would take them months his coded payin sources ranged from south africa to the baltic months a year perhaps will the others know that well see what they say what eric i called grinell from the airport in baltimore hes no part of bollingers staff and god knows he stays in the background but if we have a chairman of the board i think wed all agree hes the fellow eric what are you telling me asked mrs vanvlanderen her voice flat hell be here in a few minutes we agreed we should have a talk i wanted a little time with you alone but he should be here shortly sundstrom glanced at his watch youve got that glassy look in your eyes lover boy said ardis slowly getting up from the couch oh yes agreed the scientist the one you always laughed at when i couldnt shall we say perform your mind was so often on other things youre such a brilliant man yes i know you once said that you always knew when i was solving a problem i went limp i loved your mind i still love it how could you you dont really have one yourself so how would you know eric grinell frightens me he doesnt frighten me he has a mind the chimes of the front door filled the vanvlanderen suite kendrick sat in a small canvas chair by the cot in the cabin of the jet that was flying them to denver emmanuel weingrass his wounds prevented from further bleeding by the surviving nurse in mesa verde kept blinking his dark eyes made darker by the lined white flesh surrounding them ive been thinking said manny with difficulty half coughing the words dont talk broke in evan conserve your strength please oh get off it replied the old man what have i got twenty more years and i dont get laid will you stop it no i wont stop it five years i dont see you so we get back together and what happens you get too attachedto me what are you a feygele with a hangup for old guys dont answer that khalehla will do it for you you two must have busted your parts last night why dont you ever talk like a normal person because normalcy bores me just like youre beginning to bore me dont you know what all this shit is about i brought up a dummy you cant figure no i cant figure all right that lovely girl was on the button someone wants to make you very important in this country and someone else is having bowel movements over the prospect you cant see that im beginning to and i hope the other guys win i dont want to be important maybe you should be maybe its where you belong who the hell says so who thinks so the people who dont want youyou think about that khalehla told us that these garbage maniacs who came over here to kill you didnt just hop on a plane from paris or walk off a cruise ship they had help influential help how did she put it passports weapons moneyeven drivers licences and clothes and hideouts those things especially the paperwork you dont pick up at a corner store they take contacts with power in high places and the people who can pull those kinds of strings are the bastards who want you dead why does the outspoken congressman pose a threat to them how can i be a threat im getting out they dont know that all they see is a mensch politician who when he opens his mouth everybody in washington shuts up and listens to i dont talk that much so the listenings minor practically nonexistent the point is that when you do talk they dont you got what i call listening credentials like i do frankly weingrass coughed bringing a trembling hand to his throat evan bent over him concerned take it easy manny be quiet ordered the old man you hear what ive got to say those bastards see a real american hero whos awarded a big medal by the president and put on important committees in the congress the committees came before the medal dont interrupt after a couple of months the sequence of things blursanyway you just made it stronger this hero takes on the pentagon brass over national television before hes a hero and damn near indicts the whole damned bunch of them as well as all those big industrial complexes who supply the machine then what does he do he demands accountability terrific word accountabilitythe bastards all hate it theyve got to start sweating kid theyve got to figure that maybe this jokerhero will get more powerful maybe chair one of those committees or even get elected to the senate where he could do some real damage youre exaggerating your girlfriend wasnt countered weingrass loudly staring into kendricks eyes she told us that her elite group may have tapped into a nerve centre higher up in the government than they want to think about doesnt all this present a blueprint to you although i admit you were never the hottest shot with a blueprint i ever knew of course it does answered evan nodding slowly theres no nation in the world that doesnt have its degrees of corruption and i doubt there ever will be oh corruption intoned manny eyes rolling as if the word were part of a talmudic chant like in one guy stealing a bucks worth of paper clips from the office and another taking a million with a cost overrun is that what you mean basically yes or ten million if you like insignificant peanuts shouted weingrass such people do not deal with palestinian terrorists thousands of miles away for the sole purpose of positively removing themselves from a kill they wouldnt know howl also you didnt look into that lovely girls eyes or maybe you dont know what to look for youve never been there she says she knows where youre coming from because you have been there all right i havent so what are you talking about when youre there youre scared said the old man youre walking towards a black curtain that youre going to pull down youre excited the curiositys killing you and so is the fear all of those things you try like hell to suppress them even hide some from yourself and thats part of it because you cant afford to lose an ounce of control but its all there because once that curtain is yanked away you know youll be looking at something so nuts you wonder if anyone will believe it you saw all that in her eyes enough yes why shes getting near the edge kid why because were not dealingshes not dealingwith simple corruption even terrific corruption whats behind that black curtain is a government within the government a bunch of servants running the masters house the old architect suddenly went into a spasm of coughing his whole body trembling his eyes shut tight kendrick grabbed his arms in moments the convulsion was over and manny blinked again breathing deeply listen to me my dumb son he whispered help her really help her and help payton find the bastards and rip them out of course i will you know that i hate them that youngster under chemicals that ahbyahd you knew in masqatwe might have been friends in another time but that time wont ever come as long as there are bastards who pit ourselves against ourselves because they make billions out of hatred its not that simple manny its a larger part of it than you think ive seen it they have more than you do so well sell you more than they havethats one of the comeons or theyll kill you unless you kill them first so heres the firepower for a price it goes right up the goddamned ladder they spent twenty million on a missile well spend forty million do we really want to blow up the fucking planet or is everyone listening to lunatics who listen to men who sell hatred and peddle fear on that level its that simple said evan smiling i may even have mentioned it myself keep mentioning it kid dont walk away from that platform we talked aboutmainly regarding a certain herbert dennison we also talked about whom you scared the shit out of remember you got listening credentials like me use em ill have to think about it manny well while youre thinking coughed weingrass his right hand on his chest why dont you think about why you had to lie to me you and the doctors that is what its back evan its back and its worse because it never went away whats back big casino i think is the gentle phrase the cancers running rampant no it isnt we ran you through a dozen tests they got ityoure clean tell that to these little suckers who are choking off my air im no doctor manny but i dont think thats a symptom during the last thirtysix hours youve been through a couple of wars its a wonder you can breathe at all yeah but while theyre patching me up at the hospital you have them run one of those little checks and dont lie to me there are some people in paris ive got to take care of some things ive got locked away they should have so dont lie to me understand i wont lie to you said kendrick as the aircraft started its descent into denver crayton grinell was a slender man of medium height and a perpetually grey face made prominent by sharp features when greeting someone for the first time or the fiftieth whether a waiter or a board chairman the fortyeightyearold attorney who specialized in international law greeted that person with a shy smile that conveyed warmth the warmth and the modesty were accepted readily until one looked into grinells eyes it was not that they were cold for they were not yet neither were they particularly friendly they were expressionless neutral the eyes of a cautiously curious cat ardis my dear ardis said the lawyer walking into the foyer and holding the widow gently patting her shoulder as one might console a faintly disagreeable aunt who had lost a far more agreeable husband what can i say what can anyone say such a loss for us all but how much more so for you it was sudden cray too sudden of course it was but we must all look for something positive in our sorrows mustnt we you and he were spared a prolonged and agonizing illness since the end must come its better if its quick isnt it i suppose youre right thank you for reminding me not at all disengaging himself grinell looked over at sundstrom who was standing in the large sunken living room eric how good to see you he said solemnly walking across the foyer and down the marble steps to shake hands with the scientist somehow its right that we both should be with ardis at a time like this incidentally my men are outside in the hallway fucking bitch sundstrom mouthed the words his breath a whisper as the grieving mrs vanvlanderen closed the door the sound of the closing and the noise of her heels on the marble covering the mumble uttered by her former lover would you care for a drink cray oh no thank you i think i will said ardis heading for the bar i think you should agreed the attorney is there anything i can do at the legal end here or with arrangements anything at all i imagine youll be doing it the legal things i mean andyboy had lawyers all over the place but i gathered you were his main man yes i was and weve all been in touch during the day new york washington london paris marseilles oslo stockholm bern zurich west berlinim handling everything personally of course the widow stood motionless a decanter halfway to her glass staring at grinell when i said all over the place i didnt think that far all over the place his interests were extensive zurich said ardis as if the name of the city had slipped out unintentionally its in switzerland broke in sundstrom harshly and lets cut the crap eric really dont eric really me cray that bullheaded horses ass did it he contracted the palestinians and paid them out of zurich remember zurich sweetie i told you in baltimore cray he did it i couldnt get a confirmation on the assaults in fairfax or colorado said grinell calmly because they never happened yelled the widow her right hand trembling as she poured a drink from the heavy crystal decanter i didnt say that ardis objected the lawyer softly i merely said i couldnt get a confirmation however i did get a later call no doubt placed by a wellpaid drunk who was handed a phone after the number was dialled thus eliminating the identity of the source the words he obviously repeated are all too familiar theyre following the money he said oh jesus exclaimed mrs vanvlanderen so now we have two crises continued grinell walking to a white marble telephone on a redlined marble table against the wall our weak ubiquitous secretary of state is on his way to cyprus to sign an agreement that could cripple the defence industry and one of our own is linked to palestinian terrorists in a way i wish to heaven i knew how andrew did it we may be far clumsier he dialled as the widow and the scientist watched the switch from design six to design twelve mediterranean is confirmed said the attorney into the phone and prepare the medical unit if you will please the icarus agenda chapter varak raced around the corner to the service entrance and took the freight elevator up to his floor he then walked rapidly to his rooms unlocked the door and rushed to the sophisticated vertical recording equipment against the wall somewhat startled to see that so much tape had been used he ascribed it to various telephone calls received by ardis vanvlanderen he flipped the switch that allowed dual transmission tape and direct audio put on the earphones and sat down to listen she left about an hour and a half ago she who a woman named rashad a counter terrorist expert shes with a crossover unit the czech glanced at the spool of exposed tape there were at least twentyfive minutes of recorded conversation on it what was the former operations officer from egypt doing in san diego it made no sense to milos she had resigned from the agency he had confirmed it the quiet but official word out of cairo and washington was that she had been open to compromise he had assumed it was the oman operation and entirely accepted her vanishing she had to fadebut she had not he listened further to the conversation taking place in the vanvlanderen suite sundstrom was speaking he did it didnt he ardis that financial megalomaniac couldnt stand the possibility that a small group of benevolent misfits might replace his man with another who could cut off his pipeline to millions and probably would then ardis vanvlanderen eight hundred million thats what he said eight hundred million for him alone billions for all the rest of you i didnt know a thing varak was stunned he had made two enormous errors the first concerned the covert activities of adrienne khalehla rashad and difficult as it was for him to accept this error he could do so for she was an experienced intelligence officer the second he could not accept the false scenario he had presented to inver brass had been true it had never occurred to him that andrew vanvlanderen would act independently of his wife how could he theirs was a la rochefoucauld marriage one of convenience of mutual benefit certainly not of affection to say nothing of love andyboy had broken the rules a bull in financial heat had crashed open the gates of his corral and raced into the slaughterhouse varak listened another voice another name a man named crayton grinell the tape rolled as the czech concentrated on the words being spoken finally so now we have two crises our weak ubiquitous secretary of state is on his way to cyprus to sign an agreement that could cripple the defence industry the switch from design six to design twelve mediterranean is confirmed varak tore off the earphones whatever remained to be heard in the vanvlanderen suite would be recorded he had to move quickly he got out of the chair and rushed across the room to the telephone he picked it up and pressed the numbers for cynwid hollow maryland yes sir its varak what is it milos what have you learned its sundstrom what that can wait dr winters something else cannot the secretary of state is flying to cyprus can you find out when i dont have to find out i know so does everyone else who watches television or listens to the radio its quite a breakthrough when sir he left london about an hour ago there was the usual statement about bringing the world closer to peace and that sort of thing in the mediterranean interrupted varak controlling his voice it will happen in the mediterranean what will i dont know a strategy called design twelve thats all i heard it will happen on the ground or in the air they want to stop him who does the contributors a man named grinell crayton grinell if i tried to break in and find out they might take me there are men outside the door and i cannot jeopardize the group i certainly would never willingly disclose information but there are drugs yes i know reach frank swann at the state department tell the switchboard to raise him wherever he is and use the phrase crisis containment why swann hes a specialist sir he ran the oman operation for state yes i know that but i might have to tell him more than i care to there may be a better way milos stay on the line im going to put you on hold each ten seconds that went by seemed like minutes to varak then they were minutes what was winters doing they did not have minutes to waste finally the spokesman for inver brass was back on the phone im going to switch us to a conference call milos another will be joining us but its understood that neither of you is required to identify yourself i trust this man completely and he accepts the condition hes also in what you term crisis containment and has far greater resources than swann there were two clicks over the line and winters continued go ahead gentlemen mr a this is mr b i understand you have something to tell me mr a yes i do replied varak the circumstances are not relevant but the information is verified the secretary of state is in imminent danger there are people who do not want him to attend the conference in cyprus and they intend to stop him theyre employing a plan or a tactic called design twelve mediterranean the individual who gave the order is named grinell a crayton grinell of san diego i know nothing about him i see let me phrase this as delicately as i can mr a are you in a position to tell us the current whereabouts of this grinell i have no choice mr b the westlake hotel suite c i have no idea how long hell be there hurry and send firepower hes guarded will you do me the courtesy mr a of remaining on the line for a moment or two so you can trace this leg of the call i wouldnt do that ive given my word hell keep it interrupted samuel winters its difficult for me said the czech ill be quick a single click was heard and winters spoke you really didnt have a choice milos the secretary is the sanest man in the administration im aware of that sir i cant get over sundstrom why no doubt a combination of reasons not least of which are his patents in space technology others may build the hardware but the government is the primary buyer space is now synonymous with defence he cant want more money he gives most of it away but if the market slows down so does production and therefore the experimentationthe last is a passion with him another click im back mr a said the third party everyones alerted over in the mediterranean and arrangements have been made to pick up grinell in san diego as quietly as possible of course why was it necessary for me to remain on the phone because quite frankly if i hadnt been able to make the arrangements in san diego said mitchell payton i was going to appeal to your patriotism for further assistance youre obviously an experienced man what kind of assistance nothing that would compromise our understanding with regard to this call only to follow grinell should he leave the hotel and call our gobetween with the information what made you think im in a position to do that i didnt i could only hope and there were several things to do quickly mainly the mediterranean for your information im not in such a position lied varak im nowhere near the hotel then i may have made two mistakes i mentioned patriotism but by the way you speak this may not be your country it is my country now said the czech then it owes you a great deal i must go varak hung up the phone and walked rapidly back to the tape machine he sat down and clamped the earphones over his head his eyes straying to the reel of tape it had stopped he listened nothing silence in desperation he snapped a succession of switches up and down and left and right there was no response with any of them no sound the voiceactivated recorder was not functioning because the vanvlanderen suite was empty he had to move above everything he had to find sundstrom for the sake of inver brass the traitor had to be killed khalehla walked down the wide corridor towards the elevators she had called mj and after discussing the horror of mesa verde played him the entire conversation with ardis vanvlanderen that she had recorded on the miniaturized equipment concealed in her black notebook both were satisfied the grieving widow had left her grief behind in a sea of hysteria it was apparent to both of them that mrs vanvlanderen had known nothing about her dead husbands contract with the terrorists but had learned about it after the fact the sudden appearance of an intelligence officer from cairo with the upsidedown information she carried had been enough to send ardis the manipulator right through the roof of her skull uncle mitch had been true to form take five field officer rashad id like to take a shower and have a quiet meal i dont think ive eaten since the bahamas order room service well stand for one of your outrageous bills youve earned it i hate room service all those waiters who deliver food for a single female preen as though theyre the answer to her sexual fantasies if i cant have one of my grandmothers meals you cant okay then i know a few good restaurants go ahead by midnight ill have a list of every telephone number our distraught widow has called eat well my dear get energy you may be working all night youre too generous may i call evan who with any luck could be my intended you may but you wont get him colorado springs sent a jet to take him and emmanuel to the hospital in denver theyre airborne thanks again youre welcome rashad youre too kind sir khalehla pressed the button for the elevator hearing the rumble in her stomach she had not eaten since the meal on the air force jet and that had been somewhat destroyed by the nervous enzymes produced by evans conditionthe vomiting and all it signified dear evan brilliant evan dumb evan the risktaker with more morals than suited his approach to life she wondered briefly if he would have that same integrity if he had failed it was an open question he was a compulsively competitive man who looked somewhat arrogantly down from his perch of not having failed and it was not hard to understand how he had fallen under the spell or shell of ardis montreaux in saudi arabia ten or twelve years ago that girl must have been something a flashy lady on a fast track with a face and a body to go with the course yet he had fled from the spiderthat was her evan she heard the ping of the bell and the elevator doors parted happily it was empty she stepped inside and pressed the button for the lobby the panels closed and the machine started its descent only to slow down immediately she looked up at the lighted numbers over the doors the elevator was stopping at the third floor it was simply a coincidence she thought mj was sure that ardis vanvlanderen proprietor of suite c would not dare leave the hotel the doors opened and while her eyes remained disinterestedly straight ahead khalehla was relieved to peripherally see that the passenger was a lone man with lightcoloured hair and what appeared to be immense shoulders that filled out his jacket to the point of almost stretching the fabric yet there was something strange about him she thought as one can when alone with a single human being in a small enclosure she could sense a high level of energy emanating from her unknown companion there was an atmosphere of anger or anxiety that seemed to permeate the small area then she could feel him looking at her not the way men usually appraised herfurtively with glances she was used to thatbut staring at her the unseen eyes steady intense unwavering the doors closed as she casually grimaced to herself it was the expression of someone who may have forgotten something again casually she opened her bag as if to check for the possibly missing item she exhaled audibly her face relaxed the item was there it was her gun the elevator began its descent as she glanced at the stranger she froze his eyes were two orbs of controlled white heat and the short neatly combed hair was light blond he could be no one else the blond european he was one of them khalehla lurched for the panel as she yanked out her automatic dropping her bag and pressing the emergency button beyond the doors the alarm sounded as the elevator jerked to a stop and the blond man stepped forward khalehla fired the explosion deafening in the tight enclosure the bullet passing over the intense strangers head as it was meant to stop where you are she commanded if you know anything about me you know my next shot will go right into your forehead you are the rashad woman said the blond man his speech accented his voice strained i dont know who you are but i know what you are scumrotten thats what you are evan was right all these months all the stories about him the congressional committees the coverage over the world it was to set him up for a palestinian kill it was as simple as that no you are wrong wrong protested the european as the alarm bell outside kept up its abrasive ringing and you must not stop me now a terrible thing is about to happen and ive been in touch with your people in washington who who in washington we dont give names bullshit please miss rashad a man is getting away not you blondie where the blows came from and how they were delivered with such speed khalehla would never know for an instant there had been a blurring motion on her left then a surging hand as fast as any human hand she had ever seen stung her right arm followed by a counterclockwise twist of her right wrist wrenching the weapon away where she might have expected her wrist to be broken it merely burned as if briefly scalded by a splash of boiling water the european stood in front of her holding the gun i did not mean to harm you he said youre very good scumrotten ill give you that we are not enemies miss rashad somehow i find that hard to believe the elevator telephone rang from the box below the panel its bell echoing off the four walls of the small enclosure youre not getting out of here added khalehla wait said the blond man as the ringing persisted you saw mrs vanvlanderen she told you that so what she couldnt have broke in the european ive never met her but i have taped her she had visitors later they talked about youshe and two other men one named grinell i never heard of him theyre both traitors enemies of your government of your country to be precise as your country was conceived the telephone kept up its insistent ringing fast words mr no name no more words cried the blond man reaching under his jacket and withdrawing a thin large black automatic he flipped both weapons around gripping the barrels the handles extended towards khalehla here take them give me a chance miss rashad astonished khalehla held the guns and looked into the eyes of the european she had seen that plea in too many eyes before it was not the look of a man afraid to die for a cause but furious about the prospect of not living to pursue it all right she said slowly i may or i may not turn around your arms against the wall farther back your weight on your hands the telephone was now a steady deafening ring as the field officer from cairo expertly ran her fingers over the body of the blond man concentrating on the armpits the indented shell of his waist and his ankles there were no weapons on him stay there she ordered as she reached down and pulled out the telephone from the box we couldnt open the panel for the phone she exclaimed our engineer is on his way madam he was on his dinner break but weve just located him we apologize profusely however our indicators show no fire or i think were the ones to apologize interrupted khalehla it was all a mistakemy mistake i pushed the wrong button if youll just tell me how to make it work again well be fine oh yes yes of course said the male voice suppressing his irritation in the telephone box theres a switch the lobby doors opened and the european immediately spoke to the formally dressed manager who was waiting for them there is a business associate i was to meet here quite some time ago im afraid i overslepta long trying flight from paris his name is grinell have you seen him mr grinell and the distraught mrs vanvlanderen left a few minutes ago with their guests sir i assume it was a memorial service for her husband a fine fine gentleman yes he too was an associate we were to be at the service but we never got the address do you know it oh no sir would anybody would the doorman have heard any instructions to a taxi mr grinell has his own limousinelimousines actually lets go said khalehla quietly taking the blond mans arm youre becoming a little obvious she continued as they walked towards the front entrance i may have failed which is far more important whats your name milos just call me milos i want more than that ive got the fire remember if we can reach an acceptable accommodation ill tell you more youre going to tell me one hell of a lot more mr milos and there wont be any more of those fast manoeuvres of yours your gun is in my bag and mine is under my coat aimed at your chest what do we do now miss supposedly retired central intelligence officer from egypt we eat you nosy bastard im starved but ill pick up every morsel of food with my left hand if you make a wrong move across the table youll never be able to have children and not just because youre dead am i clear you must be very good good enough mr milos good enough im half arab and dont you forget it they sat opposite each other in a large circular booth selected by khalehla in an italian restaurant two blocks north of the hotel varak had detailed everything he had heard over the earphones from the vanvlanderen suite i was shocked i never thought for an instant that andrew vanvlanderen would act unilaterally you mean without his wife putting a bullet in his head and calling one of the others to deep six him in mexico exactly she would have done it you know he was stupid i disagree he was very bright considering his purpose everything that was done to and for evan kendrick led to a logical jaremat thaár arabic for a vengeance kill you provided that mr milos starting with the first moment you met frank swann at the state department never with that intention i assure you i never thought it was remotely possible you were wrong i was wrong lets go back to that first momentin fact lets go back over the whole damn thing theres nothing to go back over ive said nothing of substance but we know far more than you think we just had to unravel the string as my superior put it a reluctant freshman congressman is manipulated on to important congressional committees positions that others would sell their daughters for then because of mysteriously absentee chairmen hes on national television which leads to more exposure topped by the explosive worldwide story about his covert actions in oman and ending up with the president awarding him the highest medal a civilian can get the agenda is pretty clear isnt it it was organized quite well in my opinion and now theres about to be launched a national campaign to place him on the party ticket in effect making him the next vice president of the united states you know about that yes and its hardly a spontaneous act on the part of the body politic i trust it will appear so where are you coming from asked khalehla leaning over picking at her veal dish with the left hand her right out of sight under the table i must tell you miss rashad that it pains me to watch you eating so awkwardly im not a threat to you and i wont run how can i be sure of either that youre not a threat and that you wont run because in certain areas our interests are the same and i am willing to work with you on a limited basis my god what arrogance would your eminence be so kind as to describe these areas and the limits of your generous assistance certainly to begin with the safety of the secretary of state and exposing those who would have him killed as well as discovering why although i think we can assume the reason then the capture of the terrorists who attacked congressman kendricks houses with considerable loss of life and confirming the vanvlanderen connection you know about fairfax and mesa verde varak nodded the blackouts total which brings us to the limits of my participation i must remain far in the background and will not discuss my activities except in the most general terms i will however if its necessary refer you by code name to certain individuals in the government who will attest to my dependability in security matters here and abroad you dont think much of yourself do you milos smiled cautiously i really dont have an opinion however i come from a country whose government was stolen from the people and made up my mind years ago what i would do with my life i have confidence in the methods ive developed if thats arrogance so be it and i apologize but i dont think of it that way khalehla slowly pulled her right hand out from under the table and with her left picked up the bag at her side she shoved her automatic into it and leaned back shaking her hand to restore circulation i think we can dispense with the hardware and youre right its terribly awkward trying to cut meat with a lefthanded fork while your other wrist is paralysed i was going to suggest that you order something simpler perhaps an antipasto or a dish you might eat with your fingers but i didnt feel it was my place do i detect a sense of humour behind that severe expression an attempt perhaps but i dont feel very humorous at the moment i wont until i know the secretary of state has arrived safely in cyprus you alerted the proper people theres nothing more you can do theyll take care of him im counting on it then to business mr milos said khalehla returning to her meal again slowly her eyes on varak why kendrick why did you do it above all how did you do it you tapped into sources that were supposedly untappable you went in where no one should be able to go and ripped out secrets stole a theft proof file whoever gave you those should be taken out and put in the field so hed know what its like to have no protection to be naked without weapons in the dark streets of a hostile city whatever assistance was given to me was rendered by a source who trusted me who knew where i was coming from as you phrased it but why ill give you a limited response miss rashad and speak only in general terms hoorah for you so give this country imperatively needs changes in an administration that will undoubtedly be reelected who says so other than the voters off limits except again in general terms although i shouldnt have to use even them youve seen for yourself khalehla put down her fork and looked at the european san diego vanvlanderen grinell san diego vanvlanderen and grinell repeated the czech quietly to clarify further moneys obviously sent through zurich and beirut to the baaka valley for the purpose of eliminating a political contender namely congressman kendrick and now an apparent attempt to stop a brilliant secretary of state from attending a disarmament conference whose purpose is to reduce the proliferationthe production of space and nuclear weapons san diego said khalehla leaving her food on the plate orson bollinger an enigma replied varak what does he know what doesnt he know no matter hes the rallying point the funnel into an unbeatable administration he has to be replaced thus eliminating the people around him who order him to march to their drums but why evan kendrick because he is now an unbeatable contender hell never accept it hell tell you to go to hell you dont know him i do a man doesnt necessarily want to do what he must do miss rashad but he will do it if the reasons are made clear to him why he should you think thats enough i dont know mr kendrick personally of course but i dont think theres another human being ive studied so closely hes a remarkable man yet so realistically modest about his achievements he made a great deal of money out of an exploding middle east economy then walked away from millions more because he was morally offended and emotionally distraught he then entered the political arena for no other reason than to replace awhat did you call me scumrotten who was lining his pockets in colorado finally he went to oman knowing he might not come back for he believed he could help in a crisis thats not a man you take lightly he may but you dont oh good lord said khalehla im hearing a variation of my own words in support of his political advancement no to explain why he wasnt a liar but i should tell you theres another reason why he went back to oman it falls under the not too benevolent heading of a kill he was convinced he knew who was behind the terrorists in masqat the same monster whod been responsible for killing all seventyeight people who made up the kendrick group including wives and children he was right the man was executed according to arabic law thats hardly a negative miss rashad no it isnt but it somewhat alters the circumstances id prefer to think it adds a dimension of properlysought justice which further confirms our choice of him our off limits i repeat hell turn it down he will if he learns how he was manipulated he may not if hes convinced he is needed khalehla again leaned back in the booth studying the czech if im hearing correctly youre suggesting something thats deeply offensive to me it shouldnt be varak sat forward no one can force a man to accept elective office miss rashad he has to seek it conversely no one can force a political partys leading senators and congressmen to accept a new candidate they must want him its true that circumstances were created to bring out the man but we could not create the man he was there to begin with youre asking me not to tell him about this conversation not to tell him about you have you any idea how many weeks weve been looking for you have you any idea how many months we looked for evan kendrick i dont give a damn he was manipulated and he knows it you cant hide i wont let you youve put him through too much dear friends killed now possibly an old man whos been a father to him for fifteen years all his plans shot to helltoo much i cant change whats happened i can only grieve for my errors of judgment and no one will grieve more but i ask you to think of your country my country now if weve helped to produce a political force it was only because the force existed in his own right with his own instincts without him any number of perfectly decent men will be acceptable to the party leadership because theyre familiar and comfortable but they will not be a force do i make myself clear according to history a vice president once said that the office wasnt worth a bucket of warm spit not these days and certainly not in the hands of evan kendrick you were obviously in cairo when he appeared on television here i was in cairo interrupted khalehla but we have an american channeltapes of course i saw him and ive seen him here subsequently and repeatedly thanks no doubt to your agenda he was very good very intelligent and appealing miss rashad hes unique hes unbuyable and he speaks his mind and the country is taken with him because of you no because of him hes done the things hes done they werent invented hes said the things hes said the words werent provided what can i tell you i analysed over four hundred possibilities using the most advanced computers and one man stood out evan kendrick you want nothing from him you say you know him if we did what do you think hed do turn you over to some anticorruption committee and make damn sure you spent time in prison exactly khalehla shook her head her eyes closed id like a glass of wine mr milos ive got a few things to think about varak signalled a waiter and ordered two glasses of chilled chablis leaving the choice to the waiters discretion among my many deficiencies said the czech is a lack of knowledge of wines beyond those of my country i dont believe that for an instant youre probably a certified sommelier hardly i hear friends order specific vineyards and vintages and i marvel at them do you really have friends i think of you as rather an eminence grise je comprends but youre wrong i live quite a normal life my friends think im a translator freelance naturally at home bien said the agent from cairo thats how i began theres no office to contact only an answering machine which i can reach from wherever i am me too the wine arrived and after sipping khalehla spoke he cant go back she said as if speaking to herself then partially including varak at least not for a few years if then once the blackouts lifted therell be a lot of hot blood running in the baaka valley i assume youre talking about the congressman yes the terrorists were caught in a manner of speaking there was a third and final attack several hours ago it took place in mesa verde and was every bit as devastating as fairfax several hours was kendrick there yes and hes alive im told by seconds but like virginia many of our personnel were killed im sorry weingrass was severely hurt i gather thats whom you were referring to when you mentioned an old man wasnt it yes theyre flying him to a hospital in denver evans with him the terrorists please said varak his eyes boring into hers all together there were nine of them eight are dead one survived the youngest and when the blackouts lifted as you say there will be hot blood in the baaka its why kendrick cant go back to that part of the world he wouldnt live fortyeight hours theres no way to protect him from the crazies there is here and none better than the governments secret service in these matters nothing is perfect there is only the best i know khalehla drank from her glass of wine you understand what im saying dont you miss rashad i think so let events run their natural course theres a legitimate political action committee dedicated to supporting congressman kendrick for higher office let them work unencumbered and let the country respondone way or the other and if were both right about the vanvlanderens and the grinells and the people they represent let evan kendrick make up his own mind because even if we expose them and stop them there are hundreds more who will take their places a force is needed a voice is needed khalehla raised her eyes from the wine she nodded twice the icarus agenda chapter kendrick walked along denvers seventeenth street towards the brown palace hotel barely aware of the light snow that was floating down from the night sky he had told the cabdriver to let him off several blocks away he wanted to walk he had to clear his mind the doctors at the denver general had patched manny up relieving evan by explaining that the wounds although messy consisted mainly of embedded fragments of glass and metal the loss of blood was considerable for a man of his age but not critical it would be replaced the bewilderment started when kendrick took one of the doctors aside and told him about weingrasss concern that the cancer had returned within twenty minutes all of mannys tests had been electronically transmitted from washington and the chief oncologist had spoken to the dc surgeon who had operated on the old architect then about two hours into his fourhour stay at the hospital a technician had arrived from some laboratory or other and conferred quietly with another doctor there had been a mild flurry of activity and evan was asked to leave the room while various samples were taken from mannys body an hour after that the chief of pathology a thin man with inquisitive eyes approached kendrick in the waiting room congressman has mr weingrass been out of the country recently not within the past year no where was that france southwest asia the doctors eyebrows had arched my geographys not very good where is southwest asia is this necessary yes it is oman and bahrain he was with you excuse me but your exploits are common knowledge he was with me answered evan hes one of the people i couldnt thank publicly because it wouldnt be in his interest i understand we have no press office here thank you why do you ask unless im mistaken and i could be hes infected with alets say a virusthat to the best of my knowledge is indigenous to central africa that couldnt be then perhaps im wrong our equipment is among the finest in the west but theres better im having lung tissue and blood samples sent to the cdc in atlanta the what centers for disease control disease its just a precaution mr kendrick have them flown there tonight doctor therell be a jet waiting at stapleton airport within the hour tell atlanta to go to work the minute your findings arriveill pay whatever the cost even if they have to stay there around the clock ill do what i can if it would help said evan not sure whether he was bluffing or not ill have the white house call them i dont think that will be necessary said the pathologist as he left the hospital having said good night to a heavily sedated manny he remembered the vanished dr lyons of mesa verde the physician without an address or a telephone but with full government clearance to be presented to a congressman andor his staff what clearance why was clearance necessary or was it simply a very impressive document a device for slipping into the private world of one evan kendrick he decided to say nothing to anyone khalehla would know better what to do he approached the brown palace and was suddenly aware through the falling snow of the coloured lights on the christmas decorations extending across the wide avenue from the old classic structure to the new south tower then he heard the strains of a carol filling the street deck the halls with boughs of holly falalalala lalalala merry christmas from the legacy of masqat he thought where the hell have you been shouted mj payton causing khalehla to hold the telephone away from her ear having dinner hes there our blond european is in the hotel i know i had dinner with him you what as a matter of fact hes here in my room now were going over what we know hes not what we thought damn you adrienne tell that son of a bitch mr b would like to talk to mr a good god you were the one cap it rashad put him on the line im not sure hell agree the agent from cairo again had to pull the phone away she turned to varak a mr b would like to talk to mr a i should have known said the czech getting out of the chair he walked to the bedside telephone as khalehla relinquished it and moved away greetings again mr b nothing has changed you understand no names no identities what does my niece call you mind you shes my niece she calls me by the erroneous name of milos meelos slavic american sir i forgot you made that clear the secretary of state please hes arrived in cyprus im relieved we all are if indeed there was cause for alarm to begin with the information was accurate unfortunately we havent been able to confirm it at our end grinell wasnt at the hotel and he hasnt shown up at his residence hes with the vanvlanderen woman yes we know according to a desk clerk there were several others with them both any ideas grinells guards according to the information i received i mentioned to you that there were men with him that you should be prepared yes you did do we work together from a distance what have you got to offer proof of certain things ive told miss rashad replied varak thinking of the edited tapes and transcripts he would give to the intelligence officeredited so that eric sundstrom would remain an anonymous conspirator a dead man did not need an identity perhaps nothing more but its the core of what you need it will be gratefully accepted however theres a price mr b i dont make payments of course you do broke in the czech you do so all the time what is it as long as my demands require a complicated explanation ill let miss rashad tell you in her own words ill reach her tomorrow and well communicate through her if your answer is positive i will arrange for the delivery of my material to you and if its not then id advise you to weigh the consequences mr b let me speak to my niece if you please as you wish varak turned to khalehla and handed her the telephone as he headed back to his chair im here said rashad just answer yes or no and if you cant answer stay silent for a second or two all right yes are you safe yes would his material help us yesemphatically just yes is sufficient agent rashad hes obviously staying at the hoteldo you think hell remain there no has he given you any information as to how he got the oman file no lastly can we live with his demands were going tosorry to break the rules i see said the astonished director of special projects you will explain that extraordinary and extraordinarily insubordinate statement to me wont you well talk later khalehla hung up the phone and turned to varak my superiors upset with you or with me it wasnt difficult to imagine the gist of his questions with both of us is he really your uncle ive known him for over twenty years and thats enough about him lets talk about you for a moment it wasnt difficult to imagine a couple of his questions to you either only a moment please insisted the czech i really must leave you told him that grinell was with the vanvlanderen woman and that the others were grinells guards i did yet you told me that there were two men in the vanvlanderen suite and that the guards were outside thats true who was that other man and why are you protecting him protecting i believe i also told you that they were both traitors youll hear that on the tapes read it on the transcripts ill deliver to you if your superior agrees to my conditions as you have agreed ill convince him then youll hear for yourself but you know him who is he varak got out of the chair his hands pressed in front of him again we are off limits miss rashad but ill tell you this much hes the reason i must leave hes human filth whatever words you care to use and hes mine ill scour this city all night until i find him and if i dont i know where i can find him tomorrow or the next day i repeat hes mine a jaremat thaár mr milos i do not speak arabic miss rashad but you know what it means ive told you good night said the czech going to the door my uncle wants to know how you got the oman file i dont think hell stop hunting you down until he finds out we all have our priorities said varak turning his hand on the knob right now his and yours are in san diego and mine are elsewhere tell him that he has nothing to fear from my source he would go to his grave before endangering one of your people one of our people goddamn you he already has evan kendrick the telephone rang they both whipped their heads around staring at it khalehla picked it up yes it happened cried payton in langley virginia oh my god they did it what is it the larnaca hotel in cyprus the west wing was blown up theres nothing left just debris the secretary of states dead theyre all dead the hotel in cyprus repeated khalehla looking at the czech her voice a frightened monotone it was blown up the secretarys dead theyre all dead give me that phone roared varak rushing across the room and grabbing it did no one check the cellars the air conditioning ducts the structural underpinnings the cypriot security forces claimed they checked everything cypriot security yelled the furious czech its riddled with a dozen hostile elements fools fools fools do you want my job mr a i wouldnt take it said varak controlling his anger lowering his voice i do not work with amateurs he added contemptuously hanging up and going to the door he turned and spoke to khalehla what was needed here today were the brains of kendrick of oman he would have been the first to tell all of you what to do what to look for and you probably would not have listened to him the czech opened the door let himself out and slammed it shut the telephone rang hes gone said rashad picking it up knowing instinctively who was on the line i offered him my job but he made it clear that he didnt work with amateurs strange isnt it a man without any credentials that we know about alerts us and we blow it and a year ago we send kendrick to oman and he does what five hundred professionals from at least six countries couldnt do it makes you wonder doesnt it im getting old no way mj cried the agent from cairo they happen to be bright guys and they hit jackpots thats all youve done more than theyll ever do id like to believe that but tonights pretty horrible for whatever ego ive got left which should be a bunch but its also a good moment for me to explain that insubordinate remark i made to you a few minutes ago please do im receptive im not even sure i have a hell of a lot of breath left whomever milos works for they want nothing from evan when i pressed him he pointed out the obvious if they made any demands on him hed throw them to the wolves and hes right evan would i also agree so what does he want to back off and let events take their course they want us to let the race go on evan wont run he may when he learns about the black knights who are running things in california say we stop them there are hundreds more waiting to take their places milos is right a voice is needed but what do you say niece i want him alive not dead he cant go back to the emirateshe may persuade himself that he can but hed be killed the moment he got off the plane and he cant vegetate in mesa verde not with his energy and imaginationthats a form of death too you know the country could do worse mj fools fools whispered varak to himself as he dialled while studying a diagram of the vanvlanderen suite in his hand there were small red xs marked in each room seconds later a voice was on the other end of the line yes sound man prague i need you i can always use your money you roll high pick me up in thirty minutes the service entrance ill explain what i want you to do on the way to your studio there are no changes in the diagram no you found the key thank you for both you paid thirty minutes the czech hung up the phone and looked at the packed recording equipment in front of the door he had listened to rashads interview with ardis vanvlanderen and despite his anger over the tragedy of the secretary of states death he had smiledgrimly to be sureat the bold strategy employed by the field agent from cairo and her superior based on what they had learned they had gambled on the presumed truth of andrew vanvlanderens actions and turned it into an irresistible lie palestinian hit teams the target bollinger kendrick never even mentioned brilliant the appearance of eric sundstrom within two hours of rashads astonishing convoluted informationan appearance designed to trap a traitor of inver brass and not based on any presumption of vanvlanderens guilthad completed a detonation that blew apart the cemented structure of deceit in san diego one took things where one could find them varak went to the door opened it cautiously and slipped out into the corridor he walked rapidly to the vanvlanderen suite down the hall and with the key provided by the sound man let himself inside the diagram still in his hand with swift catlike strides he went from room to room removing the tiny electronic intercepts from their recessesunder tables and chairs secreted beneath the deep cushions of the sofa behind mirrors in the four bedrooms under the medicine cabinets in the various bathrooms and inside two burners in the kitchen he left the widows office for last counting the red xs satisfied that he had collected every tap so far the office was dark he found the desk lamp and switched it on ten seconds later he pocketed the four intercepts three from the office itself one from the small attached bathroom and concentrated on the desk he looked at his watch the dismantling operation had taken nine minutes leaving him at least fifteen to examine mrs vanvlanderens domestic inner sanctum he started with the desk drawers pulling one out after another riffling through meaningless papers devoted to vice presidential triviaschedules letters from individuals and institutions deemed worthy of answering some day position papers from the white house state defense and various other administrative agencies that had to be studied so they could be explained to orson bollinger there was nothing of value nothing at all related to the subterranean manipulations taking place in southern california he looked around the large panelled office at the bookshelves the graceful furniture and the framed photographs on the walls photographs there were over twenty of them scattered about the dark panelling in crisscrossing patterns he walked over and began examining them snapping on a table lamp for better light they were the usual collection of selfaggrandizing pictures showing mr and mrs andrew vanvlanderen in the company of political heavyweights from the president down through the upper ranks of the administration and congress then on the adjacent wall were photographs of the widow herself without her late husband judging from appearances these were obviously from ardis vanvlanderens past a personal testimonial that made clear her past was not inconsequential expensive cars yachts ski slopes and luxurious furs predominated varak was about to abandon the panoply of conceit when his eyes fell on an enlarged candid shot obviously taken in lausanne switzerland lake genevas northern leman marina in the background milos studied the face of the darkskinned man standing beside the effervescent centre of attraction he knew that face but he could not place it then as if following a scent the czechs eyes roamed down to the lower right to another enlarged snapshot also taken in lausanne this in the gardens of the beau rivage there was the same man againwho was he and next to it yet another now in amsterdam in the rozengracht the same two subjects who was that man concentrate images came fragments of elusive impressions but no name riyadh medina saudi arabia a shocked and furious saudi family a scheduled execution then an escape millions upon millions had been involved eight to ten years ago who was he varak considered taking one of the photographs then instinctively knew he should not whoever the man was he represented another telling aspect of the machine built around orson bollinger a missing photograph of that face might send out alarms milos turned off the table lamp and started back towards the desk it was time to leave to get his equipment and meet the sound man down in the street outside the service entrance he reached for the domeshaped lamp on the desk when suddenly he heard the door opening in the foyer swiftly he turned off the light and moved to the office door partially closing it so he could slip behind and watch through the space of the hinged panel the tall figure came into view a lone man walking confidently into familiar surroundings varak frowned for an instant he had not thought about the intruder for weeks it was the redhaired fbi agent from mesa verde a member of the unit assigned to the vice president at the request of ardis vanvlanderenthe man who had led him to san diego milos was momentarily bewildered but only momentarily the unit had been recalled to washington yet one player had remained behindmore accurately one had been bought before varak had found him in mesa verde the czech watched as the redheaded man walked around the living room as if looking for something he picked up a glass from beneath an ivoryshelled lamp on a table to the left of the couch then went through a door leading to the kitchen he returned moments later with a spray can in one hand a dishtowel in the other he crossed to the bar where he picked up each bottle separately spraying each and wiping it clean he next sprayed the copper rim of the bar top and rubbed it thoroughly with the cloth from the bar he proceeded to go to every solid piece of furniture in the sunken living room and repeated the cleaning process as if he were purifying the premises what he was doing was apparent to varak the agent was eliminating the forensic presence of eric sundstrom removing the scientists fingerprints from the area the man put down the spray can and the towel on the coffee table then casually started across the room towards the office the czech spun silently out from behind the partially closed door and raced into the small bathroom closing its door now more than partially leaving barely an inch between the edge and the frame as milos had done the fbi agent turned on the desk lamp sat down in the chair and opened the lower righthand drawer however he did something that varak had not done he pressed an unseen button instantly the vertical moulding of the desk shot out jesus christ said the redhaired man to himself his stunned cry a whisper as he peered into an obviously empty recess without wasting motion he reached for the telephone on the desk almost ripping it out and dialling within seconds he spoke its not here he cried no im certain he added after a pause theres nothing what do you want from me i followed your instructions and im telling you theres not a goddamned thing what down the street from your house all right ill get on it and call you back the agent depressed the telephone plate released it and dialled eleven digits long distance base five this is blackbird special assignment san diego code sixsixzero confirm please thank you do we have vehicles in la jolla i dont know about we dont no nothing urgent probably the press they must have found out the vp is going to an art show soireeyou got that soireewith the fruitcake crowd he wouldnt know a rembrandt from al capp but hes got to fake it ill check it out forget it again the lanky redhaired man hung up and redialled theres nothing from our side he said quietly almost immediately no theres no law that says we have to be told cia wed be the last to know okay ill call the airport do you want me to reach your pilot whatever you say then im getting out of here the agency and the bureau dont mix we never have the fbi man hung up as varak stepped out of the dark bathroom his thin black automatic in his hand youre not getting out of here that fast said the coordinator of inver brass christ screamed the redheaded agent lunging out of the chair and hurling himself at varak in the doorway gripping the czechs right wrist with the strength of a panicked animal propelling milos back into the wall above the toilet crashing varaks head into the tastefully papered plasterboard the czech straddled the lavatory basin in the dark bathroom whipping his left leg around the mans torso and levering it while yanking his right hand and gun straight up half tearing the agents left arm out of its socket it was over the man collapsed on the floor gripping his damaged arm as if it were broken get up said varak the weapon at his side not bothering to level it at his prisoner the redhaired man struggled wincing while he pulled himself up by the rim of the marble wash basin go back in there and sit down ordered milos shoving the agent through the door to the desk who the hell are you asked the man breathlessly plummeting into the chair still holding his arm weve met but you wouldnt know about it a country road in mesa verde west of a certain congressmans house that was you the agent shot forward only to be pushed back by varak when did you sell out federal man the agent studied milos in the wash of the desk lamp if youre some kind of naturalized spook from a crossover unit youd better get one thing straight im here on special assignment to the vice president a crossover unit i see youve been talking to some very excitable people there is no crossover unit and those vehicles around grinells house were dispatched from washington they werent i just checked perhaps the bureau wasnt informed or perhaps you were lied to it doesnt matter like all privileged soldiers from elite organizations im sure you can claim that you were merely following orders as in removing fingerprints and searching for hidden documents of which you know nothing i dont but you did sell out and thats all that matters to me you were prepared to accept money and privileges for services rendered under your official status are you also prepared to lose your life for these people what now you get this straight said varak quietly raising his automatic and suddenly pressing it into the agents forehead whether you live or die means absolutely nothing to me but theres a man i must find tonight you dont know grinell grinell is immaterial to me leave him to others the man i want is the one whose fingerprints you so carefully removed from this apartment youll tell me where he is right now or your brains will be all over this desk and i will not bother to clean them up the scene will add a further convincing nuance of evil consistent with everything thats taking place out here where is he his entire body trembling his breath short the redhaired man spat out the words rapidly i dont know and im not lying i was ordered to meet them on a side street near the beach in coronado i swear i dont know where they were going you just called its a cellular phone hes mobile who was in coronado just grinell and this other guy who told me where he walked and everything he touched here in vanvlanderens place where was she i dont know maybe she was sick or had an accident there was an ambulance across the road from grinells limo but you do know where theyre going you were about to call the airport what were your instructions to have maintenance get the plane ready for takeoff in an hour where is the plane san diego international the private strip south of the main runways whats the destination thats between grinell and his pilot he never tells anyone you offered to call the pilot whats his number christ i dont know if grinell wanted me to call him he would have told me he didnt give me the cellular number the agent did and the czech committed it to memory youre certain its accurate go ahead and try it varak pulled the gun away and replaced it in his shoulder holster i heard a term tonight that fits you federal man scumrotten thats what you are but as i said youre of no consequence to me so im going to let you go perhaps you can start building your defences as the obedient soldier betrayed by his superiors or perhaps youd be better off heading to mexico and points south i dont know and i dont care but if you call that mobile phone youre a dead man do you understand that i just want to get out of here said the agent bolting out of the chair and running into the sunken living room towards the marble steps and the foyer door so do i whispered milos to himself he looked at his watch he was late for the sound man downstairs no matter he thought the man was quick and would quickly grasp what he wanted from the tapes and the transcripts then he would borrow the sound mans car and park it in the lot at san diegos international airport there on a private strip south of the main runways he would find the traitor of inver brass he would find him and kill him the telephone rang jarring kendrick out of a fitful sleep disoriented his eyes centered on a hotel window and the heavy snow whirling in circles in the winds beyond the glass the phone rang again blinking he found the source turned on the bedside lamp and picked it up glancing at his watch as he did so it was fivetwenty in the morning khalehla yes hello atlanta stayed up all night said the hospitals chief of pathology they just called me and i thought youd want to know thank you doctor you may not care to all the tests are positive im afraid cancer asked evan swallowing no i could give you the medical term but it wouldnt mean anything to you you could call it a form of salmonella a strain of virus that attacks the lungs clotting the blood until it closes off the oxygen i can understand why on the surface mr weingrass thought it was the cancer its not but thats no gift the cure said kendrick gripping the phone after a brief silence the pathologist replied quietly none known its irreversible in the african kasai districts they slaughter the cattle and burn them raze whole villages and burn them too i dont give a goddamn about cattle and african villages im sorry i dont mean to yell at you its perfectly all right it goes with the job i looked on the map he must have eaten in an omani restaurant that served central african food for imported labourers perhaps unclean dishes that sort of thing its the way its transmitted you dont know emmanuel weingrass those are the last places hed eat no doctor it wasnt transmitted it was planted i beg your pardon nothing how long has he got the cdc says it can vary a month to three perhaps four no more than six may i tell him it could stretch to a couple of years you can tell him anything you like but he may tell you otherwise his breathing isnt going to get any easier oxygen will have to be readily available it will be thank you doctor im sorry mr kendrick evan got out of the bed and paced in growing anger about the room a phantom doctor unknown in mesa verde but not unknown to certain officials in the united states government a pleasant doctor who only wished to take a little blood and then disappeared suddenly evan shouted his cry hoarse the tears rolling down his face lyons where are you ill find you in frenzy he smashed his fist through the window nearest him shattering the glass so that the wind and the snow careened through the room the icarus agenda chapter varak approached the last of the maintenance hangars in the private area of san diegos international airport police and armed customs personnel in electric carts and on motorbikes drove continuously through the exposed narrow streets of the huge flat complex voices and static erupting sporadically from the vehicles radios the individual rich and the highly profitable corporations who were the areas clients might avoid the irritations of normal air travel but they could not avoid the scrutiny of federal and municipal agencies patrolling the sector each plane prepped for departure underwent not only the usual flight plan and route clearances but thorough inspections of the aircraft itself furthermore each person boarding was subject to the possibility of being searched almost as if he or she were a member of the unwashed some of the questionable rich did not really have it that good the czech had casually gone into the comfortable preflight lounge where the elite passengers waited in luxury before takeoff he inquired about the grinell plane and the attractive clerk behind the counter was far more cooperative than he had expected are you on the flight sir she had asked about to type his name into her computer no im only here to deliver some legal papers oh then i suggest you go down to hangar seven mr grinell rarely calls in here he goes straight to preclearance and then to the aircraft when its rolled out for inspection if you could direct me well have one of our carts drive you down id prefer to walk if you dont mind id like to stretch my legs suit yourself but stay in the street security here is touchy and there are all kinds of alarms ill run from streetlight to streetlight milos said smiling okay not a bad idea the girl replied last week a beverly hills hotshot got juiced in here and wanted to walk too he took a wrong turn and ended up in the san diego jail for simply walking well he had some funny pills on him i dont even have aspirin go outside turn right to the first street and right again its the last hangar on the edge of the strip mr grinell has the best location i wish hed come in here more often hes a very private person hes invisible thats what he is varak kept glancing around while nodding his head at the drivers of carts and lowslung motor scooters who approached him from both directions some slowing down others rushing past he saw what he wanted to see there were trip lights between the row of hangars on the right connecting beams from opposing short poles in the ground designed to look like demarcationsof what wondered the czech lawns between suburban houses of the future where neighbour feared neighbour on the left side of the street there was nothing but a vacant expanse of tall grass that bordered an auxiliary runway it would be his way out of the private field once his business was concluded the clerk at the preflight lounge had been accurate milos mused as he neared the immense open doors of the final hangar grinells plane was in the best location once cleared the aircraft could move out to the field through the opposite door take off subject only to control by the towerno minutes wasted during slow hours some of the rich had it better than he had thought two uniformed guards stood inside the hangar at the edge of the drive where the tarmac met the concrete floor of the interior beyond them a rockwell jet with men crawling over its silver wings stood immobile a metal bird soon to soar up into the night sky milos studied the guards uniforms they were neither federal nor municipal they were from a private security firm the realization gave birth to another thought as he noted that one of the men was quite large and very full in the waist and shoulders nothing was lost in trying he had reached his post for the kill but how much more satisfying it would be to execute a traitor at close range making certain of the execution varak walked casually down the asphalt towards the imposing entrance of the hangar both guards stepped forward one crushing out a cigarette under his foot whats your business here asked the large man on the czechs right business i think answered varak pleasantly rather confidential business i believe what does that mean said the shorter guard on the left youll have to ask mr grinell im afraid im merely a messenger and i was told to speak to only one person who should convey the information to mr grinell when he arrives more of that bullshit added the shorter patrol to his companion if you got papers or cash you gotta get em precleared they find somethin on the plane they dont know about it dont head out and mr grinell will explode you get me loud and clear my friend i have only words that must be repeated accurately do you get me so talk one person said varak and i choose him continued milos pointing at the large man hes dumb take me i was told whom to choose shit please come with me said the czech gesturing to the right behind the trip lights im to record our conversation but without anyone in earshot why dont you tell the boss himself objected the overlooked guard on the left hell be here in a couple of minutes because were never to meet face to faceanywhere would you care to ask him about it more bullshit once around the corner of the hangar varak raised his cupped left hand would you please speak directly into this he said again pleasantly sure mister they were the last words the guard would remember the czech sent the hard flat base of his right hand into the mans shoulder blade following the blow with three chops to his throat and a final twoknuckled assault on his upper eyelids the guard collapsed and varak swiftly began to remove his clothes a minute and twenty seconds later he was overdressed in the large mans private security uniform he cuffed the trouser legs and shoved up his sleeves pulling the uniform over his wrists he was ready forty seconds later a black limousine drove down the street and stopped at the base of the asphalt entrance to the hangar the czech moved out of the shadows and walked slowly into the chiaroscuro light a man emerged from the huge car and although milos had never seen him he knew that man was crayton grinell hi boss yelled the guard at the left of the hangar as the overcoated greyfaced figure walked quickly angrily across the tarmac we got your message bennys recording something why isnt the goddamned plane out on the strip roared grinell everythings cleared you idiots benny talked to them boss i didnt five ten minutes they told him it would have been different if i was on the phone shit i dont put up with no shit you know what i mean you shoulda told that guy to speak to me that benny shut up get my driver and tell him to move this son of a bitch out if they cant fly it he can sure boss anything you say boss as the guard started shouting to the driver the czech joined the rush of activity and began running towards the outsized car thanks cried the passing chauffeur seeing varaks uniform he goes on at the last minute milos raced around the boot of the car to the street side yanked open the back door and leaped inside to a jump seat he sat rigid staring at the puffed face of the astonished eric sundstrom hello professor he said softly it was a trapyou set a trap for me screamed the scientist in the dark shadows of the car but you dont know what youre doing varak were on the edge of a breakthrough in space so many wondrous things to learn we were wronginver brass is wrong we must go on even if we blow up half the planet dont be an ass cried sundstrom pleading nobodys going to blow up anything were civilized people on both sides civilized and frightened the more we build the more fear we instilthats the worlds ultimate protection dont you see you call that civilized i call it progress scientific progress you wouldnt understand but the more we build the more we learn through weapons of destruction weapons youre pitifully naive weapons is merely a label like fish or vegetables its the excuse we employ to fund scientific advancement on a scale that would be otherwise prohibitive the bigger bang for the buck theory is obsoletewe have all the bang well ever need its in the delivery systemsorbital guidance and hookups directional lasers that can be refracted in space to pinpoint a manhole cover from thousands of miles above and deliver a bomb only if someone tries to stop us answered the scientist his voice strained as if the mere prospect was enough to summon his fury then that fury broke his cherubic features suddenly turned into the grotesque components of some monstrous gargoyle research research research he cried his strident speech like the squeals of a furious pig let no one dare stop us were moving into a new world where science will rule all civilization youre meddling with a political faction that understands our needs you cant be tolerated kendrick is dangerous youve seen him heard him hed hold hearings ask stupid questions obstruct our progress thats what i thought youd say varak slowly reached beneath the uniform to the fold of his jacket do you know the universal penalty for treason professor what are you talking about his hands trembling his heavy body shaking as the sweat rolled down his face sundstrom edged towards the door ive betrayed no one im trying to stop a terrible wrong a horrible mistake committed by misguided lunatics youve got to be stopped all of you you cannot interfere with the greatest scientific machine the world has ever known in the shadows varak withdrew his automatic a reflection of light beamed up from the barrel into sundstroms eyes youve had months to say those things instead you were silent while the others trusted you through your betrayal lives were lost bodies mutilated youre filth professor no screamed sundstrom crashing into the door his trembling fingers hitting the handle as the door swung out the scientists rotund body following in frenzied panic milos fired the bullet seared into sundstroms lower spine as the traitor fell to the asphalt shrieking help me help me hes trying to kill me oh my god he shot me kill him kill him varak fired again his aim now steady the bullet accurate the back of the scientists skull blew apart in seconds amid screams of confusion gunfire was returned from the hangar the czech was hit in the chest and left shoulder he sprang out of the street side door rolling on the ground over and over again directly behind the limousine until he reached the opposite curb in pain he crawled above it scrambling on his hands and knees into the darkness of the tall grass that was the border of an auxiliary airstrip he almost did not make it from all directions there were the sounds of sirens and racing engines the entire security force was converging on hangar seven as across the street the guard and grinells chauffeur closed in on the limousine firing repeatedly into the vehicle varak was hit again an aimless ricochet a wild shot burned its way into his stomach he had to get away his business was not concluded he turned and started running through the tall grass ripping first the uniformed jacket off then stopping briefly to remove the trousers blood was spreading through his shirt and his legs grew unsteady he had to conserve his strength he had to get across the field and reach a road find a telephone he had to searchlights from a tower behind him he was back in czechoslovakia in prison racing across the compound to a fence and freedom a beam swung close and as he had done in that prison outside prague he lurched to the ground and lay motionless until it passed he struggled to his feet knowing he was growing weaker but could not stop in the distance there were other lightsstreetlights and another fence freedom freedom straining every muscle grip by grip he scaled the fence only to confront coiled barbed wire at the top it did not matter with what seemed like his last vestige of strength he propelled himself over shredding his clothes and his flesh as he dropped to the ground he lay there breathing deeply alternately holding his stomach and his chest go on now he reached the road it was one of those unkempt narrow thoroughfares that frequently surround airports no real estate development because of the noise still cars sped by shortcuts known to natives awkwardly unsteadily he walked on to it holding up his arms at an approaching vehicle the driver however was having no part of him he swung to the left and raced by moments later a second car approached from his right he stood as straight as he could and raised one hand a civilized signal of distress the car slowed down it stopped as the czech reached into his holster for his gun whats the problem asked the man in a naval uniform behind the wheel the gold wings signified that he was a pilot im afraid ive had an accident replied varak i drove off the road a mile or so back and no one has stopped to help me youre pretty smashed up pal climb in and ill get you to the hospital jesus youre a mess come on ill give you a hand dont bother i can manage said varak walking around the bonnet he opened the door and climbed in if i soil your car ill gladly pay lets worry about that in a month of tuesdays the naval officer shifted into gear and raced off as the czech replaced his unseen automatic in the holster youre very kind said milos digging a scrap of paper out of his pocket and removing his pen writing brief words and numbers in the darkness youre very hurt pal hang on please i must find a telephone please the fucking insurance can wait buddy no not insurance stammered varak my wife she expected me hours ago she has psychological problems dont they all said the pilot do you want me to make the call no thank you very much she would interpret that as a crisis far worse than it is the czech arched back in the seat grimacing theres a fruit stand about a mile down the road i know the owner and they have a phone i cant thank you enough take me to dinner when you get out of the hospital the perplexed owner of the fruit store handed varak the phone as the naval officer watched concerned for his damaged passenger milos dialled the westlake hotel room fiftyone if you please hello hello cried khalehla from out of a deep sleep do you have an answer for me milos yes whats wrong im not terribly well miss rashad do you have an answer youre hurt your answer green light payton will back off if evan can get the nomination its his the race is on hes needed more than youll ever know i dont know that hell agree he has to keep your line free ill call you right back you are hurt the czech depressed the bar on the phone and immediately redialled yes sound man prague how are things progressing well be done in a couple of hours the typists got the earphones on and is pounding away shes rough on allnight overtime whatever the cost its covered whats wrong with you i can barely hear you a slight cold youll find ten thousand in your studio mailbox yes come on im not a thief i roll high remember you really dont sound right prague in the morning take everything to the westlake room fiftyone the name of the woman is rashad give it only to her rashad room fiftyone ive got it thank you listen if youre in trouble let me know about it okay i mean if theres anything i can do your cars at the airport somewhere in section c said the czech hanging up he lifted the phone for the last time and dialled again room fiftyone he repeated hello you will receive everything in the morning where are you let me send help in the morning get it to mr b goddamn you milos where are you it doesnt matter ask kendrick he may know know what photographs the vanvlanderen woman lausanne the leman marina the beau rivagethe gardens then amsterdam the rozengracht in the hotel her study tell him the man is a saudi and things happened to him millions millions milos could hardly talk he had so little breath go on go on escape millions what the hell are you talking about he may be the key dont let anyone remove the photographs contact kendrick he may remember the czech lost control of his movements he swung the telephone back on to the counter missing the cradle then fell to the ground in front of the fruit stand on a back country road beyond the airport in san diego milos varak was dead the icarus agenda chapter the mornings headlines and related articles obscured all other news the secretary of state and his entire delegation had been brutally killed in a hotel in cyprus the sixth fleet was heading towards the island all weapons and aircraft at the ready the nation was transfixed furious and not a little frightened the horror of some uncontrollable force of evil seemed to loom on the horizon edging the country towards the brink of wholesale confrontation provoking the government to respond with equal horror and brutality but in a stroke of rare intuitive geopolitical brilliance president langford jennings controlled the storm he contacted moscow and the result of that communication had brought forth dual condemnations from the two superpowers the monstrous event in cyprus was labelled an isolated act of terrorism that enraged the entire world words of praise and sorrow for a great man came from all the capitals of the globe allies and adversaries alike and on pages and respectively in the san diego union and pages and in the los angeles times were the following far less important wire service reports san diego decmrs ardis vanvlanderen chief of staff for vice president orson bollinger whose husband andrew vanvlanderen died yesterday from cardiac arrest took her own life early this morning in apparent grief her body washed up on the beach in coronado death attributed to drowning on his way to the airport her attorney mr crayton grinell of la jolla had dropped her off at the funeral home for a last viewing of her husband according to sources at the home the widow was under severe strain and barely coherent although a limousine waited for her she slipped out a side door and apparently took a taxi to the coronado beach mexico city deceric sundstrom one of americas leading scientists and creators of highly complex space technology died of a cerebral haemorrhage while on vacation in puerto vallarta few details are available at this time a full report of his life and work will appear in tomorrows editions san diego decan unidentified man without papers but carrying a gun died of gunshot wounds on a back road south of the international airport lt commander john demartin a us navy fighter pilot picked him up telling the police the man claimed to have been in an automobile accident due to the proximity of the private field adjacent to the airport authorities suspect that the death may have been drug oriented evan flew to san diego on the first morning flight from denver he had insisted on seeing manny at am and would not be denied youre going to be fine he had lied and youre a horseshit artist weingrass had shot back where are you going khalehla san diego she needs me then get the hell out of here i dont want to see your ugly face another second go to her help her get those bastards the taxi from the airport to the hotel in the early traffic seemed interminable the situation hardly relieved by the driver who recognized him and kept up a flow of inane chatter laced with invective directed at all arabs and all things arabic every fuckin one of em should be taken out and shot right women and children too of course right the brats grow up and the broads make more brats thats quite a solution you might even call it final its the only way right wrong when you consider the numbers and the price of ammunition the cost would be too high taxes would go up no kiddin shit i pay enough theres gotta be another way im sure youll come up with one now if youll forgive me i have some reading to do kendrick returned to his copy of the denver post and the terrible news from cyprus and either miffed or feeling he had been put down the driver turned on the radio again as in the newspapers the coverage was almost exclusively about the abominable act of terrorism in the mediterranean onsite recordings and repeated interviews from world figures in various translated languages condemning the barbaric act and as if death had to follow death a stunned evan heard the newscasters words here in san diego there was another tragedy mrs ardis vanvlanderen vice president bollingers chief of staff was found dead early this morning when her body washed up on the beach in coronado an apparent suicide kendrick shot forward on the seat ardis ardis vanvlanderen ardis montreaux the bahamas a dissolute minor player from off shore investments of years ago said ardis montreaux had married a wealthy californian good christ that was why khalehla had flown to san diego mitchell payton had found the money whorebollingers chief of staff the announcer went on to speculate on the new widows grief a speculation kendrick thought suspect he walked across the hotel lobby and took the elevator to the fifth floor studying the numbered arrows he started down the hall towards khalehlas room both anxious and depressedanxious to see her and hold her depressed about manny about the wholesale slaughter in cyprus about so much but mainly emmanuel weingrass scheduled victim of murder he reached the door and rapped four times hearing the racing footsteps inside before he removed his hand the door swung back and she was in his arms my god i love you he whispered into her dark hair the words rushed and everythings so rotten so goddamned rotten quickly inside khalehla closed the door and returned to him holding his face in her hands manny hes got somewhere between three and six months to live replied evan his voice flat hes dying of a virus he couldnt possibly have got except through an injection the nonexistent dr lyons said rashad making a statement ill find him if it takes me twenty years youll have all the help washington can give you the news is rotten everywhere cyprus the best man in the administration blown to bits its tied in here evan here in san diego what khalehla backed away and took his hand leading him across the room to where there were two chairs a small round table between them sit down darling ive got a lot to tell you that i couldnt tell you before then theres something you have to do its why i asked you to fly out here i think i know one of the things youre going to tell me said kendrick sitting down ardis montreaux the widow vanvlanderen i heard it on the radio they say she committed suicide she did that when she married her late husband you came to see her didnt you yes rashad nodded as she sat down at the table youll hear and read everything there are tapes and transcripts of all of it they were delivered to me an hour ago what about cyprus the order came from here a man named grinell never heard of him few people have evan its worse than anything we could imagine you learned that from ardis yes she was ardis and i was evan i know that no not from her with her we only glimpsed the outline and that was frightening enough our main source is a man who was killed last night out by the airport for gods sake who the blond european darling what kendrick fell back in the seat his face flushed he taped not only my interview but a subsequent conversation that blew the lid off the top except for grinell we dont have names but we can piece together a picture like in a puzzle with blurred figures and its terrifying a government within the government said evan quietly those were mannys words the servants running the masters house as usual mannys right kendrick got up from the chair and walked to a window leaning against the sill and staring outside the blond man who was he we never learned but whoever he was he died delivering us the information the oman file how did he get it he wouldnt tell me except to say that his source was a good person who supported you for higher political office that doesnt tell me anything shouted evan whipping around from the window there has to be more there isnt did he have any idea what theyve done the lives that were lost the butchering he said hed grieve over the errors of judgment more than anyone else he didnt know that his grief would only last a couple of hours goddamn it roared kendrick at the walls of the room what about this grinell have they got him hes disappeared his plane left san diego for tucson arizona no one knew about it until morning it was on the ground for about an hour then took off without filing a flight plan thats how we found out planes can collide that way not if they patch into mexican air traffic across the border mj has an idea that grinells security may have spotted the federal vehicles waiting for him near his house in lajolla evan returned to the table and sat down a man exhausted beaten where do we go from here downstairs to the vanvlanderen suite our european wanted you to look at somethingphotographs actually i dont know why but he said the man was a saudi and you might remember something about millions and an escape weve secured the apartment no one goes in or out under the national security statutes insofar as she was bollingers chief of staff and there could be confidential papers all right lets go they took the elevator down to the third floor and approached the doors of the vanvlanderen apartment the two armed uniformed police officers in front nodded as the man on the left turned he inserted the key and opened the door its an honour to meet you congressman said the officer on the right impetuously extending his hand a pleasure to meet you said kendrick shaking the hand and going inside how does it feel being such a celebrity asked khalehla closing the door neither comfortable nor gratifying replied evan as they walked across the marble foyer and down into the sunken living room where are the photographs he wasnt specific only that they were in her office and you should find ones taken in lausanne and amsterdam over there said kendrick seeing a lighted desk lamp in a room to the left come on they walked across the carpeted room into the study evan adjusted his eyes to the shadowed interior then crossed to another lamp across the room and turned it on the crisscrossing arrangement of photographs sprang into light good lord how do we start said khalehla slowly and carefully answered kendrick quickly dismissing the panel on the left and concentrating on the right wall this is europe he said his eyes roaming thats lausanne he added focusing on two people in an enlarged snapshot with the leman marina in the background its ardis and no it couldnt be what couldnt be wait a minute evan followed the pattern to the lower right concentrating on another framed enlargement the faces clearer lausanne again this is in the gardens of the beau rivage is it possible is what he mentioned the beau rivage the blond man i mean also amsterdam the rose somethingorother the rozengracht here it is kendrick pointed at a photograph in which the two subjects faces were even sharper more distinct my god its him who abdel hamendi i knew him years ago in riyadh he was a minister for the saudis until the family caught him working on his own making millions with false leases and ersatz contracts he was to be publicly executed but he got out of the country they say he built a fortress for himself somewhere in the alps near divonne and went into a new brokering business armaments i was told hes become the most powerful arms merchant in the world with the lowest profile ardis vanvlanderen mentioned divonne on the second tape it was a quick reference but now it makes sense evan stepped back and looked at khalehla our dead europeans instincts were right he didnt remember the details but he saw the blood on hamendi as surely as if it were coming out of that photograph a government within the government dealing with a global brokerage house for all the illicit weapons in the world kendrick suddenly frowned his expression startled is it all tied in with bollinger the european said there was no way to tell what does he know or what doesnt he know theres only one thing thats certain hes the rallying point for the heaviest political contributors in the country my god theyre entrenched theres something else you should know ardis vanvlanderens husband was the one who made contact with the terrorists he arranged for the attacks on your homes jesus roared evan why you answered khalehla softly you were the target he wanted you killed he acted aloneits why his wife was murdered when the others found out to cut off any ties to thembut theyre all afraid of you starting next week theres going to begin a nationwide campaign to put you on the ticket replacing bollinger as the new vice president the blond europeans people yes and the men around bollinger cant tolerate that they think youll squeeze them out reduce their influence to nothing im going to do more than that said evan im not going to squeeze them out im going to rip them out cyprus fairfax mesa verdebastards who are they is there a list we can compile one with a great many names but we dont know whos involved and who isnt lets find out how im going inside bollingers camp theyre going to see another congressman kendrickone who can be bought off a national ticket mitchell jarvis payton stared out of the window from his desk in langley virginia there was so much to think about he could not think about christmas which was a minor blessing he had no regrets about the life he had chosen but christmas was a bit trying he had two married sisters in the midwest and assorted nieces and nephews to whom he had sent the usual presents appropriately purchased by his secretary of many years but he had no desire to join them for the holiday there was simply nothing much to talk about he had been too long on the other side of the world for conversations about a lumberyard and an insurance firm and of course he could say nothing about his own work also the children most of them grown up were an unremarkable lot not a scholar among them and adamant in their collective pursuit of the good stolid life of financial security it was all better left alone it was probably why he gravitated to his adopted niece adrienne rashadhe had better get used to calling her khalehla he reflected she was part of his world hardly by any choice of his but part of it and outstanding payton wished for a moment that they were all back in cairo when the rashads used to insist that he join them for their yearly christmas dinner complete with a brilliantly decorated tree and recordings of carols really mj rashads wife would explain im from california remember im the lightskinned one where had those days gone would they ever come back of course not he ate alone at christmas paytons red phone rang his hand shot out picking it up yes hes crazy yelled adriennekhalehla i mean hes nuts mj hes turned you down get off it he wants to go see bollinger on what grounds to play a fink can you believe it i might if youll be somewhat clearer there was an obvious tugging at the telephone as several obscenities were hurled back and forth mitch this is evan i gathered that im going inside bollingers its logical i did the same thing in masqat you can win one and then lose one young man once successful twice burned those people play hardball so do i i want them ill get them well monitor you no its got to be solo they have what you people call equipmenteyes all over the place ive got to play it out by myself the point being that i can be persuaded to fade from politics thats too big a contradiction from what theyve seen of you heard of you it wouldnt work kendrick it will if i tell them part of the trutha very essential part whats that evan that i did what i did in oman strictly out of selfinterest i was heading back to pick up the pieces to make all that money i left behind its something theyd understand theyd damn well understand not good enough theyll ask too many questions and want to confirm your answers none i cant answer broke in kendrick all part of the truth all easily confirmed i was convinced i knew who was behind the palestinians and whyhed used the same tactics on my companythe truth i had connections with the most powerful men in the sultanate and full government protection let them check with young ahmat hed love to get that straightened out his nose is still out of joint again the truth even when i was in the prisoner compound i was watched every minute by the police my objective throughout was merely to get the information i knew existed to nail a maniac who called himself the mahdi the truth im sure there are gaps that can trip you up said payton writing notes he would later shred not one i can think of and thats all that matters ive heard the europeans tape theyve got billions riding on the next five years and cant afford to weaken their status quo by one iota it doesnt matter that theyre wrong but they see me as a threat to them which under different circumstances i damn well would be what might those circumstances be evan interrupted the older man in langley what if i stayed in washington i imagine id ride herd on every son of a bitch who plays loose with the governments coffers and figures out ways to get around the laws for a few million here and a few million there a veritable savonarola no fanaticism mj just a goddamned angry taxpayer whos sick and tired of all those screaming scare tactics designed to bleed the taxpayers for excessive profits where was i a threat to them right they want me out of the way and ill convince them im ready to go that i want nothing to do with this campaign to put me on the ticket but i have a problem this i assume is the kicker im first and foremost a businessman a construction engineer by training and profession and the office of vice president would provide me with a global posture i could never enjoy without it im relatively young in five years ill still be in my forties and as a former vice president id have financial backing and influence available to me all over the world thats a very tempting prospect for an international builder who intends to return to the private sector what do you think would be the reaction of bollinger and his advisers mj what else said the director of special projects youre imitating their own voices with just the right amount of ooze theyll offer you a fiveyear shortcut with all the financial resources you need thats what i thought youd say thats what i think theyll say but again like any decent negotiator whos made a fair share of money in his day i have another problem i cant wait to hear it young man i need proof and i need it quickly so that i can firmly reject the political committee in denver thats priming chicago for next week reject it before it gets off the ground and possibly out of control and the proof you require is a general commitment of sorts im a businessman so are they they wont put anything in writing thats negotiable among men of goodwill i want a meetingofintent with the principals ill set forth my plans vague as they are and they can respond if they can convince me that theyre trustworthy ill act accordingly and i think theyll be very convincing but by then it wont matter because youll have the nucleus agreed payton smiling youll know who they are i must say evan it all sounds feasible even remarkably so just sound business practice mj however i have a problem at the outset theyll never believe that youre going back over there theyll think youre lying the whole middle east is too unstable i didnt say i was going back next week i said one day and god knows i wouldnt mention the mediterranean but i will talk about the emirates and bahrain kuwait and qatar even oman and saudi arabia all the places in the gulf states where the kendrick group operated theyre as normal as theyll ever be and as opec gets its act together again itll be business and profits as usual like every west european construction outfit i want part of the action and i want to be ready for it im back in the private sector good heavens youre persuasive businesswise im not far off the mark either ive got the marbles mitch im going in when im calling bollinger in a few minutes i dont think hell refuse my call not likely langford jennings would burn his ass i want to give him several hours to gather his flock at least the few he counts on ill ask for a meeting late this afternoon make it in the evening corrected the cia executive after business hours and be explicit say you want a private entrance away from his personnel and the press itll convey your message thats very good mj sound business practice congressman lt commander john demartin us navy was in jeans and a tshirt applying generous amounts of cleaning fluid over the upholstery of his cars front seat trying with minimal success to remove the bloodstains it was going to be a professional job he concluded and until it was done he would tell the kids he had spilled some cherry soda on the way home from the field still the more he reduced the stains the less it would costhe hoped demartin had read the report in the mornings union identifying him by name and stating that the authorities believed the death of the wounded hitchhiker he had picked up was drug related the pilot however was not convinced he was not on speaking terms with any drug dealers that he knew of yet he could not imagine that too many of them were so polite as to offer to pay for staining a car seat he assumed that such men if mortally wounded would be in panic not so controlled so courteous pressing down demartin scrubbed the back of the seat again his exposed knuckles touched something something sharp yet instantly flexible it was a note he pulled it out and read it reading beneath the bloodstains urgt mx scty relay contct sterm the last letters drifted off as if there had been no strength left to write them the naval officer dragged himself out of the seat and stood in the driveway studying the note then walked up the flagstone path to his front door he went inside proceeded into the living room and picked up the phone he knew whom to call moments later a wave secretary put him through to the bases chief of intelligence jim its john demartin hey i read about that crazy episode last night what some fly boys wont do for a little grass youre taking me up on the fishing saturday no im calling you about last night oh how come jim i dont know who or what that guy was but i dont think he had anything to do with drugs then a few minutes ago i found a note creased into the seat where he was sitting its kind of bloody but let me read it to you go ahead ive got a pencil the naval officer read the awkwardly printed words letters and numbers does it make any sense he asked when he had finished it may said the intelligence chief slowly obviously rereading what he had written john describe what happened last night will you the article in the paper was pretty sketchy demartin did so beginning with the observation that although the blond man spoke excellent english he had a foreign accent he ended with the hitchhikers collapse in front of the fruit stand thats it do you think he knew how severely he was wounded if he didnt i did i tried not to stop for the telephone but he insistedi mean he pleaded jim not so much in words but with his eyes i wont forget them for a long time but there was no question in your mind that he was coming back to the car none i think he wanted to make a last call even as he fell he reached up for the phone on the counter but he was coming back stay where you are ill call you right back the pilot hung up and walked to a rear window overlooking the small pool and outside patio his two children were splashing about and yelling at each other while his wife reclined in a lounge chair reading the wall street journal a practice for which he was grateful thanks to her they were able to live somewhat beyond his salary the phone rang he returned to it jim yes john ill be as clear as i can and thats not going to be too clear theres a fellow here on loan to us from washington whos more familiar with these things than i am and this is what he wants you to do oh boy what is it tell me burn the note and forget about it the cia officer in the rumpled suit reached for the small yellow package of mms the telephone held to his left ear you got all that asked shapoff otherwise known as gingerbread yes replied mj payton the word drawn out as if the information was both bewildering and startling the way i read it this guy whoever he was combined urgent with maximum security reckoning that if he didnt make it this navy officer would have enough sense to call base security rather than the cops which is exactly what he did agreed mj then security would reach the relay contact and deliver the message thinking itd be channelled to the right people the message being that someone called code name s had been terminated we got an operation with a codes no maybe its the bureau or treasury i doubt it said payton why because in this case the relay is the last stop the message wouldnt have gone any farther how do you know that area code threezeroone is maryland and unfortunately i recognize the number its unlisted and very private payton leaned back in his chair briefly understanding how alcoholics felt when they believed they could not get through the next hour without a drink which meant a step away from reality how ludicrously illogically logical the voice heard by the ears of presidents a man the nations leaders knew had the nations interests always in the forefront of his profound thinking without fear without favour with constant objectivity he had chosen the future he had selected a littleknown but outstanding congressman with a story to tell that would mesmerize the country he had guided his anointed prince through the political labyrinth until the designated tyro emerged into the media sunlight no longer a fledgling but a practitioner to be reckoned with then with the suddenness and audacity of a bolt of lightning the story was told and the nation indeed a large part of the world was transfixed a giant wave had been set in motion carrying the prince to a land he had never considered a land of power a royal house of awesome responsibility the white house samuel winters had broken the rules and far worse at an enormous loss of life mr a had not dropped from the sky in a crisis the blond european had worked solely for the august samuel winters the director of special projects picked up his phone and gently touched the numbers on his console dr winters he said in response to the single word yes this is payton its been a terrible day hasnt it doctor thats not a title i use any more i havent for years a shame you were a fine scholar have you heard from mr a since yesterday evening no although his information was tragically prophetic thered be no reason for him to call me as i told you mitchell the man who employs hima far more distant acquaintance than yousuggested he contact me very much as you did my reputation exceeds my presumed influence through you i saw the president said payton closing his eyes at the old mans lies well yes the news you brought me was devastating as was mr as in his case i naturally thought of you i wasnt sure langford or his people had the expertise that you did i obviously didnt have it interrupted mj im certain you did all you could back to mr a dr winters yes hes dead the gasp of breath was like an electric shock over the line it was several seconds before winters spoke and when he did his voice was hollow what are you saying hes dead and someone known to you as code name s has been killed oh my god whispered the spokesman of inver brass the whisper a tremulous echo of itself how do you come by this information im afraid thats privileged even from you damn you i gave you jennings the president of the united states but you didnt tell me why doctor you never explained to me that your overriding concernyour consummate concernwas the man you had chosen evan kendrick no protested winters as close to a scream of denial as he could manage you must not delve into such matters theyre not your business no laws have been broken id like to think you believe that but if you do im afraid youre terribly wrong when you contract the talents of someone like your european you cant divorce yourself from his methods as weve pieced it together they include political extortion through blackmail the corruption of the legislative process the theft of maximum classified documents and indirectly causing the death and maiming of numerous government personneland finally murder code name s was terminated oh dear god thats who you were playing you dont understand mitchell thats not the way things happened on the contrary its exactly the way they happened i know nothing about such things you must believe that i do because you employed a skilled professional for results not for giving you explanations employed is too simplistic a term he was a dedicated man who had his own mission in life so i was told interrupted payton he came from a country whose government had been stolen from its people what do you think is happening here said the leader of inver brass his words now controlled but the depth of their meaning clear it was several moments before mj replied again with his eyes closed i know he said softly were putting that together too they killed the secretary of state and the entire delegation in cyprus they have no conscience no allegiance to anything but their own everexpanding wealth and power i want nothing we want nothing i understand you wouldnt get it if you wanted it thats why he was chosen mitchell we found the extraordinary man hes too perceptive to be fooled and too decent to be bought in addition he has the personal requisites to command attention i cant fault your choice dr winters so where are we in a dilemma said payton but for the moment its mine not yours pm san diego they held each other khalehla leaned back touching his hair as she looked at him darling can you do it you forget ya anisa ive spent most of my profitable life dealing with the arab propensity for negotiation that was negotiatingexaggeration of coursenot lying not sustaining a lie in front of people wholl be suspicious of everything you say theyll desperately want to believe me thats two points for our side besides once i see them and meet them i dont really give a damn what they believe i wouldnt advise you to think that way evan said rashad lowering her hand and stepping away until we have them which includes degrees of traceable evidence theyll operate as usualdown and dirty if they think for a moment that its a trap you could be found washed up on the beach or maybe just not found at all just out there somewhere in the pacific as in the sharkinfested shoals of qatar kendrick nodded remembering bahrain and the mahdi i see what you mean then ill make it plain that my office knows where i am tonight it wouldnt happen tonight darling down and dirty doesnt mean stupid therell be a mix in theresome legitimate staffers and probably a smattering of bollingers kitchen cabinet old friends who act as adviserstheyre the ones you want to zero in on use that wellrecognized cool of yours and be convincing dont let anything throw you the telephone rang and evan started towards it thats the car he said grey with tinted windows as befits the vice presidents residence in the hills pm san diego the slender man walked rapidly through the terminal at san diegos international airport a garment bag slung over his right shoulder a black medical bag in his left hand the automatic glass doors to the taxi area snapped back as he passed through on to the concrete pavement he stood for a moment then headed for the first cab in the line of taxis queued up for passengers he opened the door as the driver lowered a tabloid newspaper i assume youre available said the new fare curtly as he climbed in throwing the carryon across the seat and lowering his medical bag to the floor no trips over an hour mister thats when i pack it in for the night youll make it where to up in the hills i know the way ill direct you gotta have an address mister its the law how about the california residence of the vice president of the united states asked the passenger testily its an address replied the driver unimpressed the taxi started off with a planned meanspirited jolt and the man known briefly in southwest colorado as dr eugene lyons was slapped back into the seat he was unaware of the insult however his anger clouding all normal perceptions he was a man who was owed a man who had been cheated the icarus agenda chapter the introductions were brief and kendrick had the distinct impression that not all the names or titles were entirely accurate as a result he studied each face as if he were about to commit it to a canvas he was incapable of painting khalehla had been right the sevenman council was a mix but not as difficult to discern as she had thought a staffer making thirty to forty thousand dollars a year did not dress or behave like someone who spent such sums on a weekend visit to paris or divonne he judged that the staff was in the minority three official aides versus four outside advisersthe kitchen cabinet from california vice president orson bollinger was a man of medium height medium build medium middle age and afflicted with a medium high voice that fell between the narrow parameters of being dismissible and convincing he was well medium the ideal second in command so long as number one was in good health and vigour he was vaguely perceived as a toady who might just possibly rise to the occasion but only possibly he was neither a threat nor was he stupid he was a political survivor because he understood the unwritten rules of the alsoran he greeted congressman evan kendrick warmly and led him into his impressive private library where his people were assembled sitting in various leather armchairs and on dark leather couches weve cancelled our christmas festivities here said bollinger sitting in the most prominent chair and indicating that evan should sit beside him in deference to dear ardis and andrew such a terrible tragedy two such magnificently patriotic people she simply couldnt live without him you know youd have to have seen them together to understand nods and impatient grunts of agreement came from around the room i understand mr vice president interjected kendrick sadly as you may know i met mrs vanvlanderen a number of years ago in saudi arabia she was a remarkable woman and so very sensitive no congressman i didnt know that its immaterial but of course not to me ill never forget her she was remarkable as indeed is your request for a meeting this evening said one of the two official aides sitting on the couch were all aware of the chicago movement to challenge the vice president and we understand that it may not have your endorsement is that true congressman as i explained to the vice president this afternoon i didnt hear about it until a week ago no it doesnt have my endorsement ive considered other plans that do not concern further political pursuits then why not simply declare your noncandidacy asked a second aide from the same couch well i guess things are never as simple as wed like them to be are they id be less than candid if i said i wasnt flattered by the proposal and during the past five days my staff did some fairly extensive polling both regionally and among the party leadership theyve concluded that my candidacy is a viable prospect but you just said you had other plans interrupted a heavyset man in grey flannels and a goldbuttoned navy blue blazer not an aide i believe i said that ive considered other plans other pursuits nothings finalized whats your point congressman asked the same staffer who had suggested that evan should declare he would not stand that could be between the vice president and me couldnt it these are my people offered bollinger unctuously smiling benignly i understand that sir but my people are not here perhaps to guide me you dont look or sound like someone who needs a hell of a lot of guidance said a short compact adviser from a leather chair unflatteringly large for his small frame ive seen you on television youve got some pretty strong opinions i couldnt change those any more than a zebra could change his stripes but there may be mitigating circumstances why they should remain privately held beliefs rather than publicly expressed ones are you trading horses asked a third contributor this a tall lanky man in an open shirt with deeply tanned features im not trading anything objected kendrick firmly im attempting to explain a situation that hasnt been clarified and i think it damn well should no need to get upset young fella said bollinger earnestly frowning at his large suntanned adviser its not a demeaning choice of words you know trading is intrinsic to our great democratic contract now whats this situation that should be clarified the oman crisis masqat and bahrain the basic reason ive been singled out for higher political office suddenly it was apparent that the vice presidents people all thought they were going to be given information that might wash away the oman myth vitiate the potential candidates strongest appeal all eyes were riveted on the congressman i went to masqat continued evan because i knew who was behind the palestinian terrorists he used the same tactics on me driving my company out of business and robbing me of millions you wanted revenge then suggested the heavyset adviser in the goldbuttoned blazer revenge hell i wanted my company backi still want it the time will come fairly soon now and i want to head back to pick up the pieces to make up for all those profits i left behind the fourth contributor a floridfaced man with a distinct boston accent leaned forward you goin back t the middle east no to the persian gulf statestheres a difference the emirates bahrain qatar dubai theyre not lebanon or syria or gaddafis libya the word from europe is that constructions starting up all over again and i intend to be there you sold your company said the tall suntanned contributor with the open shirt his speech laconic but precise at a forced sale it was worth five times what i was paid but thats not too large a problem for me against west german french and japanese capital i may have a few problems at the beginning but my contacts are as extensive as anyone elses also kendrick played out his scenario with understated conviction touching on his relationships with the royal houses and ministers of oman bahrain abu dhabi and dubai mentioning the protection and the assistance including private transportation provided for him by the governments of oman and bahrain during the masqat crisis then as abruptly as he began he stopped he had drawn the picture sufficiently for their imaginations more might be too much the men in the library looked at one another and with an almost imperceptible nod from the vice president the heavy man in the navy blue blazer spoke it strikes me that your plans are pretty well solidified what would you want with a job that pays a hundred and fifty thou a year and too many chicken dinners youre not a politician considering my age the time factor could be attractive five years from now ill still be in my forties and the way i read things even if i started tomorrow over there it would take me two perhaps three years to be in full operationand i could be shy a year there there are no guarantees but if i go the other way and actively seek the nomination i might actually get itthats no reflection on you mr vice president its merely the result of the media treatment that ive been given when several others began speaking at once bollinger held up his hand barely inches above the arm of his chair it was enough to quiet them and congressman well i think its pretty obvious theres no question in anyones mind that jennings will win the election although he may have problems with the senate if i were fortunate enough to be on the ticket id go from the house to the vice presidency spend my time and come out with more international influenceand quite frankly resourcesthan i could ever hope to have otherwise that congressman cried an angry young third aide from a straightbacked chair next to his colleagues on the couch is blatantly using the trust of public office for personal profit there was a mass lowering and straying of the contributors eyes if i didnt think you spoke out impetuously and mistakenly because you dont understand said evan calmly id be extremely offended im stating an obvious fact because i want to be completely open with vice president bollinger a man i deeply respect what i mentioned is the truth it goes with the office but in no way does that truth take away from the energy or the commitment id give to that office while serving it and the nation whatever rewards might come from such a position whether in the form of publishing corporate boardrooms or golf tournaments they wouldnt be given to a man who took his responsibilities lightly like vice president bollinger i couldnt operate that way well said evan commented the vice president softly while looking harshly at the impulsive aide youre owed an apology i apologize said the young man youre right of course it all goes with the office dont be too apologetic admonished kendrick smiling loyalty to ones boss isnt anything to be sorry about evan turned to bollinger if hes a black belt im getting out of here fast he added breaking the momentary tension with laughter he plays a mean game of pingpong said the older aide on the left of the couch hes very creative keeping score said the oldest staffer on the right he cheats at any rate continued evan waiting until the grinsmostly forcedhad left the assembled faces i meant it when i said i wanted to be completely frank with you mr vice president these are the things i have to think about ive lost four almost five years of a careera businessi worked extremely hard to develop i was shortcircuited by a mad killer and forced to sell because people were afraid to work for me hes dead and things have changed theyre getting back to normal but the european competition is heavy can i do it by myself or should i actively campaign for the ticket and if i succeed have certain guarantees that result from holding the office on the other hand do i really want to spend the additional years and the enormous amounts of time and energy that go with the job these are questions only i can answer sir i hope you understand and then kendrick heard the words he had hoped beyond hope to hearhope in this case far more meaningful than in his statement to bollinger i know its late for your staff orson said the tall lanky man in the open shirt that set off his suntanned flesh but id like to talk a little further yes certainly agreed the vice president turning to his aides these poor fellas have been up since dawn what with the dreadful news about ardis and all go home boys and have christmas with your familiesi brought all the wives and kids out here on air force two evan so they could be together very thoughtful sir thoughtful hell maybe they all have black belts youre dismissed troops tomorrows christmas eve and if i remember correctly the next days christmas so unless the ruskies blow up washington ill see you in three days thank you mr vice president youre very kind sir we can stay if you wish said the oldest as each successively got out of his chair and have you mauled by your two associates asked bollinger grinning at the expressions of the others i wouldnt hear of it on your way out send in the butler we might as well have a brandy while we solve all the worlds problems seenoevil speaknoevil and hearnoevil left the room programmed robots reacting to a familiar marching tune the man in the goldbuttoned navy blue blazer leaned forward in his chair his stomach making it difficult for him you want to talk frankly congressman real frank and real honest well were going to do that i dont understand mr im sorry i didnt get your name cut the shitshit exclaimed the florid bostonian ive heard better crap from the ward heelers in southie you may fool the pols in dc said the small man in the toolarge chair but were businessmen too kendrick youve got something to offer and maybejust maybeweve got something to offer how do you enjoy southern california congressman the tall man with the open shirt and the outstretched legs spoke loudly as a butler entered the room nothing nothing exclaimed bollinger addressing the servant never mind leave us im sorry sir i have a message for you said the butler handing the vice president a note bollinger read it his face at first grew red then rapidly paled tell him to wait he ordered the butler left the room where were we at a price said the man from boston thats what were talkin about isnt it congressman thats a little blunt answered evan but the term is in the realm of possibility you should understand said the small man with the pinched face that you passed through two separate powerful detectors you may get sick from the x rays but you have no recording machines on you theyd be the last things id want good said the tall man getting out of the chair as if solely to impress the others with his formidable height and his image as the tanned rugged yachtsman strength was the message he sauntered to the fireplace mantelhigh noon in the town of corruption thought kendrick we caught your leeward drift about german french and japanese capital how steep are the waves in open water im afraid im not a sailor youll have to be clearer what are you up against financially asked evan pausing then shaking his head in dismissal nothing i cant handle i can commit seven to ten million if i have to and my lines of credit are extensive but of course so are the interest rates suppose lines of credit were established without those kinda burdens said the man familiar with constituency fixing in his south boston ward gentlemen interrupted bollinger sharply getting out of his chair as did those seated in deference to his obviously imminent departure i understand that i have an urgent matter to attend to if you need anything feel free to ask for it we wont be long mr vice president said kendrick knowing why bollinger had to distance himself from whatever ensuing conversation took place deniability was the byword as i mentioned this is a problem that only i can properly resolve i just wanted to be open with you its greatly appreciated evan stop in and see me before you leave ill be in my office the vice president of the united states left the booklined room and like jackals descending on their prey the contributors turned to the congressman from colorado we level now son said the sixfootfive yachtsman his arm on the mantel like a leaning angry weed im not a relative of yours thank you and i resent the familiarity big tom always talks like that chimed in the florid bostonian he dont mean no harm by it the harm is in his presumption with a member of the house of representatives oh come on congressman interjected the obese man in the navy blue blazer lets all relax said the smallframed pinchedfaced man sitting down in the overlarge armchair were all here for the same purpose and courtesies aside lets get on with it we want you out kendrick do we have to be clearer since youre so adamant i think youd better be all right continued the short contributor his legs barely touching the carpeted floor as someone said lets be honestdoesnt cost a damn thing we represent a political philosophy every bit as legitimate as you think yours is but because its ours we naturally feel its more realistic for the times basically we believe in a far stronger defenceoriented system of priorities for the country than you do i believe in a strong defence too broke in evan but not in budgetcrippling excessively offensive systems where per cent of the expenditure results in waste and ineffectiveness good point agreed kendricks undersized opponent from the large chair and these areas of procurement will be rectified by the marketplace but not until billions are spent naturally if it were otherwise youd be talking about another system of government that doesnt permit the malthusian law of economic failure the forces of the free market will correct those excesses competition congressman kendrick competition not if theyre rigged in the pentagon or in those boardrooms where there are too many alumni from the defense department hell exclaimed the yachtsman from the fireplace mantel if theyre that fucking obvious let em hang big toms right said the floridfaced bostonian theres plenty to go around and those nickelanddime colonels and generals are just lubrication anyway get rid of them if you like but dont stop the treadmill for christs sake do you hear that asked the goldbuttoned blue blazer dont stop until were so strong no soviet leader would even think about a strike why do you think any of them would consider it consider blowing up a large part of the civilized world because theyre marxist fanatics roared the yachtsman standing erect in front of the mantel his arms akimbo because theyre stupid corrected the short man from his chair calmly stupidity is the basic road to global tragedy which means the strongest and the smartest will survive we can handle our critics in the senate and the house congressman but not in the administration that we cant tolerate am i clear you really think im a threat to you of course you are you get on your soapbox and people listen and what you sayvery effectively i might addis not in our interests i thought you had such respect for the marketplace i do in the long run but in the short run excessive oversight and regulation can cripple the countrys defence with delays this is no time to throw the baby out with the bath water which means throwing away profits they go with the job as you so rightly explained regarding the office of vice president go your way congressman rebuild your aborted career in southwest asia with what asked evan lets start with a credit line of fifty million dollars at the gemeinschaft bank in zurich switzerland thats very convincing but theyre only words whos putting up the collateral the gemeinschaft knows you dont have to it was all kendrick had to hear the full weight of the united states government bearing down on a zurich bank with known connections to men who dealt with terrorists from the baaka valley to cyprus would be enough to break the swiss codes of secrecy and silence ill confirm the line of credit in zurich in twelve hours he said getting up will that give you sufficient time more than sufficient replied the small man in the large chair and when you have confirmation youll do vice president bollinger the courtesy of sending him a copy of your telegram to chicago irrevocably withdrawing your name for consideration on the national ticket kendrick nodded glancing briefly at the three other contributors good evening gentlemen he said quietly and then headed for the library door out in the hallway a blackhaired muscular man with sharp cleancut features and the green dot of the secret service in his lapel rose from a chair beside a pair of thick double doors good evening congressman he said pleasantly taking a step forward itd be an honour to shake your hand sir my pleasure i know were not to say who comes and goes around here continued the member of the treasury department detail gripping evans hand but i may break that rule for my mother in new york perhaps it sounds crazy but she thinks you should be pope the curia might find me lacking the vice president asked me to see him before i left he said hed be in his office certainly its right here and let me tell you hed welcome the interruption hes got an irritated man in there with such a short fuse i didnt trust the machines and nearly stripsearched him i wouldnt let him take his bag of paraphernalia inside for the first time kendrick saw the garment bag draped across the chair at the left of the double doors beneath it on the floor was a bulky black case commonly referred to as a medical bag evan stared at it he had seen it before the inner screen of his mind was jolted fragments of images replacing one another like successive explosions stone walls in another hallway another door a tall slender man with a ready smiletoo ready too ingratiating for a stranger in a strange housea doctor casually amusingly stating that he would merely thump a chest and take a sample of blood for analysis if you dont mind said kendrick somehow through the mists realizing that he could barely be heard please open the door ive got to knock first congressman no please please do as i say the vipethe vice presidentwont appreciate that sir were always to knock first open that door ordered evan his rasping voice a whisper his eyes wide fixed briefly on the secret service man ill take full responsibility sure sure if anyones entitled i guess you are the heavy door on the right swung silently back the words hissed by a tightthroated bollinger clearly heard what youre saying is preposterous insane yes what is it kendrick walked through the terrible space and stared at the shocked panicstricken face of dr eugene lyons you screamed evan the isolated world inside his head going mad as he lunged racing across the room his two hands the claws of a maniacal animal intent only on the killthe kill hes going to die because of youbecause of all of you in a blur of violence arms gripped him hands chopped into his head and knees crashed up into his groin and his stomach his eyes bruised by experienced fingers despite the agonizing pain he heard the muted screamsone after another ive got him hes not going to move close the door get me my bag keep everyone out oh jesus he knows everything what do we do i know people who can handle this who the hell are you someone who should introduce himself viper ive heard that name its an insult who are you for the moment im in charge thats who i am oh christ darknessthe oblivion that comes with the deepest shock all was black nothing the icarus agenda chapter he felt the wind and the spray first then the motion of the sea and finally the wide cloth straps that constricted him binding him to the metal chair bolted into the deck of the pitching boat he opened his eyes in the moving darkness he was in the stern the foaming wake receding in front of him and was suddenly aware of cabin lights behind he turned craning his neck to see to understand abruptly he was face to face with the darkhaired swarthy secret service guard whose mother in new york thought he should be pope and whose voice he had heard proclaiming himself to be in charge the man sat in an adjacent deep sea fighting chair a single strap across his waist waking up congressman he asked politely what the hell have you done roared kendrick struggling against the restricting straps sorry about those but we didnt want you falling over the side the waters a little rough we were just protecting you while you got some air protecting goddamn you you bastards drugged me and carried me out of there against my will youve kidnapped me my office knows where i went tonight youre going to draw twenty years for this all of you and that son of a bitch bollinger will be impeached and spend hold it hold it broke in the man raising his hands calmly protesting youve got it all wrong congressman nobody drugged you you were sedated you went crazy back there you attacked a guest of the vice president you might have killed him i would have i will kill him wheres that doctor where is he what doctor you lying shit yelled kendrick into the wind straining at the cloth straps then he was struck by a thought my car the driver he knows i didnt leave but you did you werent feeling too well so you didnt say much and you wore your tinted glasses but you were very generous with your tip as the boat lurched in the water evan suddenly looked down at the clothes he was wearing squinting in the dim wash of light coming from the cabin behind him the trousers were a thick corduroy and the shirt a coarse black denim not his clothes bastards he roared again and again another thought then they saw me get out at the hotel sorry but you didnt go to the hotel about the only thing you said to the driver was to drop you off at balboa park that you had to meet someone and youd take a cab home you covered yourselves right down to my clothes youre all garbage you hired killers you keep getting it wrong congressman we were covering for you not anybody else we didnt know what youd been snorting or shooting into your veins but as my excitable grandfather would say we saw you go pazzo crazy you know what i mean i know exactly what you mean so naturally we couldnt let you be seen in public you can understand that cant you va bene you mafia prick i heard youim in charge you said i know people who can handle this you said that too you know congressman although i admire you a great deal im very offended by antiitalian generalizations tell that to the federal prosecutor in new york replied kendrick as the boat dipped sharply then rose with a heavy wave giulianis been putting you away by the truckload yes well talking about things that go bump in the night which we werent but we could have been in this water a number of people in balboa park saw a man who could easily fit your descriptioni mean dressed like you when you left the hotel and then in the limogoing into the balthazar the what its a coffeehouse in balboa you know weve got a lot of students down here they come from all over and theres a large contingent from the mediterranean you know kids from families who lived in iran and saudi arabia and egypt even what some still call palestine i guess sometimes the coffee gets out of hand politically that is and the police have to quiet things and confiscate items like guns and knives those people are very emotional and i was seen going inside and naturally therell be those inside wholl confirm i was there your bravery has never been questioned congressman you go into the most dangerous places looking for solutions dont you oman bahrain even the house of the vice president of the united states add bribery to your list garbageman now just a minute i havent anything to do with whatever you came to see viper about get that straight im just providing a service beyond my official duties thats all because you know people who can handle this like someone wearing my clothes and using my car and walking in balboa park and maybe a couple of others who were able to get me out of bollingers place with no one recognizing me a private ambulance service is very convenient and discreet when guests become ill or overindulge and no doubt one or two others to divert whatever press or maintenance people might be around my nongovernment associates are on call for emergencies sir were happy to provide assistance wherever we can for a price of course definitely they pay congressman they pay in lots of ways now more than ever for also including a fast boat and an experienced captain oh we cant take credit where it isnt due protested the man from the mafia enjoying himself this is their equipment their skipper there are just some things people do better for themselves especially if one of them is going into the heavily patrolled waters between the us and mexico theres clout and then again theres different clout if you know what im saying kendrick felt a third presence but turning in the chair saw no one else on the deck of the pleasure yacht then he raised his eyes to the aft railing of the bridge a figure stepped back into the shadows but not quickly enough it was the excessively tall deeply tanned contributor from bollingers library and from what could be seen of his face it was contorted in hatred are all of the vice presidents guests on board he asked seeing that the mafioso had followed his gaze what guests youre cute luigi theres a captain and one crew ive never seen either of them before where are we going on a cruise the boat slowed down as the beam of a powerful searchlight shot out from the bridge the mafia soldier unstrapped himself and got up he walked across the deck and down into the lower cabin evan could hear him on an intercom but with the wind and the slapping waves was unable to make out the words moments later the man returned in his hand was a gun a standard issue colt automatic suppressing the panic he felt kendrick thought of the sharks of qatar and wondered if another mahdi across the world was about to carry out the sentence of death pronounced in bahrain if it was to be evan made the same decision he had made in bahrain he would fight better a quick expeditious bullet in the head than the prospect of drowning or being torn apart by maneaters of the pacific were here congressman said the mafioso courteously where is here damned if i know its some kind of island kendrick closed his eyes giving thanks to whoever cared to accept them and began to breathe without trembling again the hero of oman was a fraud he reflected he simply did not care to die and fear aside there was khalehla the love that had eluded him all his life was his and every additional minute he was permitted to live was a minute of hope from the looks of you i dont think you really need that he said nodding his head at the weapon not from your press reports replied the secret service guard positioned by the upper ranks of the underworld im going to unbuckle you but if you make any sudden moves you wont set foot on land capisce motto bene dont blame me ive been given my instructions when you provide a service you accept reasonable orders evan heard the snaps and felt the wide cloth straps loosening around his arms and legs has it occurred to you that if you carried out those orders you might never get back to san diego he asked certainly answered the mafioso casually thats why weve got the viper in a vice viper in a vice acceptable alliteration wouldnt you say i wouldnt know im a construction engineer not a poet and ive got a gun in my hand which means im not a poet either so behave congressman i assume viper is the vice president yes and he said hed heard the name and it was an insult can you imagine those fuckers had the moral turpitude to bug our unit im appalled replied kendrick rising awkwardly from the metal chair and shaking his arms and legs restoring circulation easy cried the secret service man leaping back his levelled at evans head you try sitting in that damned thing for as long as i did the way i did and think youre going to walk a straight line okay okay then walk a crooked line over there to the side of this fancy tug to the steps thats where youre getting off the yacht circled in what appeared to be a cove then in fits and startswith sputtering forward and reverse screwsbanked into a dock perhaps a hundred feet in length with three additional boats each smaller faster more powerful bobbing on the other side shaded wiremeshed lights illuminated the watery berth as two figures raced out of darkness from the base of dry ground stationing themselves beside the appointed pylons as the boat was expertly manoeuvred into its tyreprotected resting place lines were thrown fore and aft the stern line whipped over by the mafioso the weapon in his left hand the bow line by the lone crewman off he yelled at kendrick as the yacht bounced gently into the dock id like to personally thank the captain for a safe and pleasant trip very funny said the secret service man but save it for the movies and get the hell off youre not going to see anybody you want to bet luigi you want your balls on the deck and the names not luigi how about reginald off evan walked down the island pier towards the sloping ground and an ascending stone path the mafioso behind him he passed between two signs both hand painted white lettering on stained brown wood each done tastefully professionally the sign on the left was in spanish the one on the right in english pasaje a china propiedad privada alarmas passage to china private property alarms hold it there ordered the secret service man dont turn around look straight ahead kendrick heard the sound of running feet on the dock then quiet voices the distinguishable words spoken in english but with hispanic accents instructions were being given okay continued the mafioso go up the path and take the first right dont turn around evan obeyed although he walked with difficulty up the sharp incline the long constricting trip on the yacht had severely numbed his legs he tried to study the surroundings in the semidarkness the shaded lights from the dock only barely compensated by small amber lamps lining the stone path the foliage was lush and thick and damp trees everywhere rose to heights of twenty perhaps thirty feet with heavy vines that appeared to spring from one trunk to another arms enveloping arms and bodies clusters of bushes and undergrowth had been cut back and down with precision forming identical waisthigh walls on both sides of the path order had been imposed on the wild then his vision was sharply reduced by the steep ascent and the growing darkness away from the pier and sounds became the focus what assaulted his ears were not unlike the sounds of the incessant staccato eruptions of the rapids during his runs in the white water but these had a beat of their own a pulse that controlled their own particular thunder waves of course waves crashing against rocks and never very far away or perhaps amplified by echoes bouncing up from stone and reverberating through the wild greenery the groundlevel amber lights divided into two sets of parallel lines one heading straight ahead and up the other to the right kendrick turned into the latter heading across the path levelled off a ridge cut out of the hill when suddenly there was an alarming increase in visibility black shafts and swelling shadows became dark trunks and spotted palms and tangled bluegreen underbrush directly ahead was a cabin lights shining through two windows flanking a central door it was not however an ordinary cabin and at first evan did not know why he thought so then as he drew closer he understood it was the windows he had never seen any like them and they accounted for the burst of light when the source appeared to be minimal the bevelled glass was at least four inches thick like two huge rectangular prisms magnifying the interior light many times its candlepower and there was something else that accompanied this imaginative feat of design the windows were impenetrable from both sides thats your suite congressman said the secret service man who provided extraofficial services your own villa describes it better doesnt it i really couldnt accept such generous accommodation why dont you find me something a little less pretentious youre a regular comedian go on over and open the door theres no key no key surprises you doesnt it laughed the mafioso me too until that guard explained everythings elettronico ive got a little widget like a garage opener and when i press a button a couple of steel bars slide out of the frame and back into the door they work inside too with time i might have figured that out for myself youre cool congressman not as cool as i should have been said kendrick walking down the path to the door and opening it his eyes greeted the rustic splendour of a wellappointed new england mountain retreat in no way reminiscent of southern california or northern mexico the walls consisted of bulging logs plastered together two thick windows on each of the four walls a break in the centre of the rear wall obviously for a bathroom every convenience had been considered a kitchen area was located at the far right complete with a mirrored bar on the far left was a kingsized bed and in front of it seating quarters with a large television set and several quilted armchairs the builder in evan concluded that the small house belonged more properly in a winter snowladen vermont than in the waters somewhere south and west of tijuana still it was bucolically charming and he had no doubt that many guests on the island enjoyed it but it had another purpose it was also a prison cell very pleasant said bollingers guard walking into the large single room his weapon constantly but unobtrusively levelled at kendrick how about a drink congressman he asked heading for the recessed mirrored bar i dont know about you but i could use one why not replied evan looking around the room designed for a northern climate whats your pleasure canadian and ice thats all said kendrick moving slowly from area to area examining the interior construction of the cabin his practised eye seeking flaws that might lead to a way out there were none the place was airtight escape proof the window sashes were secured not with recessed magnesium nails but with bolts concealed by layered plaster the front door had internal hinges impossible to reach without a powerful drill and finally walking into the bathroom he saw that it was windowless the two vents small grilled apertures four inches wide great little hideaway isnt it said the mafioso greeting evan with his drink as he emerged from the bathroom so long as you dont miss sightseeing replied kendrick his eyes aimlessly straying over to the kitchen area something was odd he considered but again nothing specific came to him aware of the guards weapon he passed the mirrored bar and went to a darkstained oval oak table where presumably meals were served it was perhaps six or seven feet in front of a long counter in the centre of which a stove had been inserted beneath a line of cabinets the sink and the refrigerator separated by another counter were against the right wall what was it that bothered him then he saw a small microwave oven built in below the last cabinet on the left he looked back at the stove that was it electric everything was electric that was the oddity in the vast majority of rustic cabins propane gas was piped in from portable tanks outside to eliminate the need for electricity for such appliances as stoves and ovens the maxim was to keep the amperage as low as possible not so much because of expense but for convenience in case of electrical malfunctions then he thought of the lamps on the pier and the amber ground lights along the paths electricity an abundance of electricity on an island at least twenty if not fifty miles away from the mainland he was not sure what it all meant but it was something to think about he walked out of the designated kitchen zone and over to the living room area he looked down at the large television set and wondered what kind of antenna was required to pull signals across so many miles of open water he sat down now only barely aware of his armed escort his mind on so many other things includingpainfullykhalehla back at the hotel she had expected him hours ago what was she doing what could she do evan raised his glass and drank several swallows of the whisky grateful for the warming sensation that spread quickly through him he looked over at bollingers guard who stood casually by the stained oak table his weapon confidently on top of it but on the edge near his free right hand your health said the man from the mafia raising the glass in his left hand why not without returning the courtesy kendrick drank again feeling the quick warming effects of the whisky no it was too quick too harsh not warming but burning objects in the room suddenly pulsed in and out of focus he tried to get up from the chair but he could not control his legs or his arms he stared at the obscenely grinning mafioso and started to shout but no sound came he heard the glass shattering on the hard wood floor and felt a terrible weight pressing down on him for the second time that night the darkness came as he kept falling falling into an infinite void of black space the secret service man crossed to an intercom console built into the wall next to the mirrored bar frowning in thought he pressed the three numbers he had been given on the boat yes cottage answered a soft male voice your boys asleep again good were ready for him ive got to inquire said the wellspoken capo why did we bring him to in the first place medical procedure not that its any of your business i wouldnt take that attitude if i were you we are owed and youre the debtors all right without a medical history there are acceptable and unacceptable limits of dosage two moderate applications rather than a single excessive one something like that our doctor is very experienced in these things if hes the same one keep him out of sight hes on kendricks death list and send down your hispanics im not contracted for hauling bodies certainly and dont concern yourself about that doctor he was on another list mj hes still not back and its threefifteen in the morning cried khalehla into the phone have you learned anything nothing that makes sense replied the director of special projects his voice thin and weary i havent called you because i thought you were getting some rest dont lie to me uncle mitch youve never had a problem telling me to work all night thats evan out there i know i know did he mention anything to you about meeting someone in balboa park no i dont think he knows what it is or where it is do you of course my grandparents live here remember do you know a place called the balthazar its a coffeehouse for hotheads arab hotheads to be exact students mostly i was there once and never went back why do you ask let me explain said payton after your call several hours ago we reached bollingers houseas kendricks office of coursesaying we had an urgent message for him we were told hed left around nine oclock which contradicted your information that he hadnt returned by eleven at best its a thirtyminute drive from the vice presidents home to your hotel so i contacted gingerbreadshapoffhes terribly good in these situations he tracked everything down including the driver of evans car our congressman asked to be let off at balboa park so gingerbread did his thing and rustled up the neighbourhood as he phrased it what he learned can be put in two enigmatic conclusions one a man fitting evans description was seen walking in balboa park two a number of people inside the balthazar have stated that this same man wearing dark glasses entered the establishment and stood for a long time by the cardamom coffee machines before going to a table mitch screamed khalehla im looking at his dark glasses now theyre on the bureau he sometimes wears them during the day so he wont be recognized but never at night he says they draw attention at night and hes right about that that man wasnt evan its a setup theyre holding him somewhere hardball said payton quietly well have to get into the game kendrick opened his eyes as a person does who is unsure of where he is or what condition he is in or even whether he is awake or still asleep there was only bewilderment clouds of confusion swirling about in his head and a numbness caused by frightening uncertainty a lamp was on somewhere its glow washing the beamed ceiling he moved his hand lifting his right arm off the unfamiliar bed in the unfamiliar room he studied both hand and arm then suddenly swiftly he raised his left arm what had happened he swung his legs off the bed and unsteadily stood up equal parts of terror and curiosity gripping him gone were the thick corduroy trousers and the coarse black denim shirt he was dressed in his own clothes in his navy blue suit his congressional suit as he frequently and humorously referred to it the suit he had worn to bollingers house and his white shirt and striped regimental tie all freshly cleaned and laundered what had happened where was he where was the wellappointed rustic cabin with the allelectric appliances and the recessed mirrored bar this was a large bedroom he had never seen before slowly regaining balance he moved about the strange surroundings a part of him wondering if he was living a dream or had just lived one previously he saw a pair of tall narrow french doors he walked rapidly over and opened them they led out to a small balcony large enough for a couple to have coffee on but no more than that a miniature round table and two wroughtiron chairs had been placed for such a ritual he stood in front of the waisthigh railing and looked out over the darkened grounds dark except for a practically nonexistent moon and the parallel lines of amber lights that branched off in various directions and something else far in the distance lit up by the dim wash of floodlights was a fenced area not unlike an immense wire cage within it there appeared to be blocks of massive machinery some of it jet black and glistening others chrome or silver equally shimmering in the dull cloudcovered moonlight evan concentrated on the sight then turned his head to listen there was a steady uninterrupted hum and he knew he had found the answer to a question that had confused him he did not have to see the signs that read danger high voltage they were there the wireenclosed machinery were components of a huge generator undoubtedly fed by giant underground tanks of fuel and fields of photovoltaic cells to capture the solar energy of the tropic sun below the balcony was a sunken brick patio the drop twentyfive feet or more which meant a twisted ankle or a broken leg if a person tried to leave that way kendrick studied the exterior walls the nearest drainpipe was at the corner of the structure far out of reach and there were no vines that could be scaled only sheer stucco blankets sheets tied firmly together he could handle a drop of eight to ten feet if he hurried he suddenly stopped all movement ended all thoughts of racing into the room and to the bed as a figure appeared walking down an amberlit path on the right a rifle strapped over his shoulder he raised his arm a signal evan looked to the left a second man was signalling back patrols acknowledging each other kendrick pulled his watch up to his eyes trying to read the second hand in the dull night light if he could time the sentries coordinates have everything prepared again he was forced to stop what plans his desperation created the bedroom door opened and the reality that was was now confirmed i thought i heard you moving around said the secret service man from the ranks of the mafia and i should have realized the room was bugged said evan coming in from the balcony you keep getting things wrong congressman this is a guest room in the main house you think these people would listen in on their guests private conversations or their perfectly natural indulgences together i think theyd do anything otherwise how did you know i was up easy answered the mafioso crossing to the bureau against the far right wall and picking up a small flat object from the top one of these theyre provided for people with infants my sister in new jersey wont go anywhere without themthey come in pairs plug it in one room then plug it in another room and you can hear the child screaming let me tell you her children scream a lot you can hear them in manhattan very enlightening when did i get my clothes back i dont know the hispanics took care of you not me perhaps you were raped and dont know it again enlightening have you any idea what youve done what youre involved in youve abducted a notunknown holder of government office a member of the house of representatives good lord you make it sound like snatching the maitre dhotel at vinnies pasta palace youre not amusing you are interrupted the guard removing his automatic from a shoulder holster youre also on call congressman youre wanted downstairs suppose i refuse the invitation then i blow a hole through your stomach and kick a corpse down the stairs whichever i really dont care im being paid for a service not a guaranteed delivery take your choice hero the room was a naturalists nightmare the heads of slain animals hung from the white stucco walls their false eyes reflecting the panic of impending death skins of leopard tiger and elephant were the upholstery neatly stretched and brasstacked over chairs and couches if nothing else it was an assertion of the power of mans bullet over unsuspecting wildlife and not so much imposing as sad as sad as the hollow triumphs of the victors the secret service guard had opened the door gestured for kendrick to go inside and then closed it remaining in the hallway once the initial effect of the room wore off evan realized that a man was seated at a large desk only the back of his head visible several moments after the door closed as if to make certain they were alone the man turned around in the swivel chair weve never met congressman said crayton grinell in his soft pleasant lawyers cadence and discourteous as it may appear i prefer to remain nameless please sit down theres no reason to be more uncomfortable than necessary its why your clothes were returned to you i gather they served their purpose in a place called balboa park kendrick sat down in a chair in front of the desk the seat was covered with leopard skin providing us with options yes agreed grinell i see evan suddenly recognized the distinctive voice he knew he had heard before it was on the blond europeans tape recording the man in front of him was the vanished crayton grinell the attorney responsible for wholesale death in cyprus killer of the secretary of state but since you dont want me to know who you are am i to infer that one of those options might find me back in san diego quite possibly but i must emphasize the questionable part im being frank with you so were your friends at bollingers house im sure they were and so were you did you have to do it do what kill an old man we had nothing to do with that besides hes not dead he will be so will we all one day it was a gratuitously stupid act as stupid as her husbands incredible financial manipulations in zurich we may be many things congressman but were not stupid however were wasting time the vanvlanderens are gone and whatever happened is buried with them the erstwhile dr lyons will never be seen again i want him kendrick broke in but we got him and he got the maximum penalty a court can impose how can i be sure of that how can you doubt it could the vice president could any of us tolerate the association we deeply regret whats happened to mr weingrass but we had absolutely nothing to do with it i repeat the doctor and the vanvlanderens are gone its all a closed book can you accept that was it necessary to drug me and bring me out here to convince me we couldnt very well leave you in san diego saying the things you were saying then what are we talking about now another book replied grinell leaning forward in the chair we want it back and in exchange youre free youll be returned to your hotel in your own clothes and nothings changed its daytime in zurich a line of credit to the amount of fifty million dollars has been established in your name stunned evan tried not to show his astonishment another book im not sure i follow you varak stole it who milos varak the european his sudden recognition of the name unconsciously slipped out it was the milos inver brasss very professional very dead lackey inver who your wouldbe promoters congressman you dont think you got where you are by yourself do you i knew someone was pushing me pushing catapulting is more like it meddling lunatics they didnt realize that one of them was also one of us what makes you think the european that this varaks dead asked evan if only to gain moments to adjust to revelations that were coming too fast it was in the papernot listing him by name of course but unmistakable but before he died he was somewhere else with someone else who worked for us he had to be or he never would have come to the airport he stole it this other book said kendrick hesitantly an industrially coded ledger meaningless to any but a selected few and you think i have it a statement i think you know where it is why because in his zeal varak would have mistakenly believed it should be in your hands he couldnt trust inver brass any longer because he learned that one of them was also one of you essentially yes said grinell im hypothesizing of course its a professional habit but its served me well over the years not this time i dont know anything about it i wouldnt lie if i were you congressman it would be futile in any event there are so many ways of loosening minds and mouths these days he couldnt allow drugs under them he would reveal everything signing khalehlas death warrant as well as giving the contributors all the information they needed to mount their individual smoke screens and in other cases disappear the dying manny deserved better than that if ever he needed credibility it was now he was back in another compound not in masqat but on an island in the waters of mexico he had to be every bit as convincing as he was among the terrorists for these men these killers from the boardrooms were no less than terrorists themselves listen to me said evan firmly leaning back and crossing his legs his eyes levelled on grinell you can think whatever the hell you care to think but i dont want the vice presidency i want a fiftymilliondollar line of credit in zurich do i make myself clear clear and recorded naturally good fine run a full scam on me and put it on videotape but you see it is interrupted the attorney excellent then were both in the same hot tub arent we same tub congressman so wheres the ledger i havent the vaguest idea but if this varak sent it to me i know how you can get it ill call my office in washington and tell my secretary annie oreilly to express it out overnight to wherever you like the two negotiators stared at each other neither wavering for an instant thats a fair solution said grinell finally if you can think of a better one use it thats even fairer am i on board on board and on your way to zurich replied grinell smiling once you settle certain items on our agenda like chicago the telegram will go out in the morning ill have oreilly send it from the office with a copy to our esteemed vice president of course of course the chairman of the contributors board of directors sighed audibly pleasantly oh how venal we all are he said you for instance congressman youre a bundle of contradictions your public persona would never accept our accommodation if this is for the benefit of your videotape let me make a statement i was burned and did my best to put out the fires in oman because they had burned me killing a great many friends i see no contradiction of issues so recorded representative kendrick suddenly without any indication whatsoever the quiet conference was broken apart by a combination of signals a bright red light started flashing from the console of the radio telephone on the desk and a muted siren came from somewhere in the stuccoed walls probably from the mouth of a dead animal the door crashed open and the tall figure of the deeply tanned captain of the boat the laconic angry weed from the town of corruption burst into the room what are you doing roared grinell get that fart out of here the yachtsman yelled i thought he was a trap from the beginning and i was right there are government people dispatched by washington all over bollingers place looking for him questioning everyone as if they were in a police lineup what were handling that but weve got a bigger problem the ledger bollinger got a call its with the bitchs own lawyer shut up commanded grinell hes talking ten million which she told him her andyboy promised her now he wants it i told you to shut up what did you mean that the federal men were questioning everyone just what i said theyre not only grilling them they got search warrants they wont find anything but not for lack of trying in the vice presidents house its unheard of theyre playing it smart theyre telling bollinger that theyre protecting him from his subordinates but no ones going to convince me the yachtsman turned on evan that son of a bitch was sent in to trap us the heros word against everybody elses grinell stared at kendrick there cant be a heros word if theres no hero adiós congressman grinell touched a button on the side of his desk and the door to the huge room of dead animals opened once again the mafiosos automatic waved back and forth as he entered cautiously take him out ordered the attorney the mexicans will tell you where you really fooled me congressman ill remember the lesson beware the persuasive philosophical turncoat the sound of the waves crashing against the islands rockbound coastline below grew louder as they walked down the amber lit path ahead the ground lights came to an end and a white barrier was starkly in place between the final domed lamps the amber wash illuminating the letters of the two signs on the white obstruction the left was again in spanish the right in english pellagra danger beyond the barrier was a promontory overlooking the sea the angry waters churning in the erratic moonlight the sound of the crashing waves now deafening kendrick was being led to his execution the icarus agenda chapter pockets of swirling vapour spewed up from the rocks of the promontory above the pacific evan suppressed his panic remembering his covenant with himself he would not die passively he would not be killed without a struggle no matter how futile yet even lastditch efforts presumed the outside possibility of survival and he had spent his adult life studying the complexities of specifics there were tropical vines all around him thick and strong from the moisture and the winds constantly assaulting their trunks there was lush undergrowth on both sides of the string of amber bulbs and loose wet dirt within that twisted foliage mud that never knew a dry moment the mexican who had directed the mafioso to the killing ground was a reluctant partner to murder his voice grew fainter as they approached the final steps towards the white barrier defrente defrente he cried nervously adelanto go over it or around it congressman said the secret service man his tone cold a professional doing his professional job someone for whom life and death meant nothing i cant answered kendrick its too high to step over and theres some kind of barbed wire spreading out from the sides where here kendrick pointed down into the dark undergrowth i dont see now screamed the silent voice inside evans throat as he whipped around both hands surging for the large ugly weapon gripping it and pushing it away as he bent the mafiosos wrist back and crashed his shoulder into the guards chest pulling the arm forward and desperately with all the strength that was in him heaving the man off balance and into the brush and the wet dirt the gun fired the explosion melding with the sounds of the crashing waves below kendrick shoved the weapon into the soft earth and freeing his right hand grabbed a fistful of mud and slapped it into the mafiosos face grinding it into his eyes the guard shouted garbled words of fury trying simultaneously to wipe his eyes and yank the gun out of the earth and evans grip kendrick remained on top of the writhing thrashing killer repeatedly crashing his knee up into the mans groin as his right hand continuously scooped up mud crushing it into the mafiosos eyes and mouth his knuckles struck a hard jagged object a rock it was almost too large for the panicked spread of his fingers but nothing could nothing would stop him straining muscles he had not exerted in months years holding off the convulsive assaults beneath him he pulled the heavy jagged rock out of the mud raised it and crashed it down into the head of his wouldbe executioner the killerguard went limp as the mans body sank into the wet undergrowth and the soft ground evan grabbed the gun and snapped his eyes up towards the mexican the hispanic waiting to see who would live and who would die yards away in the mistladen shadowed foliage crouched backing into an amber lamp smashing it with his foot seeing the survivor he spun around digging his feet into the path to run stop yelled kendrick breathlessly leaping up and lurching out of the bordering overgrowth stop or ill kill you you understand me well enough for that the mexican stopped turning slowly in the wash of light to face evan i am no part of these things señor he said in surprisingly clear english you mean you dont pull the trigger you just tell them where they can pull it i am no part repeated the man i am a fisherman but there is no decent pay on the boats these days i make my pesos and go home to my family in el descanso do you want to see your family again si very much replied the hispanic his lips and hands trembling if this is what happens i will not come back are you telling me its never happened before never señor then how did you know the way shouted kendrick against the sound of the wind and the crashing waves he was regaining his breath gradually aware of the mud that covered him and the pain everywhere inside him we are brought here and given maps of the island which we must know completely in two days or we are sent home why for multiple executions i told you no señor these are drug watersnarcoticosand very dangerous mexican and american patrols can be summoned quickly but still the island must be guarded summoned quickly the owner is a powerful man is his name grinell i do not know sir all i know is the island itself you speak fluent english why didnt you speak english before evan gestured towards the dead mafioso to him i say it again i wanted no part i was told where to take you and as we grew closer i began to understand no part señor but i have my family back in el descanso and the men who come here are powerful men evan stared at the man in indecision it would be easy so easy to end his life and eliminate a risk yet there was a glimmer of opportunity as well if the frightened mexican was not a liar kendrick knew he was negotiating for his life but there was another life involved too and it made the negotiation easier you understand he said drawing closer to the man raising his voice to be heard clearly that if you go back down to the house without him and he doesnt appear or they find his dead body up here or washed up on the rocks youll be killed you do understand that dont you the mexican nodded twice si but if i dont kill you youve got a chance dont you asked evan raising the mafiosos gun the member of staff closed his eyes and nodded once so its in the best interests of you and your family back in el descanso to join me isnt it si the mexican opened his eyes join you in what getting out of hereaway from here theres a boat down at that dock next to a fuel tank its large enough to handle the trip they have other boats interrupted the executioners guide they go faster than the government drug boats and there is a helicopter with powerful searchlights what where down near the beach on the other side of the island there is a cement landing ground are you a pilot señor i wish i were whats your name emilio are you coming with me i have no choice i want to leave here and go home to my family and move to a town in the mountains otherwise i die and they will go hungry i warn you if you give me any reason to think youre lying youll never see el descanso or your family it is understood stay at my side first i want to check out my hangman your what señor my friendly executioner lets go weve got a lot to do and not much time to do it to the boat not yet said kendrick a vague fragmented plan coming into abstract focus were going to disrupt this goddamned island not just for you and me but for everybody everybody is there a tool sheda place where they keep things like shovels picks hedge clippers those kinds of things the mantenimiento answered emilio for the gardeners although we are often required to assist them well make a stop first then take me there continued evan moving awkwardly and in pain back to the dead mafioso come on we must be careful señor i know the guards how many are there two on each of the four passable beach areas and the pier ten for each shift all carry radio alarms that set off sirenasvery loud sirens how long are the shifts asked kendrick bending over the corpse of the secret service man twelve hours twenty guardas and four jardinerosgardeners those not on duty are in what they call the barracks it is a long building north of the main house where are the tools in a metal garage fifty metres south of the generador the generator si good evan removed the mafiosos wallet and black plastic identification case then went through the mudsoaked pockets finding more than a thousand dollars undoubtedly not from a federal payroll finally he took out the small electronic key that released the bolts and opened the door of the cabincell in the woods lets go he repeated rising with difficulty from the soft wet earth and undergrowth they started down the path of amber ground lamps una momenta whispered emilio the lights kick them out señor the more darkness the better we are good thinking agreed kendrick heading back with the mexican to the white barrier where they proceeded to crush each succeeding domed bulb on both sides they reached the main island path that on the left led down to the boats and the dock on the right up to the manor house on the top of the hill with an offshoot leading to the escape proof rustic cabin evan and the mexican raced from one lamp to another demolishing each until they came to the cabin path that way ordered kendrick rushing ahead to the right forget the lights well take them out on our way back la cabaña hurry up once again the startling magnified wash of light from the thick bevelled windows illuminated the clearing in front of the small solid house evan approached the door and pressed a green button on the electronic key he heard the bolts slap back into the frame he turned the knob and went inside get in here he called to emilio the mexican did as he was told and kendrick closed the door pressing the red button locking it he ran to the kitchen area opening drawers and cabinets one after another selecting items that struck him as useful a torch a large carving knife and several smaller knives a meat cleaver three small tins of sterno solid fuel a box of camping matchescoated with paraffin strikable on any hard surfaceand a stack of folded towels with everything on the oval oak table he glanced over at emilio who was watching him he picked up one of the knives the handle extended and held it out for the mexican i hope you dont have to use this but if you do dont miss there are men i could not kill without reasoning with them first for they are as desperate as myself for employment but there are others the ones who have been here longest i would have no such problems goddamn you you cant have any problems if one alarm is raised no alarms will be raised by my friends señor not if they know it is i emilio besides most of them are in the barracks asleep they use the veteranos for the night patrols they fear the boats at night youd better be right i wish to go home believe that take some towels a can of fuel and a handful of matches hurry picking up the remaining items and putting them in his pockets kendrick left the meat cleaver until last he gripped it went to the intercom console on the wall and standing sideways sliced the heavy blade into the back of the equipment prising it off the wall and out of its recess get the two lamps over there he said to the mexican smash them ill do the stove lights and the lamp on the other side of the room less than a minute later the two desperate men were out on the path the previously brightly lit clearing in front of the cabin now eerily dark the toolsthe gardeners tools take me to them con mucho cuidado we must be careful going around the big house we will put out the path lights only up to where i say from the second level those in the house can see they are not on and there will be alarms if there are patrols let me study them first lets go theyve got problems up there but pretty soon someones going to wonder where my executioner is hurry up they smashed the amber lamps up to a ridge that preceded the level ground of the huge manor housegreat house thought evan thinking of the tropic zone and the great houses of the caribbean the mexican suddenly grabbed kendricks arm and pulled him through the bordering foliage of the path then pushed his shoulder down gripping the flesh the message was clear crouch and be still a guard his rifle strapped over his shoulder passed them on the path going in the opposite direction now quickly señor there is no one until the back galena where they drink wine and smoke fish a large patio with a barbecue pit thought evan following emilio through the thick greenery wishing he had a machete to cut through the vines but grateful for the strangely ever present sound of the wind and the crashing waves they circled down and around the house another sound intruding it was the massive generator its hum constant basstoned awesome the engineer in kendrick tried to calculate the power it produced and the fuel it consumed and the auxiliary input of the necessary field of photovoltaic cellsit was mindblowing he had installed generators from bahrain to the western deserts of saudi arabia but they were temporary to be used only until electricity could be cabled in nothing like this again the mexican gripped evans shoulder now more fiercely his hand trembling and again they crouched in the undergrowth behind the long clipped wall of shrubbery kendrick looked up and with sudden fear understood ahead to the left above the hedgelike border of the path a guard had heard something or seen something his upper body was clearly visible in the glow of the amber lights he moved forward rapidly snapping the rifle off his shoulder and levelling it in front of him he walked directly towards them then only feet away he poked the barrel of the weapon into the brush quien es shouted the patrol suddenly lashing out and pouncing like an angry cat emilio shot up grabbing the rifle and pulling the guard through the foliage there was an abrupt expunging of air that cut off the start of a scream the man fell into the greenery the base of his throat a mass of blood the knife was in emilios right hand good god whispered evan as he and the mexican dragged the body farther into the brush i had no problem with this perrol said emilio this dog smashed the head of a boy a young gardener who would not accommodate him if you understand señor i understand and i also understand that you just saved our lives wait a minute the rifle his cap we can save time there are no uniforms here just work clothesthe weapon is the uniform put on the cap and strap the rifle over your shoulder then walk out there and ill stay as close to you as i can over here if its quicker for me to go on the path myself you can make sure its clear bueno said the mexican reaching for the cap and the weapon if i am stopped i will say that this perro forced me to replace him for an hour or so they will laugh but no one will doubt it i go stay close and when i tell you come through the bushes and walk at my side not in front and not in back but at my side do you speak spanish not well enough to talk to anyone then say nothing stay close emilio broke through the bordering hedge the rifle over his shoulder and started down the path thrashing against the dark tangled greenery kendrick did his best to keep pace every now and then whispering to the mexican to slow down once at a particularly thick area evan removed the meat cleaver from his belt and hacked at a webbed mass of tropical vines only to hear emilio cry out under his breath silencio then he heard another command now señor come out and walk with me quickly kendrick did so forcing his way through the bushes and joined the mexican who suddenly emphatically began accelerating his strides down the sloping path is going this fast such a good idea asked evan breathlessly if were seen someone might think we were running while on duty we have come to the back of the main house answered emilio rushing forward there is no one here at this hour but two guards on different paths who meet at the stone galena then go back over the hill and down to the beaches it takes them many minutes and they have just left we can run across the galena and up the far path then through the woods to the mantenimiento the tools señor they reached a sunken brick patio the same patio kendrick had studied from the small balcony of the guest room above he remembered the two guards signalling each other from the bases of the opposing paths the mexican who was now very much in charge grabbed evans arm and nodded to his left breaking into a run they raced down into the sunken patio which was far larger than kendrick had realized it extended the length of the house itself and white wroughtiron furniture had been placed around the central area in front of a large brick barbecue pit they ran by the side of the house under the balconies then sprinted across and up the south path of amber lights to a flat area bordered by tall grass a knoll overlooking the ocean and two beaches separated by a rockfilled coastline perhaps six hundred feet below the amber lights were now behind them nothing in front but a narrow descending dirt road from this vantage point a great deal of the back part of the island could be seen in the sporadic moonlight directly on the right no more than three hundred yards away and washed in floodlights was the enormous generator beyond the fenced enclosure were the blurred outlines of a long low building emilios barracks evan assumed then far below just above the beach on the right its white concrete standing out like a huge flat beacon was the helipad with a large military helicopter resting in placepainted in civilian colours and with mexican identification but unmistakably united states military come whispered emilio and say nothing for voices are heard on this side of the island the mexican started down a dark unlit path cut out of the woods a forest alleyway used only in daylight and then thinking about emilios words kendrick realized what was missing the sound of the wind and the crashing waves had all but vanishedvoices would carry across the calm of these acres and a helicopter could manoeuvre into its threshold with minimum difficulty the metal garage emilio referred to was an apt description but far larger than any garage evan had ever seen except for those outsized sterilized padded structures housing an arabian royal familys various limousines conversely this was an ugly mass of corrugated aluminium with several tractors assorted power mowers chain saws and clipping machines none useful because of the noise they would make on the side wall and the floor below however were more practical objects they included a row of petrol cans and above on hooks and suspended between nails axes hatchets scythes longhandled wire cutters machetes and telescoped rubberhandled tree clippersall the tools required to hold back the tropical foliage from its incredibly swift takeover the decisions were minor instinctive and simple the meat cleaver went in favour of a hatchet and a machetefor both himself and emilio added to these were the wire cutters one full can of petrol and one tenfoot extension tree clipper everything else from the cabin remained in their pockets the helicopter said kendrick there is a path joining the north and south roads below the generador hurry the guards have reached the beaches by now and will soon start back they ran out of the gardeners warehouse and over to the first dirt road their tools precariously held by belts in their hands and under their clenched arms with emilio leading they darted across into the border of high grass and worked their way down to the narrow path heading across the sloping hill cigarrillo whispered the mexican shoving evan back into the still reeds of grass a bobbing lighted cigarette glowed as the guard trudged up the hill and passed them less than eight feet away come cried emilio softly as the figure of the guard reached the knoll above crouching they raced to the north road there was no sign of the second patrol so they walked out and began their descent to the concrete helicopter pad the huge repainted military aircraft stood like a silent behemoth about to strike out at an enemy only it could see in the night taut heavy chains were looped around the landing mounts and anchored in cement no sudden storms from the sea would move the chopper unless they were strong enough to tear it apart kendrick approached the enormous machine as emilio stayed in the grass by the road watching for the return of the guard prepared to warn his american companion evan studied the aircraft with only one thought in mind immobilize it and do so without making a sound loud enough to be carried up the quiet island slope nor could he use his torch in the darkness the beam would be spotted cables on top under the rotor blades and in the tail assembly gripping first a door handle then the frame of a window he pulled himself up in front of the flight deck the longhandled wire cutters protruding from his trousers in seconds he had crawled over the pilots curving windshield to the top of the fuselage unsteadily cautiously he made his way on his hands and knees to the base of the rotor machinery he pulled out the wire cutters stood up and three minutes later had severed those cables he could see in the dark night light the whistle was sharp and brief it was emilios signal the guard had come over the crest of the hill and would reach the helicopter pad above the beach in barely minutes the engineer in kendrick was not satisfied had he immobilized the aircraft or merely wounded it he had to reach the tail assembly it was his backup in this mechanical age where every machine that went airborne had backup after backup in case of inflight malfunctions he crawled down the fuselage as rapidly as possible without risking his balance and sliding off plummeting twenty feet to the white concrete he reached the sloping tail and could see nothing everything was encased in metal no not everything straddling the sleek body while holding on to the rising tail he leaned over and spotted two thick ropelike cables that branched off into the right aileron working furiously his sweat dripping and rolling down the shiny metal he could feel the wire cutters doing their work as succeeding strands of the top cable sprang loose suddenly there was a loud snaptoo loud a massive crack in the still nightas a whole louvred section of the aileron thumped down into a vertical position he had done it his backup was secure running feet shouts from below que cosa que dese beneath the tail assembly the guard stood on the concrete his rifle angled up in his right arm aimed at evan while his left hand reached for the radio alarm clipped to his belt the icarus agenda chapter it could not happen as if he had suddenly lost all balance all control kendrick raised his arms as he slid off the fuselage crashing the wire cutters down into the stock of the rifle the guard started to cry out in pain as the weapon was whipped out of his arm to the ground but before the scream could reach a crescendo emilio was on him crashing the blunt end of his hatchet into the mans skull can you move the mexican asked evan whispering we must leave here quickly the other guard will run over to this side writhing on the concrete evan nodded his head and struggled to his feet picking up the wire cutters and the rifle as he rose get him out of here he said instantly realizing that he did not have to give the order emilio was dragging the unconscious man across the helipad into the tall grass limping his left ankle and his right knee burning with pain kendrick followed i have made a mistake said the mexican shaking his head and still whispering we have only one chance i watched you as you walked we can never reach the dock and the boats without being seen before the other guard will understand he has no compaüero emilio pointed to his oblivious countryman in the darkness i must be him and get close enough before the other one realizes i am not hell shout first ask you what happened whatll you say i stepped into the grass to relieve myself and struck a large sharp rock in my haste i will limp as you are limping and offer to show him where i bleed can you get away with it pray to the virgin that i can otherwise we both die the mexican rose and slung the rifle over his shoulder one request please he added this guarda is not a bad man and he has family in el suazal where there is no work at all bind his legs and his arms and stuff his mouth with his own clothes i cannot kill him do you know who the other guard is asked evan harshly no suppose you cant kill him either why is it a problem i am a strong fisherman from el descanso when there are boats that will hire me i can bind him myselfor bring back another compañero for us the second option was not to be no sooner had the limping emilio reached the dirt road at the side of the helipad than the south guard came running down as they drew closer there was a brief exchange in spanish then suddenly a vocal eruption from one of the two men and it was not the fisherman from el descanso silence instantly followed and moments later emilio returned no compañero said kendrick not asking a question that snarling rata would claim his mother is a whore if the policia paid him enough would as in the past tense no comprende hes dead dead señor and in the grass also we have less than thirty minutes before the light comes up in the east then lets go your friend is bound to the dock to the boats not yet amigo we have something else to do before we get there i tell you it will be light soon if i do things right therell be a lot more light sooner than that get the gasoline and pick up the tree clippers i cant manage much more than what ive got step by agonizing step evan climbed the narrow dirt road behind the mexican until they reached the islands immense fenceenclosed generator the basstoned hum assaulting their ears to the point of painful vibrations signs of pellagradanger were everywhere and the single gate to the interior was secured by two huge platelocks that apparently took the simultaneous insertion of keys to open limping around into the darkest shadows of the floodlights kendrick gave the order while handing emilio the wire cutters start here and i hope youre as strong as you say you are this is heavygauge fence slice an opening three feets enough and you señor i have to look around he found them three iron discs screwed into concrete thirty feet apart three enormous tanks cisterns for fuel supplemented by banks of photovoltaic cells somewhere which no longer concerned him opening a disc required a tsquared hexagonal wrench its upper bars long enough for two strong men on each bar but there was another way and he knew it well from the desert tanks in saudi arabia an emergency procedure in the event the caravans of fuel trucks forgot the implement not uncommon in the jabal deserts each supposedly impenetrable disc had fourteen ridges across the top not much different from the manhole covers in most american cities although much smaller hammered slowly counterclockwise the circular vaults would loosen until hands and fingers could reach the sides and unscrew them kendrick walked back to emilio and the near deafening island generator the mexican had cut through two parallel vertical lines and was starting at the ground level base come with me said evan shouting into emilios ear have you got your hatchet pues si so do i kendrick led the mexican back to the first iron disc and instructed him how to use the towels from the electronic cabin to muffle the blows from the blunt ends of their hatchets slowly he yelled a spark can set off the fumes comprende no señor its better that you dont easy now one tap at a time not so hard its moving now harder christ no easy amigo as if you were cracking a diamond it has not been my pleasure it will be if we get out of here there its free unscrew it to the top and leave it there give me your towels for what señor ill explain as soon as you get me through that door youre cutting in the fence that will take time youve got about two minutes amigo madre de dies where did you put the gasoline kendrick moved closer to be heard there replied the mexican pointing to the left of the door he was cutting crouching painfully in the shadows evan tied the towels together tugging at each knot to make sure it was secure until he had a single tenfoot length of cloth his body aching with each twisting movement he unscrewed the top of the petrol can and drenched the string of towels squeezing each as if it were a dishcloth in minutes he had a tenfoot fuse his knee now boiling his ankle swelling rapidly he crawled back to the fuel tank dragging the towels at his side straining he prised up the iron cover inserting three feet of fuse and moving the heavy disc off centre so that a flow of air would circulate throughout the black tank below backtracking he pressed each towel each leg of his fuse firmly in the ground sprinkling dirt over each but only dusting them so as to retard the speed of the flame from base to gaseous contact the last towel in place he stoodwondering briefly how long he could standand limped back to emilio the mexican was pulling the heavygauged cutout section of the fence towards him bending it up to permit access into massive glistening machinery that through the dynamoelectrical process converted mechanical energy into electricity thats enough said kendrick bending over to speak close to emilios ear now listen to me carefully and if you dont understand stop me from here on everything is timingsomething happens and we do something else comprende si we move to other places thats about it evan reached into the pocket of his mudencrusted jacket and withdrew the torch take this he continued nodding his head at the hole in the fence im going in there and i hope to hell i know what im doingthese things have changed since i installed thembut if nothing else i can shut it down there may be a lot of noise and big sparks cómo like short bolts of lightning and and sounds like very loud static on the radio do you understand it is enough not enough dont get near the fencedont touch it and at the first crack turn away and shut your eyes with any luck all the lights will go out and when they do shine the torch on the opening in the fence okay okay as soon as i get through to this side swing the light over there kendrick pointed at the last of his knotted towels protruding out of the ground have your rifle over your shoulder and hold out one for mehave you got the cap you took from the first guard if you have give it to me si here emilio took the cap out of his pocket and handed it to evan who put it on when im clear of the fence ill go over there and strike a match setting the towels on fire the second i do that we get out of here to the other side of the road comprende i understand señor into the grass at the other side of the road we hide we hide we work our way up the hill in the grass and when everyone starts running around we join them cómo twentyodd personnel said kendrick checking his pockets and removing the two tins of fuel replacing them in his trousers then ripping the coat off his back and the tie off his neck were only two of them in the dark but well be making our way over the hill and down to the dock with two rifles and a colt i understand here we go said evan as he awkwardly painfully bent down and picked up the rubberhandled tree clipper and a machete he crawled through emilios opening and rose to his feet studying the whirring lifethreatening machinery some things had not changed they never would above on the left bolted into a fifteenfoothigh tarcovered pole was the main transformer the shunt wires carrying the major load of power to the various offshoots the cables encased in rubber conduit at least two inches in diameter to prevent seepage from waterrain and humiditywhich would shortcircuit the load ten feet away on the ground and diagonally opposed above the two black squat main dynamos were the grid plates whirling maniacally on flywheels on top of the machinery changing one field of energy into another protected by a heavy latticework of wire and cooled by the air that had open access he would study them further but not now first things first he thought moving to his left and extending the telescopic tree clipper to its full height above in the floodlights the sawtoothed jaws of the long instrument gripped the upper shunt cable and as he had done with the wire cutters on the tail assembly of the helicopter he worked furiously up and down until his professional instincts told him he was within millimetres of the first layer of coiled copper he gently leaned the extended metal pole against the fence and turned to the first of the two main dynamos if it were merely a question of shorting the islands electrical power he would simply continue slicing into the transformers conduit while gripping the nonconductive rubber handles and let the short take place by angling the metal clipper into the metal fence when he struck cable there would be a brief electrical explosion and all the power terminated however more was at stake he had to face the probability that neither he nor emilio would survive and a damaged transformer cable could be repaired in a matter of minutes he had to inflict more than damage he had to cripple the system he could not know what was happening in san diego he could only give paytons forces time by disabling the machinery to the point where it would take days to replace not repair this island compound this headquarters of a government within a government had to be immobilized isolated without means of communication or departure the transformer was in actuality his backup his far less desirable option but it had to be there and ready to execute time was everything now he approached the dynamo cautiously peering into the enormous wireencased flywheel there was a horizontal space no more than half an inch wide separating the upper and lower screens of thick latticework that kept objects of any size from penetrating the whirring interior that space or something similar was what he had hoped to find the reason for the machete sections of all generators needing air had openings of extremely limited dimensions vertically and horizontally this was his it was either his or he was its in death one slip meant instant electrocution and even if he avoided death by millicounts of high voltage he could be blinded by the exploding streaks of white electric light if he did not turn away in time keeping his eyes tightly closed but if he could do it the islands generator would be shut down for major replacement time time might well be the last gift he had to give he pulled the machete out of his belt sweat pouring down his face despite the wind from the flywheel and inched the blade towards the horizontal space trembling he yanked the machete back he had to steady his hands he could not touch either edge of the narrow space he tried again inserting one inch then two and three he rammed the heavy blade inside snapping back both hands before the blade made contact and lurched to the ground behind him his face and eyes buried under his arms the selfcontained electrical detonations were earshattering and despite his tightly closed eyes white blinding light was everywhere in the darkness the flywheel would not stop it kept chewing up the primitive metal of the machete while spewing out bolts of frankensteinian electrical charges spitting jaggedly violently into the fence kendrick leaped up shielding his eyes and step by cautious step crossed back to the tree clipper its sawtoothed jaws embedded in the transformers conduit he gripped the rubber handles and in desperation crashed them back and forth until the jolt threw him off his feet he had struck the cable proper and the telescoped metal clippers fell into the metal fence the whole generator complex went mad as if its electrical inhabitants were infuriated by mere mans interference with his superior inventions lights went out everywhere but there were still blinding erratic jagged streaks of electrical lightning within the lethal fenced enclosure he had to get out scrambling on his stomach his arms and legs propelling him like a racing spiders he reached the hole in the fence the beam of the torch guiding him through when he got to his feet the rifle was thrust into his hands by emilio matches yelled evan unable to reach his own the mexican gave him a handful while angling the torch over to the last towel kendrick ran limping to his fuse lurching to the ground and striking half a dozen matches on a rock as they flared he threw them on the last towel the flame caught and started its deadly journey slowly relentlessly no more than a glow in the dirt hurry cried emilio helping evan to his feet and leading him not to the path back to the dirt road but instead into the high grass below many have come out of the house and are running down pronto señor they raced literally diving into the grass as a swarm of panicked men most with rifles approached the blinding erupting generator shielding their eyes and shouting at one another during the chaos kendrick and his mexican companion crawled through the grass below the terrorstricken crowd they reached the road as another equally stupefied stream of men came rushing out of the long low building that was the staffs barracks most were only half dressed many in undershorts and not a few showing the effects of too much alcohol listen to me whispered evan into emilios ear well get out there carrying our rifles and start up the road keep shouting in spanish as though we were following someones orders now traenes agua roared the mexican as both men sprang out of the grass and joined the stunned screaming crowd from the barracks agua traenes agua they broke through the mass of excited bodies only to be confronted by the panicked contingent from the main house half of whom had cautiously moved down the path to the dying smoking spitting machinery that had been the islands source of power the darkness was awesome made eerie by the maniacal voices shouting everywhere in the dim intermittent moonlight then beams of light shot out from the house above the path cried kendrick head for the main path down to the dock for gods sake hurry that tank will blow any second and therell be a stampede for the boats it is ahead we must pass through the galena christ theyll be at the windows on the balconies there is no other way no quicker way lets go the dirt road stopped replaced by the narrow path that only minutes ago had been bordered by the parallel rows of domed amber lights they ran kendrick lurching in agony down into the sunken patio racing across the bricks to the steps that led to the main path stop roared a deep voice as the beam of a powerful torch swung down on them where are you jesus christ its you evan looked up directly above standing on the short balcony he had stood on barely an hour ago was the outsized yachtsman in his hand was a gun it was being raised aimed at kendrick evan fired his rifle at the same instant the yachtsmans weapon exploded he felt the searing hot bullet slice into his left shoulder hurling him back off his feet he fired again and again as the giant above held his stomach screaming at the top of his lungs its him its kendrick stop the son of a bitch stop him hes going down to the boats kendrick took closer aim and fired a last shot high noon in the town of corruption grabbed his throat arched his neck then fell forward over the railing and down into the brick patio evans eyes began to close the mists swirling about his head no señor you must run get to your feet kendrick felt his arms being pulled out of their sockets and his face being repeatedly harshly slapped you will come with me or you will die and i will not die with you i have loved ones in el descanso what shouted evan saying nothing agreeing to nothing but answering everything as part of the mists cleared his shoulder on fire the blood drenching his shirt he rose and lurched for the steps somehow in the far reaches of his mind remembering the colt he had taken from the mafioso ripping it out of his back pocket tearing the stretched cloth to remove the weapon too large for its recess im with you he cried out to emilio i know replied the mexican slowing his pace and turning around who pulled you up the steps señor you are hurt and the path is dark so i must use the linternathe flashlight suddenly the earth exploded shaking the ground with the impact of a blocksized meteor smashing windows throughout the big house on top of the hill and sending fire up into the night sky the generators fuel tank erupted into the heavens as the two fugitives raced down the path kendrick staggering trying desperately to focus on the wavering beam of light ahead his knee and ankle searing in pain shots gunfire bullets snapped above them around them digging up the earth in front of them emilio switched off the torch and grabbed evans hand it is not much longer now i know the way and i will not let go of you if we ever get away from here youre going to have the biggest fishing boat in el descanso no señor i will move my family to the hills these men will come after me after my nifios how about a ranch the moon abruptly emerged from beyond the rushing lowflying clouds revealing the islands dock barely two hundred feet away the gunfire had ceased it started up again but again the earth seemingly blew apart an isolated galactic mass in frenzy it happened shouted kendrick as they neared the base of the dock señor cried the mexican terrified at the earshattering unexpected detonation panicked by the ball of smoke and the branches of fire that rose beyond the house on the hill this island will go into the sea what happened the second tank blew i couldnt predict i could only hope a single gunshot from the dock emilio was hit he doubled over grabbing his upper thigh as the blood spread through his trousers a man with a rifle moved out of the moonlit shadows fifty feet away raising a handheld intercom to his face evan crouched his whole body now a festering boil and raised his left hand to steady his right and the colt automatic he fired twice one or both of his shots hitting the target the guard reeled dropping both the rifle and the radio he fell on the thick wood planks and was still come on amigo cried kendrick gripping emilios shoulder i cannot travel i have no leg well im not going to die with you you bastard ive got a couple of loved ones too over there get off your ass or swim back to el descanso and your niños como shouted the mexican furiously as he struggled to rise thats better get angry weve both got a lot to be angry about his arm around emilios waist his barely functioning shoulder and legs supporting the mexican the two men walked out on the dark dock the big boat on the right yelled evan grateful that the moon had gone back behind the clouds you know about boats amigo i am a fisherman boats like this asked kendrick propelling emilio over the side on to the deck laying the on the gunwale you dont catch fish on these boats you catch turistas theres another definition es igua still i have run many boats i can try the other boats señor they will come out and find us for they are much faster than this beautiful one could any of them make it to the mainland never they cannot take heavy swells and burn fuel too quickly thirty forty kilometres and they must come back this is the barca for us give me your sterno yelled evan hearing shouts up on the main path the mexican yanked the small tin out of his right pocket as kendrick removed his two and prised up the lids with the carving knife open yours if you can i have here señor i go up to the bridge can you make it i have to el descanso oh christ a key for the engine in these private docks it is customary to leave the key on board in case storms or heavy winds make it necessary to move suppose they didnt all fishermen go out with many drunken captains there are panels to open and wires to cross get the lines señor two ranches said evan as emilio hobbled to the bridge ladder kendrick turned grabbing the colt automatic from the gunwale and digging out the solid fuel of the sterno with his fingers he ran down the dock throwing handfuls over the canvas of each huge speedboat heaving each empty can into each boat at the last boat he reached into his pocket and pulled out a fistful of matches crouching in pain and frantically striking one after another on the wooden planks of the dock and lobbing them into the globs of scattered jelly until the flames leaped up from all the coverings at each speedboat he fired the automatic into the hulls near the water lines the powerful weapon blowing large holes in whatever the light alloy was that permitted the boats their excessive speed emilio had done it the deepthroated roar of the fishing yachts engines broke through the water shouts men were racing down the steep path from the manor house on the hill the fires beyond it now a steady glow señor quickly the lines the ropes on the pylons kendrick ran to the thick pole on the right and struggled with the knotted line it pulled free and slipped into the water he lurched barely able to stay on his feet and reached the second pylon yanking in panic until it too came loose stop them kill them it was the frenzied voice of crayton grinell chairman of the board of a government within the government men swarmed on to the base of the island dock their weapons suddenly on open fire the fusillades shattering evan dived off the pier and into the stern of the yacht as emilio swung the boat to the left engines at full power and curved out of the cove into the darkness of the sea a third and final immense detonation burst over the hill beyond the manor house the distant night sky became a yellow cloud then jagged streaks of white and red intruded the last tank had blown apart the island of the murderous government within a government was immobilized isolated incommunicado no one could leave they had done it señor screamed emilio from the bridge what yelled kendrick rolling on the deck trying but unable to rise his body jolting everywhere in torment the blood from his wound forming bulges of floating liquid inside his shirt you must come up here i cant you must i am shot the pechothe chest its your leg no from the dock i am falling señor i cannot handle the wheel hold on evan yanked his shirt out of his trousers pools of blood poured on to the deck he crawled over to the shellacked ladder and calling upon reservoirs of strength he could not believe existed pulled himself up rung by rung to the bridge he breached the upper deck and looked over at the mexican emilio was holding on to the wheel but his body had sunk below the bridges windows kendrick grabbed the railing and got to his feet barely able to steady himself he lurched over to the wheel appalled by the darkness and the swell of the waves that rocked the boat emilio fell to the floor his hand springing away from the circular rudder what can i do yelled evan the radio choked the mexican i haul nets and i am not a captain but i have heard them in bad weather there is a channel for urgencia numero diedseis what sixteen wheres the radio on the right of the wheel the switch is on the left pronto how do i call them take out the microfono and press the button say you are premero de mayo may day si madre de dios emilio collapsed on the bridge deck unconscious or dead kendrick lifted the plasticcoiled microphone out of its cradle snapped on the radio and studied the digital readout below the console unable to think the boat battered by swells he could not see he kept tapping the keyboard until the number appeared and then pressed the button this is congressman evan kendrick he screamed am i reaching anyone he released the button this is coast guard san diego came the flat reply can you patch me into a telephone line at the westlake hotel its an emergency anybody can say anything sir were not a phone service i repeat im congressman evan kendrick from the ninth district of colorado and this is an emergency im lost at sea somewhere west or south of tijuana those are mexican waters call the white house repeat what ive just told you kendrick of colorado youre the guy who went to that oman get your orders from the white house keep your radio open ill take your coordinates for the rdf i dont have time and i dont know what youre talking about its the radio directional finder for christs sake coast guard patch me through to the westlake and get your orders i have to reach that hotel yes sir commando kendrick whatever works mumbled evan to himself as the sounds from the console speaker erupted in different tones until there was the hum of a telephone ringing the switchboard answered room fiftyone hurry please yes cried the strained voice of khalehla its me shouted kendrick pressing the button for transmission then instantly releasing it for gods sake where are you in the ocean somewhere forget it theres an attorney a lawyer ardis used for herself and hes got a ledger that spells out everything find him get it yes of course ill reach mj right away but what about you are you another voice intruded the deep commanding tones unmistakable this is the president of the united states find that boat find that man or all your asses are in a sling the swells tossed the boat like an insignificant bauble in a furious sea evan could no longer hold on to the wheel the mists returned and he collapsed over the body of the fisherman from el descanso the icarus agenda chapter he was aware of violently swaying weightlessness then of hands grabbing him and a harsh wind buffeting him finally of a deafening roar above him he opened his eyes to blurred figures frantically moving around him unbuckling straps then a sharp puncture in his flesh on his arm he tried to rise but was restrained as men carried him to a flat padded surface inside a huge vibrating metal cage easy congressman shouted a man in a white navy uniform that gradually came into focus im a doctor and youre pretty bashed up dont make things more difficult for me because the president himself will officiate at my court martial if i dont do my job another puncture he could not take any more pain where am i a logical question replied the medical officer emptying a syringe into kendricks shoulder youre in a big whirlybird ninety miles off the coast of mexico you were on your way to china man and those seas are rugged thats it evan tried to raise his voice but could barely hear himself whats it the doctor leaned down as a medical aide above him held a bottle of plasma passage to chinaan island called passage to china seal it off im a doctor not a member of the seals do as i tell you radio san diego get planes out there boats out there take everyone hey man im no expert but these are mexican waters goddamn it call the white house no contact a man named payton at the cia mitchell payton cia tell him what i just told you say the name grinell wow this is heavy said the young doctor looking up at a third man at the foot of kendricks padded resting place you heard the congressman ensign go up to the pilot an island called passage to china and a man named payton at langley and someone else called grinell hop to it guy this is the presidents boy hey is this anything like what you did to the arabs emilio asked evan dismissing the question how is he the mex my friend the man who saved my life hes here right beside you we just got him up how is he worse off than youmuch worse at best its sixtyforty against him congressman were flying back to the base hospital as fast as we can kendrick elbowed himself up and looked at the prone unconscious figure of emilio barely two feet away behind the doctor the mexicans arm was on the deck of the helicopter his face ashen close to a mask of death give me his hand ordered evan give it to me yes sir said the doctor reaching over and pulling emilios hand up so kendrick could grasp it el descanso roared evan el descanso and your familyyour wife and the nifios you goddamned son of a bitch dont die on me you fucking knownothing fisherman put some juice in your stomach como the mexicans head thrashed back and forth as kendrick tightened his grip thats better amigo remember were angry we stay angry you hang in there you bastard or ill kill you myself comprende his head turned towards evan emilio partially opened his eyes a smile creasing his lips you think you could kill this strong fisherman try me well maybe i couldnt but i can get you a big boat you are loco señor coughed the mexican still there is el descanso three ranches said kendrick his hand falling away under the effect of the navy doctors hypodermic needle one by one the graceful limousines drove through the dark streets of cynwid hollow to the big house on chesapeake bay whereas on previous occasions there had been four such vehicles on this night there were but three one was missing it belonged to a company founded by eric sundstrom traitor of inver brass the members sat around the large circular table in the extraordinary library a brass lamp in front of each all the lamps on the table were lit but one and that was the one in front of a fifth empty chair four pools of light shone down on the polished wood the fifth source was extinguished implying no honour in death instead perhaps a reminder of human frailty in an all too human world on this night there was no humorous small talk no badinage to remind them that they were mortal and not above the common touch despite their awesome wealth and influence the empty chair was enough you have the facts said samuel winters his aquiline features in the flow of light now i ask you for your comments i have only one gideon logan stated firmly his large black head in shadows we cant stop the alternative is too devastating the unleashed wolves will take over the governmentwhat they havent usurped already but theres nothing to stop gid corrected margaret lowell poor milos set everything in motion in chicago he hadnt finished margaret said jacob mandel his gaunt face and frame in his accustomed chair next to winters theres kendrick himself he must accept the nomination be convinced that he should take it if you recall the subject was brought up by eric and now i wonder why he might have left well enough alone for it could be our achilles heel sundstrom was consumed as always by his insatiable curiosity said winters sadly the same curiosity that when applied to space technology made him betray us having said that however it doesnt answer jacobs question our congressman could walk away im not sure milos thought it was so serious a problem jacob reflected attorney lowell leaning forward her elbow on the table her extended fingers against her right temple whether he actually said it or not is immaterial but he certainly implied that kendrick was an intensely if unfashionably moral man he loathes corruption so he went into politics to replace a corrupter and he went to oman added gideon logan because he believed that with his expertise he could help with no thought of reward for himselfthat was proved to us and that was what persuaded all of us to accept him said mandel nodding everything dovetailed the extraordinary man in a very ordinary field of political candidates but is it enough will he agree even if theres the national ground swell that milos had so well orchestrated the assumption was that if genuinely summoned he would respond to the call said winters flatly but is it an accurate assumption i think it is replied margaret lowell i do too logan nodded his large head and moved forward into the reflected pool of light from the table still jacob has a point we cant be sure and if were wrong its bollinger and business as usual and the wolves take over next january suppose kendrick was confronted with the alternative of your wolves with proof of their venality their entrenched behindthescenes power thats permeated the entire washington structure asked winters his voice no longer a monotone but very much alive under those circumstances do you think he will answer the call the huge black entrepreneur leaned back into the shadows his large eyes squinting from everything we know yes yes i do and you margaret i agree with gid he is a remarkable manwith a political conscience i believe jacob of course samuel but how is it to be done we have no documentation no official recordsgood heavens we burn our own notes so apart from the fact that hed have no reason to believe us we cant reveal ourselves and varaks gone i have another to take his place a man who if necessary can make certain evan kendrick is given the truth the whole truth if he doesnt know it already stunned all eyes were on the spokesman for inver brass what the hell are you saying sam cried margaret lowell varak left instructions in the event of his death and i gave him my word not to open them unless he was killed i kept my word because in all honesty i didnt care to know the things he might tell me i opened them last night after mitchell paytons call how will you handle payton asked lowell suddenly anxiously were meeting tomorrow none of you has anything to fear he knows nothing about you well either reach an accommodation or we wont if we dont ive lived a long and productive lifeit will be no sacrifice forgive me samuel said gideon logan impatiently but we all face those decisionswe wouldnt be at this table if we didnt what were varaks instructions to contact the one man who can keep usor conceivably the collective youcompletely and officially informed the man who was varaks informer from the beginning the one without whom milos could never have done what he did when our czech uncovered the discrepancy in the state departments logs sixteen months ago the omission that had kendrick listed as entering the state department but with no record of his departure varak knew where to look what he found was not only a willing informer but a dedicated one milos is of course irreplaceable but in this day of high technology our new coordinator is among the most rapidly rising young officials in government there isnt a major department or agency in washington thats not vying for his services and the private sector has offered him contracts reserved for former presidents and secretaries of state at least twice his age he must be a hell of a lawyer or the youngest foreign service expert on record interjected margaret lowell hes neither countered the whitehaired spokesman of inver brass hes considered the foremost technologist of computer science in the country perhaps in the west fortunately for us he comes from considerable wealth and isnt tempted by private industry in his way hes as committed as milos varak in pursuit of the nations excellence in essence he was one of us when he understood his gifts winters leaned forward over the table and pressed an ivory button will you come in please the heavy door of the extraordinary library opened and in the frame stood a young man still in his twenties what set him apart from most others of his age were his striking looks it was as though he had walked out of a glossy advertisement for mens fashions in an expensive magazine yet his clothes were subdued neither tailored nor cheap just ordinarily neat it was the chiselled nearly idealized grecian face that was startling he should forget computers said jacob mandel quietly i have friends at the william morris agency theyll get him a television series do come in please interrupted winters placing his hand over mandels arm and if you will introduce yourself the young man walked confidently but without arrogance to the west end of the table below the black cylinder that when lowered was a screen he stood for a moment looking down at the pools of light on the table its a particular honour for me to be here he said pleasantly my name is gerald bryce and i am currently director of gco department of state gco asked mandel another alphabet global computer operations sir the california sun streamed through the windows of the hospital room as khalehla her arms around evan gradually released him she sat back on the bed above him and smiled wanly her eyes glistening from the residue of tears her light olive skin so pale welcome to the land of the living she said gripping his hand glad to be here whispered kendrick weakly staring at her when i opened my eyes i wasnt sure it was you or whether i was whether they were playing more tricks on me tricks they took my clothes i was in some old corduroy pantsthen i was back in my suitmy blue your congressional threads i believe you called them interrupted khalehla gently youll have to get another suit my darling what was left of your trousers after they cut them away was beyond a tailor extravagant girl christ do you know how good it is to see you i never thought id see you againit made me so goddamned angry i know how good it is to see you that hotel carpet has been worn through rest now well talk later you just woke up and the doctors said no to hell with the doctors i want to know whats happened hows emilio hell make it but one lung is gone and his hip is shattered hell never walk properly again but hes alive he doesnt have to walk just sit in a captains chair what forget it the island its called passage to china we know broke in khalehla firmly since youre so rotten stubborn let me do the talking what you and carallo did was incredible carallo emilio yes ive seen the photographsmy god what a mess the fire spread everywhere especially over the east side of the island the house the grounds even the dock where the other boats explodedgone all gone by the time the navy choppers arrived with marine assault troops everyone on the place was frightened to death and waiting on the west beaches they greeted our people as if we were liberators then they got grinell khalehla looked down at evan she paused then shook her head no im sorry darling how kendrick started to rise wincing at the pain in his stitched and bandaged shoulder again gently rashad held him lowering him down on the pillow he couldnt have got away they didnt look they didnt have to the mexicans told them what how a seaplane flew out and picked up the hombrepatron i dont understand all communications were out not all what you didnt knowcouldnt knowwas that grinell had small auxiliary generators in the cellar of the main house with enough power to reach his people at an airfield in san felipeweve learned that much from the mexican transmission authorities not who but where he can run and even disappear but he cant hide forever weve got the tail of a trail very alliterative as my executioner might say what forget it i wish youd stop saying that sorry i mean it what about ardiss lawyer and the ledger i told you about again were closing in but were not there yet hes taken a hike somewhere but where no one knows all his phones are monitored and sooner or later hell have to call one of them when he does well have him could he have any idea that youre after him its the big question grinell was able to reach the mainland and through san felipe he could have sent word to ardiss lawyer we simply dont know manny asked evan hesitantly then again you didnt have time wrong i had nothing but time desperation time to be exact i called the hospital in denver last night but all the floor nurse could tell me was that he was stable and i gather something of a nuisance the understatement of the week kendrick closed his eyes shaking his head slowly hes dying khalehla hes dying and theres nothing anyone can do about it were all dying evan every day is one day less of life thats not much help but mannys over eighty and the verdicts not in until its in i know said kendrick looking at their entwined hands then up at her face youre a beautiful lady arent you its not something i dwell on but i suppose ill pass for okayplus youre not exactly quasimodo yourself no i just walk like him its not very modest but our kids have a fair chance of being decent looking little bastards im all for the first part but somewhat dubious about the second you understand that you just agreed to marry me dont you try getting away from me and youll find out how really good i am with a gun thats nice oh mrs jones have you met my wife the gunslinger if anyones crashed your party shell nail him right between the eyes im also black belt first class in case a weapon makes too much noise hey terrific nobodys going to push me around any more pick a fight with me ill let her off the leash grrrr growled khalehla baring her bright lovely teeth then composing her face looking down as if studying him her dark eyes soft floating i do love you god knows what we two misfits think were doing but i guess were going to give it a try no not a try said evan reaching for her with his right hand a lifetime he added she bent down and they kissed holding each other like two people who had nearly lost each other and the telephone rang damn cried khalehla springing up am i that irresistible hell no not you its not supposed to ring in here those were my instructions she picked up the phone and spoke harshly yes and whoever you are id like an explanation how did you get through to this room the explanation officer rashad said mitchell payton in langley virginia is comparatively simple i countermanded a subordinates order mj you havent seen this man he looks like a nuked godzilla for a grownup woman adrienne one who has admitted in my presence that shes over thirty you have an untidy habit of frequently talking like an adolescent and ive also spoken to the doctors evan needs some rest and must keep his ankle strapped and his leg quiet for a day or so and his shoulder wound periodically checked but beyond these minor inconveniences he could go right back into the field you are one frozen fish uncle mitch he can barely talk then why have you been talking to him how did you know i didnt you just told me may we please deal with realities my dear whats evan unreal give me that phone said kendrick awkwardly taking the instrument from khalehlas hand its me mitch whats happening how are you evan i suppose thats a foolish question very answer mine ardis vanvlanderens lawyer is at his summer house in the sanjacinto mountains he called his office for messages and we got an area fix a unit is on its way there now to evaluate they should be there in a matter of minutes evaluate what the hell is there to evaluate hes got the book go in and get it it obviously spells out their whole global structure every rotten arms merchant theyve used in the world grinell can run to any of them and be hidden grab it youre forgetting about grinells own sense of survival i assume adrienne khalehla told you yes a seaplane picked him up so what he wants that ledger as much as we do and hes no doubt reached mrs vanvlanderens man by now grinell wont risk coming up himself but hell send someone he can trust to retrieve it if he knows were closing in and all it would take is another pair of eyes on the lawyers house what do you suppose the instructions will be to his trusted courier who must after all get that book into mexico where he could be stopped at the border or in an airport with us in attendance what do you think hell tell that person to burn the damn thing said kendrick quietly precisely i hope your men are good at what they do two men and one is just about the best we have his name is gingerbread ask your friend about him gingerbread what kind of dumb name is that later evan interrupted payton ive got something to tell you im flying out to san diego this afternoon and we have to talk i hope youll be up to it because its urgent ill be up to it but why cant we talk now because i wouldnt know what to say im not sure i will later but at least ill have learned more you see im meeting with a man an hour from now an influential man whos intensely interested in youhas been for the past year kendrick closed his eyes feeling weak as he sank back into the pillows hes with a group or a committee that calls itself inver brass you know only that much ive no idea who they are or what they are just that theyve screwed up my life the tan car its coded government plates signifying the central intelligence agency drove through the imposing gates of the estate on chesapeake bay and up the circular drive to the smooth stone steps of the entrance the tall man in an open raincoat that revealed a rumpled suit and shirtevidence of nearly seventytwo hours continuous weargot out of the back seat and walked wearily up the steps towards the large stately front door he shivered briefly in the cold morning air of the overcast day that promised snowsnow for christmas reflected payton it was christmas eve simply another day for the director of special projects yet a day he dreaded the impending meeting one he would trade several years of his life not to have insisted upon throughout his long career he had done many things that caused the bile to erupt in his stomach but none more so than the destruction of good and moral men he would destroy such a man this morning and he loathed himself for it yet there was no alternative for there was a higher good a higher morality and it was found in the reasonable laws of a nation of decent people to abuse those laws was to deny the decency accountability was paramount and constant he rang the bell a maid preceded payton through an enormous sitting room overlooking the bay to another stately door she opened it and the director walked inside the extraordinary library trying to absorb everything that struck his eyes the huge console that took up the entire wall on the left with its panoply of television monitors and dials and projection equipment the lowered silver screen on the right and the burning stove in the near corner the cathedral windows directly opposite and the large circular table in front of him samuel winters got up from the chair beneath the wall of sophisticated technology and came forward his hand extended its been too long mjmay i call you that said the world renowned historian as i recall everyone called you mj certainly dr winters they shook hands and the septuagenarian scholar waved his arm encompassing the room i wanted you to see it all to know that we have our fingers on the pulse of the worldbut not for personal gain you must understand that i do who are the others please sit down said winters gesturing at the chair facing his own on the opposite side of the circular table take off your coat by all means when one reaches my age all the rooms are much too warm if you dont mind ill keep it on this will not be a long conference youre certain of that very replied payton sitting down well said winters softly but emphatically as he went to his chair its the unusual intellect that chooses its position without regard to the parameters of discussion and you do have an intellect mj thank you for your generous if somewhat condescending compliment thats rather hostile isnt it no more so than your deciding for the country who should run and be elected to national office hes the right man at the right time for all the right reasons i couldnt agree with you more its the way you did it when one lets loose a rogue force to achieve an objective one cant know the consequences others do it theyre doing it now that doesnt give you the right expose them if you can and with your resources im sure you can but dont imitate them thats sophistry we live in an animal world a politically oriented world dominated by predators we dont have to become predators to fight them exposure not imitation by the time the word gets out by the time even the few understand whats happened the brutal herds have stampeded trampling us they change the rules alter the laws theyre untouchable i respectfully disagree dr winters look at the third reich look what happened to it look at runnymede and the magna carta look at the tyrannies of the french court of louis the sixteenth look at the brutalities of the czarsfor christs sake look at philadelphia in the constitution doctor the people react goddamned quickly to oppression and malfeasance tell that to the citizens of the soviet union checkmate but dont try to explain that to the refuseniks and the dissidents who every day make the world more aware of the dark corners of kremlin policy they are making a difference doctor excesses cried winters everywhere on this poor doomed planet there is excess it will blow us apart not if reasonable people expose excess and do not join it in hysteria your cause may have been right but in your excess you violated lawswritten and unwrittenand caused the deaths of innocent men and women because you considered yourself above the laws of the land rather than telling the country what you knew you decided to manipulate it that is your determination it is who are the others in this inver brass you know that name i just said it who are they youll never learn from me well find them ultimately but for my own curiosity where did this organization start if you dont care to answer it doesnt matter oh but i do care to answer said the old historian his thin hands trembling to the point where he gripped them together on the table decades ago inver brass was born in chaos when the nation was being torn apart on the edge of selfdestruction it was the height of the great depression the country had come to a stop and violence was erupting everywhere hungry people care little about empty slogans and emptier promises and productive people whove lost their pride through no fault of their own are reduced to fury inver brass was formed by a small group of immensely wealthy influential men who had followed the advice of the likes of the financier bernard mannes baruch and were unscathed by the economic collapse they were also men of social conscience and put their resources to work in practical ways stemming riots and violence not only by massive infusions of capital and supplies into inflamed areas but by silently ushering laws through congress that helped to bring about measures of relief it is that tradition that we follow is it asked payton quietly his eyes cold studying the old man yes answered winters emphatically inver brass what does it mean its the name of a marshy inlet in the highlands of scotland thats not on any map it was coined by the first spokesman a banker of scots descent who understood that the group had to act in secrecy therefore without accountability i repeat we seek nothing for ourselves then why the secrecy its necessary for although our decisions are arrived at dispassionately for the good of the country theyre not always pleasant or in the eyes of many even defensible yet they were for the good of the nation even defensible repeated payton astonished at what he was hearing ill give you an example years ago our immediate predecessors were faced with a government tyrant who had visions of reshaping the laws of the country a man named john edgar hoover a giant who became obsessed in his old age who had gone beyond the bounds of rationality blackmailing presidents and senatorsdecent menwith his raw files which were rampant with gossip and innuendo inver brass had him eliminated before he brought the executive and the legislative in essence the government to its knees and then a young writer named peter chancellor surfaced and came too close to the truth it was he and his intolerable manuscript that caused the demise of inver brass thenbut not its resurrection oh my god exclaimed the director of special projects softly good and evil decided solely by you sentences pronounced only by you a legend of arrogance thats unfair there was no other solution youre wrong its the truth payton stood up pushing the chair behind him ive nothing more to say dr winters ill leave now what are you going to do what has to be done im filing a report for the president the attorney general and the congressional oversight committees thats the law youre out of business doctor and dont bother to see me to the door ill find my way payton walked out into the cold grey morning air he breathed deeply trying to fill his lungs but unable to do so there was too much weariness too much that was sad and offensiveon christmas eve he reached the steps and started down to his car when suddenly shattering the grounds was a loud reporta gunshot paytons driver lunged out of the car crouching in the drive his weapon steadied by both hands mj slowly shook his head and continued towards the back door of the vehicle he was drained there were no reservoirs of strength to draw from his exhaustion was complete nor was there now the urgency to fly out to california inver brass was finished its leader dead by his own hand without the stature and authority of samuel winters it was in shambles and the manner of his death would send the message of collapse to those who remained evan kendrick he had to be told the whole story all sides of it and make up his own mind but it could waita day at least all mj could think of as the driver opened the door for him was to get home have several more drinks than were good for him and sleep mr payton said the driver you had a radio code five sir what was the message contact san jacinto urgent return to langley please yes sir oh in case i forget have a merry christmas thank you sir the icarus agenda chapter well look in on him at least once an hour miss rashad said the middleaged naval nurse behind the counter rest assured of it did you know the president himself called the congressman this afternoon yes i was there and speaking of phones there are to be no calls put through to his room we understand heres the note its a copy of the one each operator has at the switchboard all calls are to be referred to you at the westlake hotel thats correct thank you very much its a pity isnt it here it is christmas eve and instead of being with friends and singing carols or whatever hes bandaged up in a hospital and youre stuck by yourself in a hotel room ill tell you something nurse the fact that hes here and alive makes it the best christmas i could ever hope to have i know dear ive seen you two together take care of him if i dont get some sleep he wont consider me much of a present in the morning hes our number one patient and you rest young lady you look a mite haggard and thats a medical opinion im a mess is what i am in my best days i should be such a mess youre sweet said khalehla putting her hand on the nurses arm and squeezing it good night see you tomorrow merry christmas dear it is and have a merry one yourself rashad walked down the white corridor to the bank of elevators and pressed the lower button she had meant it about needing sleep except for a brief twenty minutes when both she and evan dozed off she had not closed her eyes in nearly fortyeighth hours a hot shower a warm roomservice meal and bed was the order of the night in the morning she would shop in one of those stores that stayed open for the benefit of errant people who had forgotten someone and buy a few silly presents for her intended my god she thought for my fiancé too much it was funny though how christmas undeniably brought out the gentler kinder aspects of human natureregardless of race creed or lack of both the nurse for instance she was sweet and probably a rather lonely woman with too large a body and a pudgy face unlikely to be chosen for a recruitment poster yet she had tried to be warm and kind she had said that she knew how the congressmans lady felt because she had seen them together she had not khalehla remembered every person who had come into evans room and the nurse was not one of them kindness reachingout whatever one cared to call it it was christmas and her man was safe the elevator doors parted and she walked into the descending cage feeling secure and warm and kind kendrick opened his eyes to the darkness something had awakened him what was it the door to his room yes of course it was the door khalehla had told him he was going to be checked and rechecked all night long where did she think he would go out dancing he sank back into the pillow breathing deeply no strength in him all energy elusive no it was not the door it was a presence someone was there in the room slowly he moved his head inch by inch on the pillow there was a blurred splash of white in the dark no upper or lower extensions just a dull space of white in the darkness who is it he said finding his barely audible voice whos there silence who the hell are you what do you want then like a rushing onslaught the white mass came towards him out of the dark and crashed into his face a pillow he could not breathe he swung his right hand up pushing against a muscular arm then sliding off the flesh into a face a soft face then into the scalp of womans hair he yanked the strands in his grip with all the strength he could summon rolling to the right on the narrow hospital bed pulling his predator down to the floor beneath him he released the hair and hammered the face under him his shoulder in torment the stitches broken blood spreading through the bandages he tried to yell but all that emerged was a throated cry the heavy woman clawed at his neck her fingers sharp hard points breaking his skin then up into his eyes tearing his lids and scraping his forehead he surged up spinning out of her grip beyond her reach crashing into the wall the pain was intolerable he lurched towards the door but she was on him hurling him into the side of the bed his hand struck the carafe of water on the table he grabbed it and spinning again swung it up into the head into the maniacal face above him the woman was stunned he rushed forward throwing his right shoulder into her heavy body smashing her into the wall then lunged for the door and yanked it open the white antiseptic hall was bathed in dim grey light except for a bright lamp behind the desk halfway down the corridor he tried again to scream someone help me the words were lost only guttural muted cries came out of his mouth he limped his swollen ankle and damaged leg barely able to support him where was everybody no one was there no one at the desk then two nurses came casually through a door at the far end of the hallway and he raised his right hand waving it frantically as the words finally came help me oh my god screamed one of the women as both rushed forward simultaneously kendrick heard another set of racing feet he spun around only to watch helplessly as the heavy muscular nurse ran out of his room and down the hall to a door beneath a redlettered exit sign she crashed it open and disappeared call the doctor down in emergency cried the nurse who reached him first hurry hes bleeding all over the place then id better call the rashad girl said the second nurse heading for the desk shes to be called with any change of status and jesus this is certainly that no yelled evan his voice at last a clear if breathless roar leave her alone but congressman please do as i say dont call her she hasnt slept in two or three days just get the doctor and help me back to my room then i have to use the phone fortyfive minutes later his shoulder restitched and his face and neck cleaned up kendrick sat in bed the telephone in his lap and dialled the number in washington he had committed to memory against strenuous objections he had ordered the doctor and the nurses not to call the military police or even the hospitals security it had been established that no one on the floor knew the heavyset woman other than as a name obviously false through transfer papers presented that afternoon from the base hospital in pensacola florida highly qualified nurses were coveted additions to any staff no one questioned her arrival and no one would stop her in her swift departure and until the whole picture was clearer there could be no official investigations triggering news stories in the media the blackout was still in effect sorry to wake you mitch evan youd better know what happened kendrick described the all too real nightmare he had lived through including his decision to avoid the police civilian and military maybe i was wrong but i reckoned once she reached that exit door there wasnt much chance of getting her and every chance of hitting the papers if they tried you were right agreed payton speaking rapidly she was a hired gun pillow corrected evan every bit as lethal if you hadnt woken up the point is hired killers plan ahead usually with several different exits and an equal number of changes of clothes you did the right thing who hired her mitch id say its pretty obvious grinell did hes been a malignantly busy man since he got off that island what do you mean khalehla didnt tell me khalehla as you call her doesnt know she has enough stress with you on her hands how is she taking tonight she hasnt been told i wouldnt let them call her shell be furious at least shell get some sleep what about grinell ardis vanvlanderens lawyer is dead and the ledger is nowhere to be found grinells people got to san jacinto first goddamn it shouted kendrick hoarsely weve lost it it would appear so but theres something that doesnt quite add up do you recall my telling you that all grinell needed in order to know we were closing in was someone watching the attorneys house certainly gingerbread found him and if they did get that book why station a lookout after the fact indeed why risk it force the lookout to tell you drug him up youve done it before gingerbread thinks not why not two reasons the man may be a lowscale watchman who knows absolutely nothing and second gingerbread wants to follow him you mean this gingerbread found the lookout but the lookout doesnt know it i told you he was good grinells man doesnt even know we found the dead lawyer all he saw was a company truck and two gardeners in overalls who proceeded to mow the lawns but if the lookouts so lowscale what will gingerbreadchrist thats a dumb namewhat will he learn by following him i said he may be lowscale with only a relay telephone number to call periodically that wouldnt tell us anything on the other hand he may not be if hes upscale he could lead us to others for gods sake mitch drug him and find out youre not following me evan a relay phone is called periodically at specific times if the schedules broken we send grinell the wrong message youre all convoluted fruitcakes said a weakened exasperated kendrick its not much of a living either ill have a couple of shore patrols placed at your door try to get some rest what about you i know you said you couldnt fly out here and now i understand why but youre still at the office arent you yes im waiting to hear from gingerbread i can work faster from here you dont want to talk about yesterday morningabout your meeting with the top dog from that inver brass perhaps tomorrow its no longer urgent without him there is no inver brass without him he killed himself merry christmas congressman khalehla rashad dropped the packages in her arms and screamed what happened she cried rushing to the bed medicares a bunch of bullshit replied evan thats not funny the sps at your door and the way they looked at my id downstairs when i said i was coming to see youwhat happened he told her omitting the parts about the replaced stitches and the blood in the hallway mitch agrees with what i did ill have his head yelled khalehla he should have called me then you wouldnt look as lovely as you do the shadows around your eyes are only half black you slept twelve hours she admitted sitting on the edge of the bed that sweet pudgy nurse i cant believe it i could have used some of your black belt first class training i dont make a point of fighting very often and hardly ever with womenexcept hookers who overcharge remind me never to let you pay oh god evan i knew i should have insisted on a larger room with two beds and stayed with you dont carry this protective routine too far kid i am the man remember and you remember that if were ever mugged let me make the moves all right there goeth all my masculine pride be my guest just feed me bonbons and champagne while you beat the hell out of the bastards only a man could even joke like that said rashad bending down and kissing him i love you so thats my problem not mine they kissed again and quite naturally the telephone rang dont yell he insisted its probably mitch it was breakthrough exclaimed the director of special projects from langley virginia has evan told you about grinell no nothing put him on he can explain things to you why didnt you call me last nightthis morning put him on yes sir what is it mitch the break weve neededweve got it gingerbread oddly enough no from an entirely different source you look for crazy things in this business and sometimes you find them on an outside chance we sent a man to the offices of mrs vanvlanderens attorney with a mockedup document permitting him access to the files of the vice presidents late chief of staff in her employers absence the secretary wasnt about to let anyone prowl around the files so she called the sanjacinto house knowing she wouldnt get an answer our man hung in there for a couple of hours playing the angry washington official with orders from the national security council while she kept trying to reach the lawyer apparently she was genuinely upset he was supposed to be in an allday conference out there with important clients whether it was frustration or selfdefence that made her say it we dont know and dont care but she blurted out the fact that our man probably wanted all those confidential pages shed xeroxed but he couldnt get them anyway because they were all in a safety box down in a bank vault bingo said evan quietly inwardly shouting unquestionably she even described the ledger our astute attorney was perfectly willing to sell grinell the book then proceed to blackmail him with the copy grinells lookout was there out of simple curiosity nothing more and the ledger will be ours within the hour get it mitch and break it down look for a man named hamendi abdel hamendi the arms dealer said payton audibly nodding the photographs in vanvlanderens apartmentlausanne amsterdam thats the one theyll use a code name for him of course but trace the money the transfers in geneva and zurichthe gemeinschaft bank in zurich naturally theres something else mitch lets clean house as much as we can a man like hamendi supplies arms to all the fanatic splinter groups he can find each side killing the other with what he sells them then he looks for other killers the ones in thousanddollar suits sitting in plush offices whose only cause is money and he brings them into his network production increases ten times what it was then twenty and theres more killing more causes to sell to more maniacs to fuel lets take him out mitch lets give a part of this screwedup world a chance to breathewithout his supplies its a tall order evan give me a few weeks to get patched together then send me back to oman what im going to make the biggest purchase of weapons hamendi ever dreamed of sixteen days passed christmas a painful memory the new year greeted cautiously with suspicion on the fourth day evan had visited emilio carallo and gave him a photograph of a fine new fishing boat along with its ownership papers a prepaid course for his captains licence a bank book and a guarantee that no one from the island of passage to china would ever bother him in el descanso it was the truth of the selected brethren of the inner government who had conferred on that insidious governments island none cared to acknowledge it instead they huddled with their batteries of lawyers and several had fled the country they were not concerned with a crippled fisherman in el descanso they were concerned with saving their lives and their fortunes on the eighth day the ground swell came out of chicago and rolled through the middle west it started with four independent newspapers within a sixtymile radius editorially proposing the candidacy of congressman evan kendrick for the vice presidential nomination within seventytwo hours three more were added in addition to six television stations owned by five of the papers proposals became endorsements and the voices of the journalistic turtles were heard in the land from new york to los angeles bismarck to houston boston to miami the brotherhood of media giants began studying the concept and the editors of time and newsweek called emergency meetings kendrick was moved to an isolated wing of the base hospital and his name removed from the roster of patients in washington annie mulcahy oreilly and the staff informed hundreds of callers that the representative from colorado was out of the country and not available for comment on the eleventh day the congressman and his lady returned to mesa verde where to their astonishment they found emmanuel weingrass a small cylinder of oxygen strapped to his side in case of a respiratory emergency overseeing an army of carpenters repairing the house mannys pace was slower and he sat down a great deal but his illness had no effect on his everpresent irascibility it was a constant the only time he lowered his voice even a decibel was when he spoke with khalehlahis lovely new daughter worth much more than the bum who was always hanging around on the fifteenth day mitchell payton working with a young computer genius he had borrowed from frank swann at state broke the codes of grinells ledger the bible according to the inner government working through the night with gerald bryce at the keyboard the two men compiled a report for the president langford jennings who told them exactly how many printouts were to be made one additional report rolled out of the word processor before the disk was destroyed but mj was not aware of it one by one the big cars arrived at night not at a darkened estate on chesapeake bay but instead at the south portico of the white house the passengers were escorted by marine guards to the oval office of the president of the united states langford jennings sat behind his desk his feet on a favourite ottoman to the left of his chair acknowledging with a nod everyone who cameall but one vice president orson bollinger was simply stared at no greeting extended only contempt the chairs were arranged in a semicircle in front of the desk and the awesome man behind it included in the entourage each carrying a single manila envelope were the majority and minority leaders of both houses of congress the acting secretary of state and the secretary of defense the directors of the central intelligence and the national security agencies the members of the joint chiefs of staff the attorney general and mitchell jarvis payton special projects cia all sat down and waited in silence the waiting was not long were in a pile of deep shit said the president of the united states how it happened ill be damned if i know but id better get some answers tonight or ill see a number of people in this town spending twenty years on a rock pile do i make myself clear there was a scattered nodding of heads but more than a few objected angry faces and voices resenting the presidents implications hold on continued jennings quieting the dissenters i want the ground rules thoroughly understood each of you has received and presumably read the report prepared by mr payton youve all brought it with you and again presumably as ordered none of you has made copies are these statements accurate please answer individually starting on my left with the attorney general each of the assembled group repeated the action and the words of the nations chief law enforcement officer each held up the manila envelope and said no copies mr president good jennings removed his feet from the ottoman and leaned forward his forearms on the desk the envelopes are numbered gentlemen and limited to the number of people in this room furthermore they will remain in this room when you leave again understood the nods and the mutterings were affirmative good i dont have to tell you that the information contained in these pages is as devastating as it is incredible a network of thieves and killers and human garbage who hired killers and paid for the services of terrorists wholesale slaughter in fairfax in coloradoand oh my godin cyprus where a man worth any five of you bastards was blown up with his whole delegation its a litany of horrors of boardrooms across the country in constant collusion of setting prices for outrageous margins of profit buying influence in all sectors of the government turning the nations defence industry into a grab bag of riches its also a litany of deceptions of illegal transactions with arms merchants all over the world lying to armaments control committees buying licences for export rerouting shipments where theyre disallowed christ its a fucking mess and theres not one of you here that isnt touched by it now did i hear a few objections mr president mr president ive spent thirty years in the corps and no one has ever dared i dare roared jennings and who the hell are you to tell me i cant anyone else yes mr president replied the secretary of defense to indulge in your language i dont know what the fuck youre specifically alluding to and i object to your innuendos specifics innuendos screw you mac read the figures three million dollars for a tank thats estimated to cost roughly one million five to produce thirty million for a fighter aircraft thats been so overloaded with pentagon goodies it cant perform then goes back to the drawing board and another ten million per machine forget the toilet seats and the goddamned wrenches youve got much bigger problems theyre all minor expenditures compared to the totality mr president as a friend of mine said on television tell that to the poor son of a bitch who has to balance a budget maybe youre in the wrong job mr secretary we keep telling the country that the soviet economy is a shambles its technology light years behind ours and yet every year when you produce a budget you tell us were up shit creek because russias outperforming us economically and technologically theres a slight contradiction there wouldnt you say you dont understand the complexities i dont have to i understand the contradictions and what about you you four glorious stalwarts from the house and senatemembers of my party and the loyal opposition you never smelled anything youre an extremely popular president said the leader of the opposition its politically difficult to oppose your positions even when the fish is rotten even when the fish is rotten sir then you should get out too and our astute military elite our olympian joint chiefs of staff whos watching the goddamned store or are you so rarefied you forgot the address of the pentagon colonels generals admirals marching in step out of arlington into the ranks of defence contractors and selling the taxpayers down the drain i object shouted the chairman of the jcs spitting through his capped teeth its not our job mr president to keep tabs on every officers employment in the private sector perhaps not but your approval of recommendations makes damned sure who gets the rank that makes it possible and how about the countrys super spies the cia and the nsa mr payton here excludedand if any of you try to railroad him to siberia youll answer to me for the next five yearswhere the hell were you arms sent all over the mediterranean and the persian gulfto ports the congress and i said were off limits you couldnt trace the traffic who the hell was on the switch in a number of cases mr president said the director of the central intelligence agency when we had reason to question certain activities we assumed they were being carried out with your authority for they reflected your policy position where the laws were involved we believed you were being advised by the attorney general as is the accepted procedure so you shut your eyes and said let joe blow handle the pot of hot potatoes very commendable for saving your ass but why didnt you check with me speaking for the nsa broke in the director of the national security agency we spoke several times with both your chief of staff and your national security adviser about several unorthodox developments that turned up on our desks your nsc adviser insisted that he knew nothing about what he termed vicious rumours and mr dennison claimed they wereand i quote him accurately mr presidenta bunch of shit spread by ultra liberal wimps taking cheap shots at you those were his words sir youll notice remarked jennings coldly that neither of those men is in this room my nsc adviser has retired and my chief of staff is on leave attending to personal business in herb dennisons defence he may have run a tight pretty autocratic ship but his navigation wasnt always accurate now we come to our chief law enforcement officer the guardian of our nations legal system considering the laws that were broken bent and circumvented i have the idea that you went out to lunch three years ago and never came back what are you running over at justice bingo games or marbles why are we paying several hundred lawyers over there to look into criminal activities against the government and not one of the goddamned crimes listed in this report was ever uncovered they were not in our purview mr president weve concentrated on what the hell is a purview corporate pricefixing and outrageous overruns arent in your purview let me tell you something whackadoo they damn well better be to hell with you lets turn to my esteemed running matethe last is by far not the least in terms of vital importance our grovelling snivelling tool of very special interests is the big man on the campus theyre all your boys orson how could you do it mr president theyre your men too they raised the money for your first campaign they raised millions more than your opposition virtually assuring your election you espoused their causes supported their cries for the unencumbered expansion of business and industry reasonably unencumbered yes said jennings the veins in his forehead pronounced but not manipulated not corrupted by dealings with arms merchants all over europe and the mediterranean and goddamn you not by collusion extortion and terrorists for hire i knew nothing about such things screamed bollinger leaping to his feet no you probably didnt mr vice president because you were all too useful peddling influence for them to risk losing you through panic but you sure as hell knew there was a lot more fat in the fire than there was smoke in the kitchen you just didnt want to know what was burning and smelling so rotten sit down bollinger sat and jennings continued but get this clear orson youre not on the ticket and i dont want you near the convention youre out finished and if i ever learn that youre peddling again or sitting on a board other than for charity well just dont mr president said the leatherfaced chairman of the joint chiefs as he stood up in light of your remarks and all too obvious disposition i tender my resignation effective immediately the declaration was followed by half a dozen others all standing and emphatic langford jennings leaned back in his chair and spoke calmly his voice chilling oh no youre not getting off that easy any of you theres not going to be a reverse saturday night massacre in this administration no crawling off the ship and into the hills youre going to stay right where you are and make damned sure we get back on course understand me clearly i dont care what people think of me or you or the house im temporarily occupying but i do care about the country i care about it deeply so deeply in fact that this preliminary reportpreliminary because it isnt finished by a long shotis going to remain the sole property of this president under the statutes of executive nondisclosure until i think the time is right to release it which it will be to release it now would cripple the strongest presidency this nation has had in forty years and do irreparable damage to the country but i repeat it will be released let me explain something to you when a man and i trust some day a woman reaches this office theres only one thing left and thats his mark on history well im taking myself out of that race for immortality within the next five years of my life because during that time this completed report with all its horrors will be made public but not until every wrong committed on my watch has been righted every crime paid for if that means working night and day then thats what youre all going to doall but my pandering sycophantic vice president whos going to fade away and with any luck will have the grace to blow his brains out a final word gentlemen should any of you be tempted to jump this rotten ship weve all created by omission and commission please remember that im the president of the united states with incredible powers in the broadest sense they include life and deaththats merely a statement of fact but if you care to take it as a threat well thats your privilege now get out of here and start thinking payton you stay yes mr president did they get the message mitch asked jennings pouring himself and payton a drink from a bar recessed in the left wall of the oval office lets put it this way replied the director of special projects if i dont have that whisky in a matter of seconds im going to start shaking again the president grinned his famous grin as he brought paytons drink to him at the window not bad for a guy whos supposedly got the iq of a telephone pole huh it was an extraordinary performance sir thats what this office has been largely reduced to im afraid i didnt mean it that way mr president of course you did and youre right its why the king with all his clothes on or naked needs a strong prime minister who in turn creates his own royal familyfrom both parties incidentally i beg your pardon kendrick i want him on the ticket then youll have to convince him im afraid according to my niecei call her my niece but shes not really i know all about it all about her interrupted jennings what does she say that evans perfectly aware of whats happenedwhats happeningbut hasnt made up his mind his closest friend emmanuel weingrass is extremely ill and not expected to live im aware of that too you didnt use his name but its in your report remember oh sorry i havent had much sleep lately i forget things at any rate kendrick insists on going back to oman and i cant dissuade him hes obsessed with the arms merchant abdel hamendi he quite rightly believes that hamendis selling at least eighty per cent of all the firepower used in the middle east and southwest asia destroying his beloved arab countries in his way hes like a modern day lawrence trying to rescue his friends from international contempt and ultimate oblivion what exactly does he think he can accomplish from what hes told me its basically a sting operation i dont think its clear to him yet but the objective is thats to expose hamendi for what he is a man who makes millions upon millions by selling death to anyone wholl buy it what makes evan believe hamendi gives a damn what his buyers think of him hes in the arms business not evangelism he might if more than half the weapons hes sold do not function if the explosives dont explode and the guns dont fire good god whispered the president turning slowly and walking back to his desk he sat down and placed his glass on the blotter staring in silence at the far wall finally he turned in his chair and looked up at payton by the window let him go mitch hed never forgive either one of us if we stopped him give him everything he needs but make goddamned sure he comes back i want him back the country needs him back across the world pockets of mist drifted in from the persian gulf blanketing bahrains tujjar road causing inverted halos beneath the streetlamps and obscuring the night sky above it was precisely fourthirty in the morning as a large black car intruded upon this deserted waterfront section of the sleeping city it came to a stop in front of the glass doors of the building known as the sahalhuddin until sixteen months ago the princely high chambers of the manmonster who called himself the mahdi two robed arabs emerged from rear doors of the imposing vehicle and walked into the wash of dull neon lights that illuminated the entrance the limousine quietly drove away the taller man tapped softly on the glass inside the guard at the reception desk glanced at his wristwatch got out of his chair and walked rapidly to the door he unlocked it and bowed to the oddhour visitors all is prepared great sirs he said his voice at first barely above a whisper the outside guards have been granted early dismissal the morning shift arrives at six oclock well need less than half that time said the younger shorter visitor obviously the leader has your wellpaid preparedness included an unlocked door upstairs most assuredly great sir and only one elevator is in use asked the older taller arab yes sir well lock it above the shorter man started towards the bank of elevators on the right his companion instantly catching up with him if im correct he continued speaking loudly we walk up the final flight of stairs is that so yes great sir all the alarms have been disengaged and the room restored exactly as it was before that terrible morning also as instructed the item you requested has been brought up it was in the cellars you may be aware sir that the authorities tore the room apart then sealed it for many months we could not understand great sir it wasnt necessary that you did you will alert us if anyone seeks entrance into the building or even approaches the doors with the eyes of a hawk great sir try the telephone please the two men reached the elevators and the taller subordinate pressed the button a panel opened immediately they walked inside and the door closed is that man competent asked the shorter arab as the machinery whirred and the elevator began its ascent he does what he is told to do and what he has been told is not complicated why was the mahdis office sealed for so many months because the authorities were looking for men like us waiting for men like us they tore the room apart said the subordinate hesitantly questioningly as with us they did not know where to look the elevator slowed down then stopped and the panel opened with quickening steps the two visitors walked to the staircase that led to the mahdis floor and former temple they reached the office door and the shorter man stopped his hand on the knob ive waited over a year for this moment he said breathing deeply now that its arrived im trembling inside the huge strange mosquelike room with its high domed ceiling filled with brilliantly coloured mosaic tiles the two intruders stood in silence as if in the presence of some awesome spirit the sparse furniture of dark burnished wood was in place like ancient statues of ferocious soldiers guarding the inner tomb of a great pharaoh the outsized desk recalled the sarcophagus of a dead revered ruler and standing against the far right wall in clashing contradiction was a modern metal scaffold rising to a height of eight feet side bars permitting access to the top the taller arab spoke this could be allahs resting placemay his will be done you didnt know the mahdi my innocent friend replied the associates superior try midas the phrygian king quickly now we waste time move the scaffold to where i tell you then climb above the subordinate walked rapidly to the raised platform and looked back at his companion to the left continued the leader just beyond the second slit of the window i dont understand you said the tall man stepping on the slip clamps and climbing to the top of the scaffold there are many things you dont understand and theres no reason why you should now count to the left six tiles from the window seam then five above yes yes it is a stretch for me and i am not short the mahdi was far taller far more impressivebut not without his faults i beg your pardon no matter press the four corners of the tile at the very edges then force the palm of your hand with all your strength into the centre now the mosaic tile literally burst from its recess it was all the tall arab could do to hold on to it without falling beloved allah he exclaimed simple suction balanced by weights said the shorter man below without elaboration now reach inside and withdraw the papers they should all be together the subordinate did as he was told pulling out layered sheets of an extensive computer printout held together by two rubber bands drop them to me continued the leader and replace the tile exactly as you removed it starting first with pressure in the centre the tall arab awkwardly carried out his orders then climbed down the scaffolds crossbars on to the floor he approached his superior who had unfolded several sheets of the printout and was scanning them intently this was the treasure you spoke of he asked softly from the persian gulf to the western shores of the mediterranean there is no greater answered the younger man his eyes racing across the papers they executed the mahdi but they could not destroy what he created retreat was necessary retrenchment demandedbut not dismemberment the myriad branches of the enterprise were not crushed nor even exposed they merely fell away and returned to the earth ready to sprout trunks of their own one day those oddlooking pages tell you that the superior nodded still reading what in allahs name do they say the shorter man looked curiously up at his taller companion why not he said smiling these are the lists of every man every woman every firm company and corporation every contact and conduit to the terrorists ever reached by the mahdi it will take months perhaps several years to put everything back together again but it will be done you see theyre waiting for ultimately the mahdi was right this is our world we will surrender it to no one the word will spread my friend cried the older taller subordinate it will will it not very carefully replied the young leader we live in different times he added enigmatically last weeks equipment is obsolete i cannot pretend to understand you again its not necessary where do you come from asked the bewildered subordinate we are told to obey you that you know things that men like me are not privileged to know but how from where from thousands of miles away preparing for years for this moment leave me now quickly go downstairs and tell the guard to have the scaffold removed to the cellars then signal the car as it circles the street the driver will take you home well meet tomorrow same time same place may allah and the mahdi be with you said the tall arab bowing and rushing out of the door closing it behind him the young man watched his companion leave then reached under his robes and pulled out a small handheld radio he pressed a button and spoke hell be outside in two or three minutes pick him up and drive to the rocks of the south coast kill him strip him and throw the gun into the sea so ordered replied the limousines driver several streets away the youthful leader replaced the radio inside his robes and crossed solemnly towards the huge ebony desk he removed his ghotra dropping it on the floor as he walked to the thronelike chair and sat down he opened a tall wide drawer on his lower left and lifted out the jewelencrusted headdress of the mahdi he placed it on his head and spoke softly to the mosaic ceiling i thank you my father said the inheritor with a doctorate in computer sciences from the university of chicago to be chosen among all your sons is both an honour and a challenge my weak white mother will never understand but as you incessantly made clear to me she was merely a vessel however i must tell you father that things are different now subtlety and longrange objectives are the order of the times we will employ your methods where they are called forkilling is no problem for usbut it is a far larger part of the globe that we seek than you ever sought we will have cells in all of europe and the mediterranean and we will communicate in ways you never thought ofsecretly by satellite interception impossible you see my father the world no longer belongs to one race or another it belongs to the young and the strong and the brilliant and we are they the new mahdi stopped whispering and lowered his eyes to the top of the desk soon what he needed would be there the greater son of the great mahdi would continue the march we must control everywhere book three the icarus agenda chapter it was the thirtysecond day since the wild departure from the island of passage to china and emmanuel weingrass walked slowly into the enclosed veranda in mesa verde his words however were rushed wheres the bum he asked jogging in the grounds replied khalehla from the couch where she was having her breakfast coffee and reading the newspaper or up in the mountains by now who knows its two oclock in the afternoon in jerusalem said manny and four oclock in masqat added rashad theyre all so clever over there my daughter the smart mouth sit down child said khalehla patting the cushion beside her smarter mouth infant mumbled weingrass walking over and removing his short cylinder of oxygen to lower himself to the couch the bum looks good continued manny leaning back and breathing heavily youd think he was training for the olympics speaking of which you got a cigarette youre not supposed to have one so give youre impossible khalehla reached into her bathrobe pocket withdrew a pack of cigarettes and shook one up while reaching for a ceramic lighter on the coffee table she lit weingrasss cigarette and repeated you are impossible and youre my arab mother superior said manny inhaling as though he were a child wallowing in a forbidden third dessert how are things in oman my old friend the sultan is a little confused but my younger friend his wife will straighten him out incidentally ahmat sends you his best he should he owes me for his grades at harvard and he never paid me for the broads i got him in los angeles somehow you always get to the heart of things how is everyone in jerusalem speaking of sending regards benami sends you his benny cried rashad sitting forward good lord i havent thought of him in years does he still wear those silly designer blue jeans and strap his weapon back over his tail he probably always will and charge the mossad double for both hes a good guy and one of the best control agents israels ever had we worked together in damascus hes small and a little cynical but a good man to have on your side tough as nails actually as your bum would say tell me about it we were closing in on the hotel in bahrain and all he did was give me lectures over the radio hell join us in masqat hell join you you not very nice person who has shut me out come on manny i know i know im a burden what do you think all right im a burden but even burdens are kept informed at least twice a day wheres benami going to meet us and how i cant imagine that the mossad wants any part of this after the iranian mess the moons too close especially with cia input and banks in switzerland ben will leave a telephone number at the palace switchboard for a miss adriennemy idea also someones coming with him who a lunatic that helps does he have a name only one i knew was code blue azra no that was the other one i know but the israeli killed azra the arabic blue evan told me it sickened him two kids with such hatred with the kids its all sickening instead of baseball bats they carry repeating rifles and grenades has payton straightened out your transportation he worked it out with us yesterday air force cargo to frankfurt and on to cairo where we go under cover in small craft to kuwait and dubai with the last leg by helicopter well reach oman at night landing in the jabal sham where one of ahmats unmarked cars will meet us and drive us to the palace thats really underground said weingrass nodding impressed it has to be evans got to disappear while stories are planted that he was seen in hawaii and is supposedly holed up at an estate on maui graphics is working up some photos showing him over there and theyll hit the newspapers mitchells imagination is improving theres none better manny maybe he should run the agency no he hates administrative work and hes a terrible politician if he doesnt like someone or something everybody knows it hes better off where he is the sound of the front door opening and closing had an immediate effect on weingrass oy he cried shoving his cigarette into the startled khalehlas mouth and blowing away the smoke above him waving his hands to move the incriminating evidence towards rashad naughty sheiks he whispered smoking in my presence impossible said khalehla softly removing the cigarette and crushing it in an ashtray as kendrick walked through the living room and on to the porch shed never smoke that close to you admonished evan dressed in a blue sweat suit perspiration rolling down his face now youve got the ears of a dobermann and youve got the brains of a hooked snapper very smart fish sorry said rashad calmly he can be terribly demanding tell me about it what did i just say shouted weingrass he says that all the time its the sign of a highly developed misplaced superiority complex and very irritating to really superior intellects have a good workout dummy kendrick smiled and walked to the bar where there was a jug of orange juice im up to thirty minutes fast pace he answered pouring himself a glass of juice thats very nice if youre a cowboys horse on a roundup he says things like that all the time protested kendrick its aggravating tell me about it khalehla replied drinking her coffee any calls asked evan its barely past seven darling not in zurich its past one in the afternoon over there i was talking to them before i went out talking to whom asked rashad mainly to the director of the gemeinschaft bank mitch scared his bladder dry with the information we have and hes trying to cooperate wait a minute did anyone check the telex in the study no but i heard the damn thing clacking away about twenty minutes ago said weingrass kendrick put down his glass turned and walked rapidly out of the porch and across the living room to a door beyond the stone hallway khalehla and manny watched him then looked at each other and shrugged within moments the congressman returned gripping a telex sheet in his hand his expression conveying his excitement they did it he exclaimed who did what asked weingrass the bank you remember the fifty million line of credit grinell and his consortium of thieves in california set up for my buyout my god exclaimed khalehla they couldnt have left it standing of course not it was cancelled the moment grinell got off the island so said manny in this age of complicated telecommunications computer errors crop up now and then and a beaut was just made theres no record of the cancellation having been received the credits on only its been transferred to a sister bank in bern with a new coded account number its all there theyll never pay weingrass was emphatic itll be charged against their reserves which are ten times fifty million theyll fight it evan insisted khalehla as emphatic as the old man and parade themselves in the swiss courts somehow i doubt it the cobra helicopter without markings stuttered across the desert at an altitude of less than five hundred feet evan and khalehla exhausted from nearly twentysix hours in the air and racing to covert connections on the ground sat next to each other rashads head on kendricks shoulder his own slumped down into his chest both were asleep a man in belted khaki overalls with no insignia walked out of the flight deck and down the fuselage he shook evans arm in the dim light well be there in about fifteen minutes sir oh kendrick snapped up his head blinking his eyes and opening them wide to rid them of sleep thanks ill wake my friend here they always do things before arriving anywhere dont they not this they said khalehla out loud without moving i sleep to the very last minute well forgive me but i dont i cant necessity calls men remarked the agent from cairo removing her head from his shoulder and shifting to the other side of the seat and into the bulkhead no control she added her eyes still closed well keep you posted said the air force flight officer laughing quietly and returning to the deck sixteen minutes passed and the pilot spoke over the intercom flare spotted directly ahead buckle up for touchdown please the helicopter decelerated and hovered over the ground where the headlights of two cars facing each other had replaced the flare slowly the chopper was lowered into its threshold depart the aircraft as quickly as possible please continued the pilot we have to get out of here fast if you catch my drift no sooner had they stepped down the metal ladder to the ground than the cobra its rotors thundering rose in the night sky it turned stuttering in the desert moonlight kicking up what sand there was and headed north accelerating rapidly the noise receding in the darkness above walking into the beams of a cars headlights was the young sultan of oman he was in slacks an opennecked white shirt replacing the new england patriots football jersey he had worn that first night he met with evan in the desert sixteen months ago let me talk first okay he said as kendrick and rashad approached okay replied kendrick first reactions can be not too smart agreed agreed agreed evan but im supposed to be smart right right still consistency is the product of small minds isnt that so within reasonable boundaries dont qualify dont you play lawyer the only bar you ever passed was with manny in los angeles why that hypocritical israeli nut at least you didnt say jew i wouldnt i dont like the sound of it any more than i like the sound of dirty arab anyway manny and i didnt pass too many bars in la that we didnt go into whats your point ahmat the young ruler breathed deeply and spoke quickly i know the whole story now and i feel like a damned idiot the whole story everything that inver brass crowd bollingers munitions bandits that bastard hamendi who my royal saudi brothers in riyadh should have executed the moment they caught him the whole ball of wax and i should have known you wouldnt do what i thought you did commando kendrick versus the rotten arab isnt you it never was you im sorry evan ahmat walked forward and embraced the congressman from colorados ninth district youre going to make me cry said khalehla smiling at the sight in front of her you you cairo tigress cried the sultan releasing kendrick and taking rashad in his arms we had a girl you know half american half omani sound familiar i know i wasnt permitted to contact you we understood but i was so touched her names khalehla if it werent for you khalehla one thered be no khalehla two come on lets go as they started for ahmats limousine the sultan turned to evan you look pretty fit for a guy whos been through so much i heal rapidly for an old man said kendrick tell me something ahmat who told you the whole story the whole ball of wax a man named payton mitchell payton cia your president jennings phoned me and said i was to expect a call from this payton and would i please accept it it was urgent hey that jennings is one charming character isnt he although im not sure he knew everything that payton told me why do you say that i dont know it was just a feeling the young sultan stood by the car door and looked at evan if you can pull this off my friend youll do more for the middle east and us on the gulf than all the diplomats in ten united nations were going to pull it off but only with your help youve got it benami and code blue walked down the narrow street into the al kabir bazaar looking for the outdoor cafe that served evening coffee they were dressed in neat dark business suits as befitted their bahrainian visas which stated that they were executives with the bank of england in manamah they saw the pavement cafe threaded their way through the crowds and the stalls and sat at the empty table nearest the street as instructed three minutes later a tall man in white robes and arab headdress joined them have you ordered coffee asked kendrick nobodys come around replied benami its a busy night how are you congressman lets try evan or better yet amal im here which in a way answers your question and weingrass not very well im afraid hello blue hello said the young man staring at kendrick you look very businesslike very unmilitary in those clothes im not sure id recognize you if i didnt know you were going to be here im not military any longer i had to leave the brigade itll miss you i miss it but my wounds didnt heal properlyvarious tendons they tell me azra was a good fighter a good commando still the hatred theres no hatred in my voice anger of course over many things but not hatred for the man i had to kill what are you doing now i work for the government he works for us interrupted benami for the mossad speaking of which ahmat apologizes for not having you to the palace is he crazy all he needs is members of the mossad in his house it wouldnt do us much good if anyone found out either how much did manny tell you with his big mouth what didnt he tell me he also called after you left the states with more information that blue was able to use how blue incidentally do you have another name with respect sir not for an american in consideration for us both all right i accept that what did weingrass say that you could use and how the young man leaned over the table all their heads were closer he gave us the figure of fifty million a brilliant manipulation broke in benami and i dont believe for a minute that it was mannys idea what well it could have been actually the bank had no choice washington leaned hard on it what about the fifty million south yemen answered blue i dont understand fifty million is a very large amount said the former leader of the masada brigade but there are larger amounts especially in the cumulative sense iran iraq et cetera so we must match the people with purses therefore south yemen it is terrorist and poor but its distant almost inaccessible location sandwiched between the gulf of aden and the red sea makes it strategically important to other terrorist organizations supported by far wealthier sources they constantly seek out land secret training grounds to develop their forces and spread their poison the baaka is constantly infiltrated and no one cares to deal with gaddafi hes mad and cant be trusted and any week may be overthrown i should tell you interrupted benami again that blue has emerged as one of our more knowledgeable experts on counter terrorism im beginning to see that go on young man you are not so much older than me try twenty years or close to it go ahead your idea as i understand it is to have air shipments of munitions from hamendis suppliers all over europe and america pass through masqat where supposedly corrupt officials close their eyes and let them fly on to lebanon and the baaka valley correct yes and as each cargo plane comes in the damage is done by the sultans guards posing as palestinians checking the supplies for which theyve paid hamendi while the crews are in quarantine each plane holds say sixty to seventy crates which will be prised open by teams of ten men per plane and saturated with corroding acid the process wont take more than fifteen to twenty minutes an aircraft the timings acceptable and were in total control the masqat garrison will cordon off the area and no one but our people will be allowed inside commendable said blue but i suggest that the process would also be too rushed and too riskprone pilots object to leaving their planes in this part of the world and the crews by and large hoodlums with strong backs and no minds will cause trouble when pushed around by strangers they smell officialdom believe me instead why not persuade the most prominent leaders in the baaka valley to go to south yemen with their veteran troops call it a new provisional movement financed by the enemies of israel of which there are quite a few around tell them there is an initial fifty million in arms and equipment for advanced training as well as for sending their assault forces up to gaza and the golan heightsmore to be supplied as needed it will be irresistible to those maniacs and instead of many air cargo shipments one ship loaded in bahrain rounding the gulf here and proceeding south along the coast on its way to the port of nishtun in south yemen where something will happen suggested kendrick id say in the waters west of ras al hadd what happens pirates answered blue a slight smile creasing his lips once in control of the ship they would have two days at sea to accomplish what they must far more subtly and thoroughly than they would racing around an airports cargo area where indeed hamendi might station his own people a harried waiter arrived whining his apologies and cursing the crowds benami ordered cardamom coffee as kendrick studied the young israeli counter terrorist you say once in control said evan but suppose it doesnt happen suppose something goes wrong say our hijackers cant take the ship or just one message is radioed back to bahrainonly a word pirates then theres no control the undamaged weapons get through and hamendi walks away free more millions in his pocket wed be risking too much for too little you risk far more at the airport in masqat argued blue his whisper emphatic you must listen to me you came back here for only a few days a year and a half ago you havent lived here in years you dont know what airports have become they are zoos of corruption who is bringing in what who has been bribed and how do i blackmail him why is there a change in procedure tell me my arab astiga or my good hebrew freund they are zoos nothing escapes the eyes of the jackals looking for money and money is paid for such information taking a ship at sea is the lesser risk with the greater benefit believe me youre convincing hes right said benami as their coffee arrived shukren said the mossad control agent thanking and paying the waiter as the man raced to another table it must of course be your decision amal bahrudi where do we find these pirates asked evan if they can be found and if they are acceptable being convinced of my projections replied blue his eyes rigid on kendricks face which went in and out of the shadows created by the passing crowds i broached the possibility of such an assignment to my former comrades in the masada i had more volunteers than i could count as you loathed the mahdi we loathe abdel hamendi who supplies the bullets that kill our people i chose six men only six this must not be solely an israeli operation i contacted six others i knew on the west bank palestinians who are as sickened by the hamendis of this world as i am together we will form a unit but it is still not enough we need six others from where from the host arab country that willingly knowingly breaks the back of abdel hamendi can your sultan provide them from his personal guards most are his relatives cousins i think that helps the illegal purchase of armaments on the international market is a relatively simple procedure which accounts for the fact that relatively simple people from washington to beirut can master it there are basically three prerequisites the first is immediate access to undisclosed and undisclosable funds the second is the name of an intermediary usually supplied over lunchnot over the telephoneby any senior executive of an armsproducing company or a bribable member of an intelligence organization this intermediary must be capable of reaching the primary middleman who will put the package together and coordinate the processing of enduser certificates this aspect in the united states simply means that export licences are granted for armaments on their way to friendly nations they are rerouted en route the third prerequisite should be the easiest but is usually the most difficult because of the extraordinary variety and complexity of the merchandise it is the preparation of the list of weapons and auxiliary equipment desired for purchase apparently no five buyers can agree on the lethal capabilities and effectiveness of an arms inventory and not a few lives have been lost during heated debates over these decisions the buyers frequently given to outbursts of hysteria which was why young code blues management talents were most welcome in terms of time and specificity the mossads agents in the baaka valley forwarded a list of the currently most favoured merchandise including the usual crates of repeating weapons hand grenades timefused explosives black pvc landing craft longrange underwater tank and demolition accoutrements and assorted training and assault equipment such as grappling hooks heavy ropes and rope ladders infrared binoculars electronic mortars flamethrowers and antiaircraft rocket missiles it was an impressive inventory that chewed up approximately eighteen million of the estimated twentysix millions worth one could buy from an arms merchant for fifty million american dollarsthe fluctuating rates of exchange being always in favour of the merchant therefore blue added three small chinese tanks under the technical umbrella of location defence and the list was completenot only complete but entirely believable the unknown unrecorded nevertobeacknowledged agent of control namely one benami now dressed in his favourite ralph lauren blue jeans operated out of the mossad safe house next to the portuguese cemetery in the jabal saali to his fury the intermediary for abdel hamendi was an israeli in bet shemesh he concealed his contempt and negotiated the huge purchase knowing in the forefront of his mind that there would be a death in bet shemesh if and when they all survived the two units of six commandos arrived one after another at night in the desert of jabal sham above flares that directed the two helicopters into their thresholds the sultan of oman greeted the volunteers and introduced them to their comrades six highly skilled personal guards from the masqat garrison eighteen menpalestinians israeli and omanigripped hands in their common objective death to the merchant of death the training began the next morning beyond the shoals of al ashkarah in the arabian sea death to the merchant of death adrienne khalehla rashad walked into ahmats office cradling the infant named khalehla in her arms beside her was the childs mother roberta yamenni from new bedford massachusetts among the elite of oman known as bobbie shes so beautiful exclaimed the agent from cairo she had to be said the father behind the desk evan kendrick in a chair beside him she has a name to live up to oh nonsense not from where im sitting said the american congressman youre an oversexed bear im also leaving tonight and so am i added the sultan of oman you cant you cant the high female voices were in concert what the hell do you think youre doing yelled the sultans wife what i wish to do replied ahmat calmly in these areas of royal prerogative i dont have to consult anyone thats bullshit cried the wife and mother i know but it works the training was over in seven days and on the eighth day twentytwo passengers climbed into a trawler off the coast of ras al hadd their equipment stowed below the gunwales on the ninth day at sundown in the arabian sea the cargo ship from bahrain was picked up on the radar when darkness came the trawler headed south to the interceptcoordinates death to the merchant of death the icarus agenda chapter the cargo ship was a bobbing hulk on the swells of the dark sea its bow rising and falling like an angry predator intent on feeding the trawler from ras al hadd stopped in the water half a mile to starboard of the approaching vessel two large pvc lifeboats were lowered over the side the first holding twelve men the other ten and one woman khalehla rashad was between evan kendrick and the young sultan of oman all were encased in tank suits their darkened faces barely visible within the folds of the formfitting black rubber in addition to canvas knapsacks across their backs and the bound waterproofed weapons clipped to their belts each wore large circular suction cups strapped to their knees and forearms the two boats pitched and rolled beside each other in the dark sea as the cargo ship ploughed forward then as the great black wall of the vessel rose above them the lifeboats pulled alongside their quiet motors drowned out by the slapping waves one by one the pirates clamped their cups on to the hull each checking his companion on the left to make certain he was secure all were slowly like a cluster of ants crawling up a filthy garbage can the force from oman made its way to the top of the hull to the gunwales where the suction cups were released and dropped back into the sea are you all right whispered khalehla beside evan all right protested kendrick my arms are killing me and i think my legs are somewhere in the water down there which i dont intend to look at good youre all right you do things like this for a living not very often said the agent from cairo on the other hand ive done worse youre all maniacs i didnt go into a compound filled with terrorists i mean thats crazy shhh ordered ahmat yamenni sultan of oman on rashads right the teams are going over be quiet the palestinians took out the barely awake men on watch at the bow midships and stern while the israelis raced up the gangways to an upper deck and captured five seamen who were sitting against a bulkhead drinking wine by design as they were in the waters of the gulf of oman the omanis ran up to the bridge to formally instruct the captain that the ship was under their control by royal decree and that its present course was to be maintained the crew was rounded up and checked for weapons all their knives and guns removed they were confined to quarters with an omani a palestinian and an israeli in rotating units of three standing guard the captain a gaunt fatalist with a stubble of a beard accepted the circumstances with a shrug of his shoulders and offered neither resistance nor objection he stayed at the wheel asking only that his first and second mates relieve him at the proper times the request was granted and his subsequent comment summed up his philosophical reaction arabs and jews together are now the pirates of the high seas the world is a little madder than i thought the radio man however was the most startling surprise the communications room was approached cautiously khalehla leading two members of the masada brigade and evan kendrick at her signal the door was crashed open and their weapons levelled at the operator the operator pulled a small israeli flag out of his pocket and grinned hows manny weingrass he asked good god was the only response the congressman from colorado could manage it was to be expected said khalehla for two days on the water approaching the port of nishtun the force from oman worked in shifts around the clock in the hold of the cargo ship they were thorough as each man knew the merchandise he was dealing with knew it and effectively destroyed it crates were resealed leaving no marks of sabotage in evidence there were only neatly repacked weapons and equipment precisely as if they had come off assembly lines all over the world and been gathered together by abdel hamendi seller of death at dawn on the third day the ship sailed into the harbour of nishtun south yemen the pirates from the west bank oman and the masada brigade as well as the female agent from cairo and the american congressman had all changed into the clothes packed in their knapsacks half arab half western they wore the dishevelled garments of erratically employed merchant seamen scratching for survival in an unfair world five palestinians posing as bahrainian cargomen stood by the gangplank that in moments would be lowered the rest watched impassively from the lower deck as the crowds gathered at the one enormous pier in the centre of the harbour complex hysteria was in the air it was everywhere the ship was a symbol of deliverance for rich and powerful people somewhere thought the proud suffering fighters of south yemen were important it was a carnival of vengeance over what they might not collectively agree upon but wild mouths below wild eyes screamed screams of violence the vessel docked and the frenzy on the pier was earshattering selected members of the ships crew under the watchful eyes and guns of the omani force were put to work at their familiar machinery and the massive unloading process began as skids of crates were lifted out of the hold by cranes and swung over the side down to the cargo area rabid cheers greeted each delivery two hours after the unloading started it ended with the emergence of the three small chinese tanks and if the crates sent the crowds into frenzy the tanks took them up into orbit raggedly uniformed soldiers had to hold back their countrymen from swarming over the armourplated vehicles again they were symbols of great importance of immense recognition from somewhere jesus christ said kendrick gripping ahmats arm staring down at the base of the pier look where i see broke in khalehla in trousers her hair swept up under a greek fishermans hat my god i dont believe it its him isnt it who demanded the young sultan angrily hamendi answered evan pointing at a man in a white silk suit surrounded by other men in uniforms and robes the procession continued on to the pier the soldiers in front clearing the way hes wearing the same white suit he wore in one of the photographs in the vanvlanderens apartment added rashad im sure hes got dozens explained kendrick im also sure he thinks they make him look pure and godlike ill say this for himhes got balls leaving his armed camp in the alps and coming here only a few hours by air from riyadh why said ahmat hes protected the saudis wouldnt dare inflame these crazies by taking any action across the border besides interrupted khalehla hamendi smells millions more where this ship came from hes securing his turf and thats worth a minor risk i know what hes doing said evan speaking to khalehla but looking at the young sultan the saudis wouldnt dare continued kendrick repeating ahmats words the omanis wouldnt dare there are perfectly sound reasons to leave well enough alone where fanatics are concerned and let them sink in their own quagmires responded the sultan defensively thats not the point what is were counting on the fact that when all these people especially the leaders from the baaka valley find out that most of what they paid for is a bunch of crap hamendi will be called a fiftymilliondollar thief hes a pariah an arab who betrays arabs for money the word will spread like falcons in the wind as my people would have said only a couple of decades ago agreed the sultan from what i know of the baaka hit teams will be sent out by the dozens to kill him not simply because of the money but because hes made fools of them thats the optimum said kendrick thats what were hoping for but hes got millions all over the world and there are thousands of places to hide what is your point evan asked khalehla maybe we can move up the timetable and with any luck ensure the optimum speak english not latin insisted the agent from cairo thats a circus down there the soldiers can barely hold back the crowds all thats needed is for a movement to get started people shouting in unison chanting until their voices shake the damn city farjunna farjunna farjunna show us translated ahmat one or two crates prised open rifles held up in triumph then ammunitions found and handed over and shot off by lunatics into the sky completed khalehla but they dont fire then other crates are opened went on the sultan catching the shared enthusiasm equipment ruined life rafts slashed flamethrowers fizzling and hamendis right there how can we get down there you cant either of you said kendrick firmly signalling a member of the masada team the man ran over and evan continued rapidly not giving ahmat or rashad a chance to speak only to stare at him stunned you know who i am dont you he asked the israeli im not supposed to but of course i do i am considered the leader of this entire unit arent i yes but im grateful that there are others irrelevant i am the leader all right youre the leader i want these two people placed under cabin arrest immediately the sultans and khalehlas protests were drowned out by the israelis own reaction are you out of your mind that man is i dont care if hes muhammad himself and shes cleopatra lock them up evan raced away towards the gangplank and the hysterical crowds below on the pier kendrick found the first of the five palestinian cargomen and pulled him away from a group of soldiers and screaming awed civilians surrounding one of the chinese tanks he spoke quickly into the mans ear the arab responded by nodding his head and pointing to one of his companions in the crowd gesturing that he would tell the others each man ran along the pier from one frenzied group to another shrieking at the top of his lungs repeating the message over and over until the feverish cry was picked up for the command it was like an enormous rolling wave pounding across a human sea the shouting erupted a thousand disparate voices slowly coming into concert farjunna farjunna farjunna the crowds converged en masse on the cargo area and the small elite procession in which abdel hamendi was the centre of attraction was literally swept aside inside the huge doors of the rundown warehouse near the end of the pier apologies were shouted to and accepted by the arms merchant with false grace he looked as though he had come to the wrong part of town and could not wait to get out would have were it not for the rewards that could be his by staying this way yelled a voice evan knew only too well it was khalehla and beside her was ahmat both barely holding their own within the tumultuous frantic crowds what the hell are you doing here roared kendrick joining them bodies pushing and shoving all around them mr congressman said the sultan of oman imperiously you may be the leader of the unit which is entirely debatable but i command the ship my damned troops took it do you know whatll happen if she loses her hat or her shirt and these lunatics see shes a woman and have you any idea of the reception youll get if anyone has the slightest clue who you will you two stop it cried rashad giving an order not asking a question hurry up the soldiers could lose control any minute and weve got to make sure it happens our way how shouted evan the crates answered khalehla the stacks on the left with the red markings go ahead of me ill never get through by myself ill hold your arm thats quite a concession come on the three of them crashed sideways through the dense constantly moving jostling crowds pummelling their way to a double stack of crates at least ten feet high held together by wide jetblack metal straps a cordon of nearly panicked soldiers too few to lock arms but gripping hands formed a circle around the lethal merchandise holding back the increasingly impatient increasingly angry throngs who now demanded farjunna farjunnato be shown the supplies that signified their own importance these are the guns and everyone knows it yelled kendrick into rashads ear theyre going crazy of course they know it and of course theyre going crazy look at the markings all over the wooden crates were stencilled dozens of the same insignia three red circles two progessively smaller ones within the largest bulls eyes the universal symbol of a target explained khalehla and bulls eyes mean weapons it was blues idea he figured that terrorists live by guns so theyd flock to them he knows his new business wheres the ammunition asked ahmat pulling two small pronged instruments from his pockets the west bankers are taking care of it replied rashad crouching under the assault of thrashing arms around her the crates are unmarked but they know which ones they are and will break them open theyre waiting for us lets go then cried the young sultan handing evan one of the instruments he had removed from his pockets what pliers we have to snap as many of the crate straps as we can to make sure they all fall apart oh they would have anywaynever mind we have to rush this bunch of maniacs forward and break the ring move back ahmat and you get behind us said kendrick to the agent from cairo fending off the furious arms and fists knees and feet that kept hammering at them from all directions when i nod continued evan shouting at the sultan of oman as they smashed through the frenzied bodies all trying to reach the crates hit the line like you just got signed up by the patriots baseball team no ya shaikh yelled ahmat like i just got signed by omanunder fire as it should be these are the enemies of my people now roared kendrick as he and the young muscular ruler crashed forward into the figures in front of them shoulders and extended arms propelling the screaming terrorists into the circle of soldiers the line broke the assault on the tenfoothigh double stacks of heavy crates was total and evan and ahmat surged through balloontrousered legs and flailing arms to the wood and the wide metal straps their pliers working furiously the bindings snapped and the crates tumbled down as if exploded from within the weight and strength of a hundred assaulters precipitating their violent descents wooden slats everywhere came apart and where they did not maniacal hands prised them apart then like starving locusts attacking the sweet leaves of trees the terrorists of south yemen and the baaka valley crawled over the crates yanking out weapons from their plastic casements and throwing them to their brothers while shrieking and straddling the large cartons that took on the grotesque images of coffins simultaneously the palestinian team from the west bank heaved boxes of ammunition all around and over the collapsed wooden mountain of death supplied by the seller of death abdel hamendi the guns were varied all types and all sizes ripped with abandon from their soft recesses many did not know what shells went into which weapons but many others mainly from the baaka did and they instructed their less sophisticated brothers from south yemen the first repeating machine gun that was fired in triumph from atop the ersatz pyramid of death blew off the face of the one who pulled the trigger in the midst of staccato sounds everywhere others were fired there were several hundred fruitless clicks but also dozens of explosions where heads and arms and hands were blown away blown away hysteria fed upon hysteria terrorists threw down their guns in terror while others used their hands and whatever implements they could find to prise open the unmarked crates everywhere it was as the young sultan of oman had predicted items of equipment were dragged out all over the pier yanked from boxes and unfolded or pulled apart or ripped from their plastic casings and displayed for all to see as each piece was examined the crowds went wilder and wilder but no longer in triumph instead in animal fury among the items were infrared binoculars with smashed lenses rope ladders with their rungs severed grappling hooks without points underwater oxygen tanks with holes drilled in the cylinders flamethrowers their nozzles crushed together guaranteeing instant incineration to whoever operated them and anyone within thirty yards rocket missile launchers without detonating caps and again as ahmat had projected landing craft held up to show where the seams had been split all of which threw the manic crowd into paroxysms of rage over the betrayal in the chaos evan weaved through the hysterical bodies to the warehouse at the midpoint of the huge pier he pressed his back against the wall and sidestepped to within three feet of the massive open doors the whitesuited hamendi was shouting in arabic that everything would be replaced his and their enemies in the bahrain depots who did this would be killed every one killed his protestations drew looks of narroweyed suspicion from those he addressed and then a man in a dark conservative pinstriped suit appeared rounding the corner of the warehouse and kendrick froze it was crayton grinell attorney and chairman of the board for the government within the government after his initial shock evan wondered why he was astonished even surprised where else could grinell go but to the core of the international network of arms merchants it was his last and only secure refuge the lawyer spoke briefly to hamendi who instantly translated grinells words explaining that his associate had already contacted bahrain and learned what had happened it was jews he exclaimed israeli terrorists had assaulted an island depot killed all the men on watch and done these terrible things how could that be asked a stocky man in the only pressed revolutionary uniform replete with at least a dozen medals all these supplies were in the original crates even boxes within cartons the casings unbroken how could it be the jews can be ingenious screamed hamendi you know that as well as i do i shall fly back immediately replace the entire order and learn the truth what do we do in the meantime asked the obvious leader of south yemens revolutionary regime what do i tell our brothers from the baaka valley we are all all of us disgraced you will have your vengeance as well as your weapons be assured grinell spoke again to the arms merchant and once more hamendi translated i am informed by my associate that our radar clearances are only in effect for the next three hoursat an extraordinary expense to me personally i might addand we must leave at once restore us our dignity fellow arab or we will find you and you will lose your life you have my guarantee that the first will happen and there will be no necessity for the second i leave they were going to get away thought kendrick goddamn it they were going to get away grinell had given hamendi the unctuous words and both of them were going to fly out of this hub of insanity and go on doing their insane obscene businessasusual he had to stop them he had to move as the two arms merchants walked rapidly out of the doors of the warehouse and around the corner of the building evan raced across the openingas one more hysterical terroristand thrashed his way towards the two welldressed men through the excited crowds on the pier he was within feet of crayton grinell then inches he pulled his longbladed knife out of its scabbard on his belt and lunged circling his left arm around the american attorneys neck and forcing him to pivot to confront him face to face inches one from the other you screamed grinell this is for an old man whos dying and thousands of others youve killed the knife plunged into the lawyers stomach and then kendrick ripped it up through the chest grinell fell to the planks on the pier amid a multitude of rushing paranoid terrorists who had no idea that another welldressed terrorist had been killed and lay beneath them hamendi he had raced ahead oblivious of his associate determined only to reach the vehicle that would take him to his radarcleared plane out of south yemen across hostile borders he must not reach it the merchant of death could not be allowed to deal in death any morel evan literally sledgehammered a path through the onslaught of running screaming figures to the base of the pier there was a wide ascending stretch of concrete that led up to a dirt road where a russian zia limousine waited the exhaustfumes indicating that the engine was roaring waiting for the cars escaping passenger hamendi his white silk jacket billowing behind him was within yards of his escape kendrick called upon strengths within him that defied the outer regions of his imagination and raced up the concrete incline his legs about to collapse and then they did collapse twenty feet from the zia as hamendi approached the door from his prone position his weapon barely steadied by both trembling hands he fired again and again and again abdel hamendi the king of the court of international arms merchants reached for his throat as he fell to the ground it was not over screamed a voice in kendricks mind there was something else to do he crawled down the concrete incline reaching into his pocket for a map code blue had given everyone in case of separation and possible escape he tore off a fragment taking a small blunt pencil from another pocket and wrote the following in arabic hamendi the liar is dead soon all the merchants will die for everywhere the treachery has begun as you have seen for yourself this day everywhere they have been paid by israel and the great satan america to sell us defective weapons everywhere reach our brothers everywhere and tell them what i have told you and what you have witnessed this day no weapons from this day on can be trusted signed by a silent friend who knows painfully as though the wounds from the island off mexico had returned evan got to his feet and ran as fast as he could back into the angry still shrieking crowds towards the doors of the warehouse feigning hysterical pleas to allah over the death of a brother he fell prostrate in front of the small group of leaders which now included those from the baaka valley in lebanon as hands came down to offer comfort he shoved the paper towards them rose suddenly to his feet screaming and raced out of the warehouse doors disappearing into the now wailing grieving crowds kneeling beside mutilated corpses everywhere in panic he heard the basstoned whistles from the cargo shipsignals of departure he pummelled his way to the far side of the pier where he saw khalehla and ahmat standing by the gangplank shouting up to the men on deck if possible more panicky than himself where the hell have you been screamed rashad her eyes furious they were lying their way out yelled kendrick as ahmat shoved both of them on to the gangplank which at his signal began its retreat into the ship hamendi asked khalehla and grinell grinell shouted the agent from cairo as the three of them staggered forward of course grinell added rashad where else youre a goddamned fool congressman roared the young sultan of oman still shoving his charges now on to the deck of the ship which had already floated away from the pier another thirty seconds and you would have stayed back there any minute that crowd could have turned on us and i couldnt risk the lives of these men christ youve really grown up we all do our thing when its our turn what about hamendi and this whoeverheis i killed them just like that said ahmat breathlessly but calmly we all do our thing when its our turn your highness gerald bryce walked into the computerized study of his house in georgetown and went directly to his processor he sat down in front of it and turned on the switch as the screen lit up he typed in a code instantly the green letters responded ultra maximum secure no existing intercepts proceed the young strikingly handsome expert smiled and continued to type i have now read all the max confidential printouts reaching the cia and coded for m j paytons modem only in a word the entire report is incredible and already the effects of the operation are seen to date barely two weeks after the events in south yemen seven of the most prominent arms merchants have been assassinated and it is estimated that the flow of weapons to the middle east has been cut by per cent our man is invincible more to the point however combined with the previous information we possess the white house mustrepeat mustlisten to us in the event we care to have our voice heard we will of course exercise this prerogative with the utmost circumspection but it is nevertheless ours to exercise for regardless of outcome positive or negative national and international laws have been broken the administration has been directly and indirectly associated with murder terrorism corruption and indeed approached the edge of that allinclusive condemnation crimesagainsthumanity as we agree there must always be a benevolent selfless power above the white house to give it direction and the means to that power is to know the innermost secrets of any administration in this we are succeeding in ways undreamed of by those who came before us if there is a god may he grant that we and our successors are truthful to our beliefs penultimately it strikes me that the sound and the partial cadence of inver brass is not far distant from a medical term intravenous its quite appropriate i believe finally i am working on several other projects and will keep you informed in a boat off glorious cay in the bahamas a large black man sat in the opulent cabin of his bertram yacht studying the computer screen in front of him he smiled at the words he read inver brass was in good hands young capable

fraternity of brilliance what was so extraordinary was the ordinariness of its inevitability their brotherhood was preordained inescapable its origins found in the most common of occurrences the

was recovering for he was not and there was no change in the terminal status of the virus infection however he appeared not to be getting much worse his rate of decline was far slower than had been anticipated the doctors would not by any means pronounce the disease arrested they were simply confused as the pathologist in denver phrased it lets say on a scale of one to minus tenminus ten being checkout timethe old guys hovering around minus six and wont move down but the virus is still there said kendrick as he and khalehla walked with the doctor in the grounds of the colorado house out of mannys earshot its rampant its just not incapacitating him to the degree that it should its probably the cigarettes he cons and all the whisky he steals stated rashad he doesnt said the pathologist surprised and even more bewildered evan and khalehla nodded their heads in resigned confirmation hes a bellicose survivor explained kendrick with more wisdom and larceny in his head than anyone ive ever met also since the prognosis was severe in terms of time we havent exactly kept our eyes wide open every minute weve been with him please understand congressman i dont want to give you any false hope hes a terribly ill eightysixyearold man eightysix exclaimed evan didnt you know no he said he was eightyone im sure he believes it or at least has convinced himself hes the sort who when they turn sixty the next birthdays fiftyfive nothing wrong with that at all by the way but we wanted a complete medical history so we went back to his days in new york city did you know he had three wives by the time he was thirtytwo im sure theyre still looking for him oh no theyve all passed away atlanta wanted their histories toopossible latent sexually related complications that sort of thing did they check los angeles paris rome tel aviv riyadh and all of the emirates asked khalehla drily remarkable said the pathologist softly but with emphasis a medical mind apparently pondering perhaps envying well i should be leaving im due back in denver by noon and congressman thank you for the private jet it saved me a great deal of time i couldnt do anything less doctor i appreciate everything youre doing everything youve done the pathologist paused looking at evan i just said congressman mr kendrick perhaps i should say mr vice president as i and indeed most of the country believe you should be in truth if youre not in the running i dont intend to vote and i can tell you i speak for the majority of my friends and associates thats not a viable position doctor besides the issue hasnt been resolved come on ill walk you to the car khalehla check on our sybaritic adolescent and make sure hes not taking a bath in scotch will you if he is do you think im going to walk in there sure i will rashad shook hands with the pathologist from denver thank you for everything she said ill know you mean it if you persuade this young man he really must be our next vice president i repeat said kendrick leading the physician across the lawn to the circular drive that issue is far from resolved doctor the issue should be resolved shouted emmanuel weingrass from his reclining chair on the enclosed porch the congressman and khalehla sitting in their accustomed positions on the couch so that the old architect could glower at them what do you think its all finished so bollinger and his fascist thieves are out and theres no one to take their places youre that stupid cut it out manny said evan there are too many areas where langford jennings and i differ for a president to be comfortable with someone like me who might possibly succeed himand the thought of that scares the hell out of me lang knows all that cried weingrass lang the architect shrugged well youll learn soon enough learn what soon enough jennings kind of invited himself out to lunch here a few weeks ago when you and my lovely daughter were winding things up in washington so what could i do tell the president of the united states he couldnt nosh a little oh shit said kendrick hold it darling interrupted khalehla im fascinated really fascinated go on manny yelled evan well we discussed many thingshes not an intellectual i grant you but hes smart and he understands the larger picture thats what hes good at you know i dont know and how dare you intercede for me because im your father you ungrateful idiot the only father youve ever known without me youd still be hustling a few buildings with the saudis and wondering if you could cover your costs dont talk about my daringyou were lucky i daredtalk about your obligations to others all right all right we couldnt have done what we did without your balls without your strength but i was there so listen to me in exasperation kendrick closed his eyes and leaned back on the couch suddenly khalehla realized that weingrass was unobtrusively signalling to her his lips in exaggerated movement the silent words were easily read its an act i know what im doing she could only respond by looking at the old man bewildered okay manny said evan opening his eyes and staring at the ceiling you can cut it out im listening thats better weingrass winked at the agent from cairo and continued you can walk away and nobodys got the right to say or think a bad word because youre owed and you dont owe anybody anything but i know you my friend and the man i know has a streak of outrage in him that he keeps running away from yet never can because its part of him in short words you dont happen to like rotten peoplepresent older company exceptedand its a good thing for this meshugah world that guys like you are around there are too many of the other type still i see a problem and to put it in an eggshell its that not too many of your kind can do a hell of a lot because no one listens to them why should anyone who are they troublemakers whistleblowers insignificant agitators theyre easily disposed of anyway jobs are lost promotions withheld and if theyre really serious they wind up in the courts where their whole lives are soileddirt dug up on them thats got nothing to do with what theyre there for by expensive lawyers whove got more tricks than houdiniand if all they end up with is a dole card and usually no wife and kids maybe it could be worse maybe they could be found under a truck or down on the tracks of a subway at an inappropriate time now you on the other hand everybody listens to youlook at the polls youre the top cardinal of the country granting the fact that langford jennings is popeand theres not a shyster in or out of sight whod take you on in the courts much less the congress as i see it youve got the chance to speak from the top for a hell of a lot of people down below who cant get a hearing lang will bring you in on everything lang again muttered kendrick interrupting not my doing exclaimed weingrass palms outstretched i started right off the right way with a mr president ask the nurses who all had to go to the bathroom the minute he came insidehes some mensch i tell you anyway after a drink which he himself got for me from the bar when the girls were out he said i was refreshing and why didnt i call him lang and forget the formal stuff manny broke in khalehla why did the president say you were refreshing well in small talk i mentioned that the new building theyre putting up on some avenue or otherit was in the new york timeswasnt so hotsytotsy and he shouldnt have congratulated that asshole architect on television the goddamned renderings looked like neoclassicart deco and believe me the combination doesnt work also what the hell did he a president know about square foot construction costs that were estimated at about onethird of what theyre going to be langs looking into it oh shit repeated evan defeat in his voice back to the point im trying to make said weingrass his face suddenly very serious as he stared at kendrick while pausing for several long intakes of breath maybe youve done enough maybe you should walk away and live happily ever after with my arab daughter here making lots more money the respect of the country even much of the world is already yours but maybe also youve got to think you can do what not too many others can do rather than going after the rotten people by which time theres so much corruption and loss of life maybe you can stop them before they play dirtyat least some of them perhaps more than somefrom the top of the mountain all i ask is that you listen to jennings listen to what he has to say to you their eyes locked father and son acknowledged each other on the deepest level of their relationship ill call him and ask him for a meeting all right thats not necessary replied manny its all set up what hell be in los angeles tomorrow at the century plaza for a dinner raising scholarship funds in honour of his late secretary of state hes cleared some time before then and expects you at the hotel at seven oclock you too my dear he insists the two secret service men in the hallway outside the presidential suite acknowledged the congressman by sight they nodded at him and khalehla as the man on the right turned and rang the bell moments later langford jennings opened the door his face pale and haggard with dark circles of exhaustion below his eyes he made a brief attempt at his famous grin but could not sustain it instead he smiled gently extending his hand hello miss rashad its a pleasure and a privilege to meet you please come in thank you mr president evan its good to see you again its good to see you sir said kendrick thinking as he walked inside that jennings looked older than he had ever seen him please sit down the president preceded his guests into the living room of the suite towards two opposing couches a large round glass coffee table linking them please he repeated gesturing at the couch on the right as he headed for the one on the left i like to look at attractive people he added as they all sat down i suppose my detractors would say its another sign of my superficiality but harry truman once said id rather look at a horses head than his ass so i rest my case forgive the language young lady i didnt hear anything to forgive sir hows manny hes not going to win but hes putting up a fight answered evan i understand you visited him several weeks ago was that wicked of me not at all but it was a little wicked of him not to tell me that was my idea i wanted to give us both time to think and in my case i had to learn more about you than what was written in several hundred pages of government jargon so i went to the one source that made sense to me i asked him to be quiet until the other day i apologize no need to sir weingrass is a brave man he knows hes dyinghis diagnosis is wrong but he knows hes dyingand he pretends to treat his impending death like a statistic on a construction proposal i dont expect to see eightyone but if i do i hope i have his courage eightysix said kendrick flatly i thought he was eightyone too but we found out yesterday hes eightysix langford jennings looked hard at evan then as if the congressman had just told an extraordinarily amusing joke he leaned back on the couch his neck arched and laughed quietly but wholeheartedly why is that so funny asked kendrick ive known him for twenty years and he never told the truth about his age even on passports it dovetails with something he said to me explained the president speaking through his soft subsiding laughter i wont bore you with the details but he pointed out something to meand he was damned rightso i offered him an appointment he said to me sorry lang i cant accept i couldnt burden you with my graft hes an original mr president offered khalehla they broke the mould jenningss voice trailed off as his expression became serious he looked at rashad your uncle mitch sends you his love oh payton left an hour ago im sorry to say he had to get back to washington but i spoke with him yesterday and he insisted on flying out to see me before i met with congressman kendrick why asked evan disturbed he finally told me the whole story of inver brass well not everything of course because we dont know everything with winters and varak gone well probably never learn who broke open the oman file but it doesnt matter now the holy inver brass is finished he hadnt told you before kendrick was astonished yet he remembered ahmat saying that he was not sure jennings knew everything payton had told him he was honest about it while offering his resignation which i promptly rejected he said that if i knew the entire story i might have squashed the bid being made in your name for you to be my running mate i dont know i might have i certainly would have been furious but thats irrelevant now ive learned what i wanted to learn and youre not only out of the starting gate youve got a national mandate congressman mr president protested evan its an artificial what the hell did sam winters think he was doing interrupted jennings firmly cutting off kendrick i dont give a damn how pristine their motives were he forgot a lesson of history that he above all men should have remembered whenever a select group of benevolent elitists consider themselves above the will of the people and proceed to manipulate that will in the dark without accountability theyve set in motion a hell of a dangerous machine because all it takes is one or two of those superior beings with very different ideas to persuade the others or replace the others or survive the others and a republic is down the drain sam winters highsounding inver brass was no better than bollingers tribe of boardroom thugs both wanted things done only one way their way evan shot forward its precisely for those reasons the doorbell of the presidential suite rang four short rings lasting no more than half a second each jennings held up his hand and looked at khalehla youd appreciate this miss rashad what you just heard is a code a what well its not terribly sophisticated but it works it tells me whos at the door and the who in this case is one of the more valuable aides in the white house come in the door opened and gerald bryce walked inside closing it firmly behind him im sorry to intrude mr president but ive just got word from beijing and i knew youd want to know it can wait gerry let me introduce you joe the name slipped out of kendricks mouth as the memory of a military jet to sardinia and a handsome young specialist from the state department came into focus hello congressman said bryce walking to the couch and shaking hands with evan while nodding to khalehla miss rashad thats right interjected jennings gerry told me he briefed you on the plane when you flew to oman i wont blow his horn in front of him but mitch payton stole him from frank swann at the state department and i stole him from mitch hes positively terrifying when it comes to computer communications and how to keep them secret now if someone will restrain the secretaries he may have a future youre embarrassingly kind sir said bryce the efficient professional but as to beijing mr president their answer is affirmative shall i reconfirm your offer thats another code explained jennings grinning i said id jawbone our leading bankers on the qt not to get too greedy in hong kong and make it rough for the chinese banks when the ninetyeight transition occurs of course in return for mr president interrupted bryce with all due courtesy but not without a tone of caution oh sorry gerry i know its top secret and eyesonly and all that other stuff but i hope that pretty soon nothing will be withheld from the congressman speaking of which sir continued the white house communications expert glancing at kendrick and briefly smiling in the absence of your political staff here in los angeles ive approved vice president bollingers statement of withdrawal tonight its in line with your thinking you mean hes going to shoot himself on television not quite mr president he does say however that he intends to devote his life to improving the lot of the worlds hungry if i find that mother stealing a chocolate bar hes in leavenworth for the rest of his life beijing sir shall i reconfirm you certainly may and add my gratitude the thieves bryce nodded to kendrick and khalehla and left again closing the door firmly behind him where were we inver brass replied evan they created me and artificially put me before the public as someone im not under those conditions my nomination could hardly be called the will of the people its a charade youre a charade asked jennings you know what im talking about i neither sought it nor wanted it as you put it so well i was manipulated into the race and shoved down everyones throat i didnt win it or earn it in the political process langford jennings studied kendrick the silence was both pensive and electric youre wrong evan said the president finally you did win it and you did earn it im not talking about oman and bahrain or even the stillunderwraps south yementhose events are simply acts of personal courage and sacrifice that have been used to initially call attention to you its no different from a man having been a war hero or an astronaut and a perfectly legitimate handle to propel you into the limelight i object to the way it was done as much as you do because it was done secretly by men who broke laws and unconsciously wasted lives and hid behind a curtain of influence but that wasnt you they werent you you earned it in this town because you said things that had to be said and the country heard you nobody mocked up those television tapes and nobody put the words in your mouth and what you did behind the scenes in those closed intelligence hearings had the beltway choked with traffic jams you asked questions for which there were no legitimate answers and a hell of a lot of entrenched bureaucrats used to having their own way still dont know what hit them except that theyd better get their acts together lastly and this is from me lang jennings of idaho you saved the nation from my most zealous contributors and i do mean zealous like in zealots they would have taken us down a road i dont even want to think about you would have found them yourself some time somewhere one of them would have pushed you too far and you would have pushed back and found them all i saw a man try to lean on you in the oval office and he knew when a tree was about to fall on him oh herb dennison and that medal of freedom the presidents worldfamous grin momentarily came back to him as he laughed herb was tough but harmless and did a lot of things i dont like doing myself hes gone now the oval office did it for him he got a call from one of those old firms on wall street the kind where everyones a member of some exclusive club no one can get into and you and i wouldnt want to so hes heading back to the money boys herb finally got the colonels rank he always wanted i beg your pardon said kendrick nothing forget it national security state secret and all that other stuff then let me make clear what we both know mr president im not qualified qualified who in heaven or hell is qualified for my job no one thats who im not talking about your job you could be interrupted jennings then im light years away from being ready for that i never could be you are already what listen to me evan i dont fool myself im well aware that i have neither the imagination nor the intellectual capacities of a jefferson either of the adams a madison a lincoln a wilson a hooveryes i said hoover that brilliant much maligned manor an fdr a truman a nixonyes nixon whose flaw was in his character not in his geopolitical overviewor a kennedy or even the brilliant carter who had too many brain cells for his own good politically but weve come into a different age now drop aquarius and insert telerius thats the fullgrown age of television instant immediate communication what i have is the trust of the people because they see and hear the man i saw a nation wallowing in selfpity and defeat and i got angry churchill once said that democracy may have a lot of flaws but it was the best system man ever devised i believe that and i believe all those bromides about america being the greatest the strongest the most benevolent country on the face of the earth call me mr simplistic but i do believe thats what the people see and hear and were not so bad off for it we all recognize reflections of ourselves in others and ive watched you listened to you read everything there is to say about you and talked at length with my friend emmanuel weingrass in my very sceptical judgment this is the job you must takealmost whether you want it or not mr president broke in kendrick softly i appreciate everything youve done for the nation but in all honesty there are differences between us youve espoused certain policies i cant support good christ i dont ask you to well on the surface id appreciate your shutting up until you talked to me about the issues i trust you evan and i wont keep you out convince me tell me where im wrongwithout fear or favourthats what this goddamned office needs i can get carried away on some things and know i should be pulled back ask my wife after the last press conference two months ago i walked into our kitchen upstairs in the white house and expected some kind of congratulations i guess instead i got hit with who the hell do you think you are louis the fourteenth with despotic powers you made as much sense as bugs bunny and my daughter who was visiting us said something about giving me a book on grammar for my birthday i know my limitations evan but i also know what i can do when i have the best people to advise me you got rid of the garbage now step in i repeatim not equipped oh but i think you are i think you are its why the job is yours for the taking dont kid yourself you may have been forced on the ticket but to deny you would be an affront to millions of voters the pr people made that clear pr public relations is that what its all about far more than either of us would like but yes its a large part of what everythings about these days to say otherwise would be to deny reality better its people like you and me than a genghis khan or an adolf hitler beneath our differences we want to save not destroy it was kendricks turn to study the president of the united states good lord you are a charmer its my stockintrade mr vice president said jennings grinning that and a few honestly held beliefs i dont know i just dont know i do interrupted khalehla reaching for evans hand i think field officer rashad should really resign also something else said president langford jennings his eyebrows arched you should get married it would be most unseemly for my running mate to be living in sin i mean can you imagine what all those evangelicals who deliver so many votes would do if your current status was revealed its simply not part of my image mr president sir yes mr vice president shut up gladly sir but i should like to add a note of clarification for the recordfor gods sake dont tell my wife i told you after both our divorces we lived together for twelve years and had two children we tied the proverbial knot in mexico three weeks before the convention and predated the marriage now thats really a state secret ill never tell mr president i know you wont i trust you and i need you and our nation will be better off for the both of usquite conceivably because of you i doubt that sir said evan kendrick i dont mr president the bell of the presidential suite rang once again four short sharp halfsecond bursts
