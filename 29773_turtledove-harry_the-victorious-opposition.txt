harry turtledove the victorious opposition manichaeism n the ancient persian doctrine of an incessant warfare between good and evil when good gave up the fight the persians joined the victorious opposition ambrose bierce the devils dictionary i clarence potter walked through the streets of charleston south carolina like a man caught in a city occupied by the enemy that was exactly how he felt it was march a monday the day before jake featherston of the freedom party had taken the oath of office as president of the confederate states of america ive known that son of a bitch was a son of a bitch longer than anybody potter muttered he was a tall wellmade man in his late forties whose spectacles made him look milder than he really was behind those lensesthese days to his disgust bifocalshis gray eyes were hard and cold and watchful hed first met featherston when they both served in the army of northern virginia himself as an intelligence officer and the future president of the csa as an artillery sergeant in the first richmond howitzers hed seen even then that featherston was an angry embittered man jake had had plenty to be bitter about too his service rated promotion to officers rank but he hadnt got it hed been right in saying his superior captain jeb stuart iii had had a negro body servant who was also a red rebel after the revolt broke out stuart had let himself be killed in battle rather than face a courtmartial for protecting the black man his father general jeb stuart jr was a power in the war department hed made sure featherston never saw a promotion for the rest of the war you got your revenge on him potter thought and now hes getting his on the whole country he turned the corner onto montague street a boulevard of expensive shops a lot of them had flags flying to celebrate yesterdays inauguration most of those that did flew not only the stars and bars but also the freedom party flag a confederate battle flag with colors reversed a starbelted red st andrews cross on a blue field few people wanted to risk the partys wrath freedom party stalwarts had broken plenty of heads in their fifteenyear drive to power what would they do now that they had it the fellow who ran donovans luggagepresumably donovanwas finding out the hard way he stood on the sidewalk arguing with a couple of beefy young men in white shirts and butternut trousers party stalwarts sure enough whats the matter with you you sack of shit one of them yelled dont you love your country i can show how i love it any way i please donovan answered that took guts since he was small and skinny and close to sixty and faced two men half his age each carrying a long stout bludgeon one of them brandished his club you dont show it the right way well knock your teeth down your stinking throat a grayuniformed policeman strolled up the street officer the man from the luggage shop called holding out his hands in appeal but he got no help from the cop the fellow wore an enamelwork party flag pin on his left lapel he nodded to the stalwarts said freedom and went on his way you see you dumb bastard said the stalwart with the upraised club this is how things are you better go along or youll be real sorry now are you gonna buy yourself a flag and put it up or are you gonna be real sorry clarence potter trotted across montague street dodging past a couple of fords from the united states and a confederatebuilt birmingham why dont you boys pick on somebody your own size he said pleasantly stowing his glasses in the inside pocket of his tweed jacket hed had a couple of pairs broken in brawls before the election he didnt want to lose another the stalwarts stared as if hed flown down from mars finally one of them said why dont you keep your nose out of other peoples business buddy you wont get it busted that way in normal times in civilized times a swarm of people would have gathered to back potter against the ruffians but they were ruffians whose party had just won the election he stood alone with donovan other men on the street hurried by with heads down and eyes averted whatever happened they wanted no part of it when potter showed no sign of disappearing the second ruffian raised his club too all right asshole you asked for it and im gonna give it to you he said he and his friend were bruisers potter didnt doubt they were brave enough during the presidential campaign theyd have tangled with tougher foes than an aging man who ran a luggage store but they knew only what bruisers knew they werent old enough to have fought in the war he had hed learned from experts without warning without tipping off what he was going to do by glance or waste motion he lashed out and kicked the closer one in the crotch the other one shouted and swung his bludgeon it hissed over potters head he hit the stalwart in the pit of the stomach wind knocked out of him the man folded up like his friend the only difference was he clutched a different part of himself potter didnt believe in wasting a fair fight on freedom party men they wouldnt have done it for him he kicked each of them in the face one still had a little fight left and tried to grab his leg he stomped on the fellows hand finger bones crunched under his sole the stalwart howled like a wolf potter kicked him in the face again for good measure then he picked up his fedora which had fallen off in the fight and put it back on his head he took his spectacles out of the inside pocket the world regained sharp edges when he set them on his nose again he tipped the fedora to donovan who stared at him out of enormous eyes you ought to sweep this garbage into the gutter he said pointing to the freedom party men the one hed kicked twice lay still his nose would never be the same the other one writhed and moaned and held on to himself in a way that would have been obscene if it werent so obviously filled with pain who the dickens are you donovan had to try twice before any words came out you dont need to know that serving in intelligence had taught potter not to say more than he had to you never could tell when opening your big mouth would come back to haunt you working as a private investigator which hed done since the war only drove the lesson home but the older man still gaped you handled them punks like they was nothing they are nothing the worst kind of nothing potter touched the brim of his hat again see you he walked off at a brisk pace that cop was liable to come back even if he didnt more stalwarts might come along a lot of them carried pistols potter had one too but he didnt want anything to do with a shootout you couldnt hope to outsmart a bullet he turned several corners in quick succession going right or left at random after five minutes or so he decided he was out of trouble and slowed down to look around and see where he was going a few blocks had taken him several rungs down the social ladder this was a neighborhood of saloons and secondhand shops of grocery stores with torn screen doors and blocks of flats that had been nice places back around the turn of the century it was also a neighborhood where freedom party flags flew without urging or coercion from anybody this was the sort of neighborhood stalwarts came from the party offered them an escape from the despair and uselessness that might otherwise eat their lives it was in clarence potters considered opinion a neighborhood full of damn fools he left in a hurry making his way east toward the harbor he was supposed to meet a police detective there the fellow had news about warehouse pilferage he would pass onfor a price potter had also fed him a thing or two over the years such balances useful to both sides had a way of evening out clarence the shout made potter stop and turn back jack delamotte he exclaimed in pleasure all the greater for being so unexpected how are you i havent seen you in years i wondered if you were dead what have you been doing with yourself delamotte hurried up the street toward him his hand outstretched and a broad smile on his face he was a big blond goodlooking man of about potters age his belly was bigger now and his hair grayer and thinner at the temples than it had been when he and potter hung around together not too much he answered im in the textile business these days got married six years agono seven now betsy and i have a boy and a girl how about you still single potter said with a shrug still poking my nose into other peoples affairssometimes literally i dont change a whole lot if youre his voice trailed off delamotte wore a handsome checked suit on his left lapel a freedom party pin shone in the sunlight i didnt expect you of all people to go over to the other side jack you used to cuss out jake featherston just as much as i did if you dont bend with the breeze itll break you delamotte shrugged too theyve been coming up for a long time and now theyre in shall i pretend the whigs won the election he snorted not likely put that way it sounded reasonable enough potter said i just saw a couple of freedom party stalwarts getting ready to beat up a shopkeeper because he didnt want to fly their flag how do you like that he kept quiet about what hed done to the stalwarts cant make an omelette without breaking eggs delamotte answered i really do think theyll put us back on our feet nobody else will where are you going i want to get your address talk about old times im in the phone book said potter who wasnt sorry jack im late he hurried away hoping delamotte wouldnt trot after him to his vast relief the other man didnt clarence wanted to puke his friendno his former friendno doubt thought of himself as a practical man potter thought of him and of all the other practical men sucking up to featherstons pals now that they were in power as a pack of sons of bitches he met the detective in a harborside saloon where sailors with a dozen different accents got drunk as fast as they could caldwell tubbs was a rolypoly little man with the coldest black eyes potter had ever seen jesus christ i shouldnt even be here he said when potter sat down on a stool beside him i cant tell you nothin worth my ass if i do hed sung that song before potter showed him some brown banknotes cautiously so nobody else saw them i can be persuasive he murmured as if trying to seduce a pretty girl and not an ugly cop but tubbs shook his head not even for that what now potter was genuinely astonished why not goddammit on account of its worth my badge if i even get caught talkin to you thats why this is goodbye buddy and i mean it you try to get hold of me from now on i never heard of you youre on a list potter and its the shit list i were you id cut my throat now save everybody else the trouble he jammed his hat back onto his bald head and waddled out of the saloon clarence potter stared after him he knew the freedom party knew how hard hed fought it and for how long and he knew the party was taking its revenge on opponents but hed never expected it to be so fast or so thorough he ordered a whiskey wondering how hed crack that pilferage case now after a lifetime of living in toledo chester martin remained disbelieving despite several months in los angeles it wasnt just the weather though that helped a lot he and rita had gone through a winter without snow theyd gone through a winter where they hardly ever needed anything heavier than a sweater and where theyd stayed in shirtsleeves half the time but that was only part of it toledo was what it was it had been what it was for all of chesters fortyodd years and for fifteen or twenty years before that it would go right on being the same old thing too not los angeles this place was in a constant process of becoming before the war it hadnt been anything much but a new aqueduct and the rise of motion pictures and a good port had brought people flooding in the people who worked in the cinema and at the port and in the factories the aqueduct permitted needed places to live and people to sell them things more people came in to build them houses and sell them groceries and autos and bookcases and washing machines then they needed chester had to walk close to half a mile to get to the nearest trolley stop he didnt like that though it was less inconvenient here than it would have been in a toledo blizzard he could see why things worked as they did though los angeles sprawled in a way no eastern city did the trolley grid had to be either coarse or enormously expensive nobody seemed willing to pay for a tight grid so people made do with a coarse one a mockingbird sang up in a palm tree martin blew a smoke ring at it it flew away white wing bars flashing a jay on a rooftop jeered it wasnt a blue jay like the ones hed always known it had no crest and its feathers were a paler blue people called the birds scrub jays they were as curious and clever as any jays hed known back east a hummingbird with a bright red head hung in midair scolding the jay chipchipchip hummingbirds lived here all year round if that didnt make a place seem tropical what did hurrying on toward the trolley stop martin ground out the cigarette with his shoe a motion caught from the corner of his eye made him turn his head and look back over his shoulder a man in filthy shabby clothes had darted out from a doorway to cadge the butt things might be better here than they were a lot of places but that didnt make them perfect or even very good some of the eight or ten people waiting at the trolley stop were going to work some were looking for work chester didnt know how he could tell who was who but he thought he could a couple like him carried tool chests the others something in the way they stood something in their eyes he knew how an unemployed man stood hed spent months out of work after the steel mill let him go and he was one of the lucky ones more than a few people had been looking for a job since the trolley clanged up it was painted a sunny yellow unlike the dull green ones hed ridden in toledo by the way they looked they might almost have been army issue not this one when you got on an la trolley you felt you were going in style his nickel and two pennies rattled into the fare box transfer please he said and the trolleyman gave him a long narrow strip of paper with printing on it he stuck it in the breast pocket of his overalls he rode the trolley south down central to mahan avenue then used the transfer to board another for the trip west to a suburb called gardena like a lot of los angeles suburbs it was half a farming town fig orchards and plots of strawberries and the inevitable orange trees alternated with blocks of houses he got off at western then went south to th street on shanks mare houses were going up there in what had been a fig orchard the fig trees had been knocked down in a tearing hurry chester suspected more than a few of them would come up again and their roots would get into pipes and keep plumbers away from soup kitchens for years to come that wasnt his worry getting the houses up was he waved to his foreman morning mordechai morning chester the foreman waved back it was an odd wave hed lost a couple of fingers from his right hand in a childhood farm accident but he could do more with tools with three fingers than most men could with five hed spent years in the navy before returning to the civilian world he had to be close to sixty now but he had the vigor of a much younger man hey joe morning fred whats up jose how are you virgil martin nodded to the other builders who were just getting started on the days work hows it going chester fred said and then look outhere comes dushan get busy quick so he cant suck you into a card game what do you say dushan chester called dushan nodded back how you is he said in throatily accented english he came from some slavic corner of the austrohungarian empire his last name consisted almost entirely of consonants and freds warning was the straight goods dushan made only a soso builder he liked the sauce more than he might have and didnt bother keeping it a secret but what he couldnt persuade a deck of cards to do nobody could chester would have bet he picked up more money gambling than he did with a hammer and saw and screwdriver come on boys enough jibberjabber mordechai said time to earn what they pay us he wasnt the kind of foreman who sat on his hind end drinking coffee and yelling at people who did stuff he didnt like he worked as hard as any of the men he bossedprobably harder if you couldnt work for mordechai you probably couldnt work for anybody nailing rafters to the ridgepole chester turned to jose who was doing the same thing on the other side you know what mordechai reminds me of he said tell me jose said his english was only a little better than dushans hed been born in baja california down in the empire of mexico and had come north looking for work sometime in the s chester didnt know whether hed bothered with legal formalities either way hed managed to keep eating after things fell apart in you fight in the war martin asked him oh sн he answered and laughed a little not on the same side as you i dont think doesnt matter not for this had to be the same on both sides if you had a good lieutenant or captain one who said follow mehell you could do damn near anything if you had the other kind martin jabbed his right thumb down toward the ground mordechais like one of those good officers he works like a son of a bitch himself and you dont want to let him down the other builder thought about that for a little while then nodded es verdad he said and then you right he laughed again and now we talk and we dont do no work nobody works all the damn time chester said but he started driving nails again it wasnt just that he didnt want to let mordechai down he didnt want to get in trouble either plenty of men wanted the job he had he was every bit as much a part of the urban proletariat here as he had been at the steel mill back in toledo after a couple of nails went in he shook his head he was more a part of the proletariat here than he had been in toledo the steel mill was a union shop hed been part of the bloody strikes after the war that made it one no such thing as a construction union here if the bosses didnt like anything about you you were history ancient history we ought to do something about that he thought and suddenly regretted voting democratic instead of socialist in the last election he held the next nail to the board tapped it two or three times to seat it firmly and drove it home another election was coming up in a little more than six months he could always go back to the socialists rita had packed him a ham sandwich some homemade oatmeal cookies and an apple in his dinner pail sure as hell dushan riffled a deck of cards at lunch sure as hell he found some suckers to play against him chester shook his head when dushan looked his way he knew when he was fighting out of his weight two lessons had been plenty for him if hed had any real sense one should have done the job back to it mordechai said after a precise half hour again he was the first one going up a ladder at the end of the day all the workers from the whole tract lined up to get their pay in cash a fellow with a stood behind the paymasters table to discourage redistribution of the wealth the paymaster handed chester four heavy silver dollars they gave his overalls a nice solid weight when he stuck them in his pocket cartwheels were in much more common use out here than they had been back east he walked to the trolley stop paid his fare and collected a transfer and made the return trip to the little house he and rita were renting east of downtown the neighborhood was full of eastern european jews with a few mexicans like jose for leavening on his way back to the house a skinny fellow about his age wearing an old greengray army trenchcoat coming apart at the seams held out a dirty hand and said spare a dime pal chester had rarely done that before losing his own job in toledo now he understood how the other half lived and now that he was working again he had dimes in his pocket he could actually spare here you go buddy he said and gave the skinny man one you know carpentry theyre hiring builders down in gardena i can drive a nail i can saw a board the other fellow answered i couldnt do much more than that when i started martin answered maybe ill get down there the skinny man said good luck chester went on his way hed keep his eye open the next couple of days see if this fellow showed up and tried to land a job if he didnt martin was damned if hed give him another handout plenty of people were down on their luck yes but if you didnt try to get back on your feet you were holding yourself down too hello sweetheart chester called what smells good pot roast rita answered she came out of the kitchen to give him a kiss she was a pretty brunetteprettier these days chester thought because shed quit bobbing her hair and let it grow outwho carried a few extra pounds around the hips she went on sure is good to be able to afford meat more often i know chester put a hand in his pocket the silver dollars and his other change clanked sweetly well be able to send my father another money order before long stephen douglas martin had lent chester and rita the money to come to california even though hed lost his job at the steel mill too chester was paying him back a little at a time it wasnt a patch on all the help his father had given him when he was out of work but it was what he could do one day at a time rita said and chester nodded richmond the conductor bawled as the train pulled into the station all out for richmond capital of the confederate states of america and next home of the olympic games richmond anne colleton grabbed a carpetbag and a small light suitcase from the rack above the seats she was set for the three days she expected to be here once upon a time shed traveled in style with enough luggage to keep an army in clothes provided it wanted to wear the latest paris styles and with a couple of colored maids to keep everything straight no more not after one of those colored maids had come unpleasantly close to murdering her on the marshlands plantation these days with marshlands still a ruin down by st matthews south carolina anne traveled alone on the train and through life she thought aloud the way she said excuse me couldnt mean anything but get the hell out of my way that would have done well enough for her motto she was a tall blond woman with a mans determined stride if any gray streaked the yellowshe was after all nearer fifty than fortythe peroxide bottle didnt let it show she looked younger than her years but not enough to suit her in her twenties even in her thirties shed been strikingly beautiful and made the most of it now handsome would have fit her better except she despised that word when applied to a woman excuse me she said again and all but walked up the back of a man who by his clothes was a drummer who hadnt drummed up much lately he turned and gave her a dirty look the answering frozen contempt she aimed like an arrow from her blue eyes made him look away in a hurry muttering to himself and shaking his head most of the passengers had to go back to the baggage car to reclaim their suitcases anne had all her chattels with her she hurried out of the station to the cab stand in front of it fords hotel she told the driver whose auto a birmingham with a dented left fender was first in line at the stand yes maam he said touching a finger to the patentleather brim of his peaked cap let me put your bags in the trunk and well go fords hotel was a great white pile of a building just across capitol street from capitol square anne tried to figure out how many times shed stayed there she couldnt she only knew the number was large afternoon maam said the colored doorman he wore a uniform gaudier and more magnificent than any the war department issued anne checked in went to her room and unpacked she went downstairs and had an early suppervirginia ham and applesauce and fried potatoes with pecan pie for dessertthen returned to her room read a novel till she got sleepy it wasnt very good so she got sleepy fast and went to bed it was earlier than she would have fallen asleep back home that meant she woke up at half past five the next morning she was annoyed but not too annoyed it gave her a chance to bathe and to get her hair the way she wanted it before going down to breakfast after breakfast she went to the lobby picked up one of the papers on a table and settled down to read it she hadnt been reading long before a man in what was almost but not quite confederate uniform strode in anne put down the newspaper and got to her feet miss colleton asked the man in the butternut uniform she nodded thats right freedom the man said and then come with me please when they went out the door the doormana different negro from the one whod been there the day before but wearing identical fancy dress flinched away from the freedom party man in the plain tan outfit the party man smiling a little led anne to a waiting motorcar he almost forgot to hold the door open for her but remembered at the last minute then he slid in behind the wheel and drove off the gray houseus papers still sometimes called it the confederate white houselay near the top of shockoe hill north and east of capitol square the grounds were full of men in butternut uniforms or white shirts and butternut trousers freedom party guards and stalwarts anne supposed there were also some official confederate guards but she didnt see any this heres miss colleton her driver said when they went inside a receptionistmale uniformedchecked her name off a list shes scheduled to see the president at nine why dont you take her straight to the waiting room its only half an hour right the freedom party guard said come this way maam i know the way to the waiting room ive been here before anne wished she didnt have to try to impress a man of no particular importance she also wished that since she had tried to impress him she would have succeeded but his dour shrug said he didnt care whether shed lived here up till day before yesterday freedom party men could be daunting in their singlemindedness she had the room outside the presidents office to herself too bad she thought shed met some interesting people there a few minutes before nine the door to the office opened a skinny little jewishlooking fellow came out jake featherstons voice pursued him youll make sure we get that story out our way right saul of course mr feathuh mr president the man answered well take care of it dont you worry about a thing with you in charge i dont featherston answered the man tipped his straw hat to anne as he walked out go on in he told her youre next thanks anne said and did seeing jake featherston behind a desk that had had only whigs sitting at it up till now was a jolt she stuck out her hand manfashion congratulations mr president featherston shook hands with her a single brisk pump enough to show he had strength he wasnt using thank you kindly miss colleton he answered almost everyone in the csa knew his voice from the wireless and newsreels it packed extra punch in person even with just a handful of words he pointed to a chair sit down make yourself at home anne did sit and crossed her ankles her figure was still trim featherstons eyes went to her legs but only for a moment he wasnt a skirtchaser hed chased power instead of women now he had it along with the rest of the country she wondered what hed do with it i expect you want to know why i asked you to come up here he said a lopsided grin on his long rawboned face he wasnt handsome not in any ordinary sense of the word but the fire burning inside him showed plainly enough if hed wanted women he could have had droves of them anne nodded i do yes but ill find out wont i i dont think youll send me back to south carolina without telling me nope matter of fact i dont intend to send you back to south carolina at all featherston said what do you intend to do with me then anne almost said to me once upon a time shed imagined she could control him dominate him serve as a puppet master while he danced to her tune a lot of people had made the same mistake a small consolation but the only one she had now he was the one who held the strings who held all the strings in the confederate states anne hated moving to any will but her own she hated it but she saw no way around it she tried not to show the nasty little stab of fear that shot through her shed abandoned the freedom party once when its hopes were at a low ebb if jake featherston wanted revenge he could take it his smile got wider which meant she hadnt hidden that nasty little stab well enough he did take revenge he took it on everyone who he thought had ever wronged him he took pride and pleasure in taking it too but after he let her sweat for a few seconds what he said was parlezvous franзais oui certainement anne answered automatically even though by the way featherston pronounced the words he didnt speak french himself she returned to english to ask why do you want to know that how would you like to take a trip to gay paree featherston asked in return no he didnt speak french at all she hadnt thought he did he wasnt an educated man shrewd yes clever oh yes educated no paris i hate the idea anne said crisply featherstons gingery eyebrows leaped that wasnt the answer hed expected then he realized she was joking he barked laughter cute he said cute as hell now tell me straightwill you go to paris for me ive got a job that needs doing and youre the one i can think of whos best suited to do it tell me what it is she said and tell me why youre not naming me ambassador to the court of king charles xi i gather no im not doing that youll go as a private citizen but id rather trust you with a dicker than the damned stripedpants diplomats at the embassy there theyre nothing but a pack of whigs and they want me to fall on my ass you know whats good for the country and you know whats good for the party too i see anne nodded again slowly and thoughtfully you want me to start sounding out action franзaise about an alliance then she saw shed surprised him again then he laughed once more i already knew you were smart he said dont know why i ought to jump when you go and show me yeah thats pretty much what ive got in mind alliance likely goes too far working arrangement is more what i figure we can do probably all the froggies can do too theyve got to worry about the kaiser same way as weve got to worry about the usa i wont be bringing back a treaty or anything of the sort will i anne said this is all unofficial unofficial as can be featherston agreed theres a time to shout and yell and carry on and theres a time to keep quiet this here is one of those last times no point to getting the united states all hot and bothered not as far as i can tell so will you take care of this for me anne nodded yes id be glad to i havent been to europe since before the war and id love to go again and this has one more advantage for you doesnt it whats that the president asked why it gets me out of the country for a while anne answered yes i dont mind that im not ashamed to admit it to you either jake featherston said i will be damned if i know what to make of you or what i ought to do about you again he sounded as if he meant what i ought to do to you if you can do something thats useful to the country and do it where you cant get into much mischief that works out fine for me works out fine for both of us as a matter of fact again anne read between the lines if youre on the other side of the atlantic i dont have to wonder about whether i ought to dispose of you fair enough she said all things considered going into what wasnt quite exile was as much as she could have hoped for one thing featherston had never learned was how to forgive colonel irving morrell watched from the turret of the experimental model as barrels chewed hell out of the kansas prairie fortunately fort leavenworth had a lot of prairie on its grounds to chew up once upon a time it had occurred to morrell that the traveling forts might find it useful to make their own smoke that way enemy gunners would have a harder time spotting them when they traveled over dry ground though barrels kicked up enough dust to make the question of smoke moot most of these barrels were the slow lumbering brutes that had finally forced breakthroughs in the confederate lines during the great war they moved at not much above a walking pace they had a crew of eighteen they had cannon at the front rather than inside a revolving turret the bellowing engines were in the same compartment as the crewand they had other disadvantages as well the only advantage they had was that they existed crews could learn how to handle a barrel by getting inside them the experimental model had been a worldbeater when morrell designed it early in the s rotating turret separate engine compartment wireless set reduced crew in no other barrel in the world touched this design but it wasnt any more the design was a dozen years older now so was irving morrell he didnt show his years very much he was still lean and strong in his early forties and his closecropped light brown hair held only a few threads of gray if his face was lined and tanned and weathered well it had been lined and tanned and weathered in the early s too hard service and a love for the outdoors had taken their toll there a model t ford in military greengray bounced across the prairie toward the experimental model one of the soldiers inside the motorcar waved to morrell when he waved back showing hed seen the man held up a hand to get him to stop he waved again then ducked down into the turret stop he bawled into the speaking tube that led to the drivers seat at the front of the barrel stopping yes sir the answer was tinny but understandable the barrel clanked to a halt whats up sir sergeant michael pound the barrels gunner was insatiably curiousmore than was good for him morrell often thought his wide face might have been that of a threeyearold seeing his first aeroplane i dont know morrell answered theyve just sent out an auto to stop the maneuvers sergeant pounds wide shoulders moved up and down in a shrug maybe the powers that be have gone off the deep end wouldnt surprise me a bit spending his whole adult life in the army had left him endlessly cynicalnot that he didnt seem to have had a good running start beforehand but then his greenblue eyes widened or do you suppose that same thought had been in morrells mind too it would be sooner than i expected if it is sergeant when was the last time those people up in pontiac ever turned something out sooner than anyone expected im afraid thats much too good a question sir pound pointed to the hatchway in the top of the commanders cupola pop your head out and see though why dont you he made out sound almost like oat as a canadian would have he came from somewhere up near the border what used to be the border morrell reminded himself no matter what he sounded like hed given good advice morrell did stand up again in the turret any barrel commander worth his salt liked to stick his head out of the machine whenever he could you could see so much more of the field that way of course everybody on the field could also see youand shoot at you during the great war morrell had often been forced back into the hell that was the interior of an oldstyle barrel by machinegun fire that would have killed him in moments if hed kept on looking around by the time he did emerge from the experimental model the old ford had come up alongside his barrel the soldier whod waved to hima young lieutenant named walt cressycalled sir you might want to take your machine back to the farm oh how come morrell asked lieutenant cressy grinned just because sir that made morrell grin too maybe they really had been working overtime up in pontiac maybe the combination of war with japannot that it was an allout noholdsbarred war on either sideand a democratic administration had got engineers and workers to go at it harder than they were used to doing all right lieutenant morrell said ill do that sergeant pound whooped with glee when morrell gave the order to break off from maneuvers and go back to the farm it has to be he said by god it has to be nothing has to be anything sergeant morrell said if we havent seen that over the past ten years and more of this business that made even pound nod thoughtfully barrels had probably been the warwinning weapon during the great war after the war theyd been the weapon most cut by budget trimmers in two successive socialist administrations no one had wanted to spend the money to improve them to give them a chance to be the warwinning weapon of the next war no one wanted to think there might be another big war morrell didnt like contemplating that possibility either but not thinking about it wouldnt make it go away the experimental model easily outdistanced the leftovers from the great war though they carried two truck engines apiece and it had only one it was made from thin mild steel enough to give an idea of how it performed but not enough to stand up to bullets it had plainly outdone everything else in the arsenal and by a wide margin too for more than ten years nobodyd given a damn now now morrells heart beat faster it he was right if the powers that be were waking up at last sergeant michael pound said maybe seeing jake featherston snorting and stomping the ground down in richmond put the fear of god into some people too it could be morrell said ill tell you something sergeant he sure as hell puts the fear of god into me hes a madman as usual everything looked simple to pound maybe if he is hes a clever one morrell said and if you put a clever madman in charge of a country that has good reason to hate the united states well i dont like the combination if we have to well squash him pound was confident too morrell wished he shared that confidence then the experimental model got to the field where the barrels stayed now that they were back in service sure enough a new machine squatted on the tracktorn turf the closer morrell got the better it looked if hed admired a woman as openly as he ogled that barrel his wife agnes would have had something sharp to say to him he climbed out through the hatch in the cupola and descended from the experimental model before it stopped moving sergeant pound let out a piteous howl from inside the barrel dont eat your heart out sergeant morrell said you can come have a look too he didnt wait for pound to emerge though he hurried over to the new barrel his leg twinged under him hed been shot in the early days of the great war he still had a slight limp almost twenty years later the leg did what he needed though if it pained him now and again then it did that was all bully he said softly as he came up to the new barrel that marked him as an oldfashioned man people whod grown up after the great war commonly said swell at such times he knew exactly what he meant though he looked from the new machine to the experimental model and back again a broad grin found room on his narrow face it was like seeing a child and the man he had become there side by side the experimental model was softskinned thinskinned one truck engine powered it because it wasnt very heavy the cannon in its turret was a onepounder a popgun that couldnt damage anything tougher than a truck here though here was the machine of which its predecessor had been the model morrell set a hand on its greengray flank armor plate felt no different from mild steel under his palm he knew the difference was there though up at the bow and on the front of the turret two inches of hardened steel warded the barrels vitals the armor on the sides and back was thinner but it was there a longbarreled twoinch gun jutted from the turret a machine gun beside it he knew of no barrel anywhere in the world with a better main armament the suspension was beefed up so was the engine at the rear it was supposed to push this barrel along even faster than the experimental model could do sergeant pound came up behind him so did the other crewmen from the experimental model the loader the bow machinegunner the wireless operator and the driver pound said its quite something sir its a good thing weve got it it would have been even better if wed had it ten years ago yes morrell wished the sergeant hadnt pointed that out no matter how obvious a truth it was if wed built this ten years ago what would we have now thats what eats at me i dont blame you a bit sir pound said what happened to the barrel program was a shame a disgrace and an embarrassment and if the japs hadnt gone and embarrassed us too it never would have started up again i know morrell couldnt wait any more he climbed up onto the new barrel opened the hatch at the top of the commanders cupola and slid down into the turret it didnt smell right he noticed that first all it smelled of was paint and leather and gasoline fresh smells new smells it might have been a chevrolet in a showroom the old machines and the experimental model stank of cordite fumes and sweat odors morrell had taken for granted till he found himself in a barrel without them he sat down in the commanders seat before long this beast would smell the way it was supposed to clankings from up above said somebody else wanted to investigate the new barrel too michael pounds voice came in through the open hatch if you dont get out of the way im going to squash you sir morrell moved pound slithered downhis stocky frame barely fit through the openingand settled himself behind the gun he peered through the sights then nodded not bad not bad at all no not bad at all morrell agreed theyre going to name the production model after general custer thats fitting its a pity they fiddled around too long to let him see them pound said and morrell nodded the gunner asked how many are they going to make i dont know that yet morrell answered what they think they can afford i suppose thats how it usually works he scowled so did sergeant pound theyd better make lots if they name them after custer he believed in great swarms of barrels anyone with sense does of course having served with custer morrell knew hed often been anything but sensible he also knew pound meant anyone who agrees with me by anyone with sense even so he nodded again colonel abner dowling opened the salt lake city bee the army published the paper it put out what the us authorities occupying utah wanted the people there to see as commander of the occupying authorities in salt lake city dowling knew that did only so much good the locals got plenty of news the paper didnt print and the town wireless outlets didnt broadcast still if you didnt try to keep a lid on things what was the point of occupying at all on page three was a picture of a very modernlooking barrelcertainly one that seemed ready to blow any number of hulking great war machines to hell and gone new custer barrel put through paces in kansas the headline read the story below praised the new model to the skies custer dowling mutteredhalf prayer half curse hed been custers adjutant for a long timeand it had often seemed much longer naming a machine intended to smash straight through everything in its path after george armstrong custer did seem to fit dowling couldnt deny that he went through the rest of the paper in a hurrythere wasnt much real news in it as he had reason to know then he pushed his swivel chair back from his desk and strode out of the office he was a hulking machine himself and built rather like the desk custer had been in the habit of twitting him about his heft custer hadnt been skinny himself but dowling hadnt lost any weight since they finally forced the old boy into retirement on the contrary its good healthy flesh he told himself plenty of people had worse vices than getting up from the supper table a little later than they might have take custer for instance dowlings jowls wobbled as he shook his head hed escaped custer more than ten years before but couldnt get him out of his mind thats how people will remember me a hundred years from now he thought not for the first time in biographies of custer ill have half a dozen index entries as his adjutant immortalitythe tradesmans entrance but that wasnt necessarily so as he knew too well people might remember him foreverif utah blew up in his face even back as far as the trouble it caused in the second mexican war in the early s custer had wanted to lay it waste abner dowling shook his head enough of custer these days dowling had an adjutant of his own a bright young captain called isidore lefkowitz he looked up from his desk in the outer office as dowling emerged from his sanctum what can i do for you sir he asked his accent purest new york mr young is due here in ten minutes isnt that right dowling said yes sir at three oclock sharp lefkowitz replied i expect him to be right on time too you could set your watch by him dowlings nod also made his chins dance oh yes heber young was a man of thoroughgoing rectitude mischief in his eye he asked how does it feel captain to be a gentile in utah captain lefkowitz rolled his eyes i should care what these mormon mamzrim think he didnt translate the word even so dowling had no trouble figuring out it was less than complimentary he said the mormons are convinced theyre persecuted the way jews used to be in the old days what do you mean used to be lefkowitz said tsar michael turned the black hundreds loose on us just a couple of years ago if the peasants and workers go after jews they dont have to worry about whether they might have done better throwing out michaels brother nicholas and going red there are pogroms in the kingdom of poland too people over there use jews for whipping boys the same way the confederates use their negroes dowling said lefkowitz started to answer stopped and gave dowling an odd look thats very perceptive sir he said as if dowling had no business being any such thing i never thought i had much in common with a shvartzer another untranslated word dowling had little trouble figuring outbut maybe i was wrong before dowling could answer he heard footsteps coming down the hall a soldier led a tall handsome man in somber civilian clothes into the outer office heres heber young sir the man in greengray said hes been searched dowling didnt think brigham youngs grandson was personally dangerous to him he didnt think so but he hadnt rescinded the order that all mormons be searched before entering us military headquarters hed been in the office with general pershing when the thencommander of occupation forces was assassinated the sniper had never been caught either officially of course the church of jesus christ of latterday saints remained forbidden in utah officially heber young had no special status whatever but as often happened the official and the real had only a nodding acquaintance with each other come in mr young dowling said gesturing toward his own office can we get you some lemonade he couldnt very well ask a pious if unofficial mormon if he wanted a drink or even a cup of coffee no thank you young said accompanying him into the private office dowling closed the door behind them he waved young to a seat with a murmured thank you colonel the local sat down so did abner dowling what can i do for you today mr young he inquired he was always scrupulously polite to the man who headed a church that did not officially exist despite half a century of government persecution and almost twenty years of outright suppression that church still counted for more than anything else in utah you will remember colonel that i spoke to you this past fall about the possibility of programs that would give work to some of the men here who need it so badly young was painfully polite to him too the diplomats called this sort of atmosphere correct which meant two sides hated each other but neither showed what it was feeling yes sir i do remember dowling replied and i trust you will recall i told you president hoover disapproved of such programs the presidents views have not changed that means my hands are tied the problem is worse here than it was last fall heber young said some people grow impatient their impatience could prove a problem are you threatening me with an uprising mr young dowling didnt shout it he didnt bluster he simply asked as he had asked if young wanted lemonade and the mormons unofficial leader shook his head of course not colonel that would be seditious and i am loyal to the government of the united states dowling didnt laugh in his face a measure of the respect he had for him but he didnt believe that bold assertion either are you also loyal to the state of deseret he asked how can i be when there is no state of deseret young asked calmly what happened here during the great war made that plain a thing may be very plain and yet people will not want to believe it dowling said true heber young agreed may i give you an example please do dowling said as he was no doubt supposed to thank you yes young was nothing if not courteous that many people in utah were not happy with the repression and persecution they received at the hands of the government of the united states must have been obvious to anyone who looked at the matter and yet the rebellion that broke out here in seems to have come as a complete and utter shock to that government if you despise people on account of what they are can you be surprised when they in turn fail to love you i was in kentucky at the time i was certainly surprised mr young dowling answered custer had been more than surprised hed been furious a couple of divisions had been detached from first army and sent west to deal with the mormon revolt that had scotched an offensive hed planned the offensive probably would have failed and certainly would have caused a gruesome casualty list of course fighting the mormons had caused a gruesome casualty list too young said my grandfather came to utah to go beyond the reach of the united states all we ever asked was to be left alone that was jefferson davis war cry too dowling said things are never so simple as slogans make them sound if you live at the heart of the continent you cannot pretend that no one will notice you are here for better or worse utah is part of the united states it will go on being part of the united states people who live here had better get used to it then treat us like any other part of the united states young said send your soldiers home open the borders let us practice our religion how many wives did brigham young have which one of them was your grandmother dowling wondered aloud he said mr young i am a soldier i do not make policy i only carry it out in my opinion though your people were well on the way to getting what you ask for until that assassin murdered general pershing after your revolt in after the uprising in that set back your cause more than i can say i understand as much young said do you understand the desperation that made that assassin pick up a rifle i dont know dowling had no interest in understanding the assassin he suddenly shook his head that wasnt quite true understanding the mormon might make him easier to catch and might make other murderers easier to thwart dowling doubted that was what heber young had in mind the mormon leader said the worse the conditions in this state get the more widespread that desperation becomes we may see another explosion colonel you are in a poor position to threaten me mr young dowling said i am not threatening you i am trying to warn you young said earnestly i do not want another uprising it would be a disaster beyond compare but if the people of utah see no hope what can you expect they are all too likely to lash out at what they feel to be the cause of their troubles if they do they will only bring more trouble down on their heads they had better understand that dowling said i think they do understand it heber young replied what i wonder about is how much they care if all choices are bad the worst one no longer seems so very dreadful i beg you coloneldo what you can to show there are better choices than pointless revolt with genuine regret dowling said you credit me with more power than i have i credit you with goodwill young said if you can find something to do for us something you may do for us i think you will the things youve asked for are not things i may do dowling said impasse they looked at each other in silent nearsympathy young got to his feet so did dowling dowling put out his hand young shook it he also shook his head and shaking it he strode out of abner dowlings office without looking back come on mort mary pomeroy exclaimed sounding as excitable as her red hair said she ought to be do you want to make us late her husband laughed for one thing we wont be late for another thing your mother will be so glad to see us she wont care anyhow he was right mary knew as much but she didnt care come on she said again tugging at his arm well all be there at the farmma and julia and ken and their children and beththats kens ma i know who beth marble is mort broke in hasnt she been coming to the diner for years whenever shes in rosenfeld to buy things and us mary finished as if he hadnt spoken and us theyd been married less than a year a lot of the glow was still left on herleft on both of them which made life much more pleasant she gave him a playful shove lets go all right all right see im not arguing with you he put on a straw boatera city fellows hat almost too much of a city fellows hat for a town as small as rosenfeld manitobaand went downstairs he carried the picnic basket though mary had cooked the food inside they went downstairs together their apartment stood across the street from the diner mort ran with his father morts rather elderly oldsmobile waited at the curb in front of the building mary wished he didnt drive an american auto but there were no canadian autos and hadnt been since before the great war as he opened the trunk to put the picnic basket inside a couple of occupiersus soldiers in greengray uniformswent into the diner they both eyed mary before the door closed behind them she slammed down the trunk lid with needless violence all she said though was i wish pa and alexander could come to the picnic too i know honey mort said gently i wish they could too the yanks had shot alexander mcgregorher older brotherin claiming hed been a saboteur mary still didnt believe that her father arthur mcgregor hadnt believed it either hed carried on a oneman bombing campaign against the americans for years till a bomb hed intended for general george custer blew him up instead one of these days mary clamped down on that thought hard smiling she turned to her husband and said let me drive please all right hed taught her after they got married before that shed never driven anything but a wagon mort grinned try to have a little mercy on the clutch will you im doing the best i can mary said i know you are sweetie her husband handed her the keys she did clash the gears shifting from first up to second before mort could even wince she said see you made me nervous he just shrugged she drove smoothly the rest of the way out to the farm where shed grown up she turned down the lane that led to the farmhouse stopped alongside of kenneth marbles model t which made the olds seem factorynew by comparison and shut off the motor see triumph in her voice she took the key from the ignition and stuck the key ring in her handbag you did fine mort said but you put the keys away too soon weve got to get the hamper out of the trunk oh mary felt foolish youre right mort carried it up onto the porch she remembered how hed stood there the first time he came to take her out but then shed seen him from inside the house and as a near stranger now she stood beside him and the house in which shed lived most of her life seemed the strange place her mother opened the door hello my dearmy dears maude mcgregor said smiling mary had got her red hair from her mother maudes these days was mostly gray she looked tired too but then what woman on a farm didnt mary knew shed had no idea how much work she did every day till she went from the farm into rosenfeld keeping an apartment clean and cooking were as nothing beside what shed done here with her father and brother dead shed worked even harder than most women had to but in town there keeping up would have been easy even without electricity with it she felt as if she lived in the lap of luxury now coming back she might have fallen into the nineteenth century or maybe even the fifteenth she shook her head that last wasnt right kerosene lamps gave light here and her mother cooked on a coalburning stove they hadnt had those in the middle ages but water came from a well and an outhouse added its pungency to the barns mary hadnt needed any time at all to get used to the delights of running water and indoor plumbing even so she had no trouble saying its so good to be back after hugging her mother she meant it too no matter how hard things had been here the farm was the standard by which she would measure everything else for the rest of her life as soon as she stepped inside two tornadoes hit her both shouting aunt mary her sister julias son anthony was five her daughter priscilla three mary picked each of them up in turn which made them squeal picking up anththat was what they called him for no reason mary could make outmade her grunt he was a big boy and gave the promise of growing into a big man julia was taller than mary and ken marble was a goodsized man though stocky and thick through the chest rather than tall glad to see you he said gravely both he and julia were quiet people though their children made up for it he might have been talking about the weather when he went on weve got number three on the way first part of next year looks like thats wonderful mary hurried to her sister and squeezed her julia looked even more weary than their mother as a farm wife with two small children she had every right to look that way how do you feel mary asked her she shrugged like im going to have a baby im sleepy all the time one day food will stay down the next it wont when are you going to have a baby mary people had started asking her that after shed been married for about two weeks i dont know exactly she answered in a low voice but i dont think itll take real long julias motherinlaw beth marble said whats the news from in town kids she was a pleasant woman with shoulderlength brown hair going gray rather flat features and a wide friendly smile tell you what i heard late last night at the diner mort said theres talk henry gibbons going to sell the general store you didnt even tell me that when you came home mary said indignantly her husband looked shamefaced it mustve slipped my mind mary wondered if hed saved the news so it would make a bigger splash at the gather he liked being the center of attention it was bigno doubt about that she said gibbons general stores been in rosenfeld for as long as i can remember for as long as i can remember too pretty much her mother said thats likely why hes sellingif he is selling and its not just talk mort said hes not a young man any more when mary thought of the storekeeper she thought of his bald head and of the white apron he always wore over his chest and the formidable expanse of his belly but sure enough the little fringe of hair he had was white these days wont seem the same without him she said and everybody nodded she added i hope to heaven a yank doesnt buy him out thatd be awful more nods julia hated the americans as much as mary did though she wasnt so open about it the marbles had no reason to love them either even if they hadnt suffered so much at us hands the only canadians mary could think of who did love americans were collaborators of whom there were altogether too many lets go take the baskets out to the field and have our picnic maude mcgregor said which was not only a good idea but changed the subject sprawled on a blanket under the warm summer sun and gnawing on a fried drumstick mary found it easy enough not to think about the americans she listened to gossip from town and from the surrounding farms the americans did come into that but only briefly a farmers daughter was going to marry a us soldier it wasnt the first such marriage around rosenfeld and probably wouldnt be the last mary did her best to pretend it wasnt happening far easier far more pleasant to talk about other things she said these deviled eggs you made sure are good ma her husband nodded can i get the recipe from you mother mcgregor they beat the ones we fix in the diner all hollow i dont know about that maude mcgregor said if other people use it it wont be mine any more of course it will mort said itll just let other people enjoy what you were smart enough to figure out hes a smooth talker isnt he julia murmured mary smiled and nodded in a low confidential voice mort went on im not just talking to hear myself talk mother mcgregor that recipes worth money to my father and me if we were buying it from someone else in the business wed probably payhe screwed up his face as he figured it outoh fifty dollars easy the farm barely made ends meet for marys mother mary doubted the pomeroys would pay anywhere near that much for a recipetheyd be more likely to swap one of their ownbut the diner was doing well and mort had a generous heart after blinking once or twice to make sure he was serious maude mcgregor said when we get back to the house ill write it down everyone beamed when they got back to the house mary said im going out to the barn mort and get us some fresh eggs i wonder if i remember how to get a hen off the nest you dont need to take the big picnic basket with you just for some eggs mort said its all right ive got a smaller one inside mary said that display of feminine logic flummoxed her husband he shrugged and watched her go then turned back to her mother who was putting the deviledegg recipe on paper in the barn mary quickly gathered a dozen eggs she put them as shed said she would in the smaller basket inside the big one cushioning them with straw she didnt go back to the house right after that instead she walked over to an old irontired wagon wheel that had been lying there since the great war maybe even since before it started the iron by now was red and rough with rust it rasped against her palmswhich were softer than they had beenas she shoved the wheel aside mary scraped aside the dirt under it and lifted a board under the dirt the board concealed a hole in the ground her father had dug in it lay his bombmaking tools the tools the yanks had never found she scooped up sticks of dynamite blasting caps fuses crimpers needlenosed pliers and other bits of specialized ironmongery and put them in the basket she was just replacing the wheel over the nowempty hole when her nephew anthony charged into the barn what you doing aunt mary he asked i was squashing a spider that had a web under there she lied smoothly anth made a horrible face she made as if to clop him with the picnic basket he fled giggling she went out to the car and put the basket in the trunk ii saul goldman was a fussy little fellow but good at what he did everythings ready now mr president he said newsreel photographers newspaper photographers and the wireless web connection by this time tomorrow everyone in the confederate states will know youve signed this bill thanks saul jake featherston said with a warm smile and the little jew blossomed under the praise jake knew goldman was exaggerating but he wasnt exaggerating by much the people who needed to know he was signing the bill would hear about it and that was what mattered at a gesture from the communications chief klieg lights came on in the main office of the gray house featherston smiled at the camera hello friends he said into the microphone in front of him im jake featherston just like always im here to tell you the truth and the truth is this bill im signing today is one of the most important laws weve ever made in the confederate states of america he inked a pen and signed on the waiting line flashbulbs popped as the photographers did their job jake looked up at the newsreel camera again weve had too many floods on our big rivers he said the one in came close to drowning the middle of the country enough is enough i say were going to build dams and levees and make sure it doesnt happen again well use the electricity from the dams too for factories and for people weve needed a law like this for years and now thanks to the freedom party weve got it mr president a carefully prompted reporter from a party paper stuck his hand in the air ask you a question mr president go right ahead delmer featherston was calm casual at his ease thank you sir delmer said what about article one section eight part three of the constitution sir you know the part that says you cant make internal improvements on rivers unless you aid navigation dams dont do that do they well no but they do lots of other things the country needs jake answered but wont the supreme court say this law is unconstitutional the reporter asked featherston looked into the cameras as if looking at a target over open sights he had a long lean face a face people remembered if not one conventionally handsome tell you what delmer he said if the supreme court wants to put splitting hairs ahead of whats good for the country it can go right ahead but if it does i wont be the one whos sorry in the end those fools in black robes will be and you can count on that he took no other questions hed said everything he had to say the microphones went off the bright lights faded he leaned back in his swivel chair it creaked saul goldman came back into the room before jake could ask his head of communications said i think that went very well mr president good featherston nodded me too now they know what i think of em lets see how much nerve theyve got ferdinand koenig walked into the office the attorney general was one of featherstons oldest comrades and as close to a friend as he had these days you told em jake he said now we find out how smart they are theyre a pack of damn fools ferd jake said scornfully you watch the people whove been running this country are damn fools all we need to do is give em the chance to prove it koenig had got to the office faster than vice president willy knight knight was tall and blond and goodlooking and very much aware of how goodlooking he was hed headed up the redemption league till the freedom party swallowed it one look at his face and you could see he still wished things had gone the other way too bad jake thought knight wasnt so smart as he thought he was either he never would have taken the vicepresidential nomination if he were the vice president of the confederate states couldnt even fart till he got permission from the president four months on the job and knight still hadnt figured that out he went right on laboring under the delusion that he amounted to something for gods sake jake he burst out now what the hell did you go and rile the supreme court for a texas twang filled his voice theyll throw out the river bill for sure on account of that just so as they can get their own back at you gosh willy do you think so jake sounded concerned he watched koenig hide a smile willy knight full of himself as usual never noticed think so im sure of it you did everything but wave a red cloth in their face featherston shrugged its done now well just have to make the best of it it may turn out all right how can it knight demanded sure as the sun comes up tomorrow somebodys gonna sue you can already hear the whigs licking their chops slobbering over the chance to make us look bad whatever district court gets the lawll say its no goddamn good then well take it to the supreme court ferdinand koenig said theyll tell you its unconstitutional too just like that reporter fellow said they would willy knight predicted theyre looking for a chance to pin our ears back once they get those black robes on supreme court justices think theyre little tin gods and theres not a freedom party man among em im not too worried willy jake said this heres a popular bill not even the whigs left in congress voted against it the country needs it bad folks wont be happy if the court tosses it in the ashcan i tell you those fuckers dont care the vice president insisted why should they theyre in there for life he paused his blue eyes widened or are you saying they wont live long if they try and smother this bill featherston shook his head i didnt say anything like that i wont say anything like that we could get away with it if that damn grady calkins hadnt shot president wade goddamn hampton v not now we dont want to get the name for a pack of lousy murderers weve done plenty of murdering on the way up and well do as much more as we have to but looks count the supreme court justices arent the right targets for stalwarts weve got other ways to deal with them if i were in your shoes id put the fear of god in those sons of bitches knight insisted jake featherston spoke softly but with unmistakable emphasis willy you arent in my shoes you try and put yourself in my shoes youre just measuring yourself for a coffin you got that knight was not a coward hed fought and fought well in the trenches during the great war but featherston intimidated him as featherston intimidated almost everyone yeah jake sure jake he mumbled and left the confederate presidents office in a hurry laughing featherston said he doesnt get it ferd and hes gonna be as surprised as a tenyearold when the magician pulls the rabbit out of his hat when we give those justices what they deserve the difference is this way well kill em dead and everybodyll stand up and cheer when we do it koenig said he doesnt see that he hesitated then asked youre sure you want one of our people filing suit against the law hell yes as long as nobody can trace him back to us jake answered without hesitation whigsd take weeks to get around to it and i want this to happen just as fast as it can ill take care of it long as you know your own mind the attorney general said you know ive always backed your play i always will too youre a good fellow ferd featherston meant every word of it man on the way up needs somebody like you to guard his back and once he gets where hes going he needs somebody like you more than ever when we started out they ran the freedom party out of a cigar box in the back of a saloon koenig said reminiscently did you ever figure back in those days that wed end up here his wave encompassed the confederate presidential mansion hell yes jake replied without hesitation thats why i joined to pay back the bastards who lost us the warall the bastards coons and our own damn generals and the yankeesand to get to the top so i could didnt you he asked it in genuine perplexity he could judge others only by what he did himself koenig shrugged broad shoulders he was beefy fat with a hard core of muscle underneath who remembers now for all i know i went to that saloon and not some other place on account of the beer was good there it was horse piss jake said i remember that now that i think back on it you may be right koenig admitted he looked around as if he couldnt believe the office where they sat but hell we were all just a bunch of saloon cranks in those days nobody thought wed amount to anything i did featherston said his longtime comrade laughed you mustve been the only one those first few months after the war a thousand different parties sprang up and every goddamn one of em said itd set the confederate states to rights somebody had to have it straight we did jake featherston had never lacked for confidence hed never doubted and his confidence had fed the party during the dark years after calkins gunned down president hampton his confidence had been all that kept the party alive that and the wireless he thought i figured out the wireless a couple of jumps ahead of the whigs and the radical liberals they ran after me but they never caught up they never will now weve got some old bills to pay you know he told koenig weve got a lot of old bills to pay matter of fact about time we started doing that dont you think weve looked meek and mild too long already that isnt our proper style had to get this bill through congress the attorney general said one thing at a time oh yes featherston nodded its been one thing at a time ever since we didnt quite win in thats a hell of a long time now im going to be fifty in a few years i havent got all the time in the world any more i want the whole pie not just slices i want it and im going to get it sure thing sarge ferdinand koenig said soothingly i know who you want to pay back first ill start setting it up by the time we do it everythingll go just as slick as boiled okra you can count on that i do youd best believe i do jake said pretty soon now we have some things to tell the usa too not quite yet weve got to put our own house in some kind of order first but pretty soon first we take care of this other stuff koenig was not a fiery man he never had been but he kept things straight jake needed somebody like that he was shrewd enough to know it he nodded koenig went on besides the next step puts the whole country behind us not just the people who vote our way yeah featherston nodded again a wolfish grin spread across his face not only that itll be a hell of a lot of fun sylvia enos looked out at the crowd of fishermen and merchant sailors and shopgirls and probably in a hall near the wharves a streetwalker or two you couldnt always tell by looking by now shed been up on the stump often enough that it didnt terrify her the way it had at first it was just something she did every other year when the election campaigns started heating up joe kennedy went to the microphone to introduce her folks heres a lady who can tell you just why youd have to be seventeen different kinds of fool to vote for anybody but a democrat for congressthe famous author and patriot mrs sylvia enos he always laid the introductions on too thick he didnt do it to impress the crowd he did it because he wanted to impress sylvia impress her enough to get her into bed with him and there was his own wife sitting in the front row of the crowd was she oblivious or simply resigned she must have seen him chasemust have seen him catchplenty of other women by now thank you mr kennedy sylvia took her place behind the microphone i do think its important to reelect congressman sanderson in november with boston sweltering in august november was hard to think about she looked forward to cooler fall weather hell help president hoover keep the united states strong we need that we need it more than ever with whats going on down in the confederate states joe kennedy applauded vigorously so did his wife she never showed that anything was wrong between them the crowd clapped too that was what the democrats needed from sylvia that was why when she finished her speech he gave her a crisp new fiftydollar bill with teddy roosevelts bulldog features and swarm of teeth on one side and a barrel crushing confederate entrenchments on the other thank you mr kennedy sylvia said againshe didnt want to bite the hand that fed her my pleasure he answered may i take you out to get a bite to eat now he didnt mean a bite with him and his wife rose would stay wherever rose stayed while joe did as he pleased and no supper wasnt all he had in mind she wondered what he saw in her she was in her midforties her brown hair going gray fine lines not so fine any more her figure distinctly dumpy maybe he didnt believe anybody could say no to him and mean it maybe her saying no was what kept him after her if she ever did give in to him she was sure he would forget all about her after one encounter no thanks mr kennedy she said now politely but firmly i have to get home she didnt with her son newly married and her daughter working she had less need than ever to go home but the lie was polite too she wanted to make a lot more speeches before election day and she wanted to get paid for each and every one of them kennedy bared his teeth he seemed to have almost as many as tr maybe another time he said shrugging sylvia got down from the stage as soon as her back was to him she let out a long sigh of relief every time she got away from joe kennedy she felt like houdini getting out of the handcuffs in the straitjacket in the tub of water she hadnt gone far before another man fell into step with her you made a good speech he said you told them what they needed to hear then when you were done you shut up too many people never know when to shut up ernie sylvia exclaimed she gave the writer a hug if joe kennedy happened to be watching too damn bad what are you doing back in boston why didnt you let me know you were coming he shrugged he had broad shoulders almost a prizefighters shoulders and dark ruggedly handsome features he looked more like a bouncer a mean bouncer than the man whod put sylvias words on paper in i sank roger kimball considering the wound hed taken driving an ambulance up in quebec during the war he had more right than most men to seem to be mean when he saw she wouldnt be content with that shrug he raised one eyebrow in a worldweary way that made him look older than she was for a moment though he had to be ten years younger he said i am looking for work why does anyone go anywhere these days maybe i will find something to write about maybe i will find something someone will pay me to write about the first is easy the second is hard these days are you hungry sylvia asked ernie didnt answer he had more pride than two or three ordinary men pride was a luxury sylvia had long since derided she couldnt afford she said come on ill buy you supper before he could speak she held up a hand ive got the money dont worry about that and i owe you she found herself talking as he did in short choppy sentences not just for the book you warned me my bank would fail i got my money out in time good i could do something he said and scowled hed wanted her shed wanted him too the first time shed really wanted a man since her husband was killed atafterthe end of the great war considering his wound that surge of desire had been nothing but one more cruel irony come on she said again ernie didnt tell her no a likely measure of how hard up he was she took him to an oyster house he ate with a singleminded voracity she hadnt seen since her son was growing into a man she put money on the table for both of them he frowned i still hate to have a woman pick up the tab for me its all right sylvia said dont worry about it its the least i can do i told you that already and i bet i can afford it a lot better than you can his painfilled bark of laughter made people all over the place stare at him you are right about that you must be right about that i do need to land a writing job i need to do it right away if i do not i will wind up in a blackfordburgh you could do something else she said oh yes ernie nodded i could step into the ring and get my block knocked off i have done that a couple of times it pays even worse than writing and it is not so much fun or i could carry a hod i have done that too the same objections apply i am glad to see you doing so well for yourself ive been lucky sylvia said i feel lucky seeing you again me another sour laugh not likely i have tried to write books that show how things were in the war people do not want to read them no one wants to publish them any more everyone wants to forget we ever had a war they havent forgotten down in the confederate states sylvia said sweet jesus christ i am lucky i have found someone who can see past the end of her nose do you know how hard that is to do these days the praise warmed sylvia it wasnt smarmy the way joe kennedys always seemed ernie wasnt one to waste his time with false praise he said what he meant sylvia tried to match him jake featherston hasnt exactly been hiding what he thinks about us no he is a real son of a bitch that one a rattler buzzing in the bushes by the road ernie said one of these days we are going to have to settle his hash i say things like that on the stump and people look at me like im crazy sylvia said sometimes i start to wonder myself you know what i mean he leaned forward and with startling gentleness let his hand rest softly on hers you have more sense than anybody i have seen for a hell of a long time sylvia he said if anyone tries to tell you any different belt the silly bastard right in the chops that had to be the oddest romantic speech sylvia had ever heard but where most of the socalled romantic speeches shed heard either made her want to laugh or made her want to kill the man who was making them this one filled her with heat that in itself felt strange and unnatural shed known desire only a handful of times since her husband didnt come back from the war lets go to my flat she murmured my sons married and on his own and my daughter works the evening shift ernie jerked his hand away as if she were on fire did you forget he asked harshly i am no good for that i am no damn good for that at all hed told her the same thing once before it had balked her then now there are other things we could do if you wanted to she looked down at the tabletop she felt the heat of embarrassment too she didnt think shed ever said anything so risquй i will be damned ernie muttered and then you will not be disappointed never she promised christ he said again only this time it sounded more like a prayer than a curse he got to his feet maybe you are lying to me maybe you are lying to yourself i am asking to get wounded again i know goddamn well i am but if you do not change your mind in one hell of a hurry not me sylvia said and she got up too closing the door to the apartment behind them locking it afterwards seemed oddly final oddly irrevocable going into the bedroom once shed done that might almost have been anticlimax sylvia wished it could happen without undressing in front of a near stranger she knew too well shed never been anything out of the ordinary for looks or for build ernie treated her as if she were though by the way he touched her and stroked her and kissed her she might have been a movingpicture actress not a fishermans widow he did know what to do to please a woman when he was no longer equipped to do one thing in particular sylvia rediscovered just how lonely taking care of herself was by comparison only a little at a time did she realize how much courage hed needed to bare himself for her his body was hard and wellmuscled his mutilation though ill do what i can sylvia said ill tell you a couple of things that sometimes can help if you dont mind ernie said why would i mind sylvia said this is what we came here for he told her she tried them george had liked one of them the other was something new for her it wouldnt have been high on her list of favorite things to do but it did seem to help ernie growled like some large fierce cat when he finally succeeded lord he said and bent down to pull a pack of cigarettes from a pocket of the trousers that lay crumpled by the bed lighting one he went on there is nothing like that in all the world nothing else even comes close sometimes i forget which is a small mercy once in a while everything goes right that is a large mercy thank you sweetheart he kissed her his lips tasted of sweat and tobacco youre welcome sylvia said damn right i am he told her she laughed then she said give me a smoke too will you he did she leaned close to him to get a light from his he set a hand companionably on her bare shoulder she liked the solid feel of him he would have to go before mary jane came home scandalizing her daughter wouldnt do but for now for now everything was just fine scipio wasnt a young man hed been a little boy when the confederate states manumitted their slaves in the aftermath of the second mexican war hed lived in augusta georgia since not long after the end of the great war everyone here even bathsheba his wife knew him as xerxes for a negro whod played a role however unenthusiastic in the running of one of the red republics during the wartime revolt a new name was a better investment than any he could have made on the bourse hed seen a lot in those mad hectic weeks before the congaree socialist republic went down in blood and fire in all the years since hed hoped he would never see anything like that again and up till now he never had up till now white rioters roared through the terry the colored district in augusta some of them shouted freedom some were too drunk to shout anything that made sense but they werent too drunk to burn anything that would burn to steal anything that wasnt nailed down and to smash any negroes who tried to stop them in the early stages of the riot what passed for augustas black leadersa double handful of preachers and merchantshad rushed to the police to get help against the hurricane overwhelming their community scipio had happened to be looking out the window of his flat when they came back into the terry most of them by their expressions might have just scrambled out of a derailed train a couple looked grim but unsurprised scipio would have guessed those men had seen some action of their own in and whatll they do for us somebody shouted from another window wont do nothin one of the leaders answered nothin said we deserves every hit of it an mo besides after that a few negroes had tried to fight back against the rampaging mob they were outnumbered and outgunned dark bodies hung from lamp posts silhouetted against the roaring leaping flames from behind scipio bathsheba said maybe we ought to run he shook his head where we run to he asked bluntly the buckra catch we we hangs on de lamp posts too dis buildin don burn we don go nowhere he sounded altogether sure of himself he had that gift even using the slurred dialect of a negro from the swamps of the congaree back in the days when hed been anne colletons butler shed also made him learn to talk like an educated white man like an educated white man with a poker up his ass he thought hed seemed even more authoritative then he hadnt always been right he knew that as any man must but hed always sounded right that also counted raucous baying laughter floated up from the street along with those neverending shouts of freedom somebody yelled kill the niggers in an instant as if the words crystallized what theyd come into the terry to do the rioters took up the cry kill the niggers kill the niggers kill the niggers scipio turned to his wife you still wants to run biting her lip she got out the word no she was a mulatto her skin several shades lighter than his she was light enough to go paler still at the moment she was almost pale enough to pass for white why they hate us like that pa antoinette their daughter was nine a good age for asking awkward questions in the confederate states few questions were more awkward than that one and the brute fact was so much taken for granted few people above the age of nine ever bothered asking why scipio answered dey is white an we is black dey don need no mon dat with the relentless logic of childhood his son cassius who was six turned the response on its head if we is black an they is white shouldnt we ought to hate them too he didnt know what to say to that bathsheba said yes but it dont do us no good sweetheart on account of theys strongern we is that yes had led directly to the red uprisings during the great war the rest of her sentence had led just as directly to their failure what do we do scipio wondered what can we do hed wondered that ever since hed seen his first freedom party rally a small thing at a park here in augusta hed hoped he wouldnt have to worry about it that hope like so many others lay shattered tonight kill the niggers the cry rang out again louder and fiercer than ever screams said the rioters were turning words into deeds too gunfire rang out from the building across the street from scipios a black man emptying a pistol into the mob some of the screams that followed burst from white throats good savage exultation blazed through scipio see how you like it you sons of bitches wasnt keeping us cooped up in this poor miserable place enough for you but the white men didnt and wouldnt think that way of course cet animal est mйchant on lattaque il se defende that was how voltaire had put it anyhow this animal is treacherous if it is attacked it defends itself thanks to miss anne though shed done it for herself not for him scipio knew voltaire well how many of the rioters did how many had even heard of him a fusillade of fire from pistols rifles and what sounded like a machine gun tore into the building from which the negro had shot more than a few bullets slammed into the building in which scipio and his family lived too then some whites chucked a whiskey bottle full of gasoline with a burning cloth wick into the entryway of the building across the street the bottle shattered fire splashed outward the white men whooped and hollered and slapped one another on the back with glee burn baby burn one of them shouted soon they were all yelling it along with kill the niggers xerxes they gwine burn this here place next bathsheba said urgently we gots to git out while we still kin he wished he could tell her she was wrong instead he nodded we gits de chillun we gits de money an we gitsout de back way to de alley on account o we don las a minute if we goes out de front maybe the building wouldnt burn maybe the white men rampaging through the terry would go on to some other crime instead but if the roominghouse did catch fire his family was doomed better to take their chances on the streets than to try to get out of a building ablaze herding antoinette and cassius along in front of them he and bathsheba raced toward the stairway a door flew open on the far side of the hall you crazy a woman in that flat said we safer in here than we is out there aint so scipio answered dey likely fixin to burn dis place the womans eyes opened so wide he could see white all around the iris she slammed the door but he didnt think shed stay in there long he and his family werent the only people going down the stairs as fast as they could some of the negroes trying to escape the roominghouse dashed for the front entrance maybe they didnt know about the back way maybe in their blind panic they forgot it or maybe they were just stupid blacks suffered from that disease no less than whites whatever the reason they paid for their mistake gunshots echoed screams followed so did hoarse bellows of triumph from the mob theyve just shot down people who never didnever could dothem any harm scipio thought as he scuttled toward the back door why are they so proud of it hed seen blacks exulting over what they meted out to whites during the red revolt but that exultation had years of reasons behind it this this made no sense at all to him out the door down the rickety stairs pray no white men prowled the alley the stinks of rotting garbage and smoke and fear filled scipios nostrils away away away where we run to pa antoinette asked as he shoved her on ahead of him go where it darkest scipio answered whatever you does don let no buckra see you easy to say hard to do most nights in the terry were black as pitch black as coal blacker than the residents the city fathers of augusta werent about to waste money on street lighting for negroes but the fires burning here there everywhere didnt just burn people they trapped they also helped betray others by showing them as they tried to get away down the alley into another scipio stepped in something nasty he didnt know what it was didnt care to find out as long as he and his family got away nothing else mattered into a side street that would take them to the edge of town take them out of the center of the storm the side street was darkno fires close by it looked deserted but as scipio and his kin ran up it a sharp challenge came from up ahead who are you answer right this second or youre dead whoever the hell you are scipio hadnt used his white mans voice since not long after the war ended hed sometimes wondered if it still worked now it burst from him as if it were his everyday speech go on about your business none of those damned niggers around here yes it still held all the punch hed ever been able to pack into it thank you sir said the white man whod challenged him and then freedom freedom scipio echoed gravely he dropped back into the dialect of the congaree to whisper come on to bathsheba and the children they said not a word they just hurried up the street no one shot at them nor did anyone else challenge them before they reached a stand of pine woods on the outskirts of augusta scipio didnt know what he would do come morning he would worry about that then for now he was alive and likely to stay that way till the sun came up do jesus all his weariness and strain came out in the two words then bathsheba asked him the question hed known she would where you learn to talk dat way aint never heard you talk dat way before reckoned i better scipio said an answer that was not an answer it didnt distract his wife hed hoped it would but hadnt expected it to bathsheba said i never knew you could talk like that you didnt jus pull it out of the air neither aint nobody could you been able to talk dat way all along you got tove been able to talk dat way all along so where you learn long time gone when i was livin in south carolina he said that much was true never did like to use it much nigger git in bad trouble he talk like white folks that was also true true or not it didnt satisfy bathsheba you got more splainin to do than that what other kind o strange stuff you gwine come out with all of a sudden i dunno he answered bathsheba put her hands on her hips scipio grimaced her curiosity promised to be harder to escape than the race riot still wracking the terry new york city the lower east side tall tenements blocking out the sun iron fire escapes red with rust poor shabbily dressed people in the crowd chattering to one another in a mixture of english and yiddish and russian and polish and romanian red socialist posters on the walls and fences some of them put up where democratic posters had been torn down a soapbox that wasnt even a soapbox but a beer barrel flora blackford hadnt felt so much at home for years shed been a socialist agitator in the fourteenth ward twenty years before at the outbreak of the great war shed argued against voting the money for the war her party had disagreed she still wondered whether theyd made a mistake whether international proletarian solidarity would have been better she would never know now what she did know was that the war had cost her brotherinlaw his life that her nephew had become a young man without ever seeing his father that her brother david had only one leg and she knew she couldnt talk about the war today not to this crowd shed represented this district for years before marrying hosea blackford before becoming first the vice presidents wife and then the first lady now her husband was a private citizen again trounced by the democrats when wall street collapsed and dragged everything else down with it now she wanted her old seat back and hoped she could take it from the reactionary whod held it for the past four years she pointed out to the crowd as she had from a different beer barrel twenty years before you voted for democrats because you thought doing nothing was better than doing something do you still think so no they shouted all except for a few heckling democrats who yelled yes hecklers mora could take in stride herbert hoover has been president for almost two years now hes spent all that time sitting on his hands are we better off on account of it are the lines at the soup kitchens shorter are the hoovervilles any smaller she refused to call the shantytowns where downandouters lived blackfordburghs after her husband though everybody else did are there more jobs is there less misery tell me the truth comrades no the crowd shouted again this time it drowned out the hecklers thats right flora said no you know the truth when you hear it youre not blind youre not stupid youve got eyes to see and brains to think with if youre happy with what the democrats are doing to the united states vote for my opponent if youre not vote for me thank you hamburger hamburger hamburger they remembered her maiden name well enough to chant it she took that as a good sign shed long since learned though that you couldnt tell much from crowds they came out because they wanted to hear you they were already on your side the rest of the voters might not be herman bruck held up a hand to help her descend from her little platform good speech flora he said did he hang on to her hand a little too long back in the old days hed been sweet on her he was married himself now with children of his own of course who could say for sure how much that meant thank you she answered my pleasure he tipped his fedora as always he was perfectly turned out today in a snappy doublebreasted gray pinstripe suit with lapels sharp enough to cut yourself on them i think youll win in three weeks i hope so thats all flora said well find out about how people feel about hooverand about congressman lipshitz if i win i go back to philadelphia if i lose she shrugged if i lose i have to find something else to do with the rest of my life come back to party headquarters bruck urged a lot of the oldtimers will be glad to see you and youre a legend to the people whove come in since you represented this district a legend gottenyu i dont want to be a legend flora said in real alarm a legend is somebody whos forgotten things she needs to know i want people to think i can do good things for them now not that im somebody who used to do good things for them once upon a time all right herman bruck made a placating gesture i should have put it better im sorry people still want to see you can you come tomorrow she answered tell everyone im sorry but i dont think i ought to go over there today heaven knows when id get home and i want to go back to the flat and see how hosea is doing this cold doesnt seem to want to go away she hoped she didnt show how worried she was the difference in their ages hadnt seemed to matter when she married him but now while she remained in vigorous middle age he was heading toward his seventyfourth birthday illnesses he would have shrugged off even a few years before hung on and on one of these days flora resolutely refused to think about that bruck nodded sure everybody will understand that give him our best then and we hope well see you tomorrow ill drive you back to your block of flats she eyed him would he cause trouble in the auto no he had better sense than that thanks she said again he hurried off to get the motorcar from a side street the de soto bespoke prosperity but not riches new york city traffic was even crazier than flora remembered more motorcars and trucks on the street more drivers seeming not to care whether they lived or died this in spite of the subways she thought and shuddered earlier in the year she and hosea and joshua had been living in dakota new york city had five or six times as many people as the big state and by all appearances had fifty or sixty times as many automobiles she let out a sigh of relief at escaping the de soto the doorman tipped his cap when she went into the block of flats the building where shed lived with her parents and brothers and sisters hadnt boasted a doorman it hadnt boasted an elevator operatoror an elevatoreither not having to walk up four flights of stairs whenever she went to the flat was pleasant hosea blackford greeted her with a sneeze his nose was red his face always bony had lost more flesh his white hair lay thin and dry across his skull this wasnt deaths doorlittle by little he was getting wellbut the way he looked still alarmed her after another sneeze he peered at her over the tops of his reading glasses and brandished the new york times like a weapon another round of riots down in the confederate states he said if thats not reactionary madness on the march down there ive never seen nor heard of it has anyone protested yet flora asked her husband shook his head not a word the confederates are saying its an internal matter and our state department is taking the same line she sighed wed sing a different song if the freedom party were going after white men and not negroes the injustice the hypocrisy are so obvious but nobody seems to care a lot of whites in the confederate states despise negroes and come right out and say so hosea blackford said a lot of whites in the united states despise negroes too they keep their mouths shut about it and so they seem tolerant when you look at them alongside the confederates they seem tolerantbut they arent i know i saw that when we were both still in congress flora said its not just democrats either too many socialists wouldnt cross the street to do anything for a black man i dont know what to do about it i dont know if we can do anything about it hosea nodded even lincoln said the war of secession was about trying to preserve the union not about the negro or about slavery he couldnt have made anybody march behind his banner if hed said the otherand even as things were he failed he coughed again i wish i would have asked him about that when i met him on the train i wish we would have talked about all kinds of things we never got to touch i know flora said that chance meeting had changed his life he talked about it often and ever more so as he got older now he laughed a bitter laugh were two peas in a pod lincoln and i the two biggest failures as president of the united states dont talk like that flora said why not its the truth im not a blind man flora and i hope im not a fool hosea blackford said words that might have come right from her speech i had my chance i didnt deliver the voters chose coolidge instead and then got hoover when cal dropped dead i dont know what we did to deserve that god must have a nasty sense of humor flora didnt think of god as having a sense of humor at all she also didnt care to be sidetracked we cant just turn our backs on the negroes in the csa she said thats true hosea said but youd be a fool if you said so in your next speech because sure as anything it would make people vote for lipshitz she winced that was bound to be true no matter how little she liked it turning away from him she said id better get to work on that next speech the elections another day closer the speech went as well as such things could after it was done she went to the socialist party headquarters across the street from the centre market and above fleischmanns kosher butcher shop now run by the son of the original proprietor some of the workers in the headquarters looked implausibly young others were implausibly familiar there sat maria tresca typing away as if the past ten years hadnt happened she almost certainly spoke better yiddish than any other italian woman in new york city she was also as thoroughgoing a socialist as anyone in the party and had paid a heavy price for holding on to her beliefs her sister had been killed by police in the remembrance day riots of flora had been with them when it happened the bullet could have struck her as easily as angelina tresca how does it feel to come back maria asked coming back here feels wonderful flora said which brought smiles all around i hope i can come back to congress in november with you people helping me im sure i can that brought more smiles on the night of november she and hosea and joshua came back to party headquarters to find out if she had won her husband was still coughing and sneezing but he had got better her parents were there too and her brothers and sisters and their families yossel reisen her sister sophies son was nineteen years old and six feet tall in the next election hed be able to vote himself that seemed impossible these days a blaring wireless set brought results faster than telegrams had the last time shed waited out a congressional election the more returns that came in the better things looked not just here in the fourteenth ward but all across the country hoover remained in office of course but he would have to deal with a socialist congress for the next two years at a quarter past eleven the telephone rang herman bruck answered it a big grin on his face he ceremoniously held out the mouthpiece to flora its lipshitz he said hello congressman flora said hello congresswoman the democrat sounded worn weary wounded congratulations on a fine campaign may you serve the district well thank you thank you very much politely flora tried to hold excitement from her voice she was going back to philadelphia the tinny ring of a cheap alarm clock bounced jefferson pinkard out of bed he lurched into the bathroom and took a long leak to get rid of the homebrew hed poured down the night before alabama was a dry state but a man who wanted a beer or three could find what he was looking for bloodshot eyes stared at jeff from the mirror over the sink he was a ruddy beefy man in his early forties his light brown hair pulling back at the temples his chin a forwardthrusting rock whose strong outline extra flesh was starting to obscure do i need a shave he asked out loud he lived alonehe was divorcedand had fallen into the habit of talking to himself deciding he did he lathered up then scraped his face with a formidable straight razor he muttered curses when he nicked himself just under his lower lip a styptic pencil stopped the bleeding but stung like fire he didnt mutter the next set of curses when he put on his gray jailers uniform the high stiff collar bit into his neck and made his face redder than ever after two cups of snarling coffee and three eggs fried harder than he cared forhed always been a lousy cookhe left his apartment and started for the birmingham jail newsboys hawked the birmingham confederate and the registerherald at almost every street corner no matter which paper they waved they shouted the same thing supreme court turns thumbs down on damming our rivers read all about it screw the supreme court pinkard muttered as he paid five cents for a copy of the confederate that was the freedom party paper in birmingham he wouldnt waste his money on the registerherald one of these days before too long he suspected something unfortunate would happen to the building where it was written and printed the confederate quoted president featherston as saying those seven old fools in black robes think they can stop us from doing what the confederate people elected us to do this is a slap in the face at every honest hardworking citizen of our country if the supreme court wants to play politics theyll find out that floods can wash away more than towns damn right jeff said and chucked the paper into an ashcan he didnt know what the president could do about the supreme court but he figured jake featherston would come up with something he always did two cops on the steps of the birmingham city jail nodded to him as he climbed those steps and went into the building one of them wore a party pin on his lapel the other one though was the one who said freedom freedom pinkard echoed he had a party pin on his lapel too not long after the war ended hed heard jake featherston speak in a birmingham park hed been a freedom party man ever since in the jail he had a desk in a cramped office he shared with several other jailers the one he was following onto duty looked up from his own desk where he was filling out some of the nine million forms without which the jail could not have survived a day mornin jeff stubby winthrop said freedom freedom pinkard said again whats new not a hell of a lot winthrop answered as his nickname implied he looked like a fireplug with hairy ears couplethree niggers in the drunk tank white kid in a cell for stabbing his lady friend when he found out she was this other fellas lady friend too oh i almost forgotthey finally caught that bastard whos been stealing everything that aint nailed down on the south side of town yeah swell pinkard said adding about time goddammit like a lot of jailers he was convinced the police who hunted down criminals couldnt find a skunk if it was spraying their leg unlike a lot of men in his line of work he wasnt shy about saying so his years at the sloss foundry had left him with the strength to back up talk with action if he ever had to he asked the question stubby winthrop hadnt answered what about the politicals well of course winthrop looked at him as if at an idiot they drug in another twelve fifteen o them bastards too he poked at the papers with a short blunt finger i can tell you exactly how many if you want to know dont worry about it now jeff said i can find out myself before i do my morning walkthroughlong as the paperworks there it is it is stubby assured him think i want the warden reaming out my ass on account of messedup papers not likely cool down i didnt mean anything by it twelve or fifteen you say jeff asked winthrop nodded jeff let out a pleased grunt we are starting to clean up this town arent we bet your butt winthrop said anybody forgets who won the goddamn election we teach the fucker a little lesson aint no such thing as a fit night out for whigs or radical republicans not any more there aint belonging to a political party other than the freedom party wasnt against the law pinkard thought it ought to be but it wasnt but anybody who raised his voice against the party regretted it and in a hurry disturbing the peace resisting arrest criminal trespass inciting to riot and possession of alcoholic beverages were plenty to get a man into jail and once he was in he might behe probably would bea long time coming out again most judges like anybody else knew which side their bread was buttered on and went along with freedom party instructions a couple of holdouts in birmingham had already suffered mysterious and most deplorable accidents their replacements were more cooperative so were the other judges a few mysterious and most deplorable accidents could make anybody thoughtful pinkard said hell with me if i know what were going to do with all these stinking politicals weve stuffed so many of em into cells we dont hardly have room for real crooks any more aint my worry stubby said and you know somethin else theres a fuck of a lot of worse problems to have pinkard nodded again he couldnt very well argue with that winthrop went on matter of fact this whole goddamn jail is your baby for the next eight hours im gonna get outa here grab myself some shuteye freedom he headed out the door freedom jeff called after him among party menand more and more widely through the csa these daysthe word replaced hello and goodbye the heavy armored door crashed shut behind stubby winthrop pinkard looked at the clock on the wall the prisoners would just be getting breakfast he had time to find out precisely what he needed to know about changes since yesterday before making his first walkthrough of the day he didnt love paperwork but he did recognize the need for it he was conscientious about keeping up with it too which put him a jump ahead of several of his fellow jailers hed just finished seeing what was what when the door to the office opened the prisoner who came in had a trusties green armband on the left sleeve of his striped shirt whats up mike pinkard asked frowning this wasnt a scheduled time for a trustie to show up but mike had an answer for him warden wants to see you sir right away his voice like those of a lot of trusties held a particular kind of whine it put pinkard in mind of the yelp of a dog that had been kicked too many times whine or not though a summons from the warden was like a summons from god pinkard did his best not to evade but to delay saying cant i take my morning walkthrough first anyways youre a jaileryou can do whatever you please mike said which only proved hed never been a jailer then he added but i dont reckon the wardend be mighty pleased which proved he had a good idea of how things worked anyhow pinkard grunted and decided the walkthrough would have to wait warden ewell mcdonald was a heavyset man with a mustache that looked like a gray moth on his upper lip he was close to retirement age and didnt much care whose cage he rattled come in pinkard he said staring at jeff over the tops of the halfglasses he used for reading whats up sir jeff asked warily come in the warden repeated sit down you aint in troubleswear to god you aint still cautious pinkard obeyed mcdonald went on that stuff on your record how you set up that prisonerofwar camp down in mexico during their last civil war thats the straight goods hell yes pinkard answered without hesitation he was telling the truth too and knew other confederate veteransfreedom party menwhod gone down to the empire of mexico to fight for maximilian iii against the yankeebacked republican rebels and could back him up anybody says i didnt tell me who he is and ill kill the son of a bitch keep your shirt on mcdonald said i just wanted to make sure is all reason im asking is weve got more politicals in jail these days than you can shake a stick at thats a fact jeff agreed stubby and me we were just talking about that a little while ago matter of fact its not just birmingham eitherits all over alabama all over the country too but alabamas what counts for you and me weve got to keep those bastards locked up but theyre a big pain in the ass here in town mcdonald said so what weve got orders to do is weve got orders to make a camp out in the country and stow the politicals in it we save the jail for the real bad guys you know what i mean jefferson pinkard nodded sure do sounds like a good idea anybody wants to know what i think mcdonald inked an oldfashioned dip pen and wrote something on the sheet of paper in front of him good i was hoping you were going to say that on account of i aim to send you out there to help get it rolling your rank will be assistant warden thats good for another fortyfive dollars a month in your pocket it wasnt the sort of promotion jeff had expected but a promotion it definitely was thank you sir he said gathering himself you dont mind my asking though why me you got a bunch of guys with more seniority than i have more seniority in the jail yeah mcdonald answered but a camp out in the open thats a different business only fellow here whos done anything like that is you youll be there from the start like i said and youll have a lot of say about how it goes well get the barbed wire well get the lumber for the barracks well get the ordinary guards and you help set it up so it works whats so goddamn funny down in mexico i had to scrounge every damn thing i used pinkard answered i cut enough corners to build me a whole new street you get me everything i need like that its almost too easy to stand he held up his hand not that im complaining mind you in mexico hed been glad to land that job riding herd on prisoners because it meant nobody was shooting at him any more hed never dreamt then how much good it would do him once he came home to the csa without a doubt sam carsten was the oldest lieutenant junior grade on the uss remembrance that was what he got for being a mustang hed spent close to twenty years in the navy before making officers rank no one could tell if he had gray hair though not when it had started out platinum blond he was the next thing to an albino with blue eyes and transparent pink skin that would sunburn in the light of a candle flame the north pacific in december wasnt a bad place for a man with a complexion like that even here hed smeared zincoxide ointment on his nose and the backs of his hands before coming out onto the ships flight deck it wouldnt help much nothing ever helped much he shifted his weight to the motion of the aeroplane carrier without noticing he was doing it most of the crew stood on the deck with him only the black gang down in the engine room and the men at the antiaircraft guns werent drawn up at attention all in neat ranks to hear what captain stein had to say gentlemen it is official at last the captain said into a microphone that not only amplified his words for the sailors on deck but also carried them to the crewmen still at their posts we have received word by wireless from philadelphia that the united states of american and the empire of japan are at peace once more sam kicked at the flight deck he was standing only a few feet from a big patch in the deck a patch that repaired the damage a japanese bomb had done he couldnt help wondering whether the fight had been worthwhile captain stein went on the terms of the peace are simple everything goes back to what the diplomats call the status quo ante bellum that just means the way things were before the shooting started we dont give anything to the japs and they dont give us anything either behind carsten a sailor muttered whyd we fight the goddamn war then in one way the answer to that was obvious the japanese had been feeding men and money into british columbia trying to touch off another canadian uprising against the usa and the remembrance had caught them at it that was when the shooting started if a torpedo from one of their submersibles hadnt been a dud the carrier might not have come through it in another sense though the sailor had a point the us and japanese navies had slugged at each other in the pacific the japanese had tried to attack the american navy base in the sandwich islands more than twenty years ago now sam had been in the fleet that took pearl harbor away from the british empire and brought it under us control aeroplanes from a couple of their carriers had bombed los angeles all in all though japan had lost more ships than the usa hador sam thought so anyhow hed missed a few words of steins speech the captain was saying at battle stations for the next few days to make sure this message has also reached ships of the imperial japanese navy we will continue flying combat air patrol but we will not fire unless fired upon or unless attack against the remembrance is clearly intended somewhere out here in the pacific a japanese skipper was probably reading a similar announcement to his crew wonder what the japs think of it went through carstens mind he didnt know what to think of it himself there was a lingering sense of unfinished business thats the story from philadelphia captain stein said before i turn you boys loose i have a few words of my own heres what i have to say we did everything we could to teach the japs a lesson and i suppose they did all they could to teach us one i dont believe anybody learned a hell of a lot this war is over my guess is the fight isnt from now on we stay extra alert in these waters because you never can tell when its going to boil over again remember the surprise attack they used against spain when they took away the philippines he looked out over the crew so did carsten here and there heads bobbed up and down as men nodded steins point had got home seeing as much the skipper gave one brisk nod himself thats all dismissed chattering among themselves the sailors hurried back to their stations sam didnt much want to go to his his post was in damage control deep down in the bowels of the ship hed done good work there good enough to win promotion from ensign to jg all the same it wasnt what he wanted to do hed come aboard the carrier as a petty officer when she was new because he thought aviation was the coming thing hed wanted to serve with the ships fighting scouts or that failing in his old specialty gunnery as often happened what he wanted and what the navy wanted were two different beasts as always happened what the navy wanted prevailed down into the bowels of the remembrance he went lieutenant commander hiram pottinger his nominal boss got to their station at the same time he did coming down the passageway he was coming up in fact sam knew a lot more about the way damage control worked aboard the remembrance than pottinger did his superior whod replaced a wounded officer had spent his whole career up till the past few months in cruisers sam on the other hand had had two long tours on the carrier he automatically thought of things like protecting the aeroplanes fuel supply pottinger thought of such things too but he took longer to do it in combat a few seconds could mean the difference between safety and a fireball quite a few of the sailors in the damagecontrol party wore the ribbon for the purple heart above their left breast pockets several of them had won other decorations too the remembrance had seen a lot of hard actionand taken more damage than carsten would have wished a ratfaced irishman named fitzpatrick asked sir you really think them goddamn japs is gonna leave us alone from now on hed aimed the question at sam instead of answering sam looked to lieutenant commander pottinger the senior officer had first call that was how things worked pottinger said well i expect were all right for now several sailors stirred carsten didnt much like the answer himself he didnt and wouldnt trust the japanese so far their trials of strength with the usa had been inconclusive both in the great war where theyd been the only entente power that hadnt got whipped and in this latest fight which had been anything but great but then pottinger went on of course god only knows how long the quiet will last the japs keep bargains for as long as they think its a good idea and not thirty seconds longer the skipper said as muchremember the philippines sam relaxed so did the ordinary sailors lieutenant commander pottinger wasnt altogether naive after all everybody stared at corridors painted in navy gray at bulkheads and hatchways at hoses that shot highpressure salt water at the overhead pipes that meant a tall man had to crouch when he ran unless he wanted to bang the top of his head at bare light bulbs inside steel cages the world in which they operated most of the remembrance lay above them they might have been moles scurrying through underground tunnels every once in a while a claustrophobe got assigned to damage control such men didnt last long they started feeling the whole weight of the ship pressing down on their heads not without pride one of the sailors said we could do our job in the dark could my nuts fitzpatrick said weve fuckin well done our job in the dark you dont need to see to know where youre at the way noise comes back at you where you bump up against fittings the smells difference between us and the rest of the poor sorry bastards on this floating madhouse is we really know what were doing almost in unison the other men from the damagecontrol party nodded the fighting had given them a fierce esprit de corps carstens head wanted to go up and down too and it would have had he not known that every other unit on the ship was just as proud of itself and just as convinced the remembrance would instantly founder if it didnt do what it was supposed to nothing wrong with that it was good for morale pottinger said heres hoping we dont have to do what we do for a hell of a long time more nods sam said long as were hoping lets hope we head back to seattle and get some leave that drew not only nods but laughter pottinger gave carsten a hard look but he ended up laughing too sam had always been able to get away with saying things that would have landed someone who said them in a different tone of voice in a lot of trouble he could smile his way out of bar scenes that usually would have brought out broken bottles seaman fitzpatrick on the other hand was deadly serious how long before we need to start worrying about confederate submersibles again he asked weve already worried about confederate subs sam said remember that passage between florida and cuba we took on the way to costa rica we didnt spot anything but god only knows what those bastards had laying for us there thats their own waters though fitzpatrick protested that isnt what i meant what i did mean was how long before we have to worry about them out here in the pacific and out in the atlantic toodont want to leave out the other ocean this time carsten didnt answer he looked to lieutenant commander pottinger again the commander of the damagecontrol party said weve already got jap subs here in the pacific and maybe british boats coming up from australia and new zealand toward the sandwich islands weve got british boats and german boats and french ones too in the atlantic enough of those sons of bitches running around loose already what the hell difference do a few confederate subs make now he got a laugh sam joined it even though he didnt think pottinger had been kidding back when i started out in the navy all we worried about was surface ships he said nobodyd ever heard that aeroplanes were dangerous and submarines were still half toys nobody had any idea what they could do its a different world nowadays and thats the truth you betcha seaman fitzpatrick said nobody ever thought of a funnylooking thing called an aeroplane carrier neither damage control is damage control pottinger said something hurts the ship we patch it up thats what were here for sailors nodded once more carsten didnt argue with his superior not out loud but it was more complicated than that shells did one kind of damage torpedoes another and bombs a third bombs had the potential to be the most destructive he thought unlike shells and torpedoes they werent limited in how much explosive they could carry and explosive was what delivered the punch everything else was just the bus driver to get the cordite to where it did its job sam didnt care for that line of reasoning if bombs could sink ships so easily what point to having any surface navy at all hed first wondered about that during the war when an aeroplane flying out from argentina had bombed the battleship he was on the damage was lightthe bombs were smallbut he thought hed seen the handwriting on the wall maybe a carriers aeroplanes could hold off the enemys but maybe they couldnt too down in the warm humid belly of the remembrance sam shivered iii jonathan moss was an american he had a canadian wife after studying occupation law hed made his living in berlin ontario by helping canucks struggling in the toils of what the us army insisted on calling justice without false modesty he knew he was one of the best in the business and what was his reward for doing everything he could to give the canadians a hand he stared down at the sheet of paper on his desk hed just taken it out of an envelope and unfolded it in block capitals it said yank swine you will die he supposed he ought to turn it over to the occupying authorities maybe they could find fingerprints on it and track down whoever had stuck it in the mail instead moss crumpled up the paper and chucked it into the wastebasket for one thing odds were anyone who sent a charming missive of this sort had the elementary common sense to wear gloves while he was doing it and for another taking a crank like this seriously gave him power over you during the war moss had flown observation aeroplanes and fighting scouts hed gone through all three years without getting badly hurt and ended up an ace after the real terror of aerial combat a cowardly little anonymous threat didnt get him very excited he methodically went through the rest of his mail the bar association reminded him his dues were payable before december that gave him two and a half weeks his landlord served notice that as of next february his office rent would go up five dollars a month happy day he said he opened another nondescript envelope this one also held a single sheet of paper its message also in untraceable block capitals was your wife and little girl will die yank swine seeing that moss abruptly changed his mind about the letter hed thrown away he fished it from the trash can and flattened it out as best he could the letters in both were about the same size and in about the same style moss rummaged for the envelope in which the first threat had come he set it next to the one hed just now opened well well he murmured isnt that interesting he was no detective with a microscope but he didnt need to be to see that his address on the two envelopes had been typed with two different machines not only that one us stamp bore a manitoba overprint while the other had one from ontario the notes as near as he could see were identical the envelopes not only werent but had been mailed from different provinces he checked to see if the postmarks confirmed what the stamps said they did one came from toronto the other from a town south of winnipeg what did that mean two possibilities occurred to him one was that somebody didnt like him and had got his botherinlaw or someone of that sort to help show how much somebody like that was a pest the other possibility was that hed fallen foul of a real organization dedicated towhat to making his life miserable certainly and odds were to making canadas american occupiers unhappy en masse hed hoped time would reconcile canada to having lost the great war the longer he stayed here the more naive and forlorn that hope looked englishspeaking canada had risen once on its own in the s more recently the empire of japan had tried to ignite it again great britain wouldnt have minded helping its onetime dominion make the yanks miserable either with a sigh moss put both sheets of paper and both envelopes in a buff manila folder with a longer louder sigh he donned his overcoat earmuffs hat and mittens then he closed the door to the law officeas an afterthought he locked it tooand left the building for the twoblock walk to occupation headquarters in berlin had he been in a tearing hurry he could have left off the earmuffs and mittens it was above zero and no new snow had fallen since the middle of the night moss had grown up around chicago a city that knew rugged weather even so his wartime service in ontario and the years hed lived here since had taught him some things about cold hed never learned down in the states he saw three new yanks out graffiti between the building where he worked and the redbrick fortress that housed the occupation authority two shopkeepers were already out getting rid of them he suspected the third would in short order leaving antiamerican messages up on your property was an offense punishable by fine occupation code section he thought the sentries in front of occupation headquarters jeered at him as he came up the steps look its the canuck from chicago he wasnt in the army indeed most of his practice involved opposing military lawyersso they didnt bother wasting politeness on him funny boys he said at which they jeered harder than ever he went on into the building or started to just inside the entrance a sergeant and a couple of privates stopped him theyve beefed up security sir the sergeant said orders are to pat down all civilians sorry sir he didnt sound sorry at all moss shed his overcoat and held his arms out wide as if he were being crucified after he passed the inspection he went on to the office of major sam lopat a prosecutor with whom hed locked horns more than a few times ah mr moss lopat said and what sort of fancy lies have you got waiting for me next time we go at each other here moss set the manila folder on the majors desk tell me what you think of these lopat raised one eyebrow when moss failed to come back with a gibe he raised the other when he saw what the folder held oh he said in a different tone of voice more of these babies more of them you say moss didnt know whether to feel alarmed or relieved other people have got em too hell yes the military prosecutor answered what did you think you were the only one he didnt wait for moss reply but threw back his head and laughed you civilian lawyers think youre the most important guys in the world and nothing is real unless it happens to you well ive got news for you you arent the cream in gods coffee and you are but jonathan moss checked himself he wanted information from lopat not a quarrel all right im not the only one you say tell me more who else has got em who sends em have you had any luck catching the bastards i guess not or i wouldnt have got these not as much as wed like lopat said which was pretty obvious weve torn apart the towns where theyre postmarked but not much luck you can see for yourselfall the canucks need is a typewriter and a pen and they could do without the typewriter in a pinch if it makes you feel better theres never been a followup on one of these nobodys got shot or blown up the day after one of these little love notes came im not sorry to hear that moss admitted you didnt say who else got alove note he nodded to lopat acknowledging the phrase i dont have the whole list investigation isnt my department you know i go into court once theyre caughtand then you do your damnedest to get em off the hook the military prosecutor leered at moss who stonily stared back with a shrug lopat went on far as i know the other people these have come to have all been part of the occupation apparatus one way or another youre the first outside shyster to get one or i think you are doesnt that make you proud at least moss said dryly and lopat laughed moss tapped one of the notes with a fingernail prints well check but the next ones we findll be the first yeah i figured as much you would have landed on these fellows like a bomb if you knew who they were moss said lopat nodded something else occurred to moss you think this has anything to do with that telephone threat i got last year where the guy told me not to start my auto or id be sorry the military prosecutor frowned id forgotten about that i dont know what to tell you pretty damn funny you know youre the best friendbest american friendthe canucks have got youre married to one of theirs and i know what she thinks of most yanks me included youre the best occupation lawyer between calgary and toronto anyway makes sense theyd want to get rid of me i dont like it but it makes sense but why you seems to me they ought to put a bounty on anybody who even messes up your hair ive wondered about that too maybe theyre angrier at laura for marrying me than they are at me for marrying her maybe but lopat didnt sound convinced in that case why arent they trying to blow her up instead of you dont know moss answered as long as this isnt too much of a much though i wont lose any sleep over it he redonned his coldweather gear ill see you in court major and ill whip you too ha lopat said you been smoking doped cigarettes to get so cocky after a few more goodnatured insults moss left occupation headquarters by then a wan sun had come out his long shadow stretched out to the northwest as he walked back to the building where he practiced hed just set one foot on the steps leading up the sidewalk when the bomb went off behind him had he had an infantrymans reflexes he would have thrown himself flat instead he stood there frozen while glass blew out of windows all around and fell clinking and clattering to the ground like sharpedged glittering snowflakes already a great cloud of black smoke was rising into the sky looking over his shoulder moss realized it came from the direction of the building hed just left he started running back in the direction from which hed come at every step his shoes crunched on shattered glass he bumped into a bleeding man running the other way sorry they both gasped each one kept going when moss rounded the last corner he came on a scene whose like he hadnt met since the days of the war occupation headquarters had had plenty of guards but someone somehow had sneaked a bomb past them the red brick building had fallen in on itself flames shot up from it bodies and pieces of bodies lay all around moss stepped on an arm that stopped abruptly halfway between elbow and wrist it still had on shirt sleeve and wristwatch blood dribbled from the end his stomach lurched here and there survivors were staggering or pulling themselves out of the building my god one of thema woman secretarysaid over and over my god my god maybe she was too stunned to say anything else maybe she couldnt find anything else that fit she cradled a broken arm in her other hand but hardly seemed to know she was hurt a hand sticking out from under bricks opened and closed moss dashed over and started clawing at the rubble the soldier he pulled out was badly battered but didnt seem to have any broken bones god bless you pal he said fire engines roared up sirens screaming they began playing water on the wreckage moss looked for more signs of life under it as he threw bricks in all directions he wondered if the people whod planted this bomb were the same ones whod written him his notes if they were sam lopat had been wrong about themnot that he was likely to know that any more down in southern sonora winter was the rainy season hipolito rodriguez had planted his fields of corn and beans when the rains started plowing behind his trusty mule now with giving way to he tramped through them hoe in hand weeding and cultivating a farmers work was never done these days he wasnt the only one tramping through the fields his two older sons miguel and jorge were big enough to give him real help one was seventeen the other sixteen before many more yearsmaybe before many more monthshad passed they would discover women once they found wives theyd go off and farm on their own then rodriguez would have to work his plot by himself again noby then pedro would be old enough to pitch in now he enjoyed the extra help when the days work was doneearlier than it would have been without his sons helphe stood at the sink working the pump handle to get water to wash the sweat from his round brown face that done he dried himself on a towel prickly with embroidery from his wife and his motherinlaw magdalena you know i am going into baroyeca tonight he said his wife sighed but nodded sн she said the two of them magdalena especially spoke more spanish than english most sonorans especially of their generation did even though sonora and chihuahua had belonged to the confederate states ten years longer than either one of them had been alive their children educated in the school in town used the two languages interchangeably schools taught exclusively in english what the rodriguezes childrens children would speak was something hipolito wondered from time to time but not something he could do anything about he said theres nothing to worry about now we have had no trouble holding freedom party meetings since seсor featherston won the election magdalena crossed herself i pray to god you are right and i still say you have not told me all you could about these times you were shooting at people since she was right rodriguez didnt answer he ate his supperbeans and cheese wrapped in tortillasthen walked to baroyeca about three miles away he got to town just as the sun was setting baroyeca had never been a big place a lot of the shops on the main street were shuttered these days and had been ever since the silver mines in the mountains to the north closed down a few years earlier if jaime diazs general store ever shut down rodriguez didnt know how the town would survive except for the general store and the culebra verde the local cantina freedom party headquarters was the only business in baroyeca that bothered lighting itself up after sundown the lamps burned kerosene electricity had never appeared here freedom the sign on the front window said and below it in slightly smaller letters ўlibertad no matter what rodriguez had told his wife an armed guard with bandoleers crisscrossing his chest stood in front of the door he nodded and stood aside to let rodriguez go in hola pablo rodriguez said їtodo estб bien yes everythings fine pablo sandoval answered in english nobody gonna do nothin to us now peeking out from under one of the bandoleers was his purple heart ribbon like rodriguez like most of the men now entering middle age in baroyeca hed gone north to fight for the estados confederados and against the estados unidos in the great war hed stayed in the englishspeaking part of the csa for several years before coming home which went a long way toward explaining why he often used that language the party organizer whod come down to baroyeca a few years before on the other hand was a native speaker of english but greeted rodriguez in fluent spanish hola seсor їcomo estб usted estoy bien gracias seсor quinn їy usted i am also well thank you robert quinn replied in spanish he was and always had been scrupulously polite to the men hed recruited into the freedom party that in itself set him apart from a lot of englishspeaking confederates who treated men of mexican blood as only a short step better than negroes rodriguez hadnt needed long in the confederate army to figure out that greaser was no term of endearment good manners alone had been plenty to gain quinn several new party members ўlibertad he added now ўlibertad rodriguez echoed he nodded to his friends as he took a seat theyd been in combat together fighting against the dons who didnt want to see the freedom party taking over baroyeca and all of sonora continuing in his good if accented spanish robert quinn said gentlemen i have a couple of announcements to make first i am glad i see before me men with many sons president featherston is beginning a freedom youth corps for boys fourteen to eighteen years old they will work where work is needed and they will learn order and discipline the party and the state of sonora will join together in paying the costs of uniforms those will not cost any party member even one cent a pleased buzz ran through the room rodriguezs friend carlos ruiz put up his hand quinn nodded to him he said seсor what if boys who come from families where there are no party members want to join this freedom youth corps this is a good question seсor ruiz quinns smile was not altogether pleasant he said in english we say johnnycomelatelies for those who try to jump on the caboose when the train is rolling away these boys will be able to join but their families will have to pay for the uniforms this seems only fair or do you think differently no seсor quinn i like this very much ruiz replied rodriguez liked it very much too for as long as his family had lived in these parts theyd had to make do with the dirty end of the stick this time though hed actually backed a winner not only that backing a winner was proving to have its rewards by the smiles on the faces of the other freedom party men their thoughts were running along the same lines some of you already know about our next item of business quinn said you saw when the pendejos who fought for don joaquin shot up our headquarters here last year that we could not rely on the guardнa civil to keep such troublemakers away from us the present members of the guardнa civil have resigned their replacements will be freedom party men bueno rodriguez said his wasnt the only voice raised in approval either putting freedom party men in those places did a couple of things it made sure the people who enforced the law would do that the way the party wanted as for so many years theyd done it the way the local mine owners and big landowners wanted and unless rodriguez missed his guess it would also make sure several freedom party men now down on their luck had jobs that paid enough to live on indeed what point belonging to the winning side if you couldnt reap any benefits from it knowing smiles around the room said he wasnt the only man to have figured that out either its good to know he thought one thing you could say about an old patron when trouble came he looked out for the men who backed him now we see the freedom party does the same thing we can rely on these people they wont use us and then walk away underscoring that very point robert quinn said baroyeca is our town now sonora is our state we have to make sure nobody takes them away from us and we have to show people who havent joined the freedom party yet that theyd be smart if they did several men stirred at that carlos ruiz put their worries into words why do we want all thesewhat did you call them in englishjohnniescomelately in the party what good are they they would only be followers they never fought for the party they never shed their blood for it who needs them you will always be special to the freedom party quinn promised he tapped the pin he wore in his lapel you men who were party members before president featherston was inaugurated will be able to wear pins like this one they will show you followed the freedom party before that was the popular thing to do the others the latecomers will have a black border on the pins they wear not bad hipolito rodriguez murmured most of the other party men nodded we deserve to be singled out rodriguez thought carlos is right we paid our party dues in blood but quinn went on still the freedom party has room for more than just us the freedom party is for everyone in the estados confederados everyone do you hear me the party is here to help all the people it is here for all the people and it is here to make sure all the people do all they can to make the estados confederados a better country a stronger country we will need all our strength all of you who are old enough fought in the war we were stabbed in the back then if we ever have to fight again we will win rodriguez hadnt hated the united states before the great war hed rarely thought about the usa before the war down here in southern sonora the united states had seemed too far away to worry about even confederate states like alabama and south carolina had seemed too far away to worry about things were different now men from the united states had spent a couple of years doing their level best to kill him he knew hed survived the war at least as much by luck as because he made a good soldier then when the fighting finally ended the men from the united states had taken away his rifle as if he and his country had no more right to defend themselves was he supposed to love the usa after that not likely well all be in step together quinn said were marching into the future side by side one country one partyall together on to victory one country one party not so long ago in this very room carlos had asked what would happen when the freedom party lost an election after gaining power robert quinn had thought that was very funny hipolito hadnt understood why not at the time now now maybe he did їhay otro mбs quinn asked nobody said anything quinn nodded brisklyan englishspeakers nod all right if there is no other business amigos this meeting is adjourned hasta luego stars shone down brightly when rodriguez and the other freedom party men left party headquarters the wind blew off the mountains to the northeast it was as chilly a wind as baroyeca ever knew though up in texas during the war rodriguez had discovered things about winter hed never wanted to know he wished hed brought along a poncho the walk back to the farm would be less than delightful of course the walking itself would help keep him warm some of the freedom party men headed for la culebra verde from which light and the sounds of a guitar and raucous singing emerged come on amigo carlos ruiz called one wont hurt you or even two or three too much work tomorrow rodriguez said his friends laughed at him they probably thought that while a beer or a tequila or even two or three wouldnt hurt him magdalena would and though he had no intention of admitting it to them they were probably right cincinnatus driver pulled over to the curb hopped out of his elderly ford truck with the motor still running and trotted to the corner to buy a copy of the des moines heraldexpress from the deafmute selling them there the fellow tipped his cap and smiled as cincinnatus gave him a nickel and smiled wider when the negro hurried back to the truck without waiting for his change he flipped the paper open to the inside pages and read whenever he had to stop for a sign or a traffic cop or one of the red lights that had sprung up like toadstools the past few years the stories that concerned him most didnt make it to the front page that was full of the antius riots convulsing houston the united state carved from west texas at the end of the great war what cincinnatus wanted to know more about werent worldshaking events and they didnt have anything directly to do with des moines either sometimes several days would go by without one of the stories that worried him turning up today though he found one the headlineit wasnt a big headline not on page fiveread party of negroes turned back at border the story told how the blacksmen women and children it saidhad tried to cross from confederate tennessee into us kentucky and how border patrol and national guard units had forced them to go back into the csa they claimed intolerable persecution in their own country the reporter wrote but as their entrance into the united states would have been both illegal and undesirable the officers of the border patrol rejected their pleas as is longstanding us policy hed made plenty of deliveries to the heraldexpress if hed had that reporter in front of him he would have punched the mana white man of courseright in the nose he came down on the clutch so clumsily he stalled his truck and had to fire it up again that made him realize how furious he was he hadnt done anything like that since he was learning how to drive back before the great war but as he rolled north toward the railroad yards he realized he shouldnt be mad at the reporter alone the fellow hadnt done anything but clearly state what us government policy was and always had been back when the border between the usa and the csa ran along the ohio river us patrols had shot negroes who were trying to flee to the united states while they were in the water the usa had only a handful of blacks and wanted no more a lot of people here would have been happier without the ones they already had cincinnatus laughter had a sour edge they was stuck with me and the ones like me on account of they couldnt no way get kentucky without us he said he was glad to live under us rather than cs rule especially now that the freedom party called the shots down in the confederacy the race riots sweeping through the csa were the main reason negroes were trying to get out of course jews had run away from russian pogroms to the usa irishmen had escaped famines and english landlords germans had fled a failed revolution poles and italians and frenchmen had done their best to get away from hunger and poverty theyd all found places in the united states negroes from the confederate states men and women who had desperately urgent reasons to leave their homes who already spoke english and who were ready to work like the slaves their parents and grandparents and some of them as youths had been could they make homes for themselves here no he supposed he should have been glad us military authorities hadnt chased negroes south into confederate territory as they advanced during the war for a moment he wondered why they hadnt but he could see reasons the confederates could have got good use from the labor of colored refugees and if anything could have made negroes loyal to the csa getting thrown out of the usa would have been it us officials for a wonder had been smart enough to figure that out and so it hadnt happened here were the railroad yards a warren of tracks and switches and trains and fragments of trains scattered here and there over them apparentlybut not reallyat random a couple of railroad dicks billy clubs in their hands pistols on their hips recognized cincinnatus and his truck and waved him forward mornin lou mornin steve he called to them they waved again hed been coming here a long time now as he bumped over railroad crossings toward a train he watched the two dicks in his rearview mirror they were chasing a ragged white man whod been riding the rails and was either switching trains or getting off for good cincinnatus would have bet the fellow was bound for somewhere else probably somewhere out west not many folks wanted to stay in des moines even if this poor bastard had had that in mind he wouldnt by the time steve and lou got through with him there stood the conductor as important a man on a freight train as the supercargo was on a steamboat cincinnatus hit the brakes jumped out of his truck and ran over to the man with the clipboard in his hand aint seen you in a while mr navin he said touching the brim of his soft cloth cap what you got for me to haul today hello cincinnatus wesley navin said cincinnatus wondered how many conductors came through des monies however many it was he knew just about all of them by now they knew him too they knew how reliable he was only a handful of them refused to give him business because he was colored navin wasnt one of those he pointed down the train to a couple of boxcars how you fixed for blankets and padding ive got a shipment of flowerpots here should be enough for this town for about the next hundred years got me plenty cincinnatus answered how many stops i got to make on this here run let me have a look here navin consulted the allimportant clipboard six where they at cincinnatus asked the conductor read off the addresses cincinnatus spread his hands pale palms up you runnin me all over creation i got to ask four dollars oughta say fivei might not make it back here to git me another load today pay you three and a quarter navin said my mama didnt raise no fools cincinnatus said i get my ass over to the riverside i get honest pay for honest work there youre the blackest damn jew i ever seen navin said cincinnatus only grinned that wasnt the first time people had said such things about him still grumbling the conductor said well hell threefifty since its you dont do me no favors like that cincinnatus told him i aint goin nowhere till i dont lose money on the way and you aint got there yet they settled at a few years earlier that wouldnt have been enough to keep cincinnatus in the black but he was more efficient now than he had beenand prices on everything had come down since money got so tight he loaded what seemed like nine million flowerpots into the back of the ford using ratty old blankets to keep one stack from bumping another anything he broke of course he was stuck with he winced every time the truck jounced over a pothole hed done a little thinking before leaving the railroad yard with the flowerpots the couple of minutes he spent probably saved him an hour of travel time for he worked out the best route to take to get to all six nurseries and department stores that was part of what being efficient was all about it let him get back to the railroad yard just past two in the afternoon plenty of time to get more cargo and deliver it before sundown with the sun setting as he finished the second load he drove home parking the truck in front of his apartment building when he walked into the apartment his daughter amanda was doing homework at the kitchen table while elizabeth his wife fried ham steaks in a big iron spider on the stove cincinnatus gave elizabeth a quick kiss then said wheres achilles at he in his room she shook her head she was cooking in the maids clothes shed worn to work he blew in a little before you got home stayed just long enough to change his clothes and then he done blew out again she said whyd he bother changin cincinnatus asked what he does he dont need to thanks not least to cincinnatus insistencesometimes delivered with a twobyfourhis son had earned his highschool diploma then hed amazed everyoneincluding very likely himselfby landing a clerks job at an insurance company he wasnt likely to work up much of a sweat filing papers or adding up columns of numbers but elizabeth said why you think he takin grace out to the movin pictures again oh cincinnatus didnt know how to go on from there grace chang lived in the apartment right upstairs from his own her father ran a laundry and brewed excellent beer a very handy talent in a state as thoroughly dry as iowa cincinnatus couldnt deny that grace was a sweet girl or that she was a pretty girl no one at all could deny that she was a chinese girl shed been going out with achilles for more than a year now it made cincinnatus acutely nervous these werent the confederate states and grace wasnt white but even so having the two of them go out together also made mr chang nervous he liked achilles well enoughhed known him since he was a little boybut there was no denying achilles wasnt chinese aint nothin good gonna come o this cincinnatus said heavily elizabeth didnt answer right away she flipped the ham steaks over with a longhandled spatula never can tell she said when they were sizzling again no never can tell mebbe grandkids come o this do jesus cincinnatus exclaimed you reckon he wants to marry her his wife used the spatula on a mess of potatoes frying in a smaller pan then she said dont reckon he go with a gal for moren a year unless he thinkin bout that dont reckon she go with him unless she thinkin bout it too what do we do he ends up marryin the chinamans daughter cincinnatus asked elizabeth turned more potatoes before answering upstairs right about now i reckon mr chang sayin to his missus what we do they git married her effort to reproduce a singsong chinese accent was one of the funnier things cincinnatus had heard lately but that bad accent wasnt the only reason he started laughing even though achilles and grace had been going out for more than a year nobody outside their families had said a word to either one of them about their choice of partner it was as if white des moinesthe vast majority of the town couldnt get excited about what either a negro or a chinese did so long as it didnt involve any whites supper was fine cincinnatus wanted to stay up and wait for achilles but the day hed put in caught up with him he went to bed where he dreamt he was trying to sneak into the usa in his truck so he could take grace chang to the moving pictures but people kept throwing flowerpots at him so he couldnt get in a snore came from behind achilles door when cincinnatus got up his son didnt have to be at the office till nine oclock so he got to sleep late that meant cincinnatus had to head out before achilles got up it also meant cincinnatus couldnt talk to him about grace he had told achilles an education would come in handy all sorts of ways now to his chagrin he discovered just how right he was lucien galtier got into his motorcar for the drive up to riviиreduloup the chevrolet started when galtier turned the key one thing any quebecois with an auto soon learned was the importance of keeping the battery strongly charged in winterand up there by the st lawrence winter lasted a long time here we go galtier said he was a small trim man whod just turned sixty he looked ita life outdoors had left his skin wrinkled and leathery but he was still vigorous his hair no lighter than iron gray when he drove a wagon up into town hed had endless philosophical discussions with the horse the motorcar made a less satisfying partner for such things than the horse had but enjoyed certain advantages the beast lacked no horse yet had ever come with a heater the highway was a black asphalt line scribed on the whiteness of fresh snow by now with so many years of weathering behind them the shell holes from the great war were hard to spy with snow on the ground oh here and there a pockmark gave a clue but little by little the earth was healing itself healing however was not the same as healed every so often the cycle of freeze and thaw brought to the surface longburied shells often rotten with corrosion demolition experts in the bluegray uniforms of the republic of quebec disposed of most of those the spring before though henri beauchamp had found one with his plow while tilling the ground his son jeanmarie now had that farm a couple of miles from galtiers and there hadnt been enough left of poor luckless henri to bury lucien didnt know what to do about that danger if he didnt plow he wouldnt eat riviиreduloup sat on the bluffs from which the river that gave it its name plunged down into the st lawrence it was a market town a river port and a railroad stop it was the biggest town galtier had ever seen except for a few brief visits to toronto while he was in the canadian army more than forty years before how it measured up in the larger scheme of things he really didnt know he really didnt care either at his age he wasnt going anywhere else on this crisp chilly sunday morning riviиreduloup seemed even larger than it was plenty of farm families from the countryside had come in to hear mass at the eglise saintpatrice on rue lafontaine as he usually did galtier parked on a side street and walked to the church more and more motorcars clogged riviиreduloups narrow streets which had been built before anyone thought of motorcars on sunday mornings a lot of horsedrawn wagons kept them company seeing a wagon much like the one hed driven threw lucien into a fit of nostalgia he came to the church at the same time as his oldest daughter nicole her husband dr leonard odoull and their son lucien whose size astonished his grandfather every time he saw his namesake what is it that you feed this one he demanded of the boys parents leonard odoull looked puzzled you mean were supposed to feed him he said i knew wed been forgetting something he spoke very good quebecois french his american accent and his parisian accent had both faded in the seventeen years since hed been married to nicole how are you mon pиre nicole asked pas pire he answered which like the english not bad would do for everything between agony and ecstasy hed known his share of agony a few years before when his wife died ecstasy getting new grandchildren came as close as anything he was likely to find at his age pointing nicole said theres charles at the same time as her husband said theres georges galtier waved to his older and younger sons and their families in turn his second daughter denise and her husband and children came up as he was greeting his sons maybe his other two girls were already in church or maybe they hadnt come into town this sunday come on georges who would always take the bull by the horns led the way in the world had better look out because here come the galtiers he towered over both lucien and charles who took after his father with georges in the lead maybe the world did need to look out for the galtiers they werent the only large clan going into the church quebecois ran to lots of children and to close family ties so plenty of brothers and sisters and cousins paraded in as units for their friends and neighbors to admire filling a couple of rows of pews was by no means an unusual accomplishment bishop guillaume presided over mass no breath of scandal attached itself to him as it had to his predecessor in the see bishop pascal pascal had been no doubt still waspink and plump and clever hed been too quick by half to attach himself to the americans during the war galtier still thought hed used their influence to get riviиreduloup named an episcopal seeand that hed done it more for himself than for the town hed left the bishopricand riviиreduloupin something of a blaze of glory when his lady friend presented him with twins galtier found it highly unlikely that bishop guillaume would ever father twins he was well up into his sixties and ugly as a mud fence he had a wart on his chin and another on his nose his eyes pouched below were those of a mournful hound his ears made people think of an auto going down the street with its doors open he was a good man lucien didnt doubt that a bit who would give him the chance to be bad he was also a pious man lucien didnt doubt that either where hed always wondered about bishop pascaland evidently had excellent good reason to wonder guillaume preached sermons that were thoughtful scriptural well organized and just a little dull after this one and after receiving holy communion lucien said sermons are the one thing i miss about pascal youd always get something worth hearing from him it might not have anything to do with the church but it was always interesting pascals favorite subject was always pascal georges said leonard odoull raised an eyebrow his long fair face marked him as someone out of the ordinary in this crowd of dark gallic quebecois and how is he so different from you then he asked mildly georges brother and sisters laughed lucien chuckled as for georges well nothing fazed georges how is he different from me he echoed dont be silly my dear brotherinlaw my favorite subject was never pascal his family or those among them old enough to understand the joke groaned in unison someone must have dropped you on your head when you were a baby lucien said otherwise how could you have turned out the way you are whats this you say georges asked in mock astonishment dont you think i take after you that was absurd enough to draw another round of groans from his kin charles who really did resemble lucien in temperament as well as looks said you should count yourself lucky papa didnt take after youwith a hatchet incorrigible georges did an impersonation of a chicken after it met the hatchet and before it decided it was dead and lay still he staggered all over the sidewalk scattering relativesand a few neighborsin his wake he managed to run into charles twice which surprised lucien very little when they were younger charles had dominated his brother till georges grew too big for him to get away with it any more georges had been getting even ever since come back to my house everyone dr odoull urged as he did on most sundays we can eat and drink and talk and the children can take turns getting in trouble so can the grownups nicole said with a sidelong look at georges odoull was doing well for himself he was probably the most popular doctor in riviиreduloup he had a goodsized house but it could have been as big as the fraser manorthe biggest house in town by a long shotand still seemed crowded when galtiers filled it lucien found himself with a glass of whiskey in his hand he stared at it in mild wonder he was much more used to drinking beer or locally made applejack that didnt bother with tedious government formalities about taxes he sipped hed had applejack that was stronger hed had applejack where if you breathed towards an open flame after a swig your lungs would catch fire he sipped again what gives it that flavor it comes from the charred barrels they use to age the whiskey his soninlaw answered so we are drinking burnt wood galtier said so we are leonard odoull agreed he sipped his own whiskey with appreciation tasty nestce pas i dont know lucien took another sip fire ran down his throat it will make a man drunk certainement but if i have a choice between drinking something that tastes of apples and something that tastes of burnt wood i know which i would choose most of the time if you want it i have some real calvados not the bootleg hooch you pour down odoull said maybe later galtier replied i did tell you most of the time for now for a change the whiskey is fine he took another sip smacking his lips thoughtfully he said i wonder how people came to savor the taste of burnt wood in the first place dr odoull said i dont know for certain but i can guess once you distill whiskey you have to put it somewhere unless you drink it right away where do you put it in a barrel especially back in the days before glass was cheap or easy to come by and sometimes peutкtre it stayed in the barrel long enough to take on the taste of the wood before anyone drank it if someone decided he liked it when it tasted that way the flavor would have been easy enough to make on purpose i dont know this is true mind you but i think it makes pretty good sense and you mon beaupиre what do you think i think you have reasonit does make good sense i think you think like a man born of french blood galtier could find no higher praise most americans from what hed seen were chronically woolly thinkers not his soninlaw leonard odoull came straight to the point he also recognized what a compliment galtier had paid him you do me too much honor he murmured lucien shook his head oh but you do dr odoull insisted i am more lucky than i can say to have lived so long among you wonderful quebecois who actuallywhen you feel like itrespect the power of rational thought you phrase that oddly lucien said maybe the whiskey made him notice fine shades of meaning he might otherwise have missed why would you not live among us for the rest of your days i would like nothing better leonard odoull replied but a man does not always get what he would like what would keep you from having this galtier asked the state of the world odoull answered sadly nothing here mon beaupиre i love riviиreduloup i love the people hereand not just you mad galtiers but it could beand i fear it may bethat one day there will again be places that need doctors much much more than riviиreduloup what do you lucien galtier broke off he knew perfectly well how the american had come to town hed been one of the doctors working at the military hospital theyd built during the great war thinking of that galtier gulped his whiskey down very fast and held out his glass for a refill hurry up with that coffee here the confederate drawl set nellie jacobs teeth on edge her coffeehouse had had plenty of confederate customers ever since the days of the great war even now with much of northern virginia annexed to the usa the border wasnt far to the south and confederates were always coming to washington for one reason or another occupation during the war business now im coming sir she said and grabbed the pot off the stove her hip twinged as she carried the coffeepot to the customers table sixty soon she thought on long afternoons like this one she felt the weight of all her years thank you kindly he said when shed poured she wondered if he would tell her hed been a regular at the coffeehouse during the war she didnt recognize him but how much did that prove a man could easily lose his hair and gain a belly in twenty years she wasnt the same as shed been in either her hair was gray her long face wrinkled the flesh under her chin flabby men didnt look at her any more not that way to her that was a relief the confederate sipped his coffee then remarked quiet around here times are hard nellie said if this drummer or whatever he was couldnt see that for himself he was a bigger fool than she thoughtwhich would have taken some doing yes times are hard he said and slammed his hand down on the tabletop hard enough to make her jump some coffee sloshed out of the cup and into the saucer on which it sat so why the dickens arent you people doing anything about it nobody seems to know what to dohere or anywhere else nellie let a little sharpness come into her voice its not like the collapse only happened in the united states youve got troubles of your own buddy dont get too sniffy about ours the confederate nodded conceding the point he lit a cigar when he did nellie took out a cigarette and put it in her mouth she smoked only when her customers did he struck another match and lit it for her as she nodded too in thanks he said but youall dont even look like youre trying up here down in my countryhis chest swelled with pride till it almost stuck out farther than his gutsince the freedom party took over weve got jobs for people who were out of work theyre building roads and fences and factories and digging canals and i dont know what all and pretty soon theyll start taming the rivers that give us so much trouble wait a minute didnt your supreme court say you couldnt do that nellie asked thats what the papers were talking about a while ago if i remember right you do the fellow said but didnt you hear president featherston on the wireless the other day cant say that i did nellie admitted the confederate states arent my country and a good thing too she thought but politeness made her ask what did he say ill tell you what he said maam what he said was he said james mcreynolds has made his decision now let him enforce it the confederate looked as proud as if hed defied the supreme court in richmond himself he went on thats what a leader does he leads and if anybody gets in his way he knocks the soandso for a loop and goes on and does what needs doing thats jake featherston for you and people are cheering too all the way from sonora to virginia nellie was cynical enough to wonder how much people were encouraged to cheer but that wasnt what really took her by surprise she said you couldnt get away with thumbing your nose at the supreme court like that here in the usa well maam im going to tell you the truth and the truth is you cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs the confederate beamed and puffed on his cigar as if hed come up with a profound and original truth he continued take the niggers for instance were still settlin with them on account of they got uppity beyond their station since they rose up during the war they got to learn where they belong and well teach em too you got to go on towards where youre headed no matter what on account of otherwise youll never get there although nellie had no particular use for colored people she said im sure i dont know what burning down peoples houses has got to do with the supreme court oh its all part of the same thing her customer said earnestly thats the truth it is he might have been talking about the holy ghost whatever you have to do you go ahead and you do that and you dont let anything stop you if you think you can be stopped youre in trouble but if you know you can win you will im not so sure about that nellie said you people were sure you were going to win the great war but you didnt you can say that if you want to the confederate answered you can say it but that doesnt make it so truth is we were stabbed in the back it hadnt been for the niggers risin up we wouldve whipped youall sure as im standing here before you thats the gospel truth like i said before they need paying back for that now theyre starting to get it serves em right if you care about what i think since nellie didnt she retreated behind the counter she hoped this noisy fellow would go away and she hoped more customers would come in so shed have an excuse to ignore him he did eventually get up and leave hed put down a dime tip on a bill of half a dollar for a sandwich and coffee so nellie forgave him his noise clara nellies daughter came home from school a few minutes later nellie stared at her in bemusement as she often did part of her wondered how clara had got to be fifteen years old a highschool freshman with a womans shape and part of her simply marveled that clara was there at all nellie had never intended to have a baby by hal jacobs she hadnt always worried about rubbers simply because shed thought she didnt need to worry about catching either that proved wrong and here was clara only a couple of years older than her nephew armstrong grimes the son of claras half sister edna hello dear nellie said what did you learn today she always asked with little book learning herself she hoped getting more would mean clara wouldnt have to work so hard as she had or have to worry about making some of the mistakes shed madeand shed made some humdingers quadratic equations in algebra clara made a horrible face diagramming sentences in english she made another one and in government how a bill becomes a law instead of a grimace a yawn then she brightened her face like hals was rounder than nellies and lit up when she smiled and walter johansen asked me if i could go to the moving pictures with him this saturday can i ma please wallys so cute nellies first impulse was to scream no all he wants to do is get your undies down as she knewoh how she knewthat was true of most men most of the time but if she made a big fuss about it she would just make clara more eager to taste forbidden fruit shed found that out raising edna and she also remembered as much from her own stormy journey into womanhood a million years beforethat was what it felt like anyhow and so instead of screaming she asked which one is walter is he the skinny blond kid with the cowlick no ma clara clucked annoyed her mother couldnt keep her friends straight thats eddie fullmer walters the football player the one with the blue blue eyes and the big dimple in his chin she sighed that sigh did almost make nellie yell no by the sound of things it was a word clara wouldnt even think about using to mr football hero but nellie made herself think twice i suppose you can go with him she said if he brings you straight back here after the film you have to promise i do i will he will oh ma youre swell clara did a pirouette skirts were long again for which nellie thanked heaven she wouldnt have wanted a girl claras age wearing them at the knee or higher the way theyd been in the s that was asking for trouble and girls between fifteen and twenty had an easy enough time finding it without asking as things were the skirt swirled out when clara turned showing off shapely calves and trim ankles do i want to be swell nellie had her doubts i wish your pa would have seen you so grownup she said that sobered clara so do i she said quietly hal jacobs had died a couple of years before of a rare disease carcinoma of the lung nellie absently lit a fresh cigarette and then had to stub it out in a hurry when a customer came in clara served him the coffee he ordered she could handle the coffeehouse at least as well as nellie and why not shed been helping out here since she was tall enough to see over the top of the stove a few minutes after the customer left edna walked into the coffeehouse her son armstrong accompanied her which he didnt usually do nellie was very fond of armstrongs father merle grimes fonder of him than shed been of any other man she could think of except perhaps hal she was positive she liked ednas husband much more than shed ever liked ednas father if he hadnt got her pregnant she wouldnt have wanted to see him again let alone marry him armstrong on the other hand yes he was her grandson yes she loved him on account of that but he was a handful no two ways about it and nellie was glad he was ednas chief worry and not her own clara reacted to armstrong the way a cat reacts to a dog that has just galumphed into its house theyd never got along not since the days when baby armstrong pulled toddler claras hair now at thirteen armstrong was as tall as she was and starting to shoot up like a weed behave yourself edna told armstrongshe did know he was a handful where some mothers remained curiously blind to such things i want to talk to your grandma i didnt do anything armstrong said yet clara put in not quite sotto enough voce thatll be enough of that clara nellie said fair was fair she gave her attention back to her older daughter whats going on edna with me edna grimes shrugged and pulled out a pack of raleighs not much im just going along one day at a time she lit the cigarette sucked in smoke and blew it out you can say what you want about the confederates ma but they make better cigarettes than we do nellie nodded that was true her daughter went on no i just want to make sure youre all right im fine nellie answered or i will be if you give me one of those edna did then leaned close so nellie could get a light from hers after a couple of drags nellie said i keep telling you im not an old lady yet edna didnt say anything nellie knew what that meant not yet but soon she drew on the cigarette again no matter how smooth the smoke was it gave scant comfort jake featherston turned to ferdinand koenig a nasty gleam of amusement sparkled in the confederate presidents eye think weve let him stew long enough ferd he asked should be about right the attorney general answered twenty minutes in the waiting room is enough to tick him off but not enough to where its an outandout insult heh jake said weve already taken care of that he thumbed the intercom on his desk all right lulu you can let chief justice mcreynolds come in now the door to the presidents private office opened featherston got only the briefest glimpse of his secretary before james mcreynolds swept into the room slamming the door behind him he wore his black robes they added authority to his entrance but he would have had plenty on his own though a few years past seventy he moved like a much younger man hed lost his hair in front which made his forehead even higher than it would have otherwise his long face was red with fury featherston he said without preamble you are a son of a bitch takes one to know one jake said equably have a seat mcreynolds shook his head no i dont even want to be in the same room with you let alone sit down with you how dare you featherston how dare you with a smile koenig said i think hes seen the new budget mr president you shut up youyou stinking party hack mcreynolds snarled im here to talk to the head goon how dare you abolish the supreme court before answering jake chose a fine habana from the humidor on his desk he made a production of clipping the end and lighting the cigar you torpedoed my river bill he said no telling how much more trouble youll make for me down the line and so he shrugged goodbye i dont fool around with people who make trouble for me mr chief justice i kill em but you cant get rid of the supreme court of the confederate states just like that mcreynolds snapped his fingers hell i cant just like that is right jake snapped his fingers too then he turned to ferdinand koenig tell him how ferd youve got all the details straight actually the lawyers who worked under the attorney general were the ones whod got everything straight but koenig could keep things straight once the lawyers had set them out for himand he had notes to help him along glancing down at them he said heres the first sentence of article three of the confederate constitution mr chief justice it says i know what article three of the constitution says god damn you james mcreynolds burst out koenig shrugged he had the whip hand and he knew it ill quote it anyway so we keep things straight like the president said it goes the judicial power of the confederate states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish yes mcreynolds stabbed out a furious finger and that means you can do whatever you please with or to the district courts but you have to keep your cottonpickin mitts off the supreme court no sir the attorney general shook his head jake featherston leaned back in his chair and blew a perfect smoke ring enjoying the show koenig went on thats not what it means and i can prove it there was no supreme court when the confederate states started out none at all in just after we finished licking the damnyankees in the war of secession jeff davis backed a bill setting up a supreme court but it didnt pass he was wrangling with congress the way he usually did and so the csa didnt get a supreme court tillhe checked his notes for the exact datetill may but we havent been without one since james mcreynolds insisted no one has ever dreamt that we could be without one its unimaginable is what it is no its not on account of i imagined it jake tapped the fine gray ash from his habana into an ashtray made out of the sawedoff base of a shell casing and what i imagine i do ever since i got into the freedom party people have said to me you dont dare do this you dont dare do that you dont dare do the other thing theyre wrong every goddamn time but they keep saying it you think youre so high and mighty in your fancy black robe you can tell me what i can do and what i cant but you better listen to me nobody tells jake featherston what to do nobody you got that mcreynolds stared at him we have congressional elections coming up this fall mr featherston the whigs and the radical liberals will make you pay for your highhandedness think so do you jakes grin was predatory he reached into his pocket pulled out a fivedollar goldpiece and let it ring sweetly off the desktop thomas jacksons bearded countenance stared up at him heres a stonewall says well have more men in the next congress than we do in this one youre on mcreynolds leaned forward and thrust out his hand featherston took it for an old man the supreme court justice had a strong grip and he squeezed as if he wished he could break featherstons fingers the people will know you and your party for what you are who do you think sent us here to do their business jake answered we set out to do it and then you seven sour bastards wouldnt let us and now youve got the nerve to blame me and the freedom party for what you went and did that law plainly violated the constitution mcreynolds said stubbornly if you violate it from now on whos going to stand up to you and call you to account that was the key question the answer of course was nobody featherston didnt say it if mcreynolds couldnt see it for himself the president didnt want to point it out to him no matter how true it was better to keep it quiet you do see though mr chief justice what were doing here is legal as can be ferdinand koenig said you may not like it but weve got the right to do it youre breaking every precedent this country knows mcreynolds thundered in the traditionminded confederate states that was an even more serious charge than it might have been in other lands youre not politicians at all youre crooks and pirates thats what you are were the folks who won the election thats what we are you forgot it and youre going to pay for it jake featherston said and the attorney general asked you a question i think youd better answer it and if i dont james mcreynolds asked with no expression at all in his voice featherston answered then youre a dead man mcreynolds started to laugh then he took a second look at the president of the confederate states the laughter died unborn the chief justices face went a blotchy yellowwhite you mean that he whispered you bet i do featherston had a in his desk drawer no one around the office would fuss if it went off and he could always persuade a doctor to say mcreynolds had died of heart failure mr mcreynolds i always mean what i say some folks dont want to believe me but i do i told you youd be sorry if you messed with our good laws and i reckon you are now ferd there asked you a question he asked if you thought getting rid of you blackrobed buzzards was legal you going to answer him or do i have to show you i mean what i say its the last lesson youll ever get and you wont have a hell of a lot of time to cipher it out the jurist licked his lips jake didnt think he was a coward but how often did a man meet someone who showed in the most matteroffact way possible that he would not only kill him but enjoy doing it jake smiled in anticipation later he thought that smile more than anything else was what broke mcreynolds spitting out the words and coming very close to spitting outright the chief justice of a court going out of business snarled yes god damn you its legal technically its also a disgrace and so are both of you he stormed from the presidents office as he opened the door though he nervously looked back over his shoulder was he wondering if jake would shoot him in the back i would if i had to jake thought not now though now mcreynolds had backed down no point to killing a man whod yielded the ones who wouldnt quitthey were the ones who needed killing koenig said now we find out how much of a stink the whigs and the rad libs kick up about this in the papers and on the wireless wont be too much thats what saul says and i expect hes right featherston answered theyre like mcreynoldstheyre starting to see bad things happen to folks who dont go along with us how many papers and wireless stations have burned down the past few months been a few the attorney general allowed funny how the cops dont have a hell of a lot of luck tracking down the boys who did it he and jake both laughed koenig raised a forefinger they did catchor they said they caughtthose fellows in new orleans too bad for the da down there that the jury wouldnt convict we had to work on that jake said harder than we should have too that long who ran for vice president on the rad lib ticket hes a firstclass bastard no two ways about it trouble and nothing else but if we hadnt beat him to the punch hedve made the whigs sweat himself now he reckons he can make us sweat instead bad mistake koenig said thoughtfully might be the last one he ever makes thats something we dont want traced back to us though featherston said all the little onesthose are what make people afraid we can use as many of them as we need thisthisd be a little too raw just now weve got to nail the lid down tighter after the elections thingsll be easierwell be able to get away with whatever we need course i dont suppose well need so much then mcreynolds thinks well lose the attorney general observed they both laughed jake couldnt think of the last time hed heard anything so funny that reminds me he said how are we doing with the politicals he already knew in broad terms but ferdinand koenig was the man with the details jails are filling up all over the country he answered several statesalabama mississippi south carolina georgiahave dragged in so many of those fuckers the jails wont hold em any more theyre building camps out in the country for the overflow thats good thats damn good jake said weve got a lot of things left to do in this country and well need people for hard work nobodys going to say boo if a bunch of prisoners go sweat all day in the hot sun eh not likely koenig who was a big blocky man contrived to make himself look not just fat but bonelessly fat render all the lard out of those porky whig bastards who never did any honest work in their lives featherston nodded emphatically you bet and getting those camps built nowll come in handy too well have plenty of uses for places like that he nodded again yes sir plenty of uses he saw a piece of paper sticking out of a pile on his desk pulled it free and grinned oh good i was afraid id lost this one idve felt like a damn fool asking the secretary of agriculture to send me another copy what is it koenig asked report on the agriculturalmachinery construction project featherston answered wont be long before weve got tractors and harvesters and combines coming out of our ears gives us practice making big motor vehicles you know he and koenig chuckled again helps farming along toodont need near so many people on the land with those machines doing most of the work the attorney general smiled a peculiar smile yeah he said iv colonel irving morrell was elbowdeep in the engine compartment of the new barrel when somebody shouted his name hang on for a second he yelled back without looking up to sergeant michael pound he said what do you think of this carburetor whoever designed it ought to be staked out in the hot sun with a trail of honey running up to his mouth for the ants to follow pound answered at once maybe another honey trail toolower down whew morrell shuddered ive got to hand it to you sergeant i may come up with nasty ideas but you have worse ones someone yelled his name again adding youre ordered to report to the base commandant immediately colonel immediately that made morrell look up from what he was doing it also made him look down at himselfin dismay he wore a mechanics greengray coveralls whose front was liberally smeared and spattered with grease hed rolled up the coveralls sleeves but that only meant his hands and forearms had got filthy instead he wiped them on a rag but that was hardly more than a token effort cant i clean up a little first he asked the messengera sergeantshook his head sir i wouldnt if i were you when brigadier general ballou said immediately he meant it its got to do with the mess down in houston sergeant pound whod kept on guddling inside the engine compartment poked his head up at that youd better go sir he said he had no business butting into morrells affairs which didnt mean he was wrong after the war the usa had made a united state out of the chunk of texas they conquered from the csa houston had always been the most reluctant of the united states even more so than kentucky and looked longingly across the border toward the country from which it had been torn since the freedom party triumphed in the confederacy houston hadnt been reluctant it had been downright insurrectionary it had a freedom party of its own which had swept local elections in and sent a congressman to philadelphia every day seemed to bring a new riot tossing the rag to the ground morrell nodded to the messenger take me to him if its got to do with houston it wont wait brigadier general charles ballou the commandant at fort leavenworth was a round little man with a round face and an oldfashioned gray kaiser bill mustache morrell saluted on coming into his office reporting as ordered sir he said i apologize for the mess im in its all right colonel ballou said i wanted you here as fast as possible and here you are i believe you know brigadier general macarthur yes sir morrell turned to the other officer in the room and saluted once more good to see you again sir its been a while so it has daniel macarthur returned the salute then sucked in smoke from a cigarette he kept in a long holder he made an odd contrast to ballou for he was very long very lean and very craggy hed commanded a division under custer during the war which was where he and morrell had come to know each other hed had a star on each shoulder even then he was only a handful of years older than morrell and had been the youngest division commander and one of the youngest general officers in the us army since then perhaps not least because he always said what he thought regardless of consequences his career hadnt flourished brigadier general ballou said macarthur has just been assigned as military commandant of houston thats right daniel macarthur thrust out a granite jaw and i want a sizable force of barrels to accompany me there nothing like armor i would say for discouraging rebels against the united states who better than yourself colonel to command such a force his voice had a certain edge to it hed tried to break through confederate lines with infantry and artillery alone hed failed repeatedly with barrels morrell had succeeded does he want me to fail now morrell wondered but he could answer only one way and he did sir i am altogether at your service i wish i had more modern barrels to place at your disposal but even the obsolete ones will serve against anything but other barrels macarthur nodded brusquely he stubbed out the cigarette then put another one in the holder and lit it just so he said how many barrels and crews can you have ready to board trains and move south by this time three days from now we are going to put the fear of the lord and of the united states army in the state of houston yes sir morrell thought for a bit then said sir i can have thirty ready in that time the limit isnt barrels its crews the modern ones need only a third as many men as the oldfashioned machines thirty will do macarthur said id expected you to say twenty or perhaps fifteen now i expect you to live up to your promise you may go colonel hed always had the sweetness and charm of an alligator snapper turtle but if you needed someone to bite off a hand he was the man for the job fuming morrell left brigadier general ballous office fuming still he had thirtytwo barrels ready to load onto flatcars at the required time daniel macarthurs cigarette and holder twitched in his mouth when he counted the machines he said not a word the trains left on time people started shooting at them as soon as they passed from kansas to sequoyah which had also belonged to the csa before the war sequoyah had been a confederate state it was not a state in the usa it was occupied territory the united states did not want it and the feeling was mutual before long morrell put men back in the barrels as the train rattled south and west they could use the machine guns to shoot back more shots came their way in the east where the five civilized tribes had dominated life in confederate times the united states werent soft on indians as the confederate states had beenespecially not on indians whod looked to richmond rather than philadelphia but bad as sequoyah was it didnt prepare anybody for houston the train was two days late getting into lubbock because of repeated sabotage to the tracks signs screamed out warnings saboteurs will be shot without trial maybe they cant read here sergeant pound suggested after one long long delay then they passed a trackside gallows with three bodies dangling from it one of the bodies had a confederate battle flag draped over it that was what morrell thought at first anyhow then he realized the colors were reversed which made it a freedom party flag not one from the csa hed seen plenty of yanks out graffiti when he was stationed up in kamloops british columbia those were as nothing next to the ones he saw as the train slowed to a stop coming into the lubbock railroad yard leave us alone was a common favorite csa was quick and easy to write so were the redwhitered stripes and the blue xs that suggested confederate flags let us go back to our country was long and so less common the same held true for houston was a traitor but the one word seemingly everywhere was freedom good lord sir sergeant pound said eyeing the graffiti with much less equanimity than hed shown rolling past the hanged houstonians what have we got ourselves into trouble morrell answered that was the only word that came to mind we will advance into downtown lubbock brigadier general macarthur declared as the barrels came down off their flatcars i have declared full martial law in this state that declaration is now being published in newspapers and broadcast over the wireless the citizens of houston are responsible for their own behavior and have been warned of this if anyone hinders your progress towards or through the city in any way shoot to kill do not allow yourselves to be endangered is that clear no one denied it daniel macarthur climbed up onto the turret of one of the modern barrels to morrells relief macarthur didnt choose his he struck a dramatic pose saying forward without words the barrels rumbled south toward central lubbock they couldnt advance at much above a walking pace because most of them were slow flatulent leftovers from the great war morrell knew the handful of modern machines could have got there in a third the time whether that would have done them any good was another question lubbock didnt look like a town that had seen rioting it looked like a town that had seen war blocks werent just burnt out they were shattered either by artillery fire or bombardment from the air the twin stenches of sour smoke and old death lingered now weaker now stronger but never absent not many people were on the streets the eyes of the ones who were in canada plenty of people had hated and resented american soldiers for occupying the country morrell had thought he was used to it but as with the graffiti what was on the faces of the people here put canada in the shade these people didnt just want him gone they didnt even just want him dead they wanted him to suffer a long time before he died if he ever fell into their hands he would too no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a shot rang out from an apartment building that hadnt been wrecked a bullet sparked off the barrel daniel macarthur was riding about a foot from his leg at the sound of the shot all the men and women on the street automatically threw themselves flat they knew what was coming and it came half a dozen barrels opened fire on that building the old ones with their sidemounted machine guns the new with turret cannon and coaxial machine guns windows vanished so did a couple of big stretches of brick wall between the windows as cannon shells struck home glass and fragments of brick flew in all directions people on the street crawled out of the way they knew better than to get up and expose themselves to the gunfire through it all daniel macarthur never moved a muscle he had nerve and he had style based on what morrell remembered from the great war none of that surprised him did macarthur have brains morrell wasnt so sure there only after the front of the apartment building was wrecked did the brigadier general wave the barrels forward once more they make a desert and they call it peace morrell thought but no one fired any more shots before the armored detachment reached its perimeter in the center of town once they got there macarthur summoned reporters from the gazette and the statesman the two local newspapers he said gentlemen here is something your readers need to know if they interfere with the us army or disobey military authority they will end up dead and having died they will be buried in the soil of the united states for they cannot and will not detach this state from this country all they can do is spill their own blood to no purpose take that back to your plants and print it they did the same message went out over the wireless and in the papers in el paso and other towns in houston contingents of morrells barrels along with infantrymen and state police reinforced it the rioting eased morrell was as pleased as he was surprised maybe brigadier general macarthur was pretty smart after all or maybe someone on the other side of the border had decided the rioting should ease for the time being morrell wished like hell that hadnt occurred to him miguel and jorge rodriguez stood side by side in the farmhouse kitchen they both looked very proud they wore identical broadbrimmed cloth hats shortsleeved cotton shirts sturdy denim shorts socks and stout shoes they also wore identical proud smiles hats shirts and shorts were of the light brown color the confederate army for no reason hipolito rodriguez had ever been able to understand called butternut on the pocket above the left breast of each shirt was sewn a confederate battle flag with colors reversed the emblem of the freedom party i will miss your work rodriguez told his two older sons i will miss it but the country needs it thats right father jorge said and theyll pay us moneynot a lot of money but someto do the work ill help you father pedrothe youngest sonsaid he wasnt old enough to join the freedom youth corps yet and had been sickjealous of his brothers ever since they did being useful on the farm wasnt much consolation but it was what he had and he made the most of it i know you will rodriguez set a hand on his shoulder youre a good boy all of you are good boys sн his wife said she probably hadnt followed the whole conversation most of which was in english but she got that in spanish she went on ill miss you while you are gone the tears in her eyes spoke a universal language father was right miguel said importantly the country does need us so you shouldnt cry well do big things for sonora big things for baroyeca i hearhis voice dropped to an excited whisperi hear we are going to put in the poles to carry the wires to bring electricity down from buenavista electricity instead of being impressed magdalena rodriguez was practical we already have poles to bring the telegraph why not use those miguel and jorge looked at each other plainly neither one of them knew the answer just as plainly neither one wanted to admit it at last jorge said because these poles are special mother he might not even have noticed switching back to spanish to talk to magdalena come on boys hipolito said lets go into town his sons had grumbled that they were almost grown men that they were going off to do mens work and that they didnt need their father escorting them to baroyeca hed explained he was proud of them and wanted to show them off hed also explained he would wallop them if they grumbled any more theyd stopped before they left he made sure his own freedom party pin was on his shirt they trooped out of the farmhouse together neither the crow that fluttered up from the roof nor the two lizards that scuttled into a hole seemed much impressed before long rodriguezs sons were less delighted too my feet hurt miguel complained jorge nodded this happened to me when i went into the army rodriguez said shoes pinch up till then i hadnt worn anything but sandals he looked down at his feet he wore sandals now they were more comfortable than shoes any day but comfort wasnt always the only question for some of what you do for working in the mountains sandals wont protect your feet good shoes like those will theyll give us blisters jorge said now miguel was the one who nodded in agreement for a little while yes rodriguez answered then your feet will toughen up and youll be fine he could afford to say that his feet werent the ones suffering when they came to baroyecajorge limping a little and trying not to show it for his shoes pinched tighter than miguelsrodriguez led them to the town square between the alcaldes house and the church as hed been instructed to do there he found most of the boys in the area all standing solemnly in ranks that werent so neat as they should have been one of the new members of the guardнa civil a man whod been a sergeant during the war was in charge of them ўlibertad hipolito he called these are your boys my older ones felipe rodriguez answered ўlibertad theyll do fine felipe rojas said they wont have too much nonsense to knock out of them some of these little brats he shook his head well you can guess which ones a lot of them will be ones whose fathers dont belong to the party rodriguez predicted felipe rojas nodded rodriguez eyed the youths he couldnt tell by the uniforms those were all the same but the stance gave away who was who a lot of the time that and whether a boy looked eager or frightened the bell in the church struck nine rodriguez let out a sigh of relief hed been told to get here before the hour he hadnt realized hed cut it so close a few minutes later another boy tried to join the ranks in the square rojas ran him off shouting you dont deserve to be here you cant even obey orders about when to come youre a disgrace to your uniform get out get out but seсor protested his father who was not a party man no rojas said he had his orders he disobeyed them you helped no doubt but anyone who doesnt understand from the start that the freedom youth corps is about obedience and discipline doesnt deserve to be in it get him out of here and you can go to the devil with him the boy slunk away his face a mask of misery his father followed hands clenched into impotent fists he was not the least important man in baroyeca but hed been treated as if he were robert quinn came into the square pushing a wheelbarrow full of shovels hello boys he said ўlibertad ўlibertad they echoed raggedly some of them were still looking after the youngster whod been sent away these are your spades quinn said in his accented but fluent spanish you will have the privilege of using them to make sonora a better place most of them smiled at that liking the idea these are your spades felipe rojas echoed you will have the privilege of taking care of them of keeping them sharp of keeping them shiny of keeping their handles polished you will take them everywhere you go in the freedom youth corps you will sleep with them por dios and you will enjoy sleeping with them more than you would with a woman do you hear me do you hear me answer when i talk to you sн seсor they chorused in alarm now hipolito rodriguez smiled and he wasnt the only man his age who did rojas rant sounded much like what sergeants had said at the training camp during the war except theyd been talking about rifles not spades rojas took a shovel from the wagon and tossed it iron blade up to the closest youth the boy awkwardly caught it another shovel flew and another till every boy had one attention rojas shouted they came to what they imagined attention to be there were as many versions as there were boys rodriguez smiled again so did the rest of the fathers and other men in the square theyd been through the mill they knew what attention was even if their sons didnt felipe rojas took a shovel from a youngster and showed the boys of the freedom youth corps how to stand at attention the tool lightly gripped in his right hand more or less clumsily the boys imitated him he tossed the shovel back to the youth who also came to attention another sharp command all of these were in english shoulderspades again the boys made a hash of it one of them almost brained the youngster beside him hipolito rodriguez didnt laugh at that he remembered what a deadly weapon an entrenching tool could be again rojas took the shovel from the boy he stood at attention with it then smoothly brought it up over his shoulder after demonstrating once more he returned it now you try he told the youths shoulderspades they did their best rojas winced that was terrible he said ive seen burros that could do a better job but youll improve well practice it till your right shoulders grow calluses youll find out his voice like the voice of any proper drill sergeant making a promise like that was full of gloating anticipation he showed them left face right face and aboutface he marched them raggedly across the square no one hit anyone else with a shovel as they turned and countermarched why nobody hit anybody else rodriguez couldnt have said he thought he ought to go light a candle in the church to show his gratitude to the virgin for the miracle i have one last piece of advice for you felipe rojas said when the boys had got to their starting place without casualties here it is youve been fooling your fathers and talking back to your mothers ever since you found out you could get away with it dont try it with me or with any other freedom youth corps man youll be sorry if you do you have no idea how sorry youll be but some of you will find out boys your age are damn fools well get rid of some of that though you see if we dont some of themmost of themdidnt believe him no boys of that age believed they were fools they thought they knew everything there was to knowcertainly more than the idiot fathers they had the misfortune to be saddled with theyd find out and in the freedom youth corps they wouldnt have to bang heads with their fathers while they were finding out that might make the corps worthwhile all by itself robert quinn drifted over to rodriguez two boys going in eh seсor good for you and good for them theyre likelylooking young men they arent young men yet rodriguez said they just think they are thats why the freedom youth corps will be good for them i think i think you are right seсor rodriguez the freedom party organizer said this will teach them many of the things they will need to know if for example they are called into the army rodriguez looked at the englishspeaker whod come from the north how can they be called into the army seсor quinn there has been no conscription in los estados confederados since the end of the great war this is true quinn said still the freedom party aims to change many things we want the country strong again if we are not allowed to call up our own young men to serve the colors are we strong or are we weak weak seсor without a doubt hipolito rodriguez replied but los estados unidos are strong now what will they do if we begin conscription once more this is not for you to worry about it is not for me to worry about either quinn said it is for jake featherston to take care of and he will seсor rodriguez you may rely on that he spoke as certainly as the priests did of resurrection and rodriguez said oh i do he meant it too like so many others in the csa he wouldnt have joined the freedom party if he hadnt well well colonel abner dowling said studying the salt lake city bee who would have thought it captain whats that sir angelo toricelli asked dowling tapped the story on page three with his fingernail the riots in houston he told his adjutant they just go on and on now up now down world without end amen he was not a man immune to the pleasure of watching someone else struggle through a tough time serving under general george custer hed had plenty of tough times of his own hed come to savor those that happened to other people not least because they sometimes ended up getting him off the hook captain toricelli said of course they go on and on the freedom party in the csa keeps stirring things up there if we could seal off the border between houston and texas wed be able to put a lid on things there i wish that were true but i dont think it is dowling said toricelli looked miffed dowling remembered looking miffed plenty of times when general custer said something particularly idiotic now the shoe was on the other foot hed been stuck then his adjutant was now and he didnt think he was being an idiot he explained why the way things are these days captain dont you believe the confederates could pull strings just as well by wireless pretty hard to smuggle rifles in by wireless toricelli remarked if not from texas houston could get them from chihuahua dowling said to stop the traffic wed really need to seal our whole border with the confederate states id love to but dont hold your breath theres too much land and not enough people to cover it i wish things were different but i dont think they are toricelli pondered that at last reluctantly he nodded i suppose youre right sir he said with a sigh if we cant seal off utah we probably wont be able to seal off houston either that stung dowling wished the usa would have been able to keep contraband out of the state where he was stationed while he was at it he wished for the moon the mormons had their caches of rifles the reason they didnt use them was simple enough soldiers held down utah to make any uprising a slaughter even the locals understood that however much they hated the us army they knew what it could do may i see the story sir captain toricelli asked and dowling passed him the bee he zipped through he read very fast when he was done he looked up and said theyve got plenty of barrels down there and it sounds like theyre doing a good job i wish we had some dowlings experience with barrels during the great war had not been altogether happy wanting to mass them against war department orders custer had had him falsify reports that went in to philadelphia custer had succeeded and made himself into a hero and dowling into a heros adjutant custer had never thought about the price of failure dowling had if things had gone wrong theyd have been courtmartialed side by side maybe not thinking about the price of failure was what marked a hero on the other hand maybe it just marked a damn fool still despite dowlings mixed feelings about barrels toricelli had a point we could use some here dowling admitted ill take it up with philadelphia i wonder if they have any to spare or if theyre using them all in houston theyd better not be his adjutant exclaimed that didnt mean they werent and both dowling and toricelli knew it that afternoon heber young came to call on the commandant of salt lake city the unofficial head of the proscribed mormon church looked grave colonel have you provocateurs among the believers of this state he asked not naming the faith to which he couldnt legally belong i have agents among them certainly id be derelict in my duty if i didnt dowling replied but provocateurs no sir why do you ask because certain individuals have been urging a more assertive course on us in our efforts to regain our freedom of conscience young picked his words with enormous and obvious care it occurred to me that if we become more assertive the occupying authorities might use that as justification for more oppression if we get out of line even a little youll squash us that was what he meant being a scrupulously polite man he didnt quite come out and say it abner dowlings jowls wobbled as he shook his head no sir i give you my word of honor i have not done any such thing my desireand it is also my governments desireis for peace and quiet in the state of utah i do not wish to do anythinganything at allto disturb what peace and quiet we already have heber young eyed him i believe i believe you he said at last and dowling couldnt help smiling at the scrupulous precision of his phrasing young continued one way to insure peace and quiet of course would be to grant us the liberties the citizens of the rest of the united states enjoy there are certain difficulties involved with that you know dowling said your peoples conduct during the second mexican war the mormon revolt of the assassination of general pershing how long do you suppose it would be mr young before utah made houston seem a walk in the park by comparison i recognize the possibility colonel young replied which was as much as hed ever admitted but if you do not grant us our due liberties would you not agree we will always be vulnerable to provocateurs and i will take the liberty of asking you one other question before i go if these men are not yours who does give them their orders for i am quite sure someone does good day he got to his feet set his somber homburg on his head and departed had young been any other mormon dowling would have called him back and demanded to know more dowling would have felt no compunctions about squeezing him if hed denied knowing more either but heber young no his goodwill was too strong a word his tolerance toward the occupiers went a long way toward keeping the lid on utah dowling didnt want to squander it and so young left occupation headquarters in salt lake city undisturbed but the question hed asked before leaving lingered and it disturbed colonel dowling more than a little he hadnt been lying to young when he said he had agents among the mormons the best of them a man almost completely invisible was a dusty little bookkeeper named winthrop w webb he seemed to know everything in the mormon community sometimes before it happened if a rumor or an answer was floating in the air he would find it and contrive to get it back to dowling getting hold of him necessarily was a roundabout business setting up a meeting was even more roundabout were webb to be seen with dowling his usefulnessto say nothing of his life expectancywould plummet in due course dowling paid a discreet visit to a sporting house to which he was in the occasional habit of paying a discreet visit waiting for him in one of the upstairs bedrooms instead of a perfumed blonde in frills and lace was dusty little winthrop w webb after they shook hands dowling sighed the sacrifices i make for my country dont worry colonel webb said with a small smile itll be betty again next time yes i suppose dowling broke off how the devil did webb know who his favorite was better not to ask maybe maybe profoundly uneasy dowling told the spy what hed heard from heber young winthrop webb nodded yes i know the people hes talking about know of them i should say theyre good at standing up at gatherings and popping off and even better at disappearing afterwards hes right somebodys backing them i dont know who no hard evidence like i say theyre good any guesses dowling asked im here to tell you the truthi really dont know webb answered deadpan for a moment dowling took him literally then he snorted and scowled and pointed south you think the confederates are behind them who gets helped if utah goes up in smoke the agent said thats what i asked myself if its not jake featherston ill be damned if i know who it is you think these mormon hotheads heber young was talking about are getting their orders from richmond then dowling leaned forward in excitement if they areif we can show they are and make it stickthatll make the president and the war department move ha says i winthrop webb told him everybody knows the freedom partys turned up the heat in houston and are we doing anything about it not that i can see houstons different though dowling had played devils advocate for custer many times now he was doing it for himself it used to be part of texas part of confederate territory you can see why the csa would think it still belongs to them and want it back same with kentucky and sequoyah especially for the redskins in sequoyah you may not like it but you can see it it makes sense but the confederates have no business meddling in utah none zero zip utahs always belonged to the usa not the way the mormons tell it webb said dryly but anyway its not that simple these people who speak up and start trouble they arent from richmond they dont go back to some dingy sportinghouse roomhe winkedand report to somebody from richmond whoevers behind this knows what hes doing there are lots of links in the chain the hotheads hell half of them never even heard of the goddamn confederate states of america dowling laughed not that it was funny all right i see what youre saying what can we do then if we cant prove the confederates are back of these fools he drummed his fingers on his thigh not like there isnt a new hothead born every minute here maybe more often than thatmormons have big families they arent supposed to drink they arent supposed to smoke they arent even supposed to have coffee what the hell else have they got to do but screw winthrop w webb said which jerked more startled laughter from dowling the spy went on i dont know what we can do except hold the lid down tight and hope the bastards on the other side make a mistake sooner or later everybody does mm dowling didnt much care for that but no better ideas occurred to him either and then as he was getting up to leave one did ill warn heber young some of the hotheadsprovocateurs he called themare liable to be confederate sympathizers you think hell believe you webb asked real curiosity in his voice or will he just think youre looking for another excuse to sit on that church of hisyou know the one that officially doesnt exist i dont know abner dowling admitted after a pause he and young had a certain mutual respect he thought he could rely on youngs honesty but did the mormon leader feel the same about him or was he in youngs eyes just the local head of the government that had spent the past fifty years and more oppressing utah ive got to try though any which way when he went downstairs the madam smiled as if hed spent his time with betty why not hed paid her as if he had the girls in the parlor looked up from their hands of poker and bridge and fluttered their fingers at him as he left but hed never gone out the door of the sporting house less satisfied everything in the white part of augusta georgia seemed normal autos and trucks chugged along the streets a sign painter was putting a big sale sign in a shoe stores front window a man came out of a saloon took two steps and then turned around and went back in a workman with a bucket of cement carefully smoothed a square of sidewalk none of the white people on the sidewalkor those who dodged into the street for a moment to avoid the wet cementpaid scipio or the other negroes among them any special attention the riots that had leveled half the terry were over and the whites had put them out of their minds scipio wished he could his family was still sleeping in a church and he knew how lucky he was he still had a family nobodyd been killed nobodyd been worse than scratched theyd even got their money out of the apartment before the building burned luck scipio walked past a wall plastered with election posters snow for congress they said vote freedom still four months to november but ed snows posters featuring his plump smiling face and a freedom party flag were everywhere a few whig posters had gone up at about the same time theyd come right down again too no new ones had gone up to take their place scipio had never seen any radical liberal posters this year maybe nobody from the rad libs wanted to run against the freedom party maybe nobody dared run against it a cop coming down the street gave scipio a hard stare you nigger he snapped let me see your passbook yes suh scipio handed it over for a while after the end of the great war nobodyd much worried about whether a black man had a passbook things had tightened up again before too long though and theyd got even worse after jake featherston won the presidency the cop made sure scipios photo matched his face xerxes he made a mess of the alias but scipio didnt presume to correct him he looked scipio up and down why the hell you wearin that damn penguin suit boy when the weathers like this his own gray uniform had darker gray sweat stains under the arms and at the collar suh i waits tables at de huntsmans lodge scipio answered getting called boy by a man half his age rankled too he didnt let it show negroes who did let such resentment show often didnt live to grow old grudgingly a little frustrated that scipio hadnt given him any excuse to raise hell the policeman thrust the passbook back at him all right go on then stay out of trouble he said adding freedom freedom scipio echoed sounding as hearty as he could satisfied the cop walked on so did scipio heart pounding and guts churning with everything he had to hold in a colored man who didnt give back that freedom was also in trouble sometimes deadly trouble a colored man born in the csa is born in trouble scipio thought hed always known that he hadnt imagined how much trouble a colored man could be born into though not till the freedom party came to power the huntsmans lodge was probably the best restaurant in augusta it was certainly the fanciest and most expensive hey there xerxes the manager was a short brisk fellow named jerry dover how are you gettin by scipio shrugged i thanks de lord jesus is doin dat much bunch of damn foolishness not that anybody cares what i think dover said bad for business he was a decent man within the limits imposed on whites in the confederate states bad for business and damn foolishness were as far as he would go in saying anything about the riots but scipio couldnt imagine him rampaging down into the terry to rip up and destroy what little the negroes of augusta had now he jerked a thumb in the direction of the kitchen you arent on for half an hour get yourself some supper thank you kindly suh scipio said waiters always ate where they worked even a white cook would feed them and as for his colored assistants in a place like this though the manager often tried to hold back the tide not wanting to waste expensive food on the help not dover scipio liked not having to sneak he liked the trout and brussels sprouts and delicate mashed potatoes he got too bathsheba and the children were eating either soupkitchen food or what they could find at the handful of cafes still open in the terry part of scipio felt guilty about getting meals like this the rest reminded him it was food he didnt have to pay for that counted too he was at the tables the minute his shift started back and forth to the kitchen he went bringing orders taking food to the customers he was part of the furniture he couldnt help wondering if any of them had gone down to the terry to take from his people what small store of happiness they had maybe not these men had too much money to need to feel the negro as a threat on the other hand on the other hand you never could tell he worked his shift he made pretty good tip money everyone knew him as xerxes nobody thought he was an educated fellow the customer whod seen him when he was anne colletons butler had scared him half to death and now hed had to use that fancy accent again had to use it with bathsheba listening the echoes from that hadnt even come close to dying down when midnight came scipio told jerry dover i see you tomorrow suh see you tomorrow the white man echoed be careful on the way home you hear plenty of drunks out looking for trouble this time of night spotting a black man would give them the excuse to start some too scipio couldnt help saying cant very well be careful goin home mistuh dover on account of i aint got no home white folks done burn it down i knew that his boss said telling you im sorry doesnt do you a hell of a lot of good does it go on get out of here go back to your family that scipio could do he slipped out the kitchen door to the huntsmans lodge and down the alley behind the place that made him harder to spot than if hed gone right out onto the sidewalk he took back streets and alleys south and east into the terry telling when he got there wasnt hard it wouldnt have been hard even before the riots the edge of the terry was where the street lights stopped he didnt dare relax once he got into the negro district either whites might have beaten him or shot him for the sport of it blacks would do the same to find out how much money he carried the destruction of the riots had left plenty of people desperateand some had been robbers before the riots too no one troubled scipio tonight he made it back to the godliness baptist church with nothing more dangerous than a stray cat and not even a black one crossing his path most of the people in the church were already asleep on cots or on blankets spread over the pews because a few men worked odd hours the pastor had put up more blankets to give them a sheltered place to change scipio shed his formal clothes there and put on a nightshirt that fell down to his ankles a cot by the one where his wife lay was empty when he lay down a sigh of relief escaped him hed been on his feet a long time the cot was hard and lumpy but weariness made it feel like a featherbed he drifted toward sleep amidst the snores and occasional groans of several dozen people and then bathshebas voice a thin thread of whisper penetrated the rhythmic noise of heavy breathing howd it go he thought about pretending to have drifted off but knew he couldnt get away with it not bad he whispered back the iron frame of bathshebas cot creaked as she shifted her weight any trouble she asked he couldnt pretend he didnt know what she meant shaking his head he answered not today policeman check my passbook but dats all i pass is legal legal his wife laughed softly is you xerxes he legal scipio said not liking the way this was going an i aint nobody but xerxes if i aint xerxes who is bathsheba stopped laughing that aint the right question right question is if you aint xerxes who you is i done tol you everything scipio didnt like lying to bathsheba he lied here anyhow and without hesitation he liked talking about his years at marshlands and his brief hectic weeks in the red congaree socialist republic even less hed told her as little as he possibly could trouble was she knew it her bed creaked again this time because she shook her head all them years we been together and i never knew you could talk that way i never imagined it i lived with you i had your babies and you done hid that from me you hid all the things that that made it possible for you to talk that way she didnt usually speak with such precision herself but then she didnt usually have to get across such a difficult idea either she was far from stupidonly ignorant she went on its like i never really knew you at all somebody youre in love with that aint right is sorry hed said that before a great many times it had done him exactly no good he said something else hed said before dont much want to talk about none o this on account of all dat ol stuff still mighty dangerous anybody know too much he made a rattling noise deep in his throat the sort of noise a man might make after the noose didnt break his neck and he hung slowly strangling on the gallows dat why bathsheba let out a small exasperated hiss i aint no sheriff i aint no police i aint no goddamn freedom party stalwart she invested the swear word with infinite bitterness i love you i love what i know of you anyways turns out that aint near as much as i reckoned it was an i dont quite know what to do about that but do jesus xerxes scipio still hadnt told her his real name that shamed him but he didnt intend to do it not even when bathsheba added you know i never do nothin to hurt you he did know that he was as sure of it as he was of his own nameand he hoped no one else was sure of his name even so he said some things dey too dangerous to say to anybody some things you gits used to keepin quiet dats what i done thats what ill keep on doing as much as i can before bathsheba could reply an old man rose with a low groan from his cot and shuffled slowly and painfully toward the outhouses in back of the church their pungent reek filled the neighborhood after a while the old man came back he groaned again when he lay down a couple of minutes later someone else got up that reminded bathsheba they werent alone they hadnt been alone together for more than a few minutes at a time since the riots scipio wasnt so young as he had been but enough time had gone by since then to leave him acutely aware of that bathsheba said all right we dont finish now but this aint done an dont you think it is she rolled over on her side facing away from him by her breathing she soon slept scipio didnt not for a long long time chester martin and the skinny man who cadged handouts near his apartment looked at each other the other man turned away he hadnt shown up at the building site martin suggested and martin hadnt given him a dime since it became clear he wouldnt show up martin saved his money for people who at least tried to help themselves the summer sun beat down on him as he walked on to the trolley stop by late august the worst heat was usually over in toledo here in los angeles hed discovered it was only beginning it could stay ungodly hotthough not muggyall the way into october he nodded to the other regulars at the trolley stop this was a different crowd he was getting up earlier than he had before because his work these days was farther away go thirty miles in toledo and you were almost to sandusky go thirty miles from your apartment here and you hadnt even got out of the city limits clang up came the trolley chester paid his fare and got two transfers the first line took him west past downtown the second took him north into hollywood and the last one carried him up over the cahuenga pass into the san fernando valley the valley as people called it was full of orange and walnut groves wheat fields and truck gardens it wasnt full of houses the farmland was so fine martin had trouble seeing why anybody would want to build houses on it that however wasnt his worry any more than grand strategy had been in the army here as there he got his orders and did what he was told a couple of long streets sliced their way from east to west across the floor of the valley ventura boulevard near the southern mountains and custer way two or three miles farther north ventura boulevard was the shopping district such as it was more and more houses with clapboard sides were going up near custer way martin had to lug his toolbox most of a mile from the last trolley stop to get to the tract where he worked morning chester said mordechai the foreman he looked at his watch five minutes early you didnt expect me to be late did you chester said not me not when you looked me up to let you know you had work for me after pausing to light a cigarette the foreman blew a meditative smoke ring it didnt last long not with a little breeze stirring the air well thats why i got hold of you mordechai said i thought you were somebody i could count on some of these fellows he shook his head its like theyre doing you a favor if you tell em theres work martin had some strong feelings about that not all of them he suspected were feelings mordechai wanted him to have he wished labor unions in the building trades were stronger for that matter he wished they existed at all bosses held absolute sway over who worked and who didnt over how many hours and for how much money as far as chester was concerned that was wrong as wrong could be hed accommodated himself to it because he was working but that didnt mean it was right or fair and yet he had to admit that coin did have two sides there were men who acted as mordechai said he could see why a boss wouldnt want them around where did you draw the line who decided how those were all good questionsall political questions to chesters way of thinking again he didnt suppose mordechai would see them that way but he didnt figure hed change the world this morningand probably not tomorrow either mordechai pointed him to the nearest house you know what needs doing take care of it right martin liked a foreman who said things like that some of them told him which nail to pound first for heavens sake if hed had his druthers he would have pounded a nailno by god a railroad spikeright up he chuckled he would have liked to swing a sledgehammer that particular way dushan looked over at him what is funny he asked in his clotted accent nothing really chester answered he started driving nails in a way that didnt bother mordechai by the pained look on dushans face it did bother him had he stayed out too late the night before and had a few drinks too many it wouldnt have been the first time since chester got to know him the croat or whatever he was had revived somewhat by lunchtime enough to lure a few suckers into a card game and likely pick up more money than he made in formal wages to nobody in particular mordechai said when i was in the navy wed have guys on the gun crew come in hung over on days where we were shooting i dont ever recollect anybody dumb enough to do it more than once though i believe that by god chester said christ itd feel like blowing your head oft wouldnt it now that you mention it yes the foreman said in a way that suggested he knew exactly what he was talking about and wished he didnt at the end of the day martin lined up in front of the paymaster who handed him a fivedollar bill as always john adams looked constipated chester didnt care as long as the bill bought him five dollars worth of whatever he needed he wouldnt complain he sat through the long trolley ride without complaining too though the sun was low in the west when he finally got off near his apartment maybe that made it cooler here he didnt think that was all thoughthe valley seemed hotter than the rest of los angeles as soon as he came in the door he knew something was wrong rita never had been able to hide what she was thinking chester asked what is it sweetheart and dont tell me its nothing because i can see its something its something she took a letter from the cutglass bowl on the hutch and handed it to him its from your sister whats sue up to martin asked and then before she could answer its not my folks is it no thank god his wife answered but your brotherinlaws lost his job oh hell chester took the letter before adding excuse me sweetie he tried hard not to talk like somebody whod just escaped from the trenches he read through the letter and shook his head thats rough i thought the plateglass plant would keep otis forever and theyve got little pete to worryabout damn damn damn he excused himself again weve got to do whatever we can for them rita said chester put down the letter and gave her a kiss sue and pete and otis blake werent kin of hers at all except through him he would have hesitated a little before saying what shed just said because money was still tight for them too youre a brick rita he told her she shrugged they helped out when your dad lost his job what goes around ought to come around and we can afford some some yeah weve paid off what we owe pa for the train tickets and all anyhow but theres still all the money he and my ma gave us to help us keep a roof over our heads when we were both out of work be a long time before we pay all that offthey carried us for a long time they probably dont expect us to ever pay all that back rita said he nodded i know but i dont always do what people expect even when the people are my own folks i dont really believe im back on my feet till i dont owe anybody anything his wife smiled at him i know how stubborn you are if i dont who would you get all over town have you seen any plateglass places that are looking for people have you seen any plateglass places at all not very many he frowned trying to remember no not very many at all it isnt a big thing here the way it is back in toledo how come he read the letter again oh i missed that theyre thinking of coming out here he clicked his tongue between his teeth no i havent seen much along those lines im not saying there isnt anything cause i havent looked but nothings jumped out at me either i wonder what else otis can do i wonder if ill have to carry him till he finds out he didnt say that saying it might make it likelier to come true dont give it a canary some guys in the army had said he didnt want to rita said it would be funny somebody owing us money instead of the other way around that was an indirect way a safe way of getting at what chester hadnt wanted to come right out and say no canarieswhy canaries martin wonderedflew after supper they played double solitaire and slapped each others hands grabbing the cards a lot of the fellows at work didnt talk about anything but what theyd heard on the wireless the night before chester would have liked to have a wireless set himself they were a lot cheaper than they had been only a few years before if he kept working steadily he could start saving for one if that money didnt have to go to his brotherinlaw instead how do you get ahead he wondered christ how do you even stay where you are socialists talked about capitalism pushing the bourgeoisie down into the proletariat hed never been bourgeois a steelworker in toledo not likely but he knew what being declassed was all about just the same it had frightened him into abandoning socialism and voting democraticonce he didnt think he would do that again rita started yawning before ninethirty that disappointed chester whod hoped to persuade her to play something more exciting than double solitaire she gave back a rather wan smile when he slipped an arm around her waist still despite another yawn she didnt say no but she did yelp when he started playing with her breasts careful she said theyve been awfully sore lately sorry hon he said i know they get that way sometimes when its right before your he paused and thought back when was your last time of the month he didnt always keep close track but he did think she hadnt had to mess with pads for quite a while now sure enough she said early last monthim late i didnt want to say anything till i was sure but im pretty sure now a baby that squeak in chesters voice was fear all right on top of everything else how were they supposed to feed a baby he wasnt even sure this apartment building allowed them how did that happen the usual way im pretty sure rita answered we can call him broken rubber martin chester laughed he hadnt thought he could and he almost forgot about other things till rita said arent you going to go on it feels nice as long as you dont squeeze too hard does it chester did go on by the small sounds his wife made it did feel nice before too long he started to reach into the nightstand drawer for a safe that made him laugh again why lock the barn door if the horse was long gone he went ahead without one and that felt mighty nice too no matter how good it felt though he started worrying again the second they finished rita fell asleep right away he worried for a long time clarence potter looked into the mirror over the sink in his apartment he thought he looked pretty sharp polkadot bow tie white shirt with blue pinstripes creamcolored linen jacket to fight the summer heat and humidity of charleston straw boater cocked at a jaunty angle then he let out a sour laugh how he looked wouldnt matter a dimes worth when he got to the whig meeting tonight nobody there would listen to him nobody there ever did he sometimes wondered why he kept going pigheadedness he supposed no more than pigheadedness these days he also had the feeling that somebody had to do something about the freedom party if the whigs didnt if they couldnt he didnt see anyone else who could that cool linen jacket also concealed a shoulder holster nobody had tried to give him a hard time yet but he knew he was on a freedom party list the party was thorough if not always swift some people had already disappeared potter didnt intend to go quietly if the stalwarts wanted him they would have to pay the price for him out the door he went whistling no one lurked at the bottom of the stairs or when he checked out on the street he nodded to himself they were less likely to drop on him away from his flat because they had more trouble knowing exactly where he was then if they didnt want him now they likely wouldnt for the rest of the day whistling still he walked on toward whig headquarters a couple of blocks from the headquarters he ran into braxton donovan who was heading in the same direction the lawyer nodded he had more patience with potter than most local whigs did how goes it shyster potter asked they still havent decided to call you a political and run you in not yet donovan answered he was a ruddy fleshy man with an impressive pompadour of course now that the supreme court is gone theyre liable to get rid of all the others next and then where will i be up the creek potter answered and braxton donovan ruefully nodded potter went on why couldnt people see its a damnfool thing to do electing a party that said ahead of time it wouldnt play by the rules once it got in because too many people dont care donovan said he pulled out his pocket watch carrying one made him on the oldfashioned sidea typical attitude for a whig potter following postwar fashion preferred a wristwatch donovan said were early you want to stop at the saloon across the street and hoist a couple twist my arm potter said holding it out donovan did not too hard i give up potter announced at once lets hoist a couple but when they turned the corner they found a line of grayuniformed policemen and freedom party stalwarts in white and butternut the cops with drawn pistolsa couple of them had submachine guns insteadand the stalwarts with bludgeons stretched in front of the entrance to the whig meeting hall angry whigs milled about on the sidewalk and in the street but nobody was going inside what the hells going on potter said against a dozen policemen and twice that many stalwarts the pistol under his left arm suddenly seemed a lot less important i dont know but i intend to find out braxton donovan strode forward in his fullest roundest plummiest courtroom voice he demanded what is the meaning of this one of the cops pointed a submachine gun at the lawyers belly donovan stopped most abruptly a burst from a weapon like that could cut him in half the policeman said no more political meetings that theres our orders and that theres what were gonna make sure of but you cant do that donovan protested its against every law on the books braxton potter said urgently he took his friends arm donovan shook him off you want to listen to this other feller here the cop said this time he didnt point the submachine gunhe aimed it by order of the governor in the interest of public safely all political meetings except for the freedom partys are banned till after the election one of the stalwarts added and for as long as we feel like after that too several of his buddies laughed potter wondered whether donovan would have a stroke right there on the spot good god are you people nuts the lawyer said i can go to judge shipley and get an injunction to stop this nonsense in thirty seconds flat and then i file the lawsuits he was plainly convinced he had the big battalions on his side the policeman just as plainly was convinced he didnt so were the stalwarts with a nasty grin the one whod spoken before said judge shipley resigned last night reasons of health he leered what was going on had got through to clarence potter a little while before the old rules didnt hold any more in the new ones the freedom party heldhad grabbedall the high cards he watched braxton donovan figure that out donovan had been red almost purple now he went deathly pale you wait till after the election he whispered the people wont stand for this theyll throw you out on your ear the policemans finger twitched on the trigger of the submachine gun donovan flinched the cop laughed so did the freedom party stalwarts in their crisp notquiteuniforms one of them said you dont get it do you pal we are the people i am going to declare this here an illegal assembly the policeman said if you folks dont disperse we will arrest you jails are crowded places these days a lot of you big talkers end up in em for a lot longer than yall expect run along now or youll be sorry across the street and into the saloon counted as dispersing potter ordered a double gin and tonic braxton donovan a double whiskey they cant do that he said tossing back the drink they just did clarence potter observed question is what can we do about it another whig whod taken refuge in the saloon said weve got to fight back not here the bartender said you start talking politics in here i get in trouble i dont want no trouble i dont want no trouble with nobody neither does the owner you keep quiet about that stuff or i got to throw yall out this is how it goes potter said how what goes donovan asked how the country goesdown the drain potter said the freedom party is doing its best to make sure we dont have elections any moreor if we do they dont mean anything its best is pretty goddamn good too he spoke in a low voice in deference to the harassedlooking barkeep even that was an accommodation to what the freedom party had already accomplished donovan snorted they wont get away with it and when they do lose an election there wont be enough jails to hold all of them not even at the rate theyre building i hope youre right i hope so but i wouldnt count on it potter said jake featherston worries me hes a son of a bitch but hes a shrewd son of a bitch the way he went after the supreme court people will be studying that one for the next fifty years pass a law thats popular but unconstitutional make the court make the first move and then land on it with both feet nobody much has complained since not that ive heard who would dare with the stalwarts ready to beat you if you try but potter shook his head its more than that if hed really riled people when he did it they would scream theyd do more than scream theyd stand up on their hind legs and tell him to go to hell but they dont going ahead with that river project has given thousands of people jobs its given millions of people hopehope for electricity hope the rivers wont wash away their farms and their houses they care more about that than they do about whether the bills constitutional nonsense braxton donovan said what could be more important than that youre a lawyer braxton potter answered patiently think of ordinary people farmers and factory hands you ask them theyd say staying dry and getting electric lights count for more there are lots of them and they vote freedom even assuming youre rightwhich i dont but assumingwhat are we supposed to do about it donovan asked youve got all the answers so of course youve got that one too right potter stared down at his drink as if hed never seen it before he gulped the glass dry then waved to the bartender for a refill only after hed got it did he say damn you braxton well i love you too donovan replied you didnt answer my question you know yes i do know that potter said gloomily i also know i dont have any answers for you nobody in the country has any answers for you all right as long as we understand each other donovan finished his second drink then got to his feet i dont want another one after this i just want to go home thats about what we have left to us these daysour homes i mean theyre still our castles for the time being he slipped out the door it had grown dark outside but not nearly so dark as potters mood what do we do what can we do the questions buzzed against his mind like trapped flies buzzing against a windowpane like the flies he saw no way out even fighting the freedom party looked like a bad idea featherstons followers had been fighters from the start they were better at it than the whigs much better at it than the radical liberals if we cant fight them and if they do whatever they please no matter how illegal it is to get what they want whats left for us buzz buzz buzz another good question with no good answer visible maybe hell go too far potter muttered maybe hell land us in a war with the united states thatd fix him he despised the usa as much as any man in the csa that he could imagine the united states in the role of savior to the confederate states said a lot about how he felt about the freedom party none of what it said was good two tall gins were plenty to make him feel wobbly on his pins when he rose from the barstool a fellow in overalls came in just then and sat down at the bar he ordered a beer as the bartender drew it for him he said bout time theyre shutting down those goddamn whigs mess they got the country into they ought to thank their lucky stars they arent all hangin from lamp posts that was a political opinion too but the barkeep didnt tell him to keep quiet it was of course a political opinion favorable to the freedom party in the csa these days who could get in trouble for an opinion like that if potter had had another gin in him he would have called the bartender on it if hed had another couple of gins in him he would have started a fight but if he fought with every idiot he met in a saloon hed end up dead before too long he went home instead the cops didnt arrest him the stalwarts didnt pound on him in the csa these days that counted for freedom v sylvia enos and ernie lay side by side on her bed he was as rigid as he would have been some hours after death by the look on his face he wished he were dead it is no good he said glaring straight up at the ceiling it is no goddamn good at all not tonight sweetheart sylvia said but sometimes it is things dont always work perfect for a woman every time either you know but i am a man sort of a man a piece of a man he raised up on one elbow to look down at himself a missing piece of a man times like this i want to blow my brains out one of these days you stop that sylvia put a hand over his mouth then as if fearing that wasnt enough to drive such thoughts from his mind she took the hand away and kissed him instead dont be stupid you hear me is it stupid to want to be a man is it stupid to want to do what men can do he answered his own question by shaking his head i do not think so its stupid to talk that way this this is just one of those things like i dont know like a bad leg maybe you have to make the best of it and do what you can to live your life sometimes things are all right you know not often enough he said it is not you sweetheart you do everything you know how to do but it is no damn use i might as well try to drive a nail with half the handle of a hammer a wound like this is not like a leg it goes to the heart of a man to what makes him a man and if it is not he is not i dont know what youre talking about i dont want to know what youre talking about either sylvia said all i know is youre scaring me george had never scared her infuriated her yes when he wanted other women after being away from her too long but she could understand that no matter how mad it made her it was her mind groped till she found the word it was normal was what it was it had none of the darkness that made ernies furious gloom so frightening naked he got to his feet and headed for the kitchen christ but i need a drink fix me one too sylvia said all right i need my pipe too cigarettes are not the same ernie never smoked the pipe in sylvias apartment cigarettes were all right because she smoked too but pipe tobacco would have made the place smell funny to mary jane when she got home thanks sylvia said when he brought her whiskey over ice he gulped his still in that black mood for a long time after i got wounded i could not do anything with a woman he said his voice hard and flat not anything a dead man could do more i wanted to oh how i wanted to but i could not ernie she said nervously wouldnt it be better not to think about about the bad times she might as well have saved her breath he went on as if she hadnt spoken i bought a rifle i went hunting i hunted and hunted i shot more kinds of animals than you can think of sometimes if you cannot love killing will do i told you once to cut that out sylvia said im going to tell you again i dont like it when you talk that way i dont like it a bit do you think i like what happened to me do you think i like what does not happen with me ernie laughed a strange harsh laugh if you do you had better think again why this is hell nor am i out of it that sounded like poetry not quite like the way he usually talked but sylvia didnt know what it was from and she was damned if she would ask him she said youre the first man ive cared about since the confederates killed my husband if you think im going to let you get away youd better think again if i decide to go nobody will stop me somber pride rang in ernies voice not you not anybody do you know something what she asked warily i am jealous of you i am more jealous of you than i know how to say of me how come you had your revenge you went to the confederate states you knocked on roger kimballs door when he opened it you shot him your husband can rest easy you were never a seaman sylvia thought like most sailors george enos had had a horror of dying at sea of having his body end up food for fish and crabs hed had the horror and then it had happened to him yes shed avenged herself but poor george would never rest easy ernie added i can never have my revenge i do not know which english pilot shot me he may not know he shot me it was war and i was a target he went on his way afterwards i hope he got shot down i hope he burned all the way but even then it would be over for him i go on a quarter of a man youre more of a man than you think you are sylvia pressed herself against him do you think id want you to stay with me if you didnt make me happy carpet munching he muttered a bull dyke could do it better than i can but thats not what i want sylvia said what i want is you and youre plenty of man for me if he really believed it maybe he wouldnt be quite so ready to blow his brains out he was mulestubborn though i am not plenty of man for me sweetheart he finished the drink got out of bed got dressed and left her apartment without another word and without a backwards glance she wondered why that didnt infuriate her as it would have if some different man had done it she couldnt say all she knew was it didnt as things turned out she was glad ernie left because she got a knock on the door about fifteen minutes later she was in a housecoat by then washing out the glasses that had held whiskey so she could put them away and so mary jane wouldnt notice theyd been out shed already dumped ernies cigarette butts down to the bottom of the wastepaper basket who is it she called wondering if a neighbor wanted to chat or to borrow something it was a little late for that but not impossibly so its megeorge the voice was eerily like her dead husbands shed thought so ever since george jr went from a boy to a man she hurried to open the door what are you doing here she asked why arent you with connie did you get drunk when your boat came back to t wharf and think you still live here instead of with your wife no ma i just had a couple of drinks he said breathing whiskey fumes at her good she thought hes less likely to notice the booze on my breath he went on i know where i live and all just fine ill go back there soon enough too but i wanted to stop by and say hello you raised me after all he was a big man bigger than ernie wideshouldered and solid and not at all inclined to talk frightening nonsense how had he got so big hadnt he been a little boy raising hell in the coal board offices just a few months ago so it seemed to her anyhow slowly she answered i must have done something right back then i couldnt ask for a better son aw ma now shed embarrassed himeasier when whiskey helped make him maudlin he paused for a moment then went on i want you to be happy mary jane and i both want you to be happy you both make me happy sylvia said you make me very happy thats good ma george jr hesitated again if if you was to meet a fella who made you happy neither one of usd mind or anything we talked it over one time if he was a nice fella i mean how much did they know about ernie did they know anything sylvia thought mary jane might her daughter had never caught him here though shed come close a couple of times but sylvia wouldnt have been surprised if the neighbors gossiped what were neighbors good for besides gossiping and how to answer george jr carefully that was how sylvia said well thats sweet of both of you if i find somebody like that ill remember what you said she shook her head she needed to tell him a little more you know im a grownup myself if i want to look for a fellow i dont really need anybodys permission to go ahead and do it oh no i know that i didnt mean you did i just meant you know that we arent upset or anything not that we wouldnt be upset they did know then or they knew something anyhow sylvia doubted they knew some of the things shed been doing not too long before children always had trouble imagining their parents doing anything like that and they wouldnt know how ernie was mutilated and some of the makeshifts sylvia and he had to use as long as youre happy thats what matters george jr said i am dear she answered most of the time i am anyhow when ernie starts talking about gunsthats a different story all right ma her son stooped and kissed her on the cheek im going to go on home i hope they give me a little time before i have to head out again but you never can tell he touched the brim of his low flat cap and ducked out of the apartment where hed grown up the apartment that would never be his home again the next morning sylvia left mary jane whod come in late in bed asleep and went down to t wharf to see what she could get in the way of seafood with her husband and her son both fishermen she had connections ordinary people could only envy she bought some lovely scrod at a price that would have turned an ordinary housewife green and better yet got the young cod without any jokes about the pluperfect subjunctive she didnt know how many times shed heard those from fish dealers and fishermen she did know it was too many she was on her way back to the flat when someone called her name she turned oh she said hello mr kennedy good morning to you mrs enos as always joseph kennedys smile displayed too many teeth it was not a friendly smile it looked more like a threat so you prefer a hack writer to me do you ernies no hack sylvia said indignantly anyone who writes an astoldto book is a hack kennedy said still smiling he wanted to wound with those teeth he wanted to bite that sylvia had said no to him was bearable as long as she said no to everyone else too that shed said no to him and yes to somebody else that irked him hes a fine writer sylvia said times are hard everybodys got to eat yes kennedy made the word into a hiss everybody does the campaign will start early next year since president hoovers going to run for reelection you would have had a part in it but he shrugged youd sooner have half a man sylvia wanted to slap him in the face with a scrod instead in a deadly voice she answered half of him makes a better man and a bigger man than all of you he went fishbelly pale under the brim of his boater sylvia hadnt bothered keeping quiet several people sniggered a woman pointed at kennedy he fled sylvia knew shed pay later but oh triumph was sweet for now the alabama correctional camp p lay in the black belt the cottongrowing part of the state forty miles south of montgomery and a hundred forty south of birmingham except for his time in the confederate army and his stint down in the empire of mexico jefferson pinkard had never been so far from home the camp lay between cotton fields and pecan groves not far from a town of about a thousand people called fort deposit once upon a time the fort had protected settlers from indians now only the name was left to commemorate the stockade that had once stood there fort deposit did boast a train station a little clapboard building with a roof that hung out over the track so people could board and leave a train when it was raining and raining it was when pinkard stood on the rickety platform by the track waiting for the northbound louisville and nashville railroad train to take him up to birmingham he wore his wardens uniform his freedom party pin on proud display on his left lapel he kept hoping someone would want to argue politics but nobody did up chugged the train it wheezed to a halt iron wheels squealing against iron rails most of the people who got off and boarded were negroes with workweary faces and cardboard luggage a couple of cars up at the front of the train were for whites though jeff climbed in and sat down in one of those a few minutes later the train rattled north again five hours later the train came into the louisville and nashville station in birmingham the station was at twentieth and morris only a few blocks west of the sloss works where pinkard had worked for so long he took a cab back to his apartment closer to the center of town the freedom party was picking up a good part of the tab for the place he didnt stay there longonly long enough to get out of uniform and into the white shirt and butternut trousers of a freedom party stalwart he wasnt the only one wearing that almostuniform who converged on birmingham party headquarters oh nofar from it inside caleb briggs had already started talking warming up the men for what they would be doing tomorrow is election day rasped the dentist who headed the party in birmingham his voice was only a ruin of its former self hed been gassed in the war and hed never recovered we got to make sure the fellows who get elected vote our way all of em yall hear me freedom the men roared pinkard loud among them briggs nodded thats right freedom weve already got the house in richmond and well keep it but we got to get the senate too and thats tougher on account of the state legislatures pick the senators so we have to take care of those yall reckon we can do it yes the stalwarts shouted and hell yes and a great many other things besides the louder they yelled the more excited they got good caleb briggs grinned a wide crooked grin not so many whig and rad lib gatherings as there used to be but the whigs are holding one tonight in capitol park smack in the middle of town we got to make sure they dont go through with it and that they dont do any voting tomorrow make sure you grab your clubs and whatnot and we arent going there to take prisoners as the men assembled for the march on the park they told stories of other elections other brawls a lot of them talked about when jake featherston won the presidency pinkard was one of the smaller number who could talk about when featherston almost won nobody talked about the presidential election of the party had wandered in the wilderness then even jeff a stalwart among stalwarts had wondered if it would ever emerge policemen tipped their hats to the advancing stalwarts the dustup in the park that followed came almost as an anticlimax the whigs werent what they had been two years earlier theyd been fighting for their lives then and known it now now it was as if they sensed it was all over but the shouting a few stubborn men fought hard to hold back the freedom party avalanche but only a few the rest fled so did the whig candidate for governor and just in time the stalwarts would surely have beaten him had they caught him and they might have strung him up thatll teach those sons of bitches somebody not far from pinkard said yeah jeff nodded not like it was in the old days when the governor used to sic the national guard on us to keep us from kicking up our heels folks know which side their bread is buttered on nowadays the other stalwart said and what the hell were holding most of the bread now thats right pinkard nodded again emphatically and were going to get the rest of it too he wished he could go to a saloon and have a few drinks with his comrades but alabama remained stubbornly dry instead he went home and slept in his own bed for the first time in months hed got used to the hard military cot down at the alabama correctional camp p his mattress seemed squashy by comparison and he woke up with a stiff back grumbling he made a cup of coffeejust about all he had in the placeand got into the stalwarts almostuniform again when he went back to freedom party headquarters caleb briggs sent him to a polling place a few blocks away i dont expect the policell enforce the electioneering limits briggs rasped case they do dont pick a fight with em here he handed jeff and the other party men a sheet of newspaperstyle photos of mens faces see if yall can keep these bastards from getting to the booth theyre nothing but troublemaking trash jeff grinned at the men with him they were grinning too you bet he said and took a cudgel from among those stuffed into a sheetmetal trash can he thwacked the bludgeon into the palm of his left hand this was the enjoyable part of the job he pulled a quarter from his pocket too gonna buy some doughnuts before we get there he said im empty inside the confederate flag flew in front of an elementaryschool auditorium sure enough no one said a word no policemen appeared when the freedom party men stationed themselves right outside the door quite a few of the men going in to vote displayed party pins some without the black border that showed a new member more with they nodded and tipped their hats to the stalwarts as they went by the call of freedom rang out again and again about half past eight pinkard nudged the stalwart nearest him theres one of the fuckers were supposed to stop right the other fellow said and stepped into the wouldbe voters path you better get the hell out of here buddy you know whats good for you are you saying im not allowed to exercise my constitutional right to vote the man asked he was bald skinny middleaged and wore a suit he looked like a lawyer or somebody else too smart for his own good he said you better get lost pinkard answered and you better too or youll be real sorry i willas soon as i vote the cleverlooking guy started forward again maybe he had guts maybe he was too stupid to know what was coming all four stalwarts set on him bludgeons rising and falling freedom they shouted as the blows thudded home pinkard added you shouldve listened you dumb asshole you gonna vote now the bald mans wails rose above the thumps of the clubs and the stalwarts battle cries at last they let him go he staggered away face and scalp bloodied he didnt try to go into the polling place which proved they hadnt beaten all the brains out of him they beat up three or four other men from their sheet of photos several more abruptly discovered urgent business elsewhere on seeing them waiting the stalwarts saluted one another with their bloodspattered bludgeons each time that happened schoolchildren watched one beating they laughed and cheered the stalwarts on no policemen came to bother them pinkard hadnt expected that any would the party had been strong in police and fire departments across the csa for years when the polls closed a couple of jeffs comrades headed home he went back to party headquarters as hed known they would they had wireless sets blaring out election returns they also had sandwiches and homebrew results from the confederate states on the east coast had a good start on those in alabama and farther west looks like the freedom party landslide that started two years ago is still rolling downhill folks the announcer said he sounded delighted with the news people who didnt sound delighted the freedom party was doing well didnt last on the wireless this fellow went on north carolinas going to have a new governor a freedom party man same with georgia and party candidates are picking up seat after seat in the legislatures in the carolinas and florida that makes races for the senate likely to go freedom too jefferson pinkard turned to the closest stalwart and raised his glass of beer heres to us by jesus weve gone and done it we sure as hell have looks like it the other party man agreed he sported a mouse under one eye he must have run into a whig with more gumption than most pinkard hadnt after a while alabama returns and others from the western part of the confederacy started coming in along with those from the eastern seaboard the only state where the freedom party didnt seem to be doing well was louisiana where the radical liberal governor had a solid organization of his own somebody not far from jeff said he can laugh now but that son of a bitchll pay before long you can count on it heads solemnly bobbed up and down pinkards among them with restive kentucky on its border tennessee went freedom in a big way and probably would have even without stalwarts outside polling places with even more restless sequoyah and stolen houston on its borders texas voted freedom more spectacularly still jeff went back to his apartment and to bed before many returns came in from chihuahua and sonora for one thing he was confident theyd turn out for the party too for another they were mostly greasers down there anyhow and hed had his fill of greasers fighting in the empire of mexico he got on the train again the next day to go back to the alabama correctional camp p newsboys shouted election results freedom party claims vetoproof majority in both houses of congress was one cry conscious of a job well done jeff bought a paper he read it as the train rumbled south from birmingham then he let it fall to the floor and dozed no he didnt sleep well in his own bed any more he got rudely awakened just before the train pulled into montgomery he came within inches of getting killed a bullet blew out the window by his seat cracking past his head and spraying him with broken glass more bullets stitched along the length of the car down get down goddammit he shouted and dove between his seat and the one in front quite a few of the men in the carlikely the ones whod seen combat during the wardid the same thing like him they knew machinegun fire when they heard it screams and wails said some of the bullets hadnt missedand that civilians were panicking before long pinkards hands and knees were wet and sticky with someones blood the last time anybodyd shot up a train in which he was riding it had been negro rebels when he was a private on his way to put down one of the socialist republics the blacks had proclaimed in georgia who was it this time the country between birmingham and montgomery was full of farms and plantations and the plantations were full of negroes coincidence or the start of a new uprising jeff didnt knowhe had no way of knowingbut he muttered under his breath flora blackford didnt realize how much shed missed the floor of congress till she came back to philadelphia is it any wonder there is armed struggle against the freedom party in the confederate states she demanded is it any wonder at all after the farce that went by the name of an election in that country two weeks ago a congressmana freedom party congressmanfrom houston sprang to his feet how is that there election different from most of the ones yall put on in what you call my state he didnt want to be in the us congress at all he would sooner have served in richmond excuse me mr mahon but i have the floor flora said with icy courtesy may i go on thats right ride roughshod over me youve been riding roughshod over my statewhat you call my stateever since you tore us bleeding from texas and made us join the usa tell the lady george that was another freedom party man from houston two more congressmen these from kentucky began singing dixie neither they nor their constituents wanted to belong to the united states either bang bang bang congressman la follette of wisconsin the speaker of the house plied his gavel with gusto the gentlemen are out of order he declared the gentlemen will observe the rules of the house mrs blackford has the floor this body is out of order george mahon shouted this whole damn country is out of order the kentucky congressmen sang louder than ever bang bang bang that will be quite enough charles la follette declared the sergeantatarms will eject from this chamber any individual flouting the rules of the house is that clear its clear all right mahon said its clear that even though our own people elected us you dont want to let us tell you what they want but he sat down after that and the rowdy singing stopped the freedom party congressmen knew la follette meant what he said hed ejected them before flora wasnt sure how much good that did though getting thrown out of congress only made them bigger heroes back home you may continue mrs blackford la follette said wearily without further interruption i very much hope thank you mr speaker flora said i rose to call upon the administration to take stronger action against the confederate states than it has done up until this time president hoover stayed silent in the wake of the riotsi might even say the pogromaimed against the black residents of the csa and does not appear to recognize their legitimate right to rise against oppression and brutality he the distinguished congresswoman from new york worries more about the negroes of the confederate states not because they are black but because they are red another congressman broke in most people in the united states worry very little about them for any reason he wasnt a freedom party man he was a rockribbed democrat from maine speaker la follette gaveled him to silence too but not with the vehemence hed used against the freedom party buffoons and to her dismay flora saw heads nodding in agreement with what the new englander had said the united states had only a handful of negroes border patrols stayed busy keeping wouldbe colored refugees out the usa wanted no more blacks if anything most people would have been happier with none at all stubbornly she said they are human beings too congressman endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights among those being life liberty and the pursuit of happiness jefferson was a damned virginian the man from maine sneered give me adams and hamilton any day more nods these from all around the big room founding fathers from states no longer in the usa had a low reputation north of the masondixon line these days and had ever since the war of secession do you deny sir that they are human beings flora asked do you deny that they possess those rights i named they are in a foreign country the congressman from maine replied i deny that they are any business of the usa he got more nods from fellow democrats from the handful of republicans and freedom party men and even from a few socialists to her dismay flora had seen that before socialists spoke on behalf of racial equality but couldnt get too far ahead of the people who voted them into office that was how they rationalized it anyhow congressman moran would you say the same if these persecuted people were irish flora asked sweetly since they arent irish the question does not apply moran was too smart to answer that one the way she asked it because he was she waited for speaker la follette to gavel down his interruption and then introduced her motion of censure against the confederate states she knew it would fail the next motion passed censuring the confederate states for the way they treated their negroes would be the first but she had to make the effort it wasnt as if jews didnt know pogroms too news out of russia and the kingdom of poland which bore about the same relationship to germany as the republic of quebec did to the usa wasnt good after the house adjourned she went across the street to her office a newsboy waving the philadelphia inquirer shouted confederates ask to enlarge their army read all about it i certainly do want to read about that flora exclaimed and gave him a nickel he handed her a paper and smiled broadly when she didnt wait for change she spread the inquirer out on her desk that was the lead headline all right she zoomed through the story president featherston apparently had requested permission to boost the confederate army to a size significantly larger than that allowed by the treaty ending the great war featherston was quoted as saying these soldiers will be used only for internal defense we have uprisings against the lawful authority of our government in several states and need the extra manpower to put them down hoover hadnt said yes and hadnt said no a powel house spokesman had said the president of the united states would give the request serious consideration flora wondered what he would do as a democrat he would normally favor a hard line against the csa but as a democrat he would also normally favor putting down uprisings of the proletariat no matter how justified they might be flora wondered how she ought to feel about the request herself up till jake featherston became president of the confederate states the socialists had favored a softer line with the csa easing the countrys return to the family of nations some still did how could the confederacy become a normal country with a rebellion sputtering in its heartland but how could one keep from sympathizing with the rebels considering what theyd been through before picking up rifles or as featherston claimed cleaning the grease off the ones theyd hidden away in that last made up her mind she dialed powel house wondering how long it would be before these newfangled telephones sent operators into extinction along with the passenger pigeon and the american bison she worked her way through three secretaries before finally securing an appointment with president hoover when she told her husband that evening what shed done hosea blackford made a sour face he wont listen to you youre my wife thats plenty of reason right there for him not to listen to you this is foreign policy flora answered foreign policy should be bipartisan you said so yourself often enough this is hoover to put it mildly blackford did not care for his successor youd do better to recommend the opposite of what you really want you might have some chance of getting it then powel house on third street was a threestory structure of red brick with wide steps leading up to the broad porch and its wroughtiron railings philadelphias last prerevolutionary mayor had lived there since the second mexican war it had also replaced the white house in washington as the chief presidential residence the reception hall onto which the street door opened was large and impressive with highly polished mahogany wainscoting gleaming a mellow redbrown the banister leading up to president hoovers secondfloor office was also of mahogany the spindles fine examples of fancy lathework when shed lived here flora had often admired them now worried as she was she hardly gave them a glance hoovers bulldog features twisted into a smile when she came in good to see you mrs blackford he waved her to a chair please sit down make yourself comfortable he didnt say make yourself at home shed been at home here had the election of turned out differently she and hosea would still be at home here hoover went on what can i do for you congresswoman thank you for your time perhaps because she didnt like president hoover flora took care to be especially polite ive come to ask you to tell president featherston you do not approve of his proposed expansion of the confederate army he will use it for nothing but the oppression of his own people i agree that is how he will use it hoover said and astonished hope flamed in flora the president continued that is why i am disposed to permit the expansion flora stared i dont understand mr president if i thought president featherston intended to use his increased army against the united states i would oppose his enlargement of it with every fiber of my being but i do believe he will use it only for the purpose he says he intends putting down the negro uprisings troubling several of his states any nation whether friendly to the united states or not is entitled to internal peace stability and security if some illadvised individuals disturb its tranquility it has the right to use force to put them down but mr president one of the reasons the negroes are in arms against the csa is that the white majority will not give themhow did you phrase itpeace stability and tranquility flora answered the confederate states made their bed through oppression shouldnt they have to lie in it radical elements have controlled blacks in the confederate states for too long hoover said this is not their first rising if you recall oh yes their last one went a long way toward winning us the war flora replied dont we owe them a debt of gratitude for that the president thrust out his chin we owe no foreigners any debts he said proudly we are at peace with the world even the japanese that was a dig at her husband in whose presidency the war with japan had broken out it was also an infallible sign she wouldnt get what she wanted i hope you will not regret this decision mr president she said rising to her feet my conscience is clear hoover said which is not the same as being right since she wouldnt get what she wanted she did take the last word grunting cincinnatus driver eased the last sofa off his dolly and down to the floor of the furniture shops storeroom here you go mr averill its pretty furniture i hope it sells good oh lord so do i the shopowner replied he signed off on the paperwork cincinnatus had given him then handed back the clipboard obliged cincinnatus wheeled the dolly outside even though hed been taking sofas and chairs and hassocks and chests of drawers off the truck for the past half hour and so was good and warm the cold air flayed his face breathing it was like breathing knives snow crunched under his shoes the winter looked to be as nasty as any hed known since moving to iowa he hoped the ford would start and breathed a sigh of relief when it did he let the engine warm up before putting it in gear that gave him a chance to pick up the folded copy of the des moines heraldexpress that lay on the seat confederate stalwarts flock to army the headline read cincinnatus muttered under his breath that had nothing to do with kentucky but it had everything to do with blacks in the csa the new recruits would land on the negro revolt with both feet that would surely make more negroes try to flee north he wondered how many would make it into the usa not many he thought throwing the paper down in disgust not near enough a jew or an irishman could be welcome here even a chinaman could sometimes but a negro only the conquest of kentucky had made cincinnatus a us citizen and a jew or an irishman though not a chinaman could easily pretend to be something he wasnt a negro cincinnatus shook his head a black man was black and nothing he could do would make him anything else back in kentucky of course cincinnatus had known men called black who had blue eyes and girls called black with freckles they hadnt bought their features from the sears roebuck catalogue or any of its smaller confederate competitors nobody talked much about how they had come by them but everybody knew another story read hoover plans reelection bid cincinnatus didnt bother reading that one hed voted democratic ever since hed been able to vote he wanted the usa to keep the csa down as far as he was concerned everything else ran second to that and now hoover had gone and betrayed his trust did that make it worth his while to vote socialist later this year he shrugged he still had months and months to go before he needed to make up his mind he drove up to the railroad yards got out of the truck and sat down on a bench with his pail to eat lunch a couple of railroad dicks nodded to him as they went by he was an accepted part of the landscape one of the white men even tipped his cap cincinnatus made haste to return the gesture no white in kentucky would have done that with a black half a dozen white truck drivers ate about fifty yards away they didnt invite cincinnatus over and he didnt presume to join them without an invitation though another white man did some things worked differently here from the way they did down in kentucky but others hadnt changed a bit cincinnatus wasnt the only colored driver picking up cargo at the des moines yards but the others seemed to be out hauling it happened hed eaten a lot of lunches by himself he took a big bite of his ham sandwich shoeleather scrunched on gravel only a few feet away cincinnatus looked up the black man coming toward him wasnt one of the usual drivers that was the first thing cincinnatus realized the second thing was that he knew him anyway though he hadnt seen him since moving away from covington lucullus he said in amazement what the hell you doin here i been lookin for you done found you now too lucullus wood stuck out his hand automatically cincinnatus shook it when hed come to iowa lucullus had been on the cusp between boy and man where achilles was now today lucullus had a mans full and formidable presence hed also grown into a good deal of his father apicius heft lookin for me what for i been gone from covington a long time now dont want to go back neither cincinnatus said the railroad dicks ambled past again coming the other way they gave lucullus a hard stare but seeing that cincinnatus knew him they let him alone aint just me its my old man lucullus said whats apicius want with me cincinnatus asked in surprise and more than a little alarm lucullus father wasnt just the best barbecue man between the carolinas and kansas city he was also one of the leading reds in kentucky during and after the war hed played a dangerous game with confederate diehards and with luther bliss the head of the kentucky state police having spent more time than he cared to in one of luther bliss jails cincinnatus wanted nothing to do with him now he pointed a finger at lucullus whyd old apicius send you anyways why dont he wire or write hisself a letter to me you know pa aint got his letters lucullus said which was true but not fully responsive seeing cincinnatus impatience the younger man went on he send me so i kin talk you into doin what needs doin so you kin talk me into doin what apicius wants you mean cincinnatus said and lucullus didnt deny it well cincinnatus asked tell me what he wants an why he wants me tell me quick so i kin say no an go on about my business he wants you on account of yous a nigger with balls and yous a nigger with a truck lucullus said plenty o black folks they tryin to get up to the usa from the csa you hear tell bout dat i hear tell cincinnatus admitted you know bout the underground railroad back before the war o secession lucullus asked run slaves up into free country so they turn free themselves thats what we do now we run niggers up into the usa an we needs your help you want me to go down there an sneak black folks from the csa up into the usa cincinnatus asked lucullus nodded thats right what you say cincinnatus looked at him he knew what lucullus and apicius were counting on his urge to protect his own but he had his own right here elizabeth achilles and amanda he looked lucullus straight in the eye and said no lucullus jaw dropped what no cincinnatus repeated that means i aint gonna do it sorry you come all this way but no anyhow tell your pa he should find hisself another nigger one with rocks where his brains ought to be now lucullus started to get angry why not he demanded on account of whoever does this he gonna get caught cincinnatus replied on account of i already been in luther bliss jail once and aint nothin or nobody make me mess with that man again on account of i do anything you goddamn reds dont like i end up dead an wishin i was in luther bliss goddamn jail no hell no he waited for lucullus to remind him his mother and father still lived in covington and bad things might happen to them if he didnt go along he waited but lucullus said nothing of the kind maybe he knew it would do no good he did say my pa he aint gonna be real happy with you i aint real happy with him or with you neither cincinnatus said you got a lot o goddamn nerve comin up here an tryin to drag me back into that shit i done gone away a long time ago an i aint never goin back he was almost shouting if hed been any angrier he would have hurled himself at lucullus the younger man held out both hands pale palms up in a placating gesture all right all right i hears you i tells my pa what you say he left the railroad yard in a hurry who was that colored fella one of the railroad dicks asked cincinnatus after lucullus went away not that other colored fella cincinnatus noticed they took him so much for granted they almost forgot what color he was that never would have happened in kentucky either people there always paid attention to who was who they were sometimes less overt about noticing than they were here in iowa but they always did i used to know him when i was livin down in kentucky cincinnatus answered aint seen him for years till now what did he want tryin to talk me into goin back there he had some kind o business deal cincinnatus shrugged i aint goin hes a flybynight you must be rich if he came all this way from kentucky to try and take your money the dick said hell have a long empty time going back thought he could play you for a sucker did he anybody reckons im rich he aint never seen all the moths fly outa my wallet when i open it cincinnatus hesitated to admit even to himself that he was doing well both railroad dicks laughed yeah well i know that song said the one who did most of the talking dont i just goddammit he and his partner both strode off to prowl around trains cincinnatus bolted the rest of his lunch then he went after work for the rest of the day he got less than he wanted wasting time with lucullus had put him behind the other drivers he muttered and fumed all afternoon not only had lucullus bothered him hed cost him money that hurt more when he got back to his apartment building at the end of that long frustrating day he found not only elizabeth but also mr and mrs chang from upstairs waiting in the lobby mrs chang spoke next to no english but started yelling at him in chinese the minute he walked in the door your foolish boy mr chang shouted foolish foolish boy what he think he do he he broke down and started to cry cincinnatus looked a question to elizabeth all this excitement was likely to mean only one thing sure enough his wife nodded achilles and grace they run off to get married she said do jesus cincinnatus said softly he didnt think that was a good idea which put it mildly but he didnt know what heor the changscould do about it his son and their daughter were of legal age if they wanted to tie the knot they could whether they would live happily ever after was liable to be a different story but they werent likely to worry about that now he held out his hand to grace changsno to grace driversfather welcome to the family he said i reckon either we make the best o this or else we spend all our time fighting from here on out mr chang looked at the hand for close to half a minute before finally taking it i got nothing against you you good man he said at last your boyagainst your boy i got plenty but you mewe no fight thats about as much as i can ask for right now cincinnatus said somehow or other well get through it the changs didnt look as if they believed him for that matter neither did elizabeth and he hadnt said a word about lucullus visit yet mort pomeroy gave mary a kiss on the cheek he was bundled into an overcoat with mittens and fur hat with earflaps he was only going across the street to the diner but in the middle of a blizzard all the clothes he could put on were none too many ill see you tonight sweetheart he said so long mary answered ive got plenty to keep me busy her husband nodded though that wouldnt have been true at the mcgregor farm mort didnt realize how much harder life had been there however much she loved him mary didnt intend to tell him either she didnt like keeping secrets from him but thought she had no choice here he kissed her again and went out the door she went to the window so she could watch him cross the street she always did that he knew it too he looked up waving through the snow that blurred his outline she waved back and blew him another kiss he jerked his head to show hed got it as soon as mort went into the diner mary washed the breakfast dishes she put them in the drainer she saw no point to drying them herself once shed done that she looked out the window again an auto painted us army greengray made its slow way up the street in rosenfeld whoever was in it paid no attention to the canadian woman looking down on him from the apartment building one of these days ill make you pay attention she muttered you see if i dont she started to fix herself a fresh cup of tea but stopped and shrugged instead the cup shed had with breakfast hadnt sat so well as she would have liked maybe the next one ought to wait till later even without the tea her heart beat faster when she got out the bombmaking gear shed taken from the barn at the farm a year and a half before after all this time mort had no idea the tools and explosives were here he was busy in the diners kitchen but the kitchen pantries in the apartment were her place and he left them alone she thought she knew as much as she needed to know about this business only the experiment of course would prove that one way or the other she hadnt made the experiment yet a clock chimed the hour eight oclock not far away the general store would be opening for business it wasnt henry gibbons store any more peter karamanlides the new owner was a bignosed greek from rochester new york his selection of merchandise was almost identical to what gibbons had been his prices were if anything microscopically lower mary disliked him just the same though she bought from him a lot of things had to come from the general store because nobody else in rosenfeld carried them karamanlides seemed decent enough but here he was one more yank yankifying canada mary wished there were canadians buying general stores in rochester instead but there werent or shed never heard of any she gave her attention back to the business at hand her fathers bombs had always had wooden cases hers fit into a cardboard box she could have made the same sort of case as arthur mcgregor had but shed decided not to she didnt want investigators reminded of her fathers work that might make them look her way for the same reason she didnt use the big tenpenny nails her father had thumbtacks would do the job well enough she wound and carefully set an alarm clock then even more carefully lowered it into the cardboard box if she dropped it if the impact made its bells clack against each other pa never made a stupid mistake like that she told herself fiercely i wont either and she didnt though a drop of sweat trickled down her forehead and between her eyes and fell from the tip of her nose onto the glass face of the clock she wiped it away with a forefinger then she poured the thumbtacks into the box put on the lid and tied it shut with brown twine she yawned as she put on a heavy coat and a scarf to cover her red hair now she wished shed had that second cup of tea after all well no help for it the coat was big and bulky she had no trouble concealing the box under it out the door and down the stairs she went the general store was around the corner and two blocks away her heart pounded harder and harder as she walked towards it again she spoke sternly to herself father did this lots of times you can too and you will hardly anyone was on the street yet that was good that was how she wanted things the fewer people who saw her the better there was the post office wilf rokeby would be getting ready to open up there as he had for as long as she could remember and here was the general store she jumped when the bell above the door jingled as she went in good day to you mrs pomeroy karamanlides said from behind the counter what can i get for you today he chuckled so early and im all yours shed counted on being the only customer in the place she hadnt counted on how hot it was inside he had the potbellied stove going full blast the sweat on her face now had nothing to do with nerves she gave him her list finishing and a pair of the strongest reading glasses youve got ill give them to my mother for her birthday her mothers birthday was indeed coming up in a few weeks karamanlides piled goods on the counter then said excuse me the glasses i keep in the back room he disappeared mary set the cardboard box on a bottom shelf it didnt look much different from the boxes of epsom salts already sitting there she left her coat open afterwards that was all to the good if shed kept it closed much longer the storekeeper would have started wondering why he came back with the spectacles i have a couple styles here which ones you like better the lenses are the same in both his accent wasnt just american a faint trace of his native country lingered in it too let me have the pair with the bronze frames mary answered what does it all come to as henry gibbon would have karamanlides scribbled figures on a scrap of paper and added them up three dollars and nineteen cents he said after checking everything twice she gave him four dollar bills and checked to make sure the change was right then she took what shed bought back to the apartment building she put everything away she didnt want mort noticing shed been to the general store this morning she didnt think anyone but karamanlides had seen her go in or come out she fell back into housework but then broke off with a gasp what would she do if the us authorities decided to search the apartment just because she was her fathers daughter stowing bombmaking tools in the kitchen was enough to keep mort from knowing they were there hardeyed men in greengray uniforms probablyno certainlynot having a really good hiding place didnt matter so long as she didnt use the tools but now she had everything went into another cardboard box this one considerably larger than the one waiting with the epsom salts then she took the box downstairs everybody in the building stashed things in the basement it wasnt such a good hiding place as her father had found in the barn but it would have to do for now the yanks would have trouble proving those tools were hers even if they did find them she hoped they would anyhow halfway back up the stairs mary paused and yawned and yawned and yawned she shook her head in amazement when she finally stopped she couldnt remember the last time shed felt this tired in the middle of the day finishing the climb felt like going up mount everest which had recently killed a couple of german climbers whod wanted to be the first to the summit when she returned to the apartment she thought about fixing that cup of tea to perk herself up but the last one had been so bitter she just didnt feel like another her stomach lurched at the mere thought whats wrong with me she thought although she had at least the beginnings of a suspicion she hadnt finished the morning dusting when she started yawning again she sat down in the nearest chair closed her eyes and tilted her head back ill just rest for a little she didnt even finish the thought before sleep claimed her she woke with a start an hour and a half later blinking and confused had it hadnt it had she slept through it if it had she didnt think she could have and yet a glance at a clock went some way toward reassuring her it shouldnt have not unless shed done something wrong feeling guilty about dozing off in the middle of the day she got back to work she should have been refreshed but she kept wanting to start yawning again excitement that had nothing to do with waiting built in her this wasnt her imagination she couldnt remember the last time shed taken a nap in the middle of the morning when the bang came at last it sounded less impressive than shed expected shed heard a bomb go off once before back during the war shed been a little girl then and remembered the noise as seeming like the end of the world thiswas just a bang the windows rattled briefly and that was that she was farther away now than she had been then maybe her bomb was smaller too before long the town fire engines siren screamed to life mary looked out the window some people mort among them came out of the diner across the street to see what had happened one of them pointed in the direction of the general store mary wondered if mort would look up at her but he didnt in a way she was sorry in another way relieved he didnt automatically think of her as a bomber then if he didnt maybe the us occupiers wouldnt either no one knocked on her door till her husband got home she didnt need to ask him about the news he was full of it somebody blew gibbons general storeof course its not gibbons any moreto hell and gone we havent seen anything like this sinceer in a long time since your fathers day hed started to say i heard a boom i didnt know what it was mary said a bomb her husband said solemnly the store went up in smoke big fire if whatshisname the greek hadnt been in the back room he would have gone up with it as is he got a nail or something right here he patted his own left buttock hell sit on a slant for weeks i bet mary laughed she wasnt too sorry karamanlides hadnt got badly hurt she wondered whether she had the stomach to go on fighting the usa pa wouldntve cared who got hurt they were just the enemy to him i have news too she said what is it mort sounded indulgent what could be interesting or important after the bomb but mary had an answer for him im going to have a baby his eyes went wide wider widest are you sure he asked a question men uncounted regret the moment it passes their lips but mary a good part of her mind on other things let him down easy all she said was yes very sure even if the us occupiers didnt catch her she doubted she would be doing much with the bombmaking tools for a while now when jonathan moss left his apartment these days his hand was always on the stock of the pistol he carried if anybody wanted to fight he was ready he took threats a lot more seriously than he had before major sam lopat had thought they were a pack of nonsense then occupation headquarters went up in smoke the military prosecutors opinions were no longer relevant berlin ontario had been quiet since the blast even new yanks out graffiti were harder to come by than they had been before the bomb went off american soldiers had gone back to shooting first and asking questions later the lawyer in moss deplored that the american in canada in him thought it made him more likely to live to a ripe old age an armored car rattled down the street the machine would have been hopelessly obsolete in time of war but it was ideal for making terrorists and wouldbe revolutionaries think twice a couple of the soldiers inside the machine jeered at moss everybody around here knew who he was canucks and americans alike again part of him savored that recognition and part of him could have done without it he slid behind the wheel of his model d ford hed finally got rid of the bucephalus not only because it was old but also because it was distinctive so far as he knew it had been the only bucephalus in berlin while there were four or five model ds on this block alone in obscurity there is strength he thought and turned the key not only did the ford start more readily than the bucephalus had been in the habit of doing he thought it less likely to have explosives waiting under the hood on any given day he hadnt really worried about that either not till after occupation headquarters blew up he laughed as he put the motorcar in gear not that it was really funny nothing like a bomb going off to concentrate the mind when he got to the building that held his office he didnt park the ford in front of it as hed been in the habit of doing instead he went on to a lot a couple of blocks away a lot surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards secure parking said the sign above the entrance moss gave the attendant twenty cents and drove in the sign might as well have read parking for americans the only canadians who used it were a handful of collaborators they were of course doubtless the ones who felt they needed it most moss felt he needed it that he felt he needed it infuriated him dammit couldnt the canucks see he was on their side evidently not they only saw he was a yank if he came from south of the fortyninth parallel he had to be an enemy most of the buildings in downtown berlin had had their glass replaced since the bomb went off here and there though plywood sheets still covered those openings some people couldnt afford to reglaze some buildings simply stood empty the business collapse had been no less savage here than anywhere else when he got to his office he plugged in the hot plate and got some coffee going the pot would be good in the morning tolerable around noon and battery acid towards evening he knew hed go right on drinking it anyway how could anybody function without coffee he yawned life was hard enough with it as soon as hed poured the coffee he started going through paperwork like a lot of busy men who worked for themselves he was chronically behind he had a better excuse than most though since the bombing in berlin hed had to try cases in galt in guelph in london even in toronto that did nothing to make him more efficient he was pleased with the record hed managed to ring up despite the added difficulty of travel his first client came in at precisely nine oclock good morning mr jamieson moss rose to shake hands with him how are you today tolerable mr moss lou jamieson was a middleaged man who walked with a limp he had a very pale face that always bore a slight sheen of sweat or oil his meat market was the biggest in berlin the occupying authorities kept accusing him of paying kickbacks to us inspectors moss wouldnt have bet that he didnt though of course lawyers didnt ask questions like that much of the evidence theyd had against him went up in smoke in the bombing that hadnt kept them from going after him again his trial in london was set to open the following week what do you think theyve got on me he asked now lighting a cigarette well thats a problem you know moss answered this isnt an ordinary criminal proceeding theres no pretrial discovery under occupation law the military prosecutor can spring whatever surprises he wants in front of the judge jamieson gestured with his right hand leaving a trail of smoke from the cigarette teach your granny to suck eggs why dont you he said in a raspy baritone this aint the first time theyve had me up you know ive beaten this crap before so what have they got on me he expected moss to know regardless of whether the army told him and moss did even over in londonhell even over in torontohe knew people who could tell him interesting things finding out cost him money but that was one of the expenses of running a practice theres a lieutenant named szymanski from the inspectorate whos going to testify that you paid him off hes going to name dates and amounts and what you wanted him not to see each time is he jamiesons laugh had a wheezy sound to it you know lucille cheever personally no moss said and lou jamieson laughed again dryly moss went on i know who she is though she ran the leading sporting house in berlin and had for years thatll do jamieson stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one ask her about lieutenant szymanski and yolanda she can name dates and amounts and what the damn polack got each time he has a wife and twins down in pennsylvania you hit him with that what you want to bet he loses his memory yolanda moss echoed jamieson nodded yolanda big blond gal his hands shaped an hourglass big jugs too gotta be better than what he was getting at home course hes no bargain himself he knows we know about yolanda hell shut up ill take care of it moss didnt write down lucille cheevers name he knew he would remember itand the less in writing when he went on the shady side of the street the better what else they got jamieson inquired unless somebodys pulling a fast one on me hes their heavy artillery jamieson snorted contemptuously dumb assholes moss knew what that was likely to mean he hadnt studied occupation law to help real crooks wiggle off the hook but you couldnt turn down clients because you thought they were guilty jamieson went on if szymanskis all theyve got well kick their asses see you over in london he fired up another cigarette and swaggered out of the office and how do i explain talking to lucille cheever to laura moss wondered he knew he would have to tell her if he didnt and she found out later that would be worse he sighed northwestern law school hadnt covered all the points of legal ethics it might have the telephone rang jonathan moss he said crisply it was occupation headquarters in galt announcing a delay in a case there the prosecutor was in the hospital with a case of boils how biblical moss murmured the officer on the other end of the line hung up on him chuckling he went back to work his next client came in fifteen minutes later clementine schmidt was embroiled in what looked to be a permanent property dispute with the occupation authorities appeals over what was and what wasnt acceptable documentation that she owned the property she claimed to own dragged on and on since the war ended military judges had changed their minds at least four times all in all it was not the usas finest hour in handling canadian affairs miss schmidt moss couldnt blame men for fighting shy of marrying such a disputatious woman brandished a letter in a voice ringing with triumph she declared i have found my cousin maximilian have you moss blinked shed been talking about maximilian for years hed always assumed her cousin had died in the war but she nodded yes i have she said triumphantly he fought in the rockies and was badly wounded there that is why he never came home it had nothing to do with you amazing moss thought his client went on he settled in a town called kamloops in british columbia and he remembers very well the situation of the property she thrust the letter at him he rapidly read through it when hed finished he nodded well definitely show this to the appellate judge when the time comes he said miss schmidt beamed the letter was in fact a lot less ironclad that she seemed to think cousin maximilian recalled that the family had owned the property in question once upon a time he had no new documentation to prove that if hed lived out in kamloops since being wounded it wasnt likely that he would clementine schmidt was still elated that shed found good old cousin max moss let her chortle then eased her out of the office he poured himself more coffee once she finally left he was still drinking it when the postman knocked on the door here you are mr moss the fellow said and dumped a pile of envelopes on what had been a nearly clean desk thanks moss surveyed the pile with something less than joy unalloyed he sorted through the days mail separating it into piles papers related to cases advertisements payments only a couple of thoseand why was he not surprised and things he couldnt readily classify he opened a plain envelope in that miscellaneous pile then unfolded the sheet of paper inside it neatly printed on it in large letters were the words we have not forgotten about you you yank son of a bitch we have not forgotten about your whore or her brat either he stared in dismay since the bombing of occupation headquarters he hadnt had a missive like this hed hoped he wouldnt considering what had happened to occupation headquarters he couldnt very well ignore it whoever was behind this had proved he was playing for keeps his hand trembled as he reached for the telephone and rang up galt as bad luck would have it he was connected to the officer with whom hed cracked wise about the military prosecutors boils youre not so goddamn funny when you need the army are you the other american said well maybe not moss admitted im no fonder of being blown up than anybody else shows how much gratitude your clients have the officer said i doubt my clients are behind this moss said stiffly the gibe stung all the same he didnt know why canadians wanted him dead either hed spent his whole career fighting their legal battlesand winning quite a few of them and this was the thanks he got bring in the paper the man in galt said well run it through the lab i doubt theyll come up with anything but you never know till you try ill do it moss said doing it right away meant canceling a meeting he canceled it whoever was doing this moss wanted him caught he didnt like living in fear somebody out there though didnt care what he liked vi spring and snow went together in quebec lucien galtier drove with exaggerated care he knew the chevrolet would skid if he did anything heroic which was to say stupid or abrupton an icy road the point of going to a dance after all was getting there in one piece he wondered if he would have thought the same as a young buck courting marie of course back in those days before the turn of the century only a few millionaires had had motorcars it was hard to do anything too spectacularly idiotic in a carriage marie his hands tightened on the steering wheel she was seven years dead and half the time it felt as if she were just around the corner visiting neighbors and would be back any minute the other half galtier knew she was gone all right and the knowledge was knives in his soul those were the black days hed heard time was supposed to heal such wounds maybe it did the knives now didnt seem to have serrated edges a right turn a left and yes there was the path leading to franзois berlinguets farmhouse and even more to the point to the barn nearby plenty of other autos and carriages and wagons sat by the house lucien found a vacant spot he turned off his headlights and got out of the chevrolet snow crunched under his shoes lamplight spilled out of the barn door so did the sweet strains of fiddle music then suddenly a whole band joined in galtier shook his head in bemusement back in his courting days nobody had owned a phonograph either music meant real live musicians it still couldthose fiddlers were real live human beings but it didnt have to not any more the band stopped people in the barn laughed and clapped their hands then the music started up againsomeone must have turned the record over or put a new one on the phonograph the live fiddlers joined in lucien blinked against the bright lights inside the barn hed got used to the darkness driving over couples dipped and swirled in the cleared space in the middle men and women watched from the edges of the action some perched on chairs others leaned against the wall quite a few of them were holding mugs of cider or beer or applejack galtier sidled toward a table not far from the fiddlers and the phonograph berlinguets wife madeleine a smiling woman of about fortyfive gave him a mug he sipped it was cider cider with a stronger kick than beer merci he said she nodded when the next tune ended franзois berlinguet who was a few years older than madeleine pointed toward lucien and here we have the most eligible bachelor in all of the county of temiscouata monsieur lucien galtier his red face and raucous voice said hed been drinking a lot of that potent cider the drunker the people were the louder they cheered and clapped their hands god knows what a liar you are franзois and so do i lucien said berlinguet bowed as if at a compliment galtier got a laugh his host got a bigger one trouble was it hadnt been altogether a lie ever since hed lost marie widows had been throwing themselves at galtier so had the daughters and granddaughters of friends acquaintances and optimistic strangers he felt no urgent need for a second wife hed done his best to make that plain no one seemed to want to listen to him even though the phonograph was quiet the fiddlers struck up a tune people began to dance again what lucien noticed was how harsh and ragged the music seemed when he was young people had enjoyed whatever music their neighbors made some was better some not quite so good but what difference did it make it made a difference now people measured neighbors music not by the standards of other neighbors music but against the professionals who made records what would have been fine a couple of generations before was anything but now were spoiled lucien thought that hadnt occurred to him before which made it no less true berlinguet came over to him will you be a wallflower he teased if i want to galtier answered i can do just about anything i want to it seems to me i have the years for it but you will break the hearts of all the pretty girls here his host said how can they dance with you if you will not dance now that my friend that is a truly interesting question lucien said and now i have another question for you as well is it that they wish to dance with me or is it that they wish to dance with my farm and my electricity and my chevrolet franзois berlinguet did him the courtesy of taking him seriously it could be that some of them do wish to dance with the farm and the other things but you know it could also be that some of them wish to dance with you will you take away their chance along with that of the others i do not know galtier shrugged a gallic shrug truly i do not the trouble is how do i tell with a certainty the ones from the others before berlinguet could answer dr leonard odoull and galtiers daughter nicole walked into the barn with his long angular body and fair irishlooking face odoull always looked like a stranger in a crowd of quebecois but he wasnt a stranger here he must have treated at least half the people in the barn men and women swarmed up to him some wanted to talk about their aches and pains more though wanted to talk politics or gossip even if he did still sound a littleand only a littlelike the american he was hed made a place for himself in and around riviиreduloup eventually he and nicole came over to galtier as franзois berlinguet had odoull said youre not dancing mon beaupиre do you think you will wear out all the sweet young things it could be lucien answered it could also be that i think they will wear me out when i want to dance i will dance and if i do not care to well who will make me nicole grabbed his left hand when she did her husband plucked the mug of cider out of his right hand i will make you she said and dragged him out toward the middle of the floor you dont need to wonder why i want to dance with you either she understood him very well he wagged a finger at her yes i know why you want to dance with me you want to make me look like a fool in front of the entire neighborhood how is it that you have come down here from town i talked with madeleine berlinguet when she came up to sell some chickens and she invited us nicole answered before too long you know little lucien will want to start coming to dances too the idea that his grandson would soon be old enough to want to dance with girls rocked galtier back on his heels had it really been so many years since little lucien was born it had sure enough when the music startedfiddlers playing along with the phonographhe had to remember where his feet went nicole didnt lead too obviously for which he was grateful and once hed been dancing a little while he discovered he was having a good time he didnt intend to admit that but it was true after the song an import from the usa with lyrics translated into french ended leonard odoull came out and tapped galtier on the shoulder excuse me mon beaupиre but i am going to dance this next dance with my wife you think so do you galtier asked in mock anger then what am i to do return to wallflowerdom is that a word his soninlaw looked dubious you can go back if you like or you can find some other lady and dance with her such choices you give me i am not worthy galtier said and leonard odoull snorted now lucien did feel like dancing he touched a woman on the shoulder he smiled hello йloise may i have this dance mais certainement lucien йloise granche was a widow of about nicoles age shed lost her husband in a train wreck a little before lucien lost marie if he hadnt known her before he would have thought that was what gave her an air of calm perhaps too firmly held in fact shed always been like that philippe granche had drunk like a fish maybe that had more to do with it the music started again galtier took her in his arms she was two or three inches shorter than marie had been and plumper too but not so much that she didnt make a pleasant armful she danced well lucien had to remind himself he needed to say such things and you she told him when he did after a moment she asked is this your first time since she let that hang but galtier understood perfectly well what she meant no not quite he answered but it still seems very strange how long have you been dancing now a couple of years йloise said yes it is strange isnt it with philippe i always knew just what he would do other people are surprises one after another yes he nodded they certainly seem to be and not only on the dance floor either the world is a different place now it certainly is for me she said i wasnt so sure it would be for a man oh yes for this man anyhow galtier didnt think hed ever spoken of his love for marie outside the bosom of his family he didnt intend to start now even saying so much was more than hed thought he would do йloise granche seemed to know what he meant even when he didnt say it she said you have to go on its very hard at first but you have to he nodded again so ive seen it was hard at first he hadnt spoken of that even with his family there had been weeksmonthswhen he hadnt wanted to get out of bed let alone get on with his life the music stopped thank you for asking me йloise said that was very pleasant i thought so too lucien hesitated he hadnt talked with anyone who knew what he was talking about before shed traveled down the same road as he after the hesitation he plunged shall we also dance the next one id like to she said briskly weve both made the same journey havent we i was just thinking that very thing he said in surprise when he and marie had the same thought at the same time hed taken it for granted why not theyd spent forty years living in each others pockets when he did it with a near stranger that was a surprise йloises shrug said it astonished her less than him it springs from what we were talking about i think the fiddlers began to play she swayed forward they started dancing again this time without words galtier wondered what marie would say probably something like try not to step on her toes the way you always did on mine йloises eyes were closed as they spun around the barn her expression said she might have been listening to someone who wasnt there too but she was also very much with lucien when the music stopped this time they both walked over to the table to get some cider they stood by the wall talking of this and that through the next danceand the next but galtier didnt feel like a wallflower any more the uss remembrance steamed south accompanied by a couple of destroyers and a heavy cruiser lieutenant junior grade sam carsten smeared zincoxide ointment on his nose and the backs of his hands he knew he would burn anyhow but he wouldnt burn so badly this way off to the east rose the bleak almost lunar landscape of baja california the remembrance and her companions sailed outside the threemile limit the empire of mexico claimed but not very far outside it their guns and the carriers aeroplanes could have smashed up that coast or whatever little gunboats the mexicans sent out to challenge them but the mexicans sent out nothing cabo san lucas wasnt much of a port no actually that wasnt true it had the makings of a fine harboror it would have if only there were any fresh water close by since there wasnt the protected bay went to waste except for an old gunboat or two and a few fishing trawlers sam turned to lieutenant commander harrison the assistant officer of the deck sir may i make a suggestion go ahead carsten roosevelt harrison replied the annapolis ring on the younger officers finger explained why he was where he was and sam was where he was thank you sir replied sam whod never expected to become an officer at all when he joined the navy a few years before the great war started the confederates have a naval base at guaymas sir where we are and where were headed they might want to use us to give their submersible skippers some practice they arent supposed to have any submersibles the assistant ood said yes sir i know that sir carsten said and said no more harrison considered after a few seconds he said you may have a point i wouldnt trust those bastards as far as i could throw em he cupped his hands in front of his mouth and raised his voice to a shout attention on deck all hands be alert for submarines in the neighborhood sailors hurried to the edge of the deck and peered in all directions shielding their eyes from the glare of the sun with their palms lieutenant commander harrison gave his attention back to sam a good thought i dont believe theyd try anything even if they do have boats in the water but youre rightstalking us would give them good practice what happens if somebody does spot a periscope carsten asked do we drop ashcans on the submersible thats a damn good question and im glad the skippers the one whos got to answer it harrison said my guess would be no the confederates arent allowed to have any submersibles but how do we know whatever we spot isnt flying maximilians flag he and sam exchanged wry grins the empire of mexico could no more build submarines than it could aeroplane carriers but where a boat was built had nothing to do with whose flag she flew i dont suppose we can tell sir sam allowed still if it looks like a boats getting ready to fire something then were liable to have a war on our hands the assistant ood shivered though the day was fine and warm till i see a wake in the water i wont order an attack on any submarine we spot if the skipper has a different notion thatll be up to him sometimes not having rank was a comfort sam knew that from his days as a petty officer if you werent important enough to give any really important orders you couldnt get into really big trouble when he was a petty officer he would have figured a lieutenant commander had the clout to screw up in a big way from harrisons point of view though that exalted status belonged only to the skipper of course harrison wasnt thinking small he was talking about starting a war back in sams pettyofficer days he couldnt have imagined a decision with that much riding on it even though hed clawed his way up to officers rank carrying that much responsibility still didnt seem real to him it must have to lieutenant commander harrison though a little later sam saw him talking on a telephone line that led straight to the bridge and not too long after that elevators started lifting aeroplanes from the hangars belowdecks pilots raced to the aeroplanes some of them putting on goggles as they ran the remembrance turned into the wind what there was of it one after another the aeroplanes roared off the flight deck were they hunting submersibles too carsten couldnt think of anything else they might have in mind maybe captain stein thought that if the confederates were getting in some training he might as well do the same thing or maybe the skipper just believed in wearing both suspenders and belt in his place sam knew he would have he wished he could hang around the wireless shack and find out what the aeroplanes were seeing but the skipper chose that moment to sound general quarters maybe it was a drill undoubtedly most of the crew would figure it was but maybe too one of the pilots had spotted something that made him jumpy the remembrance had been a nervous ship going through the straits of florida a few years before and for many of the reasons also relevant today sams generalquarters station was deep in the bowels of the ship he sighed as he hurried down to it he still wished he had another post besides damage control hed been stuck with it for years now but that didnt mean he liked it he wished he could see could be part of what the ship was doing against its enemies cleaning up the mess after the guns and aeroplanes had failed to stop trouble was a lot less appealing it was to him anyhow some people wouldnt have done anything else some people fancied sauerkraut toono accounting for taste lieutenant commander pottinger found damage control fascinating he probably liked sauerkraut too though carsten had never asked him about that by now hiram pottinger had had more than a year to learn the ropes around the remembrance he really led the damagecontrol party which he hadnt when he first boarded the carrier part of sam chafed at losing the responsibility that had been his the rest insisted hed never wanted that particular responsibility in the first place do you know anything carsten pottinger asked have any idea why the captain called us to general quarters you like to hang around on the flight deck by the way he said it that was a faintlyor maybe more than faintly reprehensible habit for a damagecontrol man to have sam told what hed seen and heard pottinger frowned do you think its the real mccoy sir i dont know for sure one way or the other carsten answered all i know is it could be the mccoy yes pottinger nodded emphatically of course thats the way we have to treat every generalquarters callsomething to remember he spoke now to the seamen and petty officers in the party not to sam their nods held varying degrees of impatience they knew the truth of that better than he did most of them had served on the remembrance when the war with japan broke out pottinger hadnt as far as sam knew he hadnt seen combat the damagecontrol party waited down there in what they knew could easily become their tomb a torpedo hit in the engine room and the light bulbs that were the only illumination in this world of narrow steel corridors smelling of paint and oil and sweat would go out trapping them in the darkness while all too probably the sea surged in around them maybe my trouble is too much imagination sam thought unhappily damage controls no place for somebody who sees all the things that can go wrong before they do but that thought had hardly crossed his mind before the allclear sounded as always sighs of relief accompanied it if they seemed more heartfelt than usual this time well they did that was all reprehensible habit or not sam made a beeline for the flight deck as soon as he could leave his station he soon found out the call to general quarters had been a drill and hadnt sprung from sighting a submersible or anything else that could have been hostile that was all to the good on steamed the remembrance into the gulf of california she was scrupulous about staying outside the territorial waters of both the empire of mexico and the confederate states legally speaking she was as much on the high seas as she would have been halfway out from san francisco to the sandwich islands somehow though neither the mexicans nor the confederates seemed to feel that way a rusty gunboat flying the mexican flag chugged out from la paz to look her over a confederate coastdefense battleship a much more serious threat steamed into the gulf from guaymas on the open sea the remembrance could easily have outrun her here in these narrow waters the slow but heavily armored and armed ship had no trouble sticking close and as they had in the straits of florida aeroplanes flew over the remembrance her own machines leaped into the air to warn off the intruders the confederacy was supposed to have no military aeroplanes but carsten waited for another generalquarters call in his time as a seaman and petty officer hed served the carriers fiveinch guns these days they fired at aeroplanes as well as aiming at targets on land and sea when the alarm didnt come sam drifted over to the wireless shack he let out a snort when he found out the strange aeroplanes overhead were labeled confederate citrus company whats so funny sir asked a wireless operator a youngster who hadnt been aboard on that earlier cruise thats the same outfit that eyeballed us when we sailed between florida and cuba carsten answered do the confederates even grow citrus over by guaymas damned if i know uh sir the operator said sam didnt know either he did know the land there would have to be more fertile than the sorry sunbaked soil of baja california to give anybody even half a chance he didnt know the confederate citrus company was a smoke screen to get around the military restrictions the armistice had imposed on the csa he didnt know but hed wondered even back in the gulf of mexico and the caribbean here in the gulf of california he went from wondering to downright suspicion the wireless operator said sir shall we remind the skipper the names the same now as it was then hes bound to remember sam said but then yes go ahead and remind him it cant hurt and it might do some good he went back out to the flight deck the aeroplanes from the confederate citrus company seemed about as swift and maneuverable as the ones that had sprung into the air from the remembrances flight deck why would an outfit that dealt with oranges and lemons and limes need machines like that carsten didnt know but he got more suspicious about twenty minutes later the aeroplanes that had flown out from the coast of sonora suddenly went back the way theyd come rumor which flew faster than any aeroplane said captain stein had warned them he would have his pilots shoot them down if they lingered sam didnt know if the rumor was true if it was he didnt know if it was connected to the reminder but when he got the news he said only one word good through the coffeehouses front window nellie jacobs watched a tweedy man come out of the cobblers shop across the street the fellows long lean face bore an unhappy expression she wasnt surprised the shop had gone to the dogs in the more than three years since her husband whod had charge of it from not long after the turn of the century passed away the tweedy man crossed the street heading her way he almost walked in front of an auto the horns angry bray pierced the plate glass nellie wasnt sure the man even realized the horn had been aimed at him once safe on the sidewalk again he took a notebook out of a jacket pocket consulted it and then headed for her door she brightened business hadnt been brisk this morning business hadnt been brisk a lot of mornings lately or afternoons either the man pulled at the door when he should have pushed realizing his mistake he tried again the bell over the door rang what can i get you sir nellie asked from behind the counter oh by the surprise in his voice he hadnt thought of ordering anything then he nodded to himself deciding he would a a cup of coffee please he set a dime in front of nellie tiny and shiny in silver theodore roosevelts toothy grin stared up at her here you are she gave him the cup cream and sugar right there she didnt bother pointing them out to most people but he might not have noticed without help thank you he said and used them after a sudden pleased smile at the coffee he asked excuse me but were you acquainted with the gentleman who used to run the cobblers shop across the street mr uhhe paused to check that little notebook againharold jacobs was i acquainted with him nellie echoed scorn in her voice i should hope i was arent i the mother of his daughter oh the tweedy man brightened is that why he wasnt there then is he here may i speak with him please she eyed him with even more scorn than shed used while speaking good luck pal i wish i could he died in who the devil are you anyway my name is maynard g ferguson mrs jacobs ferguson used the title with some hesitation as if unsure she deserved it she gave him a dirty look he hurried on i am a professor of history at the university of pittsburgh im studying the way the united states gathered intelligence in confederateoccupied washington would you know anything about that i hope i would nellie answered havent i got my own order of remembrance first class put on me by teddy roosevelt his own self for the help i gave hal during the war what do you need to know order of remembrance first class out came the notebook again after peering into it maynard ferguson said then you would be nellie semphroch not now she said as if to an idiot you said it yourselfim nellie jacobs yes of course ferguson scribbled in the little book then you would know how information was smuggled out of the city and over to the us lines i know pigeons were a part of it nellie said there was a fellow named oh what was his name lou pfeiffer that was it a fellow named lou pfeiffer who used to keep them you could ask him about the details mr pfeiffer unfortunately is deceased he died in professor ferguson flipped through the pages of the notebook in in any case i am not chiefly concerned with the pigeons i am interested in the man to whom mr jacobsand every other man in the washington spy ringreported a mr william reach were you by any chance acquainted with him ice ran through nellie with bill reach she said through lips suddenly numb i knew him a little bit but only a little bit and you cant prove anything else god damn it not now you cant why do you want to know about him in particular primarily because hes such a man of mystery maynard ferguson replied he conducted such an important intelligence campaign throughout the occupation then disappeared without a trace just before us soldiers retook washington dc ive been on the trail of that mystery for more than ten years now ever since i started doing research on this topic and im still hoping to get to the bottom of it well you wont not from me youve just come to the end of the trail nellie could have told what she knew or at least some of it it was safe enough now with hal dead but shed been keeping the secret so long hugging it so tightly to herself that letting go of it never once crossed her mind she said my best guess is he was killed in the shelling an awful lot of people were ferguson looked disappointed it could be i suppose somehow though i want to believe he had a more dramatic end and that someone still living knows what it was he doesnt strike me as the type who would have gone quietly a more dramatic end he did nellie still remembered the feel of the knife as she drove it into bill reachs chest and somebody does know sure enough but you never will if you dont know what happened to him could you at least speak to what he was like the man from pittsburgh asked i didnt like him he wasnt a gentleman and he drank too much nellie said and every word of that was true i have no idea how he got to be a spy he was a reporter wasnt he back in the days before the war yes thats correct with the starnews ferguson said how did you know you are the first person with whom i have spoken who did i used to know him back then nellie answered unwillingly ive lived in washington all my life i was herei think i was five or maybe sevenwhen the confederates shelled us during the second mexican war it was in maynard ferguson said maybe he was expecting her to tell him how old shed been then from which he could figure out exactly how old she was now she wondered if hed ever had anything to do with women before after a moment realizing she wasnt going to do anything of the sort he asked were you romantically involved with mr reach no nellie said at once with great firmness there hadnt been anything romantic about what passed between them in one hotel room or another hed laid his money on the dresser and then shed done what he paid for later during the war hed decided that meant there was something between the two of them nellie knew better she added he drank too much even way back then did he how interesting by the way professor ferguson said it the news really did interest him impressive how he ran and organized a sophisticate spy ring while at the same time battling his drunkenness i dont know whats so impressive about it nellie said with a sniff i saw him sitting right where you are when he was too drunk to know who i was even though hed known me before she didnt want to put that pause there but couldnt help herself you cant make me believe that was good for what he was doing but information from washington kept right on getting to philadelphia even so the professor said yes and it kept right on getting to philadelphia even when your precious bill reach spent time in jail on account of he stole something or other or at least the confederates thought he did nellie said ferguson scribbled furiously thats fascinating he said its something else i hadnt heard of too i wonder if confederate records survive to confirm your statement hard to guess much was destroyed in the bombardment and reach also might have used an alias with them but its another avenue to explore how do you suppose the ring continued to function with reach in custody ill tell you howthrough my hal thats how nellie answered proudly you know tr gave him a distinguished service cross i expect he didnt win that for playing tiddlywinks im sure he didnt ferguson said i wish he were alive today so i could ask him about this entire important period i wish he was alive today because i loved him and i miss him when she first said shed marry hal there at the end of the great war she hadnt dreamt how true that would be what occasionally passed in their bedroom had next to nothing to do with itwith the large exception of causing clara who was the biggest surprise and one of the most pleasant nellie had ever got what made it true was that hal had been a good man and even nellie who had no use for the male half of the human race couldnt possibly have had a different opinion im sorry the professor said he was just being polite though nellie could tell he asked is there anyone else who could possibly shed light on the way william reach met his end in if that is what happened to him i cant think of anybody else nellie answered which again was nothing but the truth no one had been anywhere close by when reach tried to rape her and she killed him but professor ferguson had ideas of his own what about your daughter ednaflip flip flip went the notebook pagessemphroch even with his fancy research he still got things wrong shes been edna grimes for a long time now nellie said and i guarantee she doesnt know anything about that she did know about nellies scandalous background though would she tell some professor what she knew nellie didnt think so but wasnt a hundred percent sure edna had a mean streak in her that came out now and again didnt she receive aflip flip flipan order of remembrance second class at the same time as you were given your decoration ferguson asked how can she be ignorant with that background nellie laughed in his face easy as pie thats how she worked here with me and sometimes id pass on things she told me things she heard and i didnt thats what she got her medal for she wouldve married a confederate officer you know if an artillery bombardment hadnt killed him on the way to the altar oh ferguson sounded faintly disappointedand more than faintly revolted he was old enough to have fought in the great war like most men who were he had no love for the confederate states he also seemed to have little understanding for what the people of washington whod lived under confederate occupation for more than two years had gone through during that time nellie wasnt surprised few who hadnt lived here then did understand you see any which way nellie didnt want ferguson talking to edna nobody knows nothing about bill reach maynard ferguson sighed i suppose not i hope you realize how frustrating this is for me im sorry said nellie who was anything but nothing i can do about it though nothing i will do about it anyway the professor left the coffeehouse head down shoulders slumped nellie put his cup in the sink shed never dreamt anybody would come poking after bill reach but it didnt matter in the end it truly didnt only she knew the answeronly she knew literally enough where the body was buriedand she wasnt talking not now not ever an aeroplane buzzed over the charles xi as the french liner approached the confederate coast anne colleton glanced up at the machine which roared past low enough for her to make out the words confederate citrus company painted on the fuselage in big bright orange letters the lines of the aeroplane suggested falcon much more than grouse she wondered why a citrus company needed such a swift deadlylooking aircraft beside her colonel jeanhenri jusserand watched the aeroplane speed back toward the virginia coast the frenchman said i suspect it would not be too very difficult to fit this aeroplane with weapons would you not agree mademoiselle colleton i would agree that am i an idiot anne replied also in french i should have seen that for myself she kicked at the decking angry at missing something so obvious but colonel jusserand stopped just in time anne sent him a sour look hed been about to say something like but you are only a woman mademoiselle colleton so how could you be expected to notice such a thing then fortunately hed remembered anne had spent the last two years in paris dickering with some of the more prominent people in action franзaisenot always the people with fancy titles but those who could promise results and mean it with wry amusement anne thought but you are only a boy colonel jusserand so how could you be expected to know anything jusserand was in his midthirties as young as he could be and still have fought in the great war he paid attention to anne as a negotiator but never once to her as a woman she had fifteen years on him give or take a couple most of the officers with whom shed dealt were close contemporaries of the boyish colonel action franзaise had so far done a better job of pruning deadwood from the french army than the freedom party had of purging the confederate army the charles xi pressed on toward norfolk more aeroplanes buzzed by to examine the liner all of them said confederate citrus company they shared the same sleek dangerous look colonel jusserand asked will there be an open display of these machines at the olympic games i dont know anne said im a stranger here myself that held more truth than she felt comfortable admitting shed enjoyed her two years in france she thought shed helped her country while she was there but with virginia in sight once more she had to remember what shed worked so hard to forget that her time out of the csa had also been an exile of sorts july in norfolk brought memory flooding back though she was close to two hundred miles north of st matthews the heat and humidity reminded her all too much of home shed never known weather like this in paris she wouldnt have been sorry not to renew acquaintance either when the customs men saw her passport and colonel jusserands they very quickly became very respectful youre on our list sir maam one of them said touching the brim of his cap he wore a snappier uniform than he would have when she left the confederate states one that made him look like a soldier rather than a functionary our good list i meanweve got train tickets to richmond waiting for both of you and well get you to the station fast as we can he kept his promise too anne wondered what sort of treatment she would have got had her name been on a different sort of list she was just as glad not to have to find out sweating in his brown wool uniform colonel jusserand let out a sigh of relief when their railroad car proved airconditioned anne found herself less delighted too cold seemed as unpleasant as too hot but she could add clothes for more warmth she couldnt take them off outside not if she wanted to stay decent with a cloud of coal smoke erupting from the stack the locomotive began to roll jusserand stared at the countryside which he was seeing for the first time how very many tractors and other farm machines there are he remarked anne nodded more than i remember seeing before i went to france she said a lot more as a matter of fact then there would have been nothing but sharecroppers working the land sharecroppers had come out in english she thought for a moment before coming up with a french equivalent tenant farmers with so many machines who needs men colonel jusserand said where do you suppose the tenant farmers have gone that was a good question anne answered it with no more than a shrug for she didnt know either she did know most of the displaced sharecroppers were colored was it like this all over the csa or just in this stretch of virginia she couldnt guess if this went on nationwide what would the confederacy do with all the displaced negroes one more question she couldnt answer but remembering what negroes had done to the marshlands plantation remembering what theyd almost done to her she hoped they got everything they deserved night was falling when the train pulled into richmond from the south as soon as anne descended to the platform someone called her name all she had to do was answer as before uniformed men whisked her and colonel jusserand away she barely had time to note how many people in the station spoke with yankee accentsmen and women down from the usa to see the olympic gamesbefore she and the frenchman were in a motorcar bound for the gray house no waiting in the waiting room this time either jake featherston saw them right away congratulations he told anne ive read every report you sent you did a firstrate job over there firstrate i tell you he stuck out his hand and gave colonel jusserand a big friendly smile and im damned pleased to meet you colonel action franзaisehe didnt butcher the french too badlyis doing the same thing for your country that the freedom party is for this one yes i think so too jusserand spoke good english though annes french was even better revenge is a sweet word is it not he couldnt have said anything better calculated to hit the confederate president where he lived oh yes featherston said softly oh yes indeed none sweeter so we will be able to count on france when the day comes that depends jusserand answered can we count on the csa if we first find that day here was something anne hadnt seen before someone hustling jake featherston like you said that depends the president spoke carefully you start a fight with the germans tomorrow afternoon well have to sit outwe arent ready yet you give us the chance to get ready well back you all the way in paris anne and the frenchmen with whom shed dealt had gone round and round over that the kaisers government watched the french as carefully as the united states watched the confederate states maybe more carefully colonel jusserand thought so he said you have the advantage over us you are a large country with more room to hide what you do not want your neighbors to see with us les boches could be anywhere at any time since weve been good little boys i dont know what youre talking about featherston answered even his grin didnt make those long bony features handsome but a smiling jake featherston made handsomer men seem insipid anne had thought so since the first time she met him back in the days when she thought she could control him she wasnt wrong very often when she was she wasnt wrong in a small way how fortunate you are to have these olympic games jusserand murmured you show your own people and the world the confederate states are once more a nation to be reckoned with thats right thats just exactly right featherston said youre a pretty sharp fellow arent you colonel the french officer did his best to look modest his best as anne had seen was unconvincing she asked how serious are the negro uprisings mr president some of the stories i heard in paris played them down the others made it sound as bad as thats crap its nothing like nothing you hear featherstons voice was hard and cold more than a nuisance less than real trouble you know what i mean bad enough so the usa couldnt say no when we asked to beef up the army a bitand we may beef it up a bit more than the damnyankees know about he sounds pleased the blacks are trying to hit back anne realized he expected them to and he was ready to take advantage of it she eyed the confederate president with respect no less genuine for being reluctant he always seemed to see a move or two further than anybody else featherston went on but the hell with that for now colonel jusserand looked shocked hed never have sworn in front of a woman featherston said youre here in richmond when weve got the olympics you want to enjoy yourselves right here he scribbled on a couple of sheets of paper from a pad on his desk then handed one to anne the other to the frenchman passes to whatever you want to see go on over to the ticket bureau and exchange em anybody gives you a hard time about it let me know ill make the son of a bitch pay no one gave anne anything close to a hard time she found that instructive people in the csa took featherstons orders seriouslyor at least theyd learned they would be sorry if they didnt anne rode a bus to the enormous olympic stadium on the northern outskirts of town it hadnt existed when shed left the country two years earlier now the great bowl of marble and concrete confederate and party flags aflutter all around the rim dominated the skyline in that part of richmond other olympic buildings and the village where the athletes lived surrounded the stadium in the stands near her anne heard american accents from both csa and usa clipped british tones irish brogues and people speaking french german spanish italian and several languages she didnt recognize for that matter she had trouble following some of the french she heard when the couple with the odd accent cheered the athletes from the republic of quebec she understood why black men from haiti and liberia competed along with everyone else when a haitian sprinter won a bronze medal jake featherston looked as if hed swallowed a big swig of lemon juice in france anne had heard hed had to accept the negroes participation on equal terms like it or not otherwise the games would have gone elsewhere she wondered how furious featherston was and whether he could extract any sort of revenge on the international olympic committee but that was a question only a handful of insiders would know about to most citizens of the confederate states to most of the swarms of visitors from abroad all that mattered was whether the olympics came off well by that standard featherston and the csa were doing fine a confederate runner narrowly beat a man from the usa in the meter run the crowd went wild anne clapped and yelled as loud as anyone else she would never be behindhand in cheering for confederate victories over the damnyankees she wished there were more of them and on fields different from the track one of these days she thought maybe one of these days before too long with a grunt clarence potter rose from the seat hed been occupying for what seemed like forever he hadnt wanted to pay for a pullman berth from charleston up to the confederate capital now he was paying in a different way with a sore back and with eyes gritty from lack of sleep his seat had reclined but not far enough hed managed to doze a bit on the way north but he hadnt got nearly enough rest as he stood and grabbed his carpetbag from the rack above his head the weight of the pistol in the shoulder holster reminded him of the weapons presence he wondered if freedom party goons would be waiting for him when he got off the train if they were theyd be sorry but no one troubled him on the platform or in the station he hurried through the cavernous building and got to the cab stand outside ahead of most of the other passengers whod had to go to the baggage car to retrieve their suitcases where to pal asked the driver of the frontmost cab when potter got in the fellow added freedom freedom potter echoed hating the word he felt the weight of the pistol again fords hotel across from capitol square right you are the cabby put his autoa middleaged ford imported from the usainto gear waiting for an opening in the traffic you here for the olympics thats right among other things clarence potter thought i know they started a couple of days ago but i couldnt get away from work till now these days you hold on tight to a job if youve got one hed had more flexibility than he let on but the driver didnt need to know that the fellow nodded aint it the truth he said even this lousy jobi couldnt very well leave could i not if i want my kids to eat i couldnt business was crummy till the games started tooyoud best believe that oh i do potter said solemnly times arent easy anywhere yeah the driver pulled away from the curb behind him the next cab moved up to wait for a passenger richmond had changed since potter last saw it of course that had been during the dark days at the end of the great war when us bombers were methodically knocking the confederate capital flat now it seemed so fresh and clean someone might have rubbed the buildings and even the sidewalks with soap and water and maybe someone had to give visitors the impression jake featherston wanted them to have potter wouldnt have been surprised freedom party stalwarts stood on every other corner they werent wearing their usual bludgeons and were giving strangers directions how long would they stay on their best behavior till the olympics were over no doubt and not a minute longer in capitol square a mitcheltownwhat the damnyankees called a blackfordburgh a shantytown full of people whod lost their jobs and lost their homeshad flourished for years it was gone now with no sign it had ever existed where were those people were they all working potter laughed under his breath not likely but they were out of sight which was what mattered to the present masters of the csa fords hotel was a great white pile of a building with confederate flags flying everywhere on it the cab wheezed to a stop in front of the entrance potter gave the driver half a dollar which included a dime tip he carried his bag up the low stairs leading into the hotel and past the doorman an immensely tall immensely fat negro in a uniform gaudier than any the cs army issued potter recalled the getup from his wartime visits to richmond though he didnt think this was the same man wearing it he checked in got his room key and put his clothes on hangers and into drawers as if he were an ordinary traveler then he went downstairs again and spent five cents for a copy of the richmond whig which gave him a schedule of olympic events president featherston will watch the swimming competition tomorrow one story said to cheer on richmonds own peter dawson who will be aiming for the gold medal in the and meters potter nodded slowly to himself the swimming stadium would be a good place to try much smaller than the great bowl where the athletes competed in track and field every story in the paper seemed to glorify featherston the freedom party the olympics richmond or all four at once what made that particularly disgusting as far as potter was concerned was that up until the freedom party took power the paper as its name showed had been strong for the whigs no more not many papers in the csa persistedor were still able to persistin opposing the freedom party and the president which is why someone has to do something potter murmured and who better than me i should have seen this coming before anybody else hell i did see it coming but i couldnt take featherston seriously my only consolation is nobody else did either without jake featherston what would happen to the freedom party nothing good potter was sure of that featherston was the glue that held it together take him away and the pieces would fly apart they would have to wouldnt they potter ate a big steak and a mess of fries in the hotel restaurant then he went up to his room and turned on the wireless it was full of stories about what elsejake featherston the freedom party the olympics richmond or all four at once the wireless stories were very smooth smoother than those in the paper whoever had put them together knew what he was doing the next morning potter ordered a plate of ham and eggs the condemned man ate a hearty meal well why not he got another taxi and took it to the swimming stadium tickets were three dollars apiecenot the worst daily wage for a working man potter set three brown banknotes on the counter took his ticket and went inside for a tense moment the smell of chlorine rising from the huge swimming pool put him in mind of great war gas attacks he had to fight down panic had to and did then he worked his way toward the presidential box he couldnt get as close as he would have liked freedom party guards in their almostarmy uniforms surrounded jake featherston potter sighed hed expected nothing different he would have to wait for his chance if it ever came he settled into his seat right by an aisle that gave him at least the illusion of a chance to get away he drummed his fingers on his thigh how long would featherston watch would he go do something else before potter found a chance youll find out potter told himself wait see what happens while he waited he watched the swimmers he cheered richmonds own peter dawson as loudly as any of the men around him with their freedom party pins hed always thought of himself as a patriot the difference was that to him confederate patriotism didnt start and stop with the party dawson didnt win the gold in the meters a swimmer from sweden did by several lengths but the hometown hero did win a silver medal better yet he outkicked a man from the usa to do it cheers rang through the swimming stadium after shaking the swedes hand dawson pulled himself from the pool and waved to the crowd frankfurters git your frankfurters twentyfive cents frankfurters the colored vendor roamed up and down the aisles hawking the sausages clarence potter handed the manwhose graying hair said they were about of an agea quarter he got back a frankfurter on a bun wrapped in waxed paper as potter unwrapped it and began to eat the negro hurried up the aisle once more frankfurters git your frankfurters the medalists got up onto the victory stand a pretty girl put the medals gold silver bronzearound their necks they all grinned and shook hands with one another a band blared out what potter presumed to be the swedish national anthem though he didnt recognize it up went the swedish flag yellow cross on blue the stars and bars and the stars and stripes rose on flagpoles to its right and left when the anthem ended the three young men descended from the platform they were still chattering excitedly peter dawson and the swimmer from the usa might have been friends maybe they were potter wondered how often theyd raced against each other how well they knew each other frankfurters twentyfive cents git your frankfurters here came the vendor again distracting potterand everyone around himfrom the joy of the moment back in the roman days vendors at the colosseum selling dormice in honey had probably made people miss the best moments of lions devouring christians the negro paused by potter taking another frankfurter from the enameled metal box he wore at his waist a sweatstained canvas strap that went around his neck supported the box leaving his hands free he handed the sausage to a woman across the aisle got back a dollar banknote and gave her three quarters in change frankfurters git your frankfurters here the vendor stopped again two or three steps farther down for a moment that meant nothing to clarence potter then he realized no one there had called or waved for a frankfurter the negro reached into the box just the same what he pulled out this time wasnt a bun wrapped in waxed paper it was a submachine gun with the stock sawed off short to make it easier to hide with a wordless shout of fury and hate he aimed it in jake featherstons direction and started shooting guards toppled wounded or dead people screamed the president of the csa went down too did he dive for cover or was he hit potter didnt know he did know the surviving guards were going to fill the negro full of lead and probably everyone around the fellow including himself with hardly any conscious thought his own pistol sprang into his hand he shot the negro in the back of the head the colored man crumpled as if all his bones had turned to mush he was surely dead before he hit the stairs by sheer luck the submachine gun didnt spray any more bullets when it clattered off the concrete you poor damned fool potter thought if youd only waited a little longer i would have tried to do it for you nowsweet jesus maybe ive gone and saved jake featherstons worthless life drop it four freedom party guards screamed the words at the same time they pointed tredegars and submachine guns of their own at potter very slowly and carefully he laid down the pistol dont shoot him somebody close by called he just killed that goddamn niggerand where the hell were you thats right someone else said voice cracking with excitement hes a hero he just saved president featherston those rifle barrels didnt waver but the guards held their fire maybe i didnt save him potter thought hopefully maybe he got one right between the eyes maybe but no jake featherston stuck his head up he had a pistol in his hand he wouldnt have been easy meat for anyone with a little luck he wont recognize me potter thought he hasnt seen me for years after all featherstons eyes widened he recognized potter all right then one of his guardswho didntsaid this guy killed the nigger who was shootin at you sir other people called potter a hero too hero here was the last thing he wanted to be but he was stuck with itand so was jake featherston back in the gray house jake featherston gulped down a whiskey and set the glass on the presidential desk across the desk from him clarence potter annoyingly calm sipped from a drink of his own jake said so you were sitting right there close to me and you just happened to have a pistol in a shoulder holster i didnt just happen to have it potter sounded annoyingly calm too im an investigator some of the things i investigate are pretty unsavory i always have a pistol where i can grab it in a hurry and you never once thought of plugging me featherston said of course not potter answered his face said if i did do you think im dumb enough to admit it a silent aide set a piece of paper on featherstons desk his gaze flicked down it when he was done he eyed potter again youve been a busy boy down in charleston havent you its a wonder youre still running around loose you come right out and admit that potter said admit what jakes smile was all teeth and no mirth you say i said ityou say i said it and you get anybody to print what you sayand ill call you a liar to your face how are you going to prove anything different potter took another sip from his drink a point he wasnt just a cool customer he was a cold fish so what the hell am i going to do with you jake wondered aloud you hate my guts but you shot that nigger before any of my guards could hed had bullets whistle past his ear before the frankfurter seller whod tried to do him in couldnt shoot worth a damn the first couple of rounds had been near misses but then the submachine gun had pulled up and to the right as such weapons did all too often ten or twelve people were hurt some of them badly but not jake and by failing the negro had handed the freedom party a whole new club with which to beat his race that could waitfor a little while anyhow what am i going to do with you featherston repeated with a shrug clarence potter said give me a medal and send me home featherston shook his head nope youd be back and who knows you might not miss if i send you home youd have to have an accident pretty damn quick you dont care what you say do you potter remarked you never did i already told you youre not going to make a liar out of me jake said tell you what ill do though since i owe you for this and since you were damn near the only officer i knew during the war who had any sense at all he leaned forward howd you like to go back in the army colonel potter in spite of potters calm faзade his eyes widened you mean that he said slowly damn right i do i can get some use out of you and so can the country about time we had some intelligence in intelligence goddammit and i can keep an eye on you that way too what do you say if i tell you no i wind up dead potter answered what do you think im going to say you can end up just as dead in a butternut uniform as you can in slacks and a jacket jake thought but he wasnt sorry potter had said yes the other man was a prim son of a bitch but he had brains and he had nerve hed proved that during the war in the swimming stadium andjakes eyes again traveled down the list of some of the things potter had done in charlestonin between times too even if hed been on the wrong side then he could do the csa a lot of good if he wanted to all right colonel featherston said well go from there then he stuck out his hand potter didnt hesitate more than a heartbeat before shaking it watching potter walk out the door with a flunky reminded jake of something else a piece of business he wondered why hed left unfinished he picked up the telephone and spoke into the mouthpiece hed taken too many orders in his time he liked giving them a lot better he had to wait a while before this order was carried out normally he didnt like waiting here though he composed himself in patience and went through some of the endless paperwork on his desk if id known how much paperwork went with the job i mightve let willy knight he president of the confederate states but he shook his head that might be funny but it wasnt true the paperwork didnt just go with the job in large measure the paperwork was the job his secretary poked her head into the office general stuart is here to see you mr president thanks lulu jakes smile was large and predatory you send him right on in in marched jeb stuart jr his back as stiff as an old man could make it he was a year or two past seventy his chin beard and hair white his uniform hanging slightly loose on a frame that had begun to shrink he looked at featherston with grayblue eyes full of hate his salute might have come from a rickety machine mr president he said tonelessly hello general featherston said that fierce grin still on his face we meet again he waved to a chair sit down i prefer to stand sit down i said jake snapped and stuart startled sank into the chair featherston nodded remember the last time you paid a call on me general you were gloating on account of i was down you reckoned i was down for good you werent quite as smart as you reckoned were you no sir jeb stuart jrs voice remained stubbornly wooden do you recollect clarence potter general stuart featherston asked doing his best to remain impassive stuart nodded featherston went on i just brought him back into the armyrank of colonel that is your privilege mr president stuart did his best not to make things easy his best wasnt going to be good enough jake had the whip hand now yeah he said it is you screwed his career over just as hard as you screwed mine and for what ill tell you for what god damn you on account of we were right thats what jeb stuart jr didnt answer during the war jake had served in a battery commanded by jeb stuart iii his son hed suspected pompey the younger stuarts colored servant of being a red hed said as much to potter jeb stuart iii had used his family influence and his fathers to get pompey off the hook the only trouble was pompey had been a red when that proved unmistakably clear jeb stuart iii had thrown his life away in combat rather than face the music and jeb stuart jr had made sure neither featherston nor potter saw another promotion through the rest of the war did you reckon id forget general stuart jake asked softly i never forget that kind of thing never you hear me i hear you mr president stuart said the high respect i hold for your office precludes my saying more for my office eh not for me featherston waited again jeb stuart jr didnt answer jake shrugged he knew the older man blamed him for jeb stuart iiis death too damn had he thought in spite of his campaign promises hed walked softly around the army up till now he hadnt been quite ready to clean house all of a sudden he wasand surviving an assassination attempt would do wonders for his popularity cushion whatever anger there might have been i accept your resignation general that struck home stuart glared hed spent fiftyfive years in the confederate army hed been a boy hero in the second mexican war and had never known or wanted any other life you dont have it you you damned upstart he burst out upstart jake knew he was one the difference between him and stuart between him and all the swarms of juniors and iiis and ivs and vs in the csawas that he was proud of it no resignation he said jeb stuart jr shook his head featherston shrugged all right with me in that case youre fired dont bother cleaning out your desk dont bother about your pension either youre finished as of now i demand a courtmartial stuart said furiously what are the charges against me damn you ive been in the army and risking my life for my country since before you were a gleam in your whitetrash fathers eye and not even the president of the confederate states of america has the power to drum me out without my day in court white trash is it featherston whispered jeb stuart jr nodded defiantly all right mr blueblood all right jake said you want charges you stinking son of a bitch ill give you charges by christ his voice rose and went harsh and rough as a rasp yeah ill give you charges charges are aiding and abetting your inbred idiot son captain jeb fucking stuart iii in hiding that his prissy little nigger called pompey was really a goddamn red ill take you down cocksucker and ill take your stinking brat down with you there wont be a place in the csa you can hide in by the time im done with you two youll stink so bad and so will he the color drained from jeb stuart jrs face it wasnt just that no one had talked to him like that in all his life but no one had ever gone for the jugular against him with such fiendish gusto he was white as typing paper when he found his voice choking out youyou wouldnt not even you would stoop so low jake smiled savagely try me you want a court thats what youll get ggive me a pen god damn you stuart said featherston did and paper to go with it the officers

from the office he slammed the door as he went jake laughed hed heard a lot of slams since becoming president this one didnt measure up to some of the others after a moment jake called lulu yes mr president his secretary said give saul goldman a buzz for me will you featherston was always polite to lulu if to nobody else tell him i want to talk with him right away when he said right away to goldman the skinny little jew who got the freedom partys message out to the country and the world took him literally he got to jakes office within five minutes what can i do for you mr president general jeb stuart jr just resigned featherston flourished the sheet of paper with the oneline message im going to tell you why he resigned too he gave goldman the story of jeb stuart iii and pompey

useless timeservers soon too thats the angle i want you to take reckon you can handle it if thats what you want mr president thats what youll get goldman said thats what i want jake featherston declared and sure as hell what he wanted he got vii jefferson pinkard stood in line at the odeum waiting to buy a ticket when he got up to the window he shoved a quarter at the fellow behind it he took the ticket and walked inside after a pause at the concession stand he went into the darkness of the theater popcorn and a dr hopper in hand he sat in the middle of a row so people going by wouldnt make him spill the popcorn or the soda as soon as he was settled he started methodically munching away no one else sat very close to him maybe because of the noise he didnt care he wasnt there for company he was there to kill a couple of hours the maroon velvet curtains slid back to either side of the stage revealing the screen in the back of the theater the projector began to hum and whir smoking is prohibited in this auditorium appeared on the screen then vanished most of the people in the odeum came from fort deposit they leaned forward almost in unison knowing the newsreel was coming up next pinkard leaned forward with them since coming to work at the alabama correctional camp p hed felt far more cut off from the world around him than he ever had up in birmingham if not for wireless and moving pictures the outside world would hardly have touched this little alabama town in richmond the olympic games came to a magnificent conclusion the announcer blared the confederate states have shown the world they are on the move again thanks to president featherston and the freedom party freedom somebody in the auditorium called and the chant rang out jeff was glad to join it but it didnt last people couldnt chant and hear what the announcer was saying at the same time confederate athletes with the cs battle flag on their shirtfronts ran and jumped and swam and flung javelins smiling they posed with medals draped around their necks president featherston posed with them shaking their hands in congratulations he turned to face the camera and said were a match for anybodymore than a match for anybody and nothings going to stop us from getting where were going suddenly the camera cut away from the athletes it lingered on the crumpled corpse of a black man and on the submachine gun half visible under his body this stinking worthless nigger tried to assassinate our beloved president who sat watching the athletic competition the announcer declared thanks to the heroism of a great war veteran he paid the price for his murderous folly another camera cut the bespectacled white man standing beside jake featherston didnt look like a veteran he put pinkard more in mind of a professor featherston spoke again those damn blacksbeg your pardon folksstabbed us in the back during the war theyre trying to do it again this time though were good and ready for em and we wont let em get away with it murmurs of agreement ran through the odeum fort deposit was in the black belt but no black faces had been visible in the theater before the lights went down indeed armed guards outside and on the roof made sure no marauding negroes would cause trouble while the motion picture played at the olympic closing ceremonies smartly turnedout confederate soldiers ringed the stadium protecting it as the guards protected the theater here aeroplanes with the words confederate citrus company painted in big letters on their sides streaked low above the stadium they flew wingtip to wingtip in formations only professional pilots who were also daredevils would have tried they could fight if they had to pinkard realized he wondered if they were great war veterans or if theyd picked up their experience flying for maximilian in the mexican civil war that didnt matter wherever theyd got it they had the right stuff so did the machines they flew sleek lowwinged metal monoplanes that made the slow sputtering canvasandwire contraptions of the great war seem like antiques by comparison after a moments pause the newsreel shifted subjects veteran steps down a card said jeb stuart jr who first came to prominence in the second mexican war more than fifty years ago has left the confederate general staff after revelations about his unfortunate role in failing to prevent the red uprising of the announcer said on the screen stuart looked ancient indeed ancient and doddering president featherston will soon name a younger more vigorous replacement other newsreel snippets showed dams rising in the tennessee river valley tractors plowing and other machines harvesting agriculture makes great strides the announcer said proudly each machine does the work of from six to six hundred lazy shiftless sharecroppers the camera panned across shabbily dressed colored men and women standing in front of shanties and in lands stolen from the csa after the war in sequoyah and the part of occupied texas miscalled houston the announcer fell silent the pictures of dust in dunes in drifts in blowing choking curtains spoke for themselves leaning forward against a strong wind a man lurched through drifted dust towards a farmhouse with a sagging roof his slow effortful journey seemed all but hopeless so did the wail of a baby on the lap of a scrawny woman in a print dress she sat on the front porch of a house whose fields lay dustchoked and baking under a merciless sky gloating the announcer said this is how the united states care for the lands they took from their rightful owners damnyankees a woman behind pinkard whispered after those grim scenes the serial that followed came as something of a relief it portrayed a pair of confederate bunglers whod ended up in the army during the war and had escape after unlikely escape jeff knew it was ridiculous but couldnt help laughing himself silly the main feature was more serious it was a love story almost thwarted by a colored furniture dealer who kept casting lustful looks toward the perky blond heroine pinkard wanted to kick the negro right in the teeth that the people whod made the motion picture might want him to react just like that never once crossed his mind he rose and stretched when the picture ended well pleased that the black man had got what was coming to him then he left the theater and walked over to the bus that would take him back to the alabama correctional camp p the bus was heavily armored with thick wire grating over the windows pinkard wasnt the only white passenger who drew a pistol before boarding here at the edge of the black belt rebellion still sizzled he wanted to be able to fight back if the negroes shot up the bus his heart thudded in his chest when the machine got rolling it reached the alabama correctional camp p without taking fire jeff breathed a sigh of relief when he got off two sandbagged machinegun nests guarded the front entrance they were new black raiders hadnt been shy about shooting into the camp and didnt seem to care whether they hit guards or prisoners new belts of barbed wire ringed the place too they were as much to keep marauders out as they were to keep inmates in jeffs white skin was enough to get him past the machinegun nests unchallenged at what had been the entrance another guard carefully scrutinized both him and his identity card oh for christs sake toby he fumed you know goddamn well who i am yeah i do the lowerranking guard said but i gotta be careful there was that camp in mississippi where one of the prisoners managed to sneak out with a phony card you ever hear of anybody sneaking in with a phony card jeff demanded toby only shrugged pinkard let it go he couldnt complain too hard not when the camp needed solid security a mosquito bit him on the back of the neck he swatted and missed its buzz as it flew away sounded as if it were laughing at him the camp lay quiet in the summer night snores floated out the windows of the prisoners barracks men whod proved too enthusiastic about being whigs or rad libs werent going anywhereexcept for hasty trips to the latrines what do you say jeff a guard called as pinkard headed toward his much more comfortable barracks how was the picture pretty good charlie he answered got to do something about those damn niggers though that one who took a shot at the president he caught himself yawning and didnt go on instead he just said freedom freedom charlie echoed it was a handy word when you wanted to say something without bothering with a real conversation pinkards mattress creaked when he lay down in the warm muggy darkness he was some little while falling asleep hed laid out the camp with room to grow the expanded security perimeter had come from that extra room which was fine the land was there for whatever reason if it hadnt been that would have caused a problem as things were as things were he rolled over and slept reveille woke him he got out of bed put on a fresh uniform washed his face and shaved and went out to look at morning roll call and inspection the politicals were lined up in neat rows they wore striped uniforms like any convicts with a big white p stenciled on the chest and back of each shirt and the seat of each pair of trousers guards counted them off and compared the tally to the number expected when pinkard saw the count start over again he knew the numbers didnt match the politicals groaned they didnt get fed till everything checked out the way it was supposed to one of them said take off your shoes this time goddammit without even pausing a guard walking by backhanded the talky prisoner across the face the political clapped his hands to his nose and mouth whereupon the guard kicked him in the belly he fell to the ground writhing jeff ate breakfast with assistant wardens not involved in the count ham and eggs and grits and good hot coffee filled him up nicely when the count finally satisfied the guards making it the prisoners got the very same breakfastexcept for the ham and eggs and coffee one of the assistant wardens said i hear weve got some new fish coming in today yeah jeff pricked his ears up what kind of new fish blackfish the other man answered niggers pinkard said and the other fellow nodded jeff swore how the hell are we going to keep em separate nobody said nothin about niggers when we were laying out this place what the devil difference does it make the other fellow said half the bastards weve got in hereshit more than halftheyre already niggerlovers let em stick together with their pals he laughed to jeff it wasnt a laughing matter theyll make trouble he said dolefully he didnt want troublehe didnt want trouble the prisoners started anyhow he wanted things to go smoothly that made him look good with a shrug the other assistant warden said they wont bust out and thats all that matters and how much trouble can they make weve got the guns let em write the governor if they dont like it he guffawed again so did pinkardthat was funny sure enough the colored prisoners came in a little before noon some of them were wounded and went into the meager infirmary the rest the rest reminded jeff of the red rebels hed fought just after he got conscripted into the cs army with them inside it this camp would need more guards he was morally certain of that what after all did these skinny somber negroes have left to lose yankees go home yankees go home yankees go home the endless chant worried irving morrell he stood up in the cupola of his barrel watching the crowd in the park in lubbock trouble was in the air he could feel it it made the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck want to stand up the way lightning did before it struck not enough men here in the restlesshell the rebelliousstate of houston not enough barrels either they hadnt been able to clamp down on things here and make them stay quiet what do you expect he asked himself weve got that long long border with confederate texas and agitators keep slipping over it they keep sneaking guns across it too not that there werent plenty here already as if on cueand it probably wasthe crowd in the park changed their cry plebiscite plebiscite plebiscite morrells worry eased ever so slightly maybe they were less likely to do anything drastic if they were shouting for a chance to vote themselves back into the csa from the gunners seat sergeant michael pound said by god sir we ought to let featherston have these bastards back theyd be just as unruly for him as they are for us im not going to tell you youre wrong sergeant but thats not what our orders are morrell answered were supposed to hold houston and so we will yes sir by his tone pound would sooner have dropped the place morrell had trouble blaming him as far as he was concerned the confederates were welcome to what had been western texas but he didnt give orders like that he only carried them out or tried when trouble started it started very quickly the crowd was still chanting plebiscite plebiscite morrell barely heard the pop of a pistol over the chant and over the rumble of the barrels engine but he realized what was going on when a soldier in us greengray slumped to the ground clutching at his belly the rest of the soldiers raised their rifles to their shoulders the crowd like most hostile crowds in houston had nerve it surged forward not back rocks and bottles started flying the soldiers opened fire so did people in the crowd whod held back up till then morrell ducked down into the turret its going to hell he told pound do what you have to do with the machine gun yes sir the gunner answered a couple of rounds of case shot from the main armament too before morrell could answer three or four bullets spanged off the barrels armor plate whatever you think best he said but were going to dismiss this crowd if we have to kill everybody in it yes sir michael pound said crisply that was an order he could appreciate case shot he told the loader and case shot he got he had never been a man to do things by halves despite the gunfire morrell stood up in the cupola again he wanted to see what was going on a bullet cracked past his ear the turret traversed through a few degrees bringing the main armament to bear on the heart of the crowd the cannon bellowed at pointblank range barrels carried only a few rounds of case shot for gunners seldom got the chance to use it sergeant pound might have fired an enormous shotgun at the rioting houstonians the results werent pretty and another round hard on the heels of the first made them even more grisly people ran then not even trained troops could stand up to that kind of fire sergeant pound and the bow gunner encouraged them with a series of short bursts from their machine guns the other barrel in the park was firing its machine guns too and the soldiers were pouring volley after volley into the dissolving crowd such treatment might not make the houstonians love the us government but would make them pay attention to it they had nerve even if they had no brains to speak of some men lay down behind corpses and kept shooting at the us soldiers and a whiskey bottle with a smoking wick arced through the air and smashed on the front decking of morrells barrel it smashed spilling flaming gasoline across the front of the machine god damn it morrell shouted in furious but futile rage what soldiers here in houston called featherston fizzes had proved surprisingly dangerous to barrels flames spread over paint and grease and dripped through every opening no matter how tiny in the fighting compartment out morrell yelled everybody out he ducked back into the turret to scream the same message into the speaking tube to make sure the driver and bow gunner heard him then he scrambled out the cupola and down the side of the barrel escape hatches at the bow and on either side of the turret flew open the rest of the crew got out through them closely followed by growing clouds of black smoke move away sergeant pound shouted when the ammo starts cooking off morrell needed no more encouragement neither did any of the other crewmen they put as much ground between them and the doomed machine as they could morrell looked back over his shoulder smoke was pouring out of the cupola now too a moment later the most spectacular fireworks display this side of the fourth of july in philadelphia finished the barrel do you know what we need sir pound said we need a good fire extinguisher in there could make a lot of difference im not going to tell you youre wrong because youre morrell knew he was repeating himself a bullet thudded into a tree trunk behind his head he threw himself flat so did the rest of the barrel crew lying on his belly he finished with such aplomb as he could muster not but do you think you could remind me about it when i havent got other things to worry about like getting my ass shot off that was your ass sir michael pound asked innocently and morrell snorted pound said i will sir i promise morrell believed him he wouldnt forget something like that the sergeant went on it did cross my mind just now for some reason or other really cant imagine why still prone morrell watched another houstonian get ready to fling a featherston fizz at the second barrel in the park a us soldier shot him in the arm before he could let fly the incendiary dropped at his feet broke and engulfed him in flames a shrieking torch he ran every which way until at last mercifully he fell and did not rise serves him right sergeant pound said savagely morrell would have been hard pressed to argue and so didnt try what happened to the fizzflinger sufficed to scare even the houstonians still shouting freedom they fled the park soldiers in greengray moved among the wounded they werent helping them they were methodically finishing them off with single gunshots or with the bayonet grim work pound said getting to his feet but necessary those people wont see reason and so we might as well be rid of them you kill everybody who doesnt want to see reason people will get mighty thin on the ground mighty fast morrell remarked as he too got up and brushed off his coveralls oh yes sir the sergeant agreed but if i kill everybody who wont see reason and whos trying to kill me ill sleep better of nights and im a lot likelier to live to get old and gray sometimes perfect bloodthirstiness made perfect sense this did seem to be one of those times morrell mournfully eyed the burning barrel which still sent a thick column of black stinking smoke up into the brassy sky sergeant pound looked toward the barrel too his thoughts as usual were completely practical i wonder how long theyll take to ship a replacement machine down here depends morrell said judiciously if hoover wins the election come november itll be business as usual but if its al smith and the socialists get back in he shrugged sergeant pound made a sour face so did the rest of the barrel crew pound said im going to vote for hoover too what sane man wouldnt and yet you know its a funny thing charlie la follette makes a ten times better vice president than whatshisname running with hooverborah thats it bill borahs got no brains to speak of i wont argue that morrell said still you have to vote the party and the man at the top of the ticket odds two presidents in a row would drop dead are pretty slim oh yes sir certainly i said the same thing pound wasnt currying favor morrell didnt think such a ploy had ever occurred to the gunner if it had he would have become an officer years ago he had said that and was just reminding morrell of it a lieutenant with a still in his hand strode up to the barrel crew seeing morrells eagles he started to come to attention morrell waved for him not to bother arent you glad were in the usa sir the young officer said if were not careful though theyll send us to a country where the people dont like us morrell clamped down hard on a laugh if he started he wasnt sure he could stop ive served in canada lieutenant he said carefully its nothing like this the canucks dont like us but even the ones who shoot at us arent wild men like these oh good real relief showed in the lieutenants voice i thought it was just me i couldnt imagine how they held their ground so long with the punishment they took he might still have been making messes in his drawers when the great war ended wearily morrell said people will do all kinds of mad things when their blood is up son he hadnt intended to add that last word but the lieutenant had to be young enough to suit it and hadnt seen a quarter of the things morrell had only after a couple of seconds did morrell realize that made the other man lucky not unlucky the lieutenant had seen enough to keep a firm grip on fundamentals a lot of those bastards wont get their blood up again on account of its out i know morrell said thats the way its supposed to work yeah shaking his head the lieutenant went away his feet were unsteady as if hed had too much to drink morrell knew he hadnt hed simply seen too much that could produce a hangover of its own and one more painful than any that sprang from rotgut sergeant pound said were alive and theyre dead and thats how i like it ammunition was still cooking off inside the burning barrel the flames had caught in the dry grass under it had the grass been less sparse the fire would have spread farther and been more dangerous beyond the barrel lay the dead menand a few women toowhod wanted to drag the state of houston back into the csa morrell took a pack of cigarettesraleighs from the confederate states out of the breast pocket of his coveralls and lit one a moment later he stubbed it out in the dirt the smoke seemed to taste as greasy and nasty as the thick black stuff pouring from the barrel he wondered if hed ever want another cigarette again its all right ernie sylvia enos heard the fright in her own voice heard it and hated it it really is that sort of thing can happen to anybody not just to she broke off she hadnt helped her hands folded into fists nails biting the flesh of her palms not just to someone who got his dick shot off ernie finished for her his voice flat and deadly maybe it can but there is a difference for me it happens all the goddamn time he glared at her as if it were her fault half the time these days he seemed to think it was sylvia twisted away from him on the narrow bed in his flat she almost wished they hadnt succeeded so often when they were first starting out ernie had begun to think he could whenever he wanted to hed begun taking it and herfor granted then when hed started failing again he reached down plucked a bottle of whiskey off the floor and took a big swig that wont help sylvia said itll only make things worse drunk he was always hopeless in bed and when he proved hopeless that made him meaner he laughed now depends on what you mean by things he took another long pull at the bottle i do not know why i go on there does not seem to be much point he reached into the drawer of the nightstand by the bed and pulled out a he held it about a foot from his face staring at it as if it were the most beautiful thing in the world ernie sylvia wasnt frightened any more she was terrified she snatched the pistol out of his hand leave this damned thing alone do you hear me he let her take it she shuddered with relief he didnt always and he was much stronger than she was when the black mood seized him but now he smiled with a wounded tenderness that pierced and melted her heart even through her fear you never stop trying to make me into an angel do you he said i am not an angel i am from the other place youre talking nonsense is what youre doing sylvia got out of bed and started to dress what you need is sleep what i need ernie cupped what he had with one hand sylvia thought about taking the with her when she left the only reason she didnt was that ernies apartment was a young arsenal she couldnt carry off all the guns he owned shed been standing on the corner waiting for a trolley at least five minutes before she realized her knees were shaking when the streetcar came up she staggered as she boarded it she threw a nickel in the fare box then all but fell into the closest seat she looked down at her hands they were shaking too her daughter mary jane was sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee when she walked into the apartment hi ma mary jane said cheerfully and then her smile fading and her jaw dropping my god what happened to you youre white as a sheet ernie sylvia poured herself coffee put in cream and sugar and then poured in a good slug of whiskey too ma that guy is nothing but trouble mary jane spoke with the air of someone who knew what she was talking about no doubt she did at twentyfour she probably had more practical experience with men than did sylvia whod found george stuck with him and then done very little till the writer came back into her life her daughter went on i know youve got a soft spot for him because he helped you with the book about dad but hes a little bit nuts you know what i mean maybe he was good for you once but he isnt any more before answering sylvia took a big gulp of the improved coffee it wasnt improved enough to suit her so she put some more hooch in it with a sigh she said chances are youre right but wait mary jane held up a hand stop no buts if hes trouble if you know hes trouble you dont walk to the nearest exit you run its not that simple sylvia drank more of the coffee she could feel the whiskey calming her you dont understand honey when hes rightand he is most of the timehes the sweetest man i ever knew the sweetest man i ever imagined that was true saying it she almost forgot the cold weight of the shed wrenched from ernies hand i dont know anything about that mary jane admitted but ill tell you what i do know if he makes you come home looking like you just saw a ghost when he isnt right you dont want anything to do with him hes coping with more than most men ever have to hes got this war wound sylvia had never gone into detail about ernies injury shed never even admitted they were lovers though she was sure mary jane and george jr knew now shock and the potent coffee loosened her tongue she explained what the wound was poor guy mary jane said when she finished im sorry about that its terrible and he cant do anything about it fine now i understand better why hes the way he is but youre not the red cross ma you cant go on giving like this when all you get back is grief what if he decides to use you for a punching bag one of these days he wouldnt do that but sylvia was uncomfortably aware that she spoke without conviction her daughter noticed too how many times have you told me not to be dumb lots sylvia managed a wry grin how many times have you listened a few maybe mary jane grinned too but youre my mother youre supposed to have good sense for both of us right dont be dumb ma you want to find somebody swell find somebody who doesnt scare you to death ill think about it sylvia hadnt expected to say even that much but she found herself continuing hes working on a book about how he got wounded about driving an ambulance up in quebec hes let me see some of it its really goodand when hes writing things go better sometimes not tonight but sometimes mary jane threw her hands in the air honest to god ma i swear you didnt hear a word i said sylvia shook her head and lit a cigarette mary jane held out a hand sylvia passed her the pack she leaned close to get a light from her mother sylvia said i heard you but ill do what i think i ought to not what you think all right all right all right mary janes smile had a wry twist to it i cant make you do anything after all im not your mother sylvia laughed she hadnt dreamt shed be able to but she did her daughters company and some strongly fortified coffee made the terror shed felt not long before seem distant and unreal a few days later she had a visitor who surprised her joseph kennedy simply showed up assuming shed be glad to see him good day mrs enos he said and tipped his hat to her i hope we can rely on you to help get out the vote for hoover and borah i didnt think id ever see you again after our quarrel last year sylvia said and i hoped i wouldnt he shrugged state democratic headquarters reminded me how useful youve been the party comes first by his face he wished it didnt i wondered whose side youd be on this year she remarked why kennedy asked in real surprise now then he laughed you mean because al smith is a catholic and so am i sylvia nodded kennedy laughed again louder this time my dear lady the pope is infallible i believe that al smith if al smith were the pope id kiss his ring since hes not im going to do my best to kick his fanny knowing it would be useless sylvia said mr kennedy im not your dear lady and i dont want to be well mrs enos thats as may be the democratic organizer said ill tell you this though i have no idea what you see in that miserable hack of yours hed made that crack before i told you ernies no hack sylvia said hes a writer kennedy shrugged again if you say so his dismissive tone said he wasnt about to change his mind but he went on never mind bedfellows then well keep this to politics youve been helping the democrats for a long time do you want another socialist president now well no sylvia admitted youll pay the same as you have the past couple of elections of course kennedy answered as if insulted she needed to ask i told you youd been good we pay for what we get if state headquarters tells us to she thought still the money was better than she could get any other way royalties from i sank roger kimball were skimpy these days thered been talk of putting it out as one of the newfangled paperbound pocket books but that hadnt happened yet and she didnt know if it would its a dealas long as you keep your hands to yourself joe kennedy sighed you drive a hard bargain mrs enos but yes thats a deal he held out his hand warily sylvia took it she knew the only reason he stayed interested in her was that she stayed uninterested in him but she couldnt stomach giving in to get him out of her hair the democrats trotted her out at a rally near t wharf a few days later party faithful listened as she told them this was no time to let a socialist someone who was bound to be soft on the confederate states take up residence in powel house the crowd clapped in all the right places because they did sylvia needed longer than she would have otherwise to realize her speech was falling flat four years earlier the democrats whod lost three presidential elections in a row had been hungrymore than hungry desperateto reclaim powel house and theyd done it even if calvin coolidge had dropped dead before he could take the oath of office but hoover hadnt proved any better at fixing the collapse than socialist hosea blackford had before him and he was about as exciting as oatmeal without sugar he was earnest he worked hard it wasnt enough even before the last round of applause faded sylvia thought the democrats are going to lose this time the feelingno the certaintywas irrational but no less real for that her eyes met those of joe kennedy who stood on the platform with her he was still clapping but his smile seemed held on his face by force of will alone he knows she realized hes slimy but hes not stupid yes he knows he gave back a shrug as if to say this is my job and im going to do it as well as i can no matter what happens sylvia nodded in reply that was something she understood she could respect kennedy the political operator no matter what she thought about kennedy the man as she stepped down from the platform a new realization came to her the election still lay a couple of months ahead she was going to have to be a professional herself all through that time going up on platforms and saying what needed to be said in spite of what she thought would happen in november that wouldnt be easy it might be harder than anything shed ever tried before her back stiffened i dont care whether its easy or not if joe kennedy can do it so can i carl martin was just starting to creep every minute or so hed forget how to move and flop down like a jellyfish at six months that didnt bother him he thought it was funny hed try again after a while when he remembered how to make his elbows work and try to find something on the floor and stick it in his mouth bwee he said proudly you tell em kid chester martin agreed he was pretty proud of his son though he sometimes wondered how any baby ever lived to grow up some of the things carl did and of course did without thinking about them you had to watch him not just every minute but every single second as if to prove the point the junior member of the martin family headed for a book of matches that shouldnt have been on the floor in the first place carl didnt want a cigarette he wanted to find out what matches tasted like chester grabbed them before his son could carl clouded up and started to cry you cant eat matches chester said they arent good for you telling something like that to a sixmonthold naturally did no good at all carl kept on crying and because he was crying he forgot to hold his head up when it came down he banged it on the floor that really gave him something to cry about what now rita called from the kitchen chester explained as best he could over his sons din he picked up the boy and cuddled him the crying subsided chester pulled out his hankie and wiped snot off carls face carl didnt like that he never did to distract him chester turned on the wireless theyd bought the set not long after the baby was born they couldnt quite afford it but rita had wanted it badly feeding the baby meant being up in the middle of the night a lot she wanted it to stay dark then to keep carl from waking up listening to music or news or a comedy show was better than sitting there all alone in the quiet somebody knocked on the door theres sue and otis and pete chester said oh god theyre early rita said well let em in the fried chickenll be done in about fifteen minutes when chesters sister and brotherinlaw and nephew came in sue exclaimed over the baby how big hes getting hes still tiny said pete who at nine seemed to be shooting up like a weed himself all shins and forearms and long skinny neck otis blake pointed to him i think this ones going to be a giraffe when he grows up sue shook her head no he wont giraffes eat vegetables pete made a horrible face at the very idea having company over made carl forget hed been crying and stare about wideeyed chester wondered not for the first time what babies made of the world it had to be confusing as hell he put his son down went into the kitchen and pulled four bottles of burgermeister out of the icebox he set one on the counter by rita who was turning chicken pieces and brought the others out for himself and sue and otis his brotherinlaw raised his beer in salute heres to california he said ill drink to that by god chester said and did this place has saved my life back in toledo id still be out of work oh yes blake nodded vigorously back in toledo i was out of work too im not making as much as i did back there when i had a job unions here arent what they were in toledo chester broke in ive seen that otis blake agreed itll come i think but im working and im not broke or on the dole the way things have been since the stock market went south i cant complain thats what years of hard times have done to us chester said theyve made us satisfied with less than we used to have its not right what can we do about it though his sister asked before chester could answer rita called suppers ready he felt like a prizefighter saved by the bell because he didnt know he remembered the years when hed eaten chicken gizzards and hearts because he couldnt afford anything better hed even started to like them too often though he couldnt afford them or beef heart or tripe or any of the other cheap meats he remembered plate after plate of noodles or potatoes and cabbage too now though he grabbed himself a drumstick the crispy skin burned his fingers ow he said along with green beans and fried potatoes it made a tasty mealand he could leave the gizzard and heart and neck to pete who since hed started eating them as a kid remained convinced they were treats later when chester saw everybody else had plenty he also snagged a thigh after juicy dark meat giblets werent worth talking about let alone eating rita put carl in his high chair and gave him small bits of food along with his bottle he wound up wearing as much as he ate he usually did pete watched in fascination sue said you used to eat that way too the boy shook his head denying even the possibility after apple pie rita made coffee for the grownups carl got fussy she changed him and put him to bed otis blake lit a cigarette who are you two going to vote for when the election gets here he asked hoover hasnt done anything much chester said hoover hasnt done anything period rita said im voting for al smith i dont know about him she pointed at her husband she still hadnt fully forgiven him for backing away from the socialist camp in he said i expect ill vote for smith too the only thing that bothers me about him is that hes never looked outside new york before now im not sure hes tough enough to spit in jake featherstons eye if he has to his brotherinlaw scratched his head he had a wide perfect permanent part in the middle of his scalp had the bullet that made it been even a fraction of an inch lower sue would never have got the chance to meet him after the war he said dont you think we need to worry about the usa more than we do about the csa not if another wars brewing chester said featherston fought in the last one blake said he couldnt be crazy enough to want to do that again besides hes firing generals remember that was in the paper this past summer thats true it was chester admitted i said id probably vote for smith i probably will me too sue said our folks are the only democrats left in the family otis blake snorted yeah theyre still democrats even though your dad hasnt got a job and cant get one he and chester had both sent stephen douglas martin money whenever they could afford to the blakes didnt stay late it was a sunday night with school ahead for pete and work for otis after they left rita washed the dishes chester who also had work in the morning turned on the wireless before getting ready for bed he found a news show president hoover vowed today to keep houston in the united states regardless of confederate pressure in the state the announcer said he also accused governor smith of having too soft a policy on the confederate states such wellmeaning foolishness got the united states into trouble in the past two socialist administrations hoover said i dont intend to go down that mistaken road we must be strong first everything else springs from that chester grunted foreign policy was the only area where he favored the democrats platform over the socialists he shrugged when you got right down to it what happened in the usa counted for more than what happened outside hed voted against his class interest four years ago and hed spent most of the time since regretting it he wouldnt make the same mistake twice the newscaster went on when asked for comment on the presidents remarks governor smith said its hard to keep people in a country where they dont want to stay you would think the united states had learned that lesson after the war of secession but the present administration seems as thickheaded there as it does everywhere else take that martin thought he wasnt sure he agreed with al smith but he liked the way the governor of new york came back swinging hard when hoover attacked him the announcer went on to talk about the dust storms that were picking up the soil of droughtridden kansas and sequoyah and houston and blowing it east so the dust came down in new york city and even on the decks of ships out of sight of land in the atlantic the winds blew from west to east so the dust storms didnt directly affect los angeles but martin had seen in newsreels how dreadful they were and farmers from the afflicted states were giving up any hope of bringing in a crop on their bonedry farms a lot of them were coming west by train or in rattletrap motorcars looking for whatever work they could find two or three men who spoke with a twang had joined chesters construction crew they worked hard enough to satisfy even the exacting mordechai who thought anybody who didnt go home limp with exhaustion every night was a lazy son of a bitch rita came out of the kitchen in the middle of the football scores since moving west himself chester had become passionately devoted to the fortunes of the los angeles dons the local franchise in the west coast football league the seattle sharks unfortunately had smashed the hometown heroes with an enormous yawn rita said im going to bed myself hes been so fussy the past few nights he must be cutting a tooth but i cant find it yet if he wakes up and he isnt hungry i wish youd take him tonight all right chester did rock carl back to sleep every once in a while when the alarm clock went off the next morning he woke up happy he hadnt heard a thing in the night which meant the baby must have slept straight through or so he thought till he got a look at ritas wan sleepy face reproachfully she said you told me youd take him but you just lay there while he cried till finally i got up and got him he didnt want to go back to bed after that either im sorry martin said i never even heard him that was nothing but the truth because he didnt usually get up when the baby cried the noise carl made didnt rouse him though hed shut off the alarm clock as soon as it rang his wife looked as if she had trouble believing him i dont see how you could have missed him half the neighbors must have heard she said but he kept protesting his innocence and finally persuaded her she rubbed bloodshot eyes i wish i could sleep through a racket like that chester had slept through worse in the great war bursting shells hadnt fazed him then not unless they landed very close a man could get used to anything absently chester scratched along the seam of his pajama bottoms hed got used to being lousy too and the vermin hid and laid their eggs in seams after strong coffee scrambled eggs and toast he grabbed his tool kit and headed for the trolley stop a man who had work clung to it he didnt give anyone the chance to take it away martin knew what he had to do he aimed to do it one day he wanted to have the money to buy a house his father had never owned one living in apartments all his days i can do better than that martin thoughta great american war cry i can and by god i will polite as usual heber young nodded to abner dowling i am afraid colonel that this is our final meeting said the unofficial leader of the even more unofficial mormon movement dowling blinked whats that you say mr young his mouth fell open several chins wobbled i am very sorry but i have concluded that the united states are not serious about negotiating with the people of utah young said this being so my continued presence no longer serves any useful purpose i have better things to do with my time to do with my life than try to turn back the tide that was some sort of legend dowling knew as much though he couldnt recall the details he said i hope youll reconsider mr young i know you to be a man of good will and a man of good sense your people will be the losers if you walk away so i have told myself many timesi am no less vain than any other man heber young replied gravely telling myself such fables has kept me coming here to your headquarters these past several years even though i know president hoover has tied your hands i believe you would be more liberal if not constrained by orders from philadelphia after so many futile discussions though i find i no longer have the heart for any more if you were any man but yourself i would say the confederate hotheads had got to you dowling didnt hide his anger and disappointment if you leave the scene they will get to your people and the results will not be happy he didnt need winthrop w webbs prediction to see that but the spys judgment here matched his own all too well i shall have to take that chance young said i am still not altogether convinced these men serve the csa and not the usa he held up a hasty hand please understand me coloneli do not claim you are lying when you deny planting provocateurs among us i believe youyou personally that is but whether someone else in the us government is using such men of that i am less certain abner dowling grunted he wasnt a hundred percent certain no us officials were using provocateurs here in utah either he wished he were but he wasnt since he wasnt he thought it wiser not to talk any more about that instead he said you tell me youre unhappy with the orders i get from back east i admit i havent been happy about all of them myself because you are honest enough to admit such things ive kept coming back to talk with you young said but no more i am sorry coloneli am very sorry in factbut enough is enough he started to get to his feet and walk out of dowlings office wait dowling exclaimed why the mormon was still polite but implacable why for the results of the election thats why the commandant of salt lake city answered if smith beats hoover isnt it likely ill have new orders after the first of next february hmm heber young had already taken his dark homburg by the brim now he hesitated perhaps the first time dowling had ever seen him indecisive he set the hat back on the tree and returned to the chair across the desk from dowling now that is interesting colonel that is very interesting you would follow more liberal orders if you received them i am a soldier sir i am obliged to follow all legitimate orders i receive dowling didnt tell the mormon leader he intended to vote for hoover or that he hoped the incumbent would trounce al smith young likely knew as much but he had told the truth as if to prove it he said didnt i try to get publicworks jobs for utah just after hoover took over the president had forbidden the scheme but young couldnt say he hadnt tried you did young admitted he rubbed his square chin then abruptly he nodded once he had made up his mind he didnt hesitate all right colonel dowling i will wait and see what happens in the election if hoover wins a second term that will be the end of that if smith wins if smith wins i will see what happens next good day now he did take his hat tipping it he left dowling allowed himself a sigh of relief if heber young walked away from talks with the occupying authorities that in itself might have been enough to ignite utah dowlings career wasnt where it would have been if he hadnt spent so many years as george custers adjutant but he still had hopes for it with a utah uprising on his record he would have been dead in the water as far as hopes of getting stars on his shoulders one day went the telephone in the outer office rang his own adjutant answered it a moment liter the telephone on dowlings desk rang abner dowling he said crisply into the mouthpiece he listened and nodded though no one was there to see it thats very good news thanks for passing it on he hung up captain toricelli came into the inner office his face alight barrels he said theyre really going to give them to us i only started shouting for them a year or so ago dowling said the way things work back in philadelphia theyre on the dead run we could all have been dead by the time they got here captain toricelli said if we had died thats the one thing i can think of that would have got them here faster dowling said his adjutant laughed he wondered why he hadnt been kidding being promised the machines didnt mean getting them right away when they did arrive he was grievously disappointed hed been hoping for new barrels and what he got were great war retreads they must have come from houston most of them still showed fresh bullet scars and other combatrelated damage to their armor i can move faster than one of these things dowling said scornfully since he was built like a rolltop desk that was unlikely to be true but it wasnt very false either a man in good shape could outrun one of these snorting monsters dowling eyed the crewmen duffel bags on their shoulders who dismounted from passenger cars they take a couple of squads worth of men apiece too he grumbled he remembered that very well from great war days yes sir captain toricelli answered but theyre better than nothing i suppose so dowling said unwillingly then he brightened a little i suppose new barrels are coming off the line theyd have to be eh they must be going straight to houstonand to kentucky now too that makes sense to me toricelli sounded faintly aggrieved what was the world coming to when a superior started making sense three days later a pair of barrels rumbled up temple street and took up positions in temple square dowling thought that would be the least inflammatory way he could use them temple square had been under guard ever since the us army leveled the mormon temple and killed the last stubborn defenders there bits of granite from the temple were potent relics to mormons who opposed the government that struck dowling as medieval which made it no less true soldiers had always had orders to shoot to kill whenever anyone tried to abscond with a fragment dowling wasnt particularly surprised when heber young paid him a call a few days later he did his best to pretend he was saying and to what do i owe the pleasure of your company this time mr young those horrible machines young was furious and making only the barest effort to hide it how dare you pollute temple square with their presence for one thing weve had soldiers in the square for years the barrels just reinforce them dowling answered for another i want people here to know we have them and that well use them if we need to it mightprevent rashness i guess youd say heber young shook his head more likely to provoke than to prevent no dowling shook his head i am very sorry sir but i cannot agree to my mind the safety of my men and the protection of us interests in utah must come first those infernal machines promote neither the mormon leader insisted they looked at each other not for the first time they found they were both using english but speaking two altogether different languages i would be derelict in my duties if i did not use barrels dowling said using them is what makes you derelict young eyed him then sighed i see i do not persuade you i dont suppose i should have expected to yet hope does spring eternal in the human breast i tell you colonel no good will come from your using these machines do you threaten me mr young colonel if i tell you the sun will come up tomorrow is that a threat i would not say so i would call it a prediction based on what i know of past events i would call this the same thing he stood up politely challenging dowling to arrest him for sedition after hed come and put his head in the lions jaws dowling couldnt and he knew it the word that heber young languished in a us prison would touch off insurrection regardless of whether the barrels in temple square did as young turned to go he added if the government were generous enough to grant me the franchise you may rest assured i would vote for al smith in the hope that such discussions as this one would become unnecessary good day colonel dowling out he went a man whose moral force somehow made him worth battalions four days later one of the barrels caught fire on the way from the us base to its turn at temple square all eighteen crewmen escaped and nobody shot at them as they burst from the doomed machines hatches word came to dowling almost at once cursing he left the base in an auto and zoomed down temple toward the blazing barrel by the time he got there the fire had already started touching off ammunition the fireworks display was spectacular with red tracer rounds zooming in all directions a fire engine roared up not long after dowling arrived it started spraying water on the barrel from as far away as the stream from the hose would reach that struck him as being about as futile as offering last rites to a man smashed by a speeding locomotive but he didnt think it could do any harm so he kept quiet about it how did this happen he demanded of the barrels commander a captain named witherspoon sir i dont know witherspoon nursed a burned hand hell live dowling thought savagely was it sabotage he asked sir i dont know captain witherspoon repeated it could have been but he shrugged this machine has to be almost twenty years old plenty of things can go wrong with it any which way a leak in a fuel line a leak in an oil line another shrug he pointed toward the burning barrel from which a thick cloud of black smoke rose well never know now thats for damn sure yes it is dowling said unhappily were people in salt lake city laughing because theyd got away with one worse were people in richmond laughing because theyd got away with one kaplans on the lower east side was a delicatessen flora blackford hadnt visited for years that got driven home the minute she walked in the door she remembered the foxyred hair of lou kaplan the proprietor it made you want to warm your hands over it kaplan was still behind the counter these days though his hair was white these days floras hair had more than a little gray in it too she saw her brother at a table in the corner she waved david hamburger nodded she hurried over to him her little brother had a double chin tired eyes and gray in his own hair the things time does to us flora thought sudden tears stinging her eyes she blinked them away its good to see you david she said its been too long he shrugged i get by i like being a tailor i like it better than being a congressmans brother and a lot better than being a first ladys brother you cant say i ever bothered you for anything the way important peoples relatives do bothered me flora shook her head i wish you would have most of the time you wouldnt even talk to me you dont visit i dont get out much david tapped the cane leaning against his chair hed lost a leg in the war not far below the hip he could walk with a prosthesis but only painfully as if to emphasize that he pointed to the chair across from him and said sit down for heavens sake you know why im not going to get up till i have to flora did sit a waitress came over to her and david they both ordered the pause meant she didnt have to call him on what she knew to be an evasion he was after all here at kaplans he could have come to socialist party headquarters once in a while too he could have but he hadnt politics estranged them flora had never thought that could happen in her family but it had her brother had come out of the war a staunch democrat it was as if having been crippled he didnt want his wound to have been in vain and so joined the party that was hardest on the csa flora reached into the jar across the table pulled out a pickled tomato and bit into it she smiled the taste and the vinegar tang in the air and the crunch took her back to her childhood cant get things like this in dakota or even down in philadelphia she said that won her a grudging smile from david no i dont suppose you would he said and then fell silent again as the waitress brought his pastrami sandwich and floras corned beef on rye he sipped from an egg cream which had neither egg nor cream in it floras drink was a seltzer with a shpritz of raspberry syrup on top something else unmatchable outside of new york city is your family well flora asked well enough he answered amazing how fast children grow she nodded joshua had taught her that she said im glad and then broke off hoping he would think shed intended it for a complete sentence david had feared no one would ever want to marry a onelegged man shed started to say she was glad hed been wrong about that but hadnt known how he would take it by his tightlipped smile he knew where shed been going but then he shrugged visibly setting aside annoyance he said these past couple of years i see youve finally started to understand what nice people the confederates really are better late than never thats all ive got to say its not the confederate people its the freedom party flora said reactionaries have seized control of the apparatus of the state the same as they have in france david hamburger rolled his eyes i dont suppose that would have happened if the people hadnt voted them in now would it well flora winced her brothers comment was painfully pungent but that didnt mean it was wrong yes well he said listen if it comes to a fight wed better be ready thats the big thing i wanted to tell you weve got to you hear me otherwise thishe made a fist and hit his artificial leg which gave back a sound like knocking on a doorwas for nothing and i dont think i could stand that it wont come to war flora said in genuine alarm not even hoover thinks itll come to war hoovers one of the best men weve ever had for getting things done david said and one of the worst for figuring out what to do thats how it looks to me anyhow of course im no political bigwig nu am i right or am i meshuggeh youre a lot of things but youre not meshuggeh flora answered hed summed up hoover better than most editorial columnists shed seen i still think you worry too much about the csa though they have more tsuris than we do just because you have tsuris doesnt mean you cant give it david finished his sandwich he used one hand to help lever himself upright taking hold of the cane he said theyll send you back to congress in a couple of days im not telling you to listen to mewhen did you ever but keep your eyes open i always do flora insisted her brother didnt argue he just walked out of kaplans with a slow rolling gait like a drunken sailors that let the knee joint in the artificial leg lock each time he took a step and kept it from buckling under him flora wanted to go after him but what was the point they hadnt had anything in common for years a sad lunch talking politics proved as much as if it needed proof that evening she made a speech in a union hall and got cheered till her ears rang more loud cheers greeted her after her two speeches the day before the election she shook hands till her own was swollen and soreand she knew how to minimize the damage while she did it she expected she would win reelection too her district was solidly socialist it had gone democratic for a little while in the despair following the collapse but then repented of its folly what she didnt knowwhat nobody knewwas whether the country would have its revenge on herbert hoover as it had had its revenge on her husband four years earlier tuesday november was cold and rainy flora went out and voted early so the reporters and photographers who waited at her polling place could get their stories and pictures into the papers before the polls closed she knew her democratic opponent was doing the same thing this way their appearances canceled each other out if she hadnt come early he would have grabbed an edgea small one but an edge nonetheless i think smith will whip him hosea blackford said when flora came back to their apartment after voting he was still registered in dakota and had cast an absentee ballot hed stayed on the sidelines during the campaign for one thing his own reputation wouldnt help either flora or the socialist party for another he was getting ever more fragile he still managed pretty well as long as he stuck close to home out in crowds these days though he seemed not only frail but also slightly baffled that worried flora she took her son with her to socialist party headquarters for the fourteenth ward then but not her husband most of her family was there too although her nephew yossel was serving out his time as a conscript on occupation duty in canada and david as usual gave the socialists a wide berth flora was glad yossel had been sent north rather than down to houston that was a running sore that would not heal hoover had made a mess of things there but flora had no idea what a socialist president might have done to make things better when she came in herman bruck boomed lets all welcome congresswoman hamburger he turned red as a bonfire congresswoman blackford he said blushing still but i knew her when she was congresswoman hamburger he had too it was twenty years nowand where had the time gone since shed beaten him for the nomination to this seat when myron zuckerman the longtime incumbent fell down a flight of stairs and broke his neck if that hadnt happened with a shake of her head flora tried to drive that thought out of her mind it wasnt easy the past couple of years thered been a spate of what people called worlds of if novels if the usa had won the war of secession or the second mexican war if the negro uprising had succeeded in the csa if the red uprising had succeeded in russia if if if dealing with the world as it was was hard enough for most people flora didnt think the worlds of if fad would last bruck turned on a wireless set he got loud music and then as he turned the dial a quiz show a couple of young women perked up at that but he kept changing stations till he found one that was giving election returns with the polls just closing in new york the announcer said a burst of static squelched him another station farther down the dial came in better it was announcing early returns from massachusetts cheers rang out in the socialist headquarters when the broadcaster said smith was leading hoover three to two the station switched to an interview with a boston democratic leader doesnt look good for us heah the man said in a gravelly new englandaccented voice have to hope smith and borah dont drag the local candidates down too fah thank you mr kennedy the interviewer said yes thank you mr kennedy maria tresca said she and flora grinned at each other the two of them had been friends for more than twenty years too it was partly a matter of living in a largely jewish district partly sheer luck that flora and not maria had succeeded in politics as soon as flora heard al smith was ahead in massachusetts she knew the night would belong to the socialists and so it proved she handily won her own race her democratic opponent called before eleven oclock to throw in the towel that brought more cheers in the headquarters though by then everyone was starting to get hoarse the air was blue with cigarette cigar and pipe smoke which helped make throats raw president hoovers spokesman kept issuing statements along the lines of the current trend cannot be overlooked but the president will not concede the election before he is sure his victory is impossible herman bruck pulled out a bottle of champagne an upperclass touch for the party of the proletariat he brought flora a glassnot a fancy flute but an ordinary water glass heres to hoover his victory is impossible he said alevai omayn flora drank the bubbles tickled her nose bruck had a glass too did you ever imagine when we first started here we would win powel house lose it and win it back he asked did you ever imagine you would be first lady dont be silly she shook her head how could i how could anyone he leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek people all around them cheered flora laughed she wasnt so sure herman had done it just to congratulate her hed been sweet on her before she won her first election and went to philadelphia even if she hadnt been sweet on him now theyd both been married to other people for years but he just smiled when she wagged a finger at him and everyone else laughed and cheered some more on a night full of victory she didnt push it viii happy new year darlin scipio said to bathsheba do jesus i was borned in slavery days i dont never reckon i lives to see his wife sighed better be a happy year she said darkly last couplethree sure aint we is on our feets scipio said we gots a place again the flat wasnt much worse than the one theyd lived in before white rioters torched so much of the terry and they werent paying much more for it compared to so many people who were still living in churches or in tents they were amazingly lucky that theyd managed to bring their money out with them had helped a lot money usually did bathsheba refused to look on the bright side of things what happens the next time the buckra decide they gots to go after all the niggers in town where we stay then aint been badscipio correct himselfaint been too bad since bully in bathshebas mouth the oldfashioned white mans slang sounded poisonously sarcastic we gots to go on we gots to do what we kin scipio knew he was trying to convince himself as well as her wish we could go somewheres else his wife said like where scipio asked she had no answer he knew she wouldnt the united states had made it very plain they didnt want any negroes from the confederate states no matter what happened to blacks in the csa the empire of mexico was farther away and even less welcoming we is stuck where wes at gots to be some way like most people bathsheba saw what she wanted to see regardless of whether it was really there he didnt try to argue with her theyd argued too much lately she still hadnt stopped nagging him about who he was and who and what he had been he gave short answers knowing that the more he said the more dangerous it was for him short answers didnt satisfy her she wanted to know she was convinced she had the right to knowwhere and how and why and when hed learned to talk like an educated white man as far as he was concerned the less said the better secrecy had become deeply ingrained in him since he came to augusta only by keeping his past secret did he could he survive neither of them stayed up long after midnight they had planned to get out with the children on new years day but a cold nasty rainstorm rolling down from the north put paid to that instead they spent the day cooped up in the flat they were all on edge scipios son and daughter from disappointment at an outing spoiled himself and his wife over worry about what the new year might bring it was still raining the next day the sort of steady sullen rain that promised to hang around for days january second was a saturday the huntsmans lodge which had been closed for new years reopened scipio put on his formal clothes then put a raincoat of rubberized cloth on over them with that and an umbrella he left the block of flats full of a relief he dared not show he had no trouble getting to the lodge because of the rain only people who had to be out and about were and no one seemed in the mood to harass a negro also the raincoat concealed the fancy jacket wingcollared boiled shirt and satinstriped trousers he wore beneath it not standing out in the crowd undoubtedly helped jerry dover greeted him when he came in the door how are you xerxes happy new year i thanks you suh de same to you scipio answered with dover the work came first if you could do it well nothing else mattered if you couldnt nothing else mattered either and he would send you packing but if you could do it he would stand by you scipio respected that and responded to it today though dover didnt seem happy got a few words to say when the whole crew comes in he told scipio wont take long anything that broke routine was worrisome what de trouble be scipio asked his boss shook his head ill tell you soon i dont want to have to do this more than once youll hear i promise that convinced scipio the news whatever it was wouldnt be good he couldnt do anything about it but wait naturally one of the other waiters chose that day to show up late when he finally did come in he was so hung over he could barely see new years eve night befo last somebody told him he managed a sheepish grin then took two aspirins from his pocket and dryswallowed them listen people anybody see a paper the past couple days or listen to news on the wireless jerry dover asked none of the waiters and assistant cooks and dishwashers and janitors said anything scipio might have bought a constitutionalist if rain hadnt kept newsboys off the street he wasnt sure how many of the other negroes in the crew could read wireless sets were cheap these days but nobody here got rich at his job no dover shrugged all right i suppose you heard about the colored fellow who took a shot at president featherston at the olympics again nobody said anything too bad he missed was what scipio was thinking his boss went on theres an order from the president that colored folksall colored folkshave got to pay a fine to the government on account of that and theres an order that anybody whos got colored folks working for him has to take twenty dollars out of their pay and send it to richmond to make sure that fine gets paid so thats whatll happen im sorry but i cant do a thing about it twenty dollars the pained echo rose from the throats of all the men there twenty dollars was a lot of moneya weeks wages for the ones who made the most two weeks for the rest scipio cursed softly under his breath a twentydollar hole in his budget wouldnt be easy to fill somebody asked how is we supposed to git by without that money jerry dover spread his hands i cant answer that all i can tell you is i dont dare try to duck this not with what theyll do to me if i get caught from a lot of men that would have been a polite lie scipio believed the manager of the hunstmans lodge dover treated the black men who worked for him like human beings mistuh dover suh he called what is it xerxes kin you dock we a dollar two dollars a week so it dont hurt so bad yeah several other men spoke up others nodded one of the assistant cooks said i buys everything on the installment plan i should oughta pay this here fine the same way but dover shook his head i would if i could but i cant the order says its got to come out of your next pay its supposed to hurt thats why theyre doing it im sorry xerxes it was a good idea dully scipio nodded its supposed to hurt hed known that from the minute the freedom party won in no hed known it from the moment he first heard jake featherston speak in a park here in augusta back when the party was young and small he asked mistuh dover suh what keep de gummint from takin away anudder twenty dollar from we whenever dey please jerry dover looked startled he was within his limits a decent man plainly that hadnt occurred to him it hadnt occurred to some of scipios fellow workers either not by their horrified exclamations and dover proved his honesty for he answered ill be damned if i know the huntsmans lodge was a glum place that night some of the men who came to dine there wore freedom party pins on their lapels somehow or other waiters contrived to spill hot or greasy food on several of them or on their wives or girlfriends the whites were furious the negroes were apologetic so was jerry dover im sure it was an accident sir he said repeatedly we have a very fine staff here but they are human freedom party men dont want to believe that scipio thought hed taken his tiny revenge on a man with one of those enamel pins on his tuxedo jacket cleaning the jacket wouldnt come cheap but it wouldnt come to twenty dollars either by contrast two or three waiters found themselves with unusually large tips the men who gave them might have been silently saying they didnt approve of collective fines you could always tell when a man got an unexpected tip he would straighten and smile in delighted surprise before he could catch himself scipio kept hoping he would find a sympathetic customer like that he kept hoping and he kept being disappointed when he left the lodge at half past twelve the rain was still coming down he didnt mind fewer troublemakers white or black were on the streets in weather like this so he thought anyhow and indeed no one troubled him but he was going up the front steps of his apartment building when he heard gunfire from the white part of town it wasnt just a pistol shot it was a regular fusillade from several tredegars back during the brief and bloody history of the congaree socialist republic hed come to know the sound of military rifles much better than he ever wanted to some things you didnt forget no matter how much you wished you could what was that bathsheba asked worriedly when he went inside dunno he answered that was technically true but he had his suspicionshis fears so did his wife you reckon some niggers doin somethin stupid she sounded frightened too and she didnt know about the fine the government was levying wouldnt be surprised we all be sorry if they is that one nigger he shoot at the president he told her of the fine twenty dollars bathshebas anguish was painful to hear she knew how much that was how badly it would hurt their finances aint nothin i kin do about it scipio said more gunfire burst out in the white part of augusta tredegars again and then the smaller answering pops of pistols black attackers and roused whites fighting back with whatever weapons they had handy scipio judged a moment later a hard hammering made him shiver even though it wasnt close somebody had a machine gun hed seen what such reaping machines of death could do by the way the rifle fire suddenly slacked off the machine gun didnt belong to the raiders bathshebas face was a mask of pain she had to be thinking the same thing them poor boys she whispered them poor boys gettin all shot up scipio nodded heavily but his pain wasnt just for the raiders whod bitten off more than they could chew bitter as wormwood revelations said he understood that now where he never had before them damn fools give de buckra de excuse to come down on we even hardern ever how they come down on us hardern they already doin his wife asked suppose georgia fine de niggers in de state suppose augusta fine de niggers in de city richmond do it dey reckons dey kin do it too mebbe scipio said bathsheba flinched as if hed hit her then reluctantly nodded with the freedom party in the saddle anything was possible anything at all that was a big part of what made it so frightening another inauguration day nellie jacobs wondered how many shed seen she hadnt gone to all of them work indifference and war had kept her away at one time or another this year though february first fell on a fine bright monday the temperature got up close to fifty it might almost have been spring she decided to close the coffeehouse and go hear what al smith had to say she took clara with her the high school closed for the day that her younger daughter her accidental daughter should be in high school still struck her as amazing to say nothing of unnatural hadnt clara been born just a few weeks ago that was how it seemed to nellie but clara was taller than she was shed grown up while nellie wasnt looking shed grown snippy while nellie wasnt looking too do we have to go with edna and merle and armstrong she said the last name was the problem clara and armstrong grimes had never got along not since she was a toddler and he was a baby she didnt want to have anything to do with him and she wasnt shy about letting the world know as much either hes my only grandson and ednas my daughter just as much as you are miss smartybritches and merle grimes is a good manand i dont say that about many men nellie answered so youll come along and act polite or youll find out youre not too big for me to warm your backside one of these days that kind of argument wouldnt work shed have a fight on her hands if she tried it she remembered that from dealingtrying to dealwith edna she got by with it today though clara might be snippy but she wasnt ready to fight back hard yet merle grimes wore his purple heart edna had on her order of remembrance second class nellie wished shed worn her medal shed earned it where edna hadnt come close to deserving hers they got pretty good bleacher seats on the mall in front of the washington monument nellie remembered when it had been blasted down to a stump now it stood tall again all it needed were hieroglyphics carved on the sides to make it seem perfectly egyptian nellie endured the parade of soldiers and workers and bands they werent what shed come to see or hear though they entranced both clara and edna and merle tapped the tip of his cane up and down between his feet in time to the music armstrong also seemed bored with parades and bands but armstrong made a habit of seeming bored with everything so nellie wasnt sure what that meant she leaned forward when the big black limousine carrying hoover and smith and la follette pulled up to the platform on which the new president and vice president would take the oath of office she hadnt voted for smith but she wanted to hear what he had to say for himself chief justice cicero pittman probably hadnt voted for al smith either he was a hoover appointee replacing at last the fierce and venerable oliver wendell holmes who was a veteran of the war of secession hed outlasted even george custer in public life pittman was round and benignlooking unlike the hawkfaced piratically mustached holmes charlie la follette took the vicepresidential oath first no outgoing vice president congratulated him for hoover having been elected as vice president himself had no replacement when propelled to the presidency on calvin coolidges death hoover did rise to shake al smiths hand the atmosphere on the platform was what diplomats called correct people who despised one another did their best to behave as if they didnt after chief justice pittman administered the oath of office to president smith the jurist sat down smith stayed behind the forest of microphones that would send his words to the crowd and take them across the country by wireless his unruly shock of black hair tried to deny that he was in his early sixties but his jowls affirmed it workers and people of the united states i thank you from the bottom of my heart for bringing me here today al smiths voice was raspy and full of new york city i have a lot of work to do and i am going to do it it is the peoples work and none is more important applause washed over him he seemed to grow a couple of inches taller when it did nellie had seen that before with other politicians teddy roosevelt and upton sinclair had both been the same way some folks said that because i am a catholic that was the kiss of death for my chances as was his way smith met the issue headon scorn in his voice he continued they used to say the same thing about any socialists chances what i say is no matter how thin you slice it its still baloney nellie joined the startled laughter up on the platform al smith grinned they didnt call him the happy warrior for nothing and what i say is youve heard a lot of baloney about what ill do and what i wont especially about our newest states presidentno former presidenthoover squirmed in his seat smith went on lets look at the record the record shows we won the war and we took houston and kentucky away from our confederate neighbors at gunpoint we didnt ask the people who were living there what they thought we just went ahead and grabbed with both hands now were paying the piper on account of that merle grimes started tapping his cane againthis time nellie judged in anger she needed a moment to realize smith hadnt said a word about sequoyah but it was full of indians so what difference did that make we have to find some way to straighten things out there smith said i dont know yet what that will be but i intend to work with president featherston to learn if i need to i will go to richmond to seek it out for a moment that didnt get applause it got nothing but astonished silence no president of the united states had ever said anything like it not in all the years since the confederate states rammed secession down the usas throat the cheers it did get after that long amazed beat were all the more fervent because of the preceding surprise nellie didnt join in them she had her own ideas about confederates and cozying up to them wasnt one of those ideas from then on she stopped listening armstrong said to edna grannys falling asleep but that wasnt true she just wasnt interested any more she almost told him soshe almost told the obnoxious brat where to go and how to get therebut it didnt seem worth the effort next thing she remembered loud clapping made her jump so maybe her grandson hadnt been as wrong as shed thought smith was done armstrongs still obnoxious though she thought looking around furtively to make sure no one had paid too much attention to her lapse her voice was louder and cheerier than it had to be when she said well lets go back to my place all right ma edna by contrast sounded oddly gentle are you all right ma clara asked im fine nellie declared then she stood up too quickly and felt dizzy for a moment oh for gods sake she thought mortified theyre all going to think im nothing but a little old lady merle grimes steadied her with a strong hand on her elbow dont worry mother jacobs he said well get you home just fine thank you merle nellie said youre a good soninlaw merle smiled armstrong made a face merle was good and strict with him and didnt put up with any guff the way edna sometimes did when they went back to the coffeehouse above which nellie had lived for so many years edna and clara both crowded into the kitchen with her as she took a big frying chicken out of the icebox why dont you let us give you a hand ma clara said edna nodded you can stick me in a rest home the day i dont know how to cut up a chicken and put it in hot fat nellie said tartly her daughters looked at each other and both started to laugh with identical shrugs they retreated and then with almost the first cut she made nellie got her own hand on the web between thumb and forefinger she said something she hadnt said since her days as a working girl armstrong was sitting closest to her his head came up in astonishment she glared at him defying him to make something of it or even to believe hed heard what he thought he had he looked away in a hurry satisfied nellie went back to work she didnt even bother washing her hands not that it would have done much good when she was still messing with chicken pieces once the chicken was dredged in cornmeal and sizzling in the fat she did rinse off the wound hadnt bled much she forgot about it everyone said the chicken was the best shed ever made she thought so too it turned out crisp and juicy and not a bit greasy clara and edna insisted that they wash the dishes triumphantly full nellie let them when she woke up a couple of days later with a sore hand she had trouble even remembering what shed done to it only when she looked down and saw how red and angry the cut looked did she nod to herself and think oh thats rightthe chicken then she went on about her business favoring the hand as much as she could clara noticed when she came home from school you ought to take that to a doctor ma she said it doesnt look so good oh dont be silly nellie said itll get better besides who can afford doctors but the hand didnt get better and the next day she started feeling weak and hot and rundown real alarm in her voice clara said im going to get the doctor over here right now nellie started to tell her not to bother but then didnt she didnt feel up to itand besides clara was already out the door the doctor looked nellie over listened to her heart took her pulse and took her temperature what is it nellie asked though she was too miserable to care much about the answer its mrs jacobs he said reluctantly you have blood poisoning im afraid it could be serious do you understand me when nellie nodded the room spun even so she said of course i do after a moment she added and the coffee and the raspberries even she had no idea what that meant she tried to laugh but didnt seem to have the strength what do we do clara asked from a million miles away keep her comfortable aspirin to fight the fever soup water juice whatever she can keep down the doctor answered his voice even more distant if she beats the infection shell be fine he didnt say what would happen if she didnt clara didnt ask neither did nellie she knew her body knew even if the fever clouded her mind she remembered very little of the next few daysand less and less as the time went on in that same dim way that way beneath consciousness she knew she was fading but shed already faded so far that she had trouble caring above her people seemed to appear and disappear as she drifted in and out of the real world clara edna merle armstrong she would blink and one would turn to another it might have been magic once though when she saw edna she knew there was something she had to say after a struggle she found it bill reach forcing out the name took all the strength she had what is it ma tears glinted off ednas cheeks bill reach nellie repeated and edna nodded so shed understood fighting for every word nellie went on killed him stuck him fuck him whats she saying asked someone off to the side armstrong shes delirious edna said there was this crazy man during the war he was a spy or something hal wouldve known for sure but she thinks she killed him did nellie said or tried to say but no one seemed to pay her any mind isnt that the way it goes she thought as lucidity ebbed for the last time isnt that just the way it goes you tell the truth and no one believes you she felt burning hot and then cold as the south pole and then nothing at all where do you have to go today laura asked as jonathan moss threw on his overcoat and jammed a wool hat down low on his head as usual april in berlin ontario was spring by the calendar but not by what it was doing outside the sun shone brightly but it shone on drifted snow from the storm that had just blown throughand another snowstorm or two might yet follow on the heels of this one london he answered gulping the hot tea shed set in front of him whatever warmth he could seize now would be welcome dorothys eyes got big and round youre driving all the way to england daddy his daughter asked she was four an age that seemed startling but not necessarily impossible moss laughed no sweetiejust over to london here in ontario if the roads arent clear though itll seem like its as far as england he kissed dorothy and laura and headed for the door london his wife said behind him thats where i used to go when i needed something they didnt have in arthur to someone whod grown up in chicago the idea of london ontario as the big city was pretty funny jonathan moss didnt say so he knew the things that were likely to spark quarrels with his wife and tried to steer clear of them too many quarrels started out of a clear blue sky for him to want to look for more instead with a wave he ducked out the door and was gone snow plows had gone over the road that ran west from berlin moss didnt care to think about what the rock salt the road crews had put down was doing to his undercarriage and his fenders and so resolutely he didnt he drove past the military airstrip outside of london and let out a nostalgic sigh he hadnt flown an aeroplane since coming home from the great war unlike a lot of fliers hed never had the urge now though it tugged at him tug or no though meeting the urge would have to wait he had a trial scheduled at occupation headquarters in london his client one morris metcalfe was accused of bribing the occupying authorities to look the other way while he did some blackmarket liquor dealing metcalfe was a cadaverous man with none of the bounce and energy lou jamieson displayed moss suspected he was guilty but the military prosecutor didnt have a strong case against him moss made that plain at every turn at last the prosecutor a captain named gus landels complained to the judge how can i show hes guilty if all his lawyer has to do is say hes innocent how can i show hes innocent if all you have to do is say hes guilty moss retorted and thought the shot went home in the middle of the afternoon the judge a lieutenant colonel who looked as if hed seen far too many cases pronounced metcalfe not guilty captain landels looked disgusted the judge pointed a finger at morris metcalfe he said my personal opinion is that theres more here than meets the eye i cant prove that and youre probably lucky i cant but i wont be surprised if i see you in this court again and if you dont get off so easy metcalfe looked back out of deadfish eyes i resent that your honor he saidhed spent enough time in us courts to know and use the proper form of address i wont lose any sleep over it the judge replied case dismissedfor now after a limp handshake metcalfe disappeared with hardly a word of thanks for moss captain landels noting that let out a derisive snort moss shrugged his only worry was extracting the balance of his fee from metcalfe but he thought he could do it like the judge he believed the other man would need his services again before too long he went out to reclaim his ford from the secure lot where hed parked itlike berlin london had one he was starting back to his home town when a flight of five fighting scoutsjust plain fighters they were calling them nowadayszoomed down to land at the field outside of london he almost drove off the road a block later he did drive off the road down a side street toward the airstrip those lean lowwinged shapes drew him as a lodestone draws nails they were as different from the machines hed flown in the great war as a thoroughbred was from a donkey he tried to imagine what one of them would have done to a squadron of his kites it would have knocked down the whole squadron without getting scratched he was sure of that the rifletoting guards at the airstrip werent inclined to let him enter his us identification card finally persuaded them though one rode along to escort him to the commandants office he caught a break there the man in charge of the field major rex finley had served in ontario during the war i remember you finley said i was at the party after you made ace youd forgotten it was your fifth kill thats me moss agreed cheerfully id forget my own head if my wife didnt nail it on me every morning finley chuckled i know the feeling well what can i do for you mr moss he bore down on moss civilian title i saw the new fighters coming in for a landing moss said theyre quite something the new wright s i should say so finley rubbed at his mustache a thin strip of dark hair clinging tight to his upper lip and could i sit in one the naked longing in moss voice startled even him he hadnt felt anything like that since hed fallen for laura secord long before she fell for him please major finley frowned i shouldnt its against about half a pound of regulations and you know it as well as i do moss didnt say anything hed done all the pleading he could do if he wanted to keep his selfrespect the field commandant made a fist and smacked it into his other hand come on officially you know you dont exist you were never here got it who me moss said finley laughed they walked out to the airstrip together major finley said ive heard you spend your time getting canucks off the hook to moss relief he sounded curious not hostile i do try the lawyer answered it needs doing even if you lost the war you need decent representation maybe you especially need it if you lost the war sandbagged machinegun nests protected the field the soldiers in them looked very alert pointing to one of those nests finley said id be happier about having somebody representing the damn canucks if all of em were convinced they had lost the damn war but we both know it isnt so that bomb over in manitoba and the big one in your town a couple of years ago oh yeah moss said that one almost caught me still dont you think things would be worse if the canadians decided the whole system was rigged against them shrugging finley answered damned if i know but then they dont pay me to worry about politicswhich is all to the good far as im concerned moss only half heard him by then theyd come up to the closest wright the air above the engine mount still shimmered with released heat two machine guns on this side of the mount fired through the prop moss assumed there were two more on the far side hed never flown an aeroplane that carried more than two machine guns with four he would have felt like the grim reaper in the sky and yet he knew the armament was nothing out of the ordinary these days you never piloted a machine that wasnt canvas and wire did you rex finley asked setting an affectionate hand on the bluepainted aluminum skin of the wing nope moss answered started out in a curtiss super hudson pusher ended up in our copy of kaiser bills albatros this is all new to me looks like a shark with wings all youd need to do would be to paint eyes and a mouth full of teeth on the front end not a half bad idea finley said well go on up the fighter moss discovered had a mounting stirrup just in front of the left wing he used the stirrup to climb up onto the wing the aeroplane rocked under his weight if hed climbed onto the wing of one of the aeroplanes hed flown in the great war though odds were he would have stuck his foot straight through the doped fabric the wright had a closed cockpit for better streamlining and because the wind at the high speeds at which it flew would have played havoc with a pilots vision goggles or no after some fumbling moss found the latch and slid back the canopy good thing i havent got fat or id never fit in here he remarked as he settled himself in the seat major finley slammed the canopy shut above him the cockpit smelled of leather and sweat and oil its being closed made it feel even more cramped than it really was the instrument panel bristled with dials along with the altimeter compass airspeed indicator inclinometer and fuel gauge he was used to instruments monitored engine performance in a dozen different ways ammunition supply propellor pitch and the electrical system the machine also boasted a wireless set which had its own profusion of dials youd need to go to college all over again to understand what half this stuff does moss thought dizzily but the essentials hadnt changed there was the stick and there was the firing button on top of it his right thumb found that button with unconscious ease the gunsight in the fighter made what hed used during the great war seem a tencent toy by comparison he jerked when finley rapped on the thickarmoredglass with his knuckles the base commandant gestured to show he should get out with an odd reluctance he nodded finley pushed back the canopy moss felt like a sardine getting out of its can as he extracted himself what do you think finley asked thats the cats meow all right moss hesitated then plunged any chance i could fly it when was the last time you flew the officer inquired moss wished he could lie but judged that would make things worse not better with a sigh he told the truth not long after the great war ended rex finley nodded about what i figuredand i would have kicked you off my field if youd tried to tell me it was week before last if youre going to take another stab at it i want you to put in some time on trainers before you smash up a wright machine even a trainer nowadays is a hotter crate than anything youve ever flown ill do that moss said at once jesus you bet i will i figured youd say you didnt want anything to do with me nope you were an ace you knew what you were doing up there finley said with any luck at all you can find it again and you know what one of these days were liable to need more people like you again or do you think im wrong moss wished he could have said yes but that too would have been a lie after her time in paris and richmondespecially after her time in paris anne colleton found st matthews south carolina much too small and confining she did what she could to fight the feeling by making forays into columbia and charleston but that helped only so much she had to come back to the flat where shed lived since red negroes almost killed her on the marshlands plantation the confederate governmentor maybe it was the freedom partyhad paid the rent on the flat while she was abroad she hadnt had to put her worldly goods into storage and then exhume them when she took up her life in st matthews again that was something anyhow something but not enough in paris shed haggled over alliances and foreign affairs in her fluent french in st matthews people talked about the weather and crops and what theyd heard on the wireless the night before but for the talk about the wireless anne had grown up on such conversation it seemed all the more stifling now when her brother came over to visit one warm muggy afternoon in late may she burst out if i hear one more word about tractors and combines and harvesters the loudmouth who says that word is going to be awfully sorry tom colleton shrugged sorry sis he said that stuff is important here its important all over the csa its boring anne replied with great sincerity all the yahoos bragging about the fancy equipment theyve got they dont get that excited about the equipment in their drawers for christs sake her brother turned red you cant talk like that around here he said and then before she could further scandalize him by asking why not he went on besides tractors and suchlike are important you notice how many niggers have been coming through town lately i should say i have anne answered one more reason to keep guns where i can get at them in a hurry yeah i know theft is up thats a problem tom said but those niggers are sharecroppers who dont have work any more because the machinerys doing it instead of them we dont need nearly so many people tied down to the land as we did when the great war started anne started to say and so then she remembered that pushing hard for farm machinery was part of featherstons program before she could remark on that tom said i dont know what the townsll do if all the niggers from the countryside stream into them at once do you know does the president if he does he isnt telling me anne said no too bad hed make a lot of friends if he came out and said what he has in mind this is liable to hurt him when elections come around this fall that made anne smile she couldnt help herself do you think anything will get in the way of the freedom party at election time anything at all her brothers face was a study in astonishment but thereve always been elections he said the freedom party is in anne might have been an adult reproving a childs naпvetй its going to stay in till it gets where its going and the confederate states get where theyre going christ tom said i dont think i much care for that tom now anne spoke urgently warning him against disaster do you realize how big a chance youre taking saying that even to me if you say it to somebody elseand it could be somebody you trustyoure liable to end up in more trouble than youve ever imagined tom colleton started to say something else very visibly he changed his mind but he couldnt let it go he asked and you work with these people you work for these people by the way he looked at her he might have been seeing her for the first time but anne didnt hesitate before she nodded i sure do she said because theyre going to take the csa where i want us to goright back up to the top id sooner her brother caught himself again his face twisted all right sis ill shut up if i talk too goddamn much im liable to end up in a camp with a big p stenciled on the back of my shirt isnt that right she winced not if youre talking to me that isnt what you said a minute ago i just wanted to remind you that you need to be careful and you do because if im not careful i will end up in a camp that was statement not question tom paused to light a cigarette after a couple of long angry puffs he added if thats where the freedom party is taking the country to hell with me if i want to go along am i a nigger or am i a white man who can stand up on his hind legs and speak his mind if he wants to weve all got to give up something if were going to get revenge on the usa anne said soothingly the yankees put up with keeping quiet and doing what they were told and standing in line for rationed goods for thirty years so they could get even with us the coal on that cigarette glowed a fierce fiery red when tom took another drag smoke fumed from him as he replied they didnt give up elections did they they didnt stop talking when they felt like talking even during the war the socialists were telling the democrats to go to the devil you shouldve heard some of the mouthy prisoners we caught up in virginia yes they had elections anne said they had them but how much did they matter from the second mexican war up till they licked us in the great war the democrats won every single time so they had them they kept people happy with them but the elections didnt really count maybe the freedom party will keep on doing that so people will stay happy i dont know the whigs here did and when the whigs lost they got out of office and handed things over to featherston the way they were supposed to tom stubbed out the cigarette then lit another one if the freedom party loses will it do the same no anne thought she decided she didnt want to be that blunt so she answered i dont see the freedom party losing any time soon people have work where they didnt before i was in richmond for the olympics i saw what a hit they were people are proud again they want to vote freedom before the war tom had been content even eager for her to do his thinking for him he wasnt any more he was his own man now through the haze of tobacco smoke around himhe might have been putting up a smoke screen he said you didnt answer my question i know i didnt you werent supposed to notice anne said i dont think the freedom party will lose an election for quite a whilenot one thats really important to it anywayexcept maybe in louisiana and that hardly counts it still wasnt a direct answer it seemed to come close enough tom said all featherston needs is a crown like the one the emperor of mexico wears think whatever you want anne said wearily you care about your family though be careful where you shoot off your mouth please why dont you have dear old jake wrapped around your finger annes lips skinned back from her teeth in what was anything but a smile at that the question could have been worse at least hed asked about her finger and not some other part of her anatomy she had to hide a small shiver as she answered dont be stupid tom anybody whos ever tried to get jake featherston to do what he wantsor what she wantshas ended up either sorry or dead and before you ask i think its more luck than anything else that im still here more than her words she thought her tone got through to tom his eyes blue as her own went wide he blurted sweet jesus christ anne youre scared to death of him anybody whos met him and who isnt is a fool she said standing up against him is like standing up to a hurricane you can yell and scream and fight and carry on but hell blow you over just the same he laughed shed known he would and shed known why sure enough he said thats how people talk about you you know oh yes she waved the words aside for now shed assess the hurt later for the time being she wanted to make sure she was understood but hes hes serious about things hes serious all the time and what he wants happens i dont always know how it does but it does think about it the whigs had run things here for as long as the confederate states were a country if they couldnt stop jake featherstonand they damned well couldntwhat can nothing nobody tom colleton shook his head in disbelief you talk about him like he really is a hurricane hes just a man sis anne shook her head too oh hes a man all right he sleeps he eats he goes to the toilet that jerked a startled laugh out of her brother she went on hell die one of these days if that nigger had shot him at the olympics hedve died right then but as long as hes alive hes not just a man for a long time i thought he was too so did a lot of people look whats happened since we were wrong every single one of us another cigarette out of the pack the scrape and flare of another match the harsh stink of sulfur before the mellower smell of tobacco smoke tom blew a smoke ring up toward the ceiling maybe to give himself time to think he said i never reckoned anybody could make you talk like that did you think i did she flared but jake does make me talk that way and youd better be careful how you talk too if you do anything stupid i cant protect you have you got that i cant featherston and the stalwarts will do whatever they want oh he might listen to me if i beg hard enough he might ive done some useful things for him and he might throw me a bone but i walked away from the freedom party once remember i thought he was finished and i went back to the whigs he never forgets something like that he might use you to pay me back too dont give him the chance please had she ever said please to him before oh shed said it she must have everybody did for politeness sake but had she ever meant it the way she had twice in the past five minutes she didnt think so children meant please especially when they got into trouble usually grownups didnt have to her desperate urgency must have got through to her brother he put out the latest cigaretteby now the ashtray was full of buttsand got to his feet all right he said ill keep quiet but its not for your sake its for bertha and the kids i dont care why just do it anne said he left the flat without another word she thought hed slam the door but he didnt the restraint was worse it felt like a slap in the face she wondered if they would ever have anything to say to each other again lucien galtier looked up at the sky the sun was sliding down toward the northwest but it wouldnt set for a long time yet when summer days came to the country by riviиreduloup they lasted long days meant short nights hed always thought that was good it let him get more work done and spend more time with his family now now suddenly he wondered oh the work went on he couldnt imagine the work stopping altogether if the work stopped wasnt that a sure sign he was dead he could still do the work too he took a certain somber pride in that true he wasnt young any more but he was still strong thinking about that made him laugh he was walking back from weeding the potato plot hoe on his shoulder like a soldiers rifle when an auto came up the track from the road toward his farmhouse he picked up the pace like a soldier going from ordinary march to double time that machine belonged to the odoulls sure enough his soninlaw got out of the motorcar and stood there waiting for him a good day to you galtier called to dr leonard odoull and what brings you here what brings me here odoull patted the iron flank of the motorcar my automobile what else thank you so much lucien unshouldered the hoe and made as if to swing it like a soldier starting bayonet drill let me ask the question another way then why have you come here oh why what he meant might not have occurred to dr odoull before galtier didnt believe that for a moment but his soninlaw played the role of a suddenly enlightened one well i had some business at the hospital he pointed to the big building the us army had run up on galtiers land during the warand i thought i would stop by as long as i was so close good im glad you did come inside if you like we can have a little something to drink smoke a cigarwith an afternoons weeding behind me i could use a cigar and i could truly use a drink his soninlaw laughed motion carried by acclamation without a dissenting voice lucien stowed the hoe in the barn he and leonard odoull went into the house through the door that led to the kitchen galtier knew the place wasnt so clean and neat as it had been when marie was alive all he could do was hope she wouldnt have been too displeased with the way he kept it up he busied himself pouring a couple of glasses of applejack and handed one to the american whod married nicole merci beaucoup dr odoull reached into a jacket pocket and took out two cigars he gave one to galtier here you are i delivered a baby boy yesterday these are part of the reward from the father i thank you i thank him comelets go into the front room when theyd sat down when they had the cigars going lucien raised his glass of homemade calvados salut he said and drank so did odoull after a good swig he whistled softly son of a bitch he said in english a tongue he used these days only when taken by surprise he sipped again more cautiously and returned to french potent stuff yes a strong batch lucien agreed quality varied wildly from one jug to the next as was only to be expected when people made the stuff in small stills with no tedious government regulations or even more tedious taxes strong but good so how wags your world well enough if i didnt set fire to my liver there leonard odoull replied for myself for nicole and little lucien all is well as i hope it is for you as you say well enough galtier puffed on the cigar hed had better whoever the new father was he was a cheapskate he paused all is well for your family you say which is good all is not so well somewhere else he wasnt sure hed heard that in the doctors voice but thought he had and odoull nodded i am not nearly so sure i like the direction in which i see the world headed galtier tried to make sense of that what man ever does non mon beaupиre not like that odoull said not the little thoughts that make a man wonder if he is all he should be when i say the world i mean the world his expansive gesture not only took in the whole world it nearly knocked over a lamp on the table next to the sofa where he sat maybe the applejack was hitting hard and fast maybe too he did have something big on his mind and what of the world lucien galtier asked most of it goes its way far from here when i remember how things were when that was not so i think this is not so bad i can do without soldiers and bombs and such things on my doorstep that ambulance driver i saw poor fellow wounded in his very manhood he shuddered and sipped again from his own drink if you will recall though helping the wounded is why i first came to quebec odoull picked up his glass instead of drinking he stared at the pale yellow apple brandy i have been comfortable here for many years forgetting the world and by the world forgot but i fear one day i may have to go back to my proper craft healing the wounded once more here in quebec lucien shook his head i do not believe it nor i odoull replied with a sweet sad smile but the world poor thing is wider than quebec and wilder too worse luck and i am a doctor and i am an american and if my country should ever need me in another war god forbid galtier broke in and crossed himself yes god forbid leonard odoull nodded so the world said in but god did not forbid and so if he should happen to be watching a football match again lucien laughed at the delicious blasphemy his soninlaw was not in a laughing mood odoull went on if that happens how could i stay quiet here attending to cases of measles and rheumatism that would be a waste of everything for which i trained the worst part of it was what he said made sense to galtier soberlyin spite of the applejackthe farmer said all i can tell you is may this not come to pass yes may it not indeed odoull knocked back the rest of his drink after he got over the coughing fit that followedthe stuff was too strong for such cavalier treatmenthe said thank you for letting me share my darkness with you cest rien lucien replied and it is nothing because who but you saw my darkness not so long ago who but you caused it he thought but that wasnt fair and he knew as much odoull had only diagnosed the trouble marie already had between the action franзaise and the freedom party and the silver shirts in england the world is a nastier place than it was ten years ago odoull said and in russia the tsar seems to think the jews cause all his problems and no one seems to want to stay in austriahungary except the austrians and the hungarians and even the hungarians are not so sure and the turks treat the armenians as the russians treat the jews and and you americans hold down englishspeaking canada galtier hadnt expected to say that it just popped out he wondered if his soninlaw would be offended but leonard odoull only nodded yes and that small next to some of the others i believe but no less real even so he got to his feet and now i had better leave if you ask me to have another drink ill say yes and then ill be too drunk to go back to riviиreduloup and nicole will be unhappy with meand with you he gave a curiously oldfashioned bow then made his way to the door and to his motorcar galtier wasnt going anywhere that night he made himself another drink and poured it all down maybe it helped him go to sleep after odoulls dark fantasies he needed all the help he could get when sunday came he drove into riviиreduloup to hear mass as hed got into the habit of doing the past few months he stopped at йloise granches house to give her a ride into town bonjour lucien she said as he opened the passengerside door of the chevrolet for her you look very handsome today i thank you for not buying new spectacles any time lately he replied she laughed he went on now i do not need spectacles of any sort to know what a pretty woman i am lucky enough to have with me how you do go on she said but indulgently when they got to the church йloise saw some lady friends and went to chat with them lucien sat in the bosom of his family nothing could have been more decorous nicole said how nice that you were able to bring mme granche again lucien nodded the service started a moment later after taking communion galtier led йloise granche back to his auto as theyd driven north so they went south when he stopped by the house she said would you care to come in for a cup of tea thank you id like that i cant stay long though he replied they went inside everything was quiet and peacefuland dark for йloise had no electricity she turned lucien took her in his arms a moment later they were holding each other and kissing and murmuring endearments for all the world as if they were a couple of youngsters discovering love for the very first time laughing exulting in his strength lucien lifted her into his arms and carried her upstairs to the bedroom be careful йloise exclaimed youll hurt yourself he laughed some more she said that every time he hadnt hurt himself yet and didnt seem likely to and the soft feel of her made the way his heart pounded till he gently set her on the bed seem altogether worthwhile before too long his heart was pounding again from an even more pleasurable exertion oh lucien йloise gasped urging him on her nails dug into his back so sweet she murmured eyes half closed so sweet afterwards he gave her a kiss as he lay beside her his heart was still drumming harder than it would have when he was a younger man he had more trouble catching his breath too than he would have when he and marie were newlyweds one of these days he said we should have father guillaume say the words over us women were supposed to be the ones who wanted such things but йloise shook her head as she had several times before not necessary she said better if he doesnt in fact it would only complicate matters with both our families if we marry it turns into a question of patrimonies if we dont then this is what it is thats all i like it better this way lucien set a hand on his chest and mimed complete exhaustion i dont think i could like it better than this he said йloise laughed again they laughed a lot when they were alone together neither one of them had done much laughing for a long time before and that to lucien mattered almost as much as the other cincinnatus driver wasnt an old man no oneexcept his son of course could have accused him of being an old man he was strong his hair was mostlydark he remained three years on the good side of fifty none of that though had kept him from turning into a grandfather karen driver wiggled in his arms he was getting used to holding a baby all over again karen weighed no more than a big cat which is to say nothing to speak of he was getting used to the way she looked too her skin was lighter than his but not quite the coffeewithcream color of negroes with a fair amount of white blood she had her mothers narrow eyes with the folds of skin at the inner corners too shes going to be beautiful cincinnatus said shes already beautiful thank you grace driver said softly cincinnatus and elizabeth had accepted her more readily than her folks accepted achilles the child helped and hurt at the same time the changs did love the baby but graces mother blamed her for not having a boy among other things karen stopped wiggling screwed up her little face and grunted cincinnatus laughed he had no trouble remembering what that meant he handed her to her mother she done made a mess in her drawers he said he was just karens granddad he didnt have to clean her up himself ill take care of her grace said and changed the babys diaper cincinnatus turned to his son how you doin he asked im all right achilles answered more of iowa than of kentucky in his accent cincinnatus knew his son would have said the same thing if he were living on the street and eating what he could fish out of garbage cans achilles had his own full measure of the familys stubbornness but he wasnt on the street he continued that clerking job of mine isnt what youd call exciting but i can pay my bills i wont get rich but im doing fine good thats good cincinnatus had been on his own when he was younger than achilles was now but he hadnt had to worry about a family then and a young black in confederate kentucky hadnt had the hopes and dreams of one in us iowa cincinnatus had been brutally sure he wouldnt couldnt get very far ahead of the game achilles could aspire to more he might not get it but if he didnt hed have to blame himself as well as the system under which he lived down in the csa the system gave any negro an easy excuse for failure let me have my grandbaby elizabeth said and reached for karen elizabeth took to being a grandmother with none of the doubts about age and the like that troubled cincinnatus and karen fascinated amanda who at fourteen was plenty old enough to help take care of her niece how you doin with your folks these days cincinnatus asked grace before she could answer achilles said well her daddy hasnt called me a nigger but he sure has come close i didnt ask how you was doin with mr chang cincinnatus said sharply i asked how grace was it is still hard she answered it is still very hard like achilles said my father and especially my mother are not modern people they think of china all the time they dont think we are all americans they dont think we are all the same achilles stirred at that pa doesnt think were all the same either he thinks colored people are down at the bottom of the pile that aint so cincinnatus said the heck it isnt achilles retorted no cincinnatus shook his head i never said that and i dont believe it what i say is white folks reckon black folks is on the bottom o the pile an thats the lords truth if you was old enough to recollect what it was like livin in kentucky when it belonged to the confederate states youd know it too but we arent in the confederate states any more achilles pointed out but white folks is still white folks that wasnt cincinnatus it was elizabeth the two older people thought as one on this question if anything elizabeth was more cautious about rocking the boat than her husband graces smile was sad she held up a hand to stop achilles when he would have come back with a hot answer that hand did stop him too as cincinnatus noted with surprise and more than a little respect she said my parents sound the same about this but times have changed if times hadnt changed would achilles and i be together times has changedsome cincinnatus said they aint changed enough you look at the black folks runnin away from the confederate states you look at how the usa dont let em cross the border president hoover president smith that dont matterit dont change the usa dont want nothin to do with us an thats how come i say things aint changed enough he waited to see how grace would respond to that she shrugged and said maybe he wondered what that was supposed to mean probably that he hadnt convinced her but she was too polite to say so she didnt always come out and say what she thought cincinnatus had already noticed that he asked you going to visit your folks while youre here only one flight up grace shook her head not much point they dont want to see us dont they want to see their grandbaby cincinnatus pointed to karen his son answered im not chinese im just a spook his voice was harsh and cold thats not quite fair grace said they wouldnt like it if you were white either well maybe not achilles admitted they dont quite hate me the way ive seen some white men do they can make themselves be polite i even used to think they were pretty nice till the two of us started getting serious but they sure dont want you to be married to me and the baby hasnt made em change their minds about that his wife sighed i know its sad they came to america to find a better life than they could have had in china they got one too but theyre still chinese first and american afterwards we came here to iowa to get a better life too cincinnatus said im glad im livin in the united states and not in the confederate states no more specially nowadays god help the poor niggers in the csa nowadays achilles and grace left a little later cincinnatus walked to the stairway with them hoping they would change their mind and go upstairs to visit the changs after all but they didnt they went down to the street carrying the baby with them he sighed and went back to the apartment elizabeths raised eyebrows asked a question cincinnatus shook his head his wife sighed thats so sad they cut off from half their family dont seem right dont seem right at all you aint got family you aint got nothin and the babys so cute amanda said how can you not love a little baby cincinnatus smiled you love everybody honey that was true amanda was a sweetnatured child because she liked almost everyone she thought everybody should like everybody else and if all the people in the world had been like her everybody would have sooner or later though she would have to realize not everyone worked the way she did cincinnatus hoped she wouldnt get hurt too badly finding that out elizabeth said i reckon graces folks love the baby all right the one they got trouble with is your brother not even amanda believed everybody ought to love achilles she loved him yes but sometimes even she had to work at it especially when she was smaller hed sometimes made her life miserable as an older brother was only too likely to do with a younger sister the next morning cincinnatus gulped an extra cup of coffee before he hit the road he stopped on the way to the railroad yards to buy a copy of the heraldexpress as usual he read the paper in snatches at stop signs and traffic lights and not for the frontpage stories but for the ones on the inside pages the stories the editorsand most people in des moinesdidnt think were so important who in des moines for instance got excited about a pagethree story whose headline said kentucky state police disbanded kentucky had rejoined the usa before houston had and had been much less troublesome but the freedom party had done very well in the last elections there and this was the result how many comfortable iowans knew the kentucky state police might better have been called the kentucky secret police the kentucky state police had been the instrument the usa used to make sure the state stayed loyal to philadelphia cincinnatus knew luther bliss the head of the outfit all too well just thinking of bliss light brown eyes the color of a hunting dogs was enough to make him break out in a cold sweat hed spent a couple of years in prison on account of the kentucky state police and now they were disbanding cincinnatus whistled softly do jesus he muttered who hold that state down and what would happen to their longtime head whod spent a generation stomping on everything the freedom party stood for would the new winners in kentucky hang him from a lamp post cincinnatus got his answer to that in the very next paragraph state police chief luther bliss the story said is on a factfinding trip to pennsylvania and was unavailable for comment when cincinnatus saw that he chuckled grimly bliss was either lucky orgiving him credit no less real for being reluctantsly to have escaped kentucky when his foes grabbed hold of the reins president smith is conferring with the secretary of war and the secretary of the interior about the present situation in kentucky the story continued a statement from philadelphia is expected within the next few days would the us government send more troops to kentucky to force the state to rescind what it had done or would it send enough soldiers to hold things down without the kentucky state police the only thing cincinnatus couldnt imagine the administration doing was nothing after all kentuckys southern border was also the usas southern border these days behind cincinnatus a horn blared he jumped and put the truck in gear hed been reading and woolgathering while traffic piled up he would have honked too if someone else did something like that he didnt get to finish the story then till he stopped at another red light when he did ice ran through him for the last sentence read governor ruby laffoon pledges to make good on a campaign promise to explore a plebiscite on whether kentucky should belong to the united states or to the confederate states they cant do that cincinnatus exclaimed he hoped they couldnt anyhow his father and mother still lived in covington if the stars and bars replaced the stars and stripes he shivered though the day was warm and muggy even so early in the morning got to git them out o there for negroes what nightmare could be worse than returning to the csa with the freedom party in the saddle ix the manitoba prairie seemed to roll on forever above puffy white clouds drifted across the blue sky mary pomeroy watched a hawk circle in lazy spirals high overhead the hawk would be watching too for rabbits or gophers to it a picnic on a farm wouldnt mean a thing mary couldnt watch the hawk for long she had to watch her own son like a hawk alexander arthur pomeroys first birthday was the occasion for the picnic hed just figured out how to put one foot in front of him without falling down which made him all the more dangerous to himself alexander didnt know that of course to him walking was the most wonderful thing in the world something went into his mouth mary tossed the drumstick shed been gnawing onto a plate and grabbed her son what have you got there she said sharply mama alexander said then as her forefinger snaked into his mouth he let out an indignant wail something there she fished it outa blade of grass not so bad she thought wiping her hand on her checked skirt shed taken a used match and a dead fly out of his mouth at one time or another she didnt want to think about the things he might have swallowed none of them seemed to have done him any harm anyhow maude mcgregor watched her daughter with a faint smile on her face i dont know how many times i had to do that with you she said then there was the pearl button i found in your diaper was there mary said and her mother nodded mary glanced toward her husband mort pomeroy was doing his polite best to pretend he hadnt heard but he turned red all the same of course hed grown up in town not on a farm mary had dealt with droppings of one kind or another ever since she learned how to walk talking about them didnt faze her her older sister who still lived on a farm was the same way ive had a surprise or two changing my kids too julia marble said she lay on a blanket on her side propped up on one elbow her belly bulged another chip off the marble block was due in about six weeks her husband kenneth and motherinlaw rode herd on her children she couldnt move fast enough now to do it herself mary remembered that beachedwhale feeling from her own pregnancy dont you wish it was over she asked julia oh lord yes her sister answered their mother nodded at that too and so did beth marble kenneths mother hand me another beer would you dear mary said to her husband mort pulled a moosehead from the picnic hamper he opened it with a church key and gave it to her thanks she told him nothing went better with fried chicken than the intense hoppiness of beer she smiled thats nice he nodded it is isnt it we get some hamms at the diner too because yanks will order it when they eat but i wouldnt bring it here i hope not kenneth marble said ive had yank beer they strain it through the kidneys of a sick horse and then bottle it eh mort started to nod again then blinked and made a peculiar noise half snort half giggle beth marble laughed out loud so did mary who was always ready to say or hear unkind things about the usa so did her mother which surprised and pleased her maude mcgregor didnt find a whole lot to laugh about these days fried chicken homemade potato salad deviled eggs freshbaked bread apple pie mary made a pig of herself and enjoyed doing it too she changed alexanders soggy diaper and cuddled him then set him down on the blanket when he fell asleep after a while the picnickers headed back to maude mcgregors house mort carried alexander mary carried the hamper which was much lighter than it had been when they put it in the motorcar back in rosenfeld julia said mary and i will take care of the dishes thats all right mary said i can do them you should stay off your feet i dont mind even if i have to run to the outhouse all the time now her sister said we can talk while we do them we dont get the chance much any more not the way we used to when we both lived here thats sweet beth marble said i was going to tell you id help but now i wont ill be lazy instead she laughed at that so did julia her motherinlaw was one of the least lazy people around before mary got married shed taken working the pump handle every so often while she did dishes for granted now she had to remind herself to do it and it made her shoulder ache running waters spoiled me she said sheepishly well youre living in town now julia said we always knew it was different it sure is we didnt know how much mary said electricity it beats kerosene all hollow i bet it does julia said like i said a lot of things are different in town i know that she lowered her voice and added but im afraid some things havent changed at all whats that supposed to mean mary asked scrubbing at a frying pan the breading and chicken skin at the bottom didnt want to come off she used more elbow grease in that same quiet voice julia answered i think you know i almost died when i heard somebody put a bomb in the general store i think ma probably did too if anything happened to you i dont think we could stand it not after alexander and pa i dont know what youre talking about said mary who knew perfectly well besides that was a year and a half ago nowmore than a year and a half ago nobody ever thought i had anything to do with it till now her sister set a glass in the dish drainer in the front room mort was telling a joke mary recognized his tone though she couldnt make out the words that ought to mean nobody in the front room could make out what she and julia were saying youre lucky julia told her and like i said before the two of us dont get the chance to talk like we used to if youre going to talk about things like this mary said julias smile was anything but amused i know you so does ma youve hated the yanks since you were this high she set a hand where her waist had been and you know what pa did the americans never found his tools did you even if i had i wouldnt say anything mary answered people who know things can tell them thats how the last uprising got betrayed some folks blabbed and theyre rich and happy and other folks hanged on account of it do you think i would do anything like that julia asked indignantly no dear hand me that platter would you mary scrubbed at it but it doesnt matter because i havent told you anything there isnt anything to tell nobody knows where pa hid his tools if the yanks couldnt find them you dont think i could do you after that they worked together in tense silence for some little while julia said i never thought the day would come when my own sister lied to me that hurt mary scrubbed away her head down i didnt lie she said in a low furious voice i told you there was nothing to talk about and there isnt and if you call me a liar there wont be anything to talk about not ever tell me you didnt put that bomb in the general store then julia said i didnt put it there mary said julias jaw dropped mary added and if you dont believe me you can go to the devil she lied without hesitation her family was and always had been sternly presbyterian here though she had no compunctions shed seen her father a man of somber rectitude if ever there was one lie the same way some things were too important to trust to anyone but yourself other people even a sister you loved could let you down better not to give them the chance and the lie worked julia put her arms around mary because of her bulging belly the embrace was awkward but julia plainly meant it im so sorry dear she said i did think you had something to do with it and it left me petrified ma too weve talked about it though i dont think shed ever get up the nerve to say so mary didnt think so either when her father was making bombs her mother had never asked him about it shed known shed known full well but shed kept quiet that had always been her way as the older sister though julia had always thought she could poke her nose into marys business whenever she felt like it that was how it seemed to mary anyhow she never stopped to wonder if it looked any different to julia they finished the dishes when they went into the living room mort asked what were you two gossiping about in there men mary answered in the same breath julia said horses how to tell the difference between them mary said that got a laugh from julia and their mother and beth marble mort and kenneth marble didnt seem to think it was quite so funny on the drive back to rosenfeld mary held alexander on her lap he put up with that for a while but then started to fuss he wanted to crawl around in the auto no matter what he wanted mary didnt let him who could guess what kinds of fascinating things hed find to stick in his mouth down there its a different world your mothers farm mort remarked as he pulled to a stop in front of their apartment building ive thought the same thing mary said no running water no electricity i didnt know what they were like till i married you no indoor plumbing either and that privy her husband held his nose alexander thought that was funny he tried to hold his little button of a nose and almost stuck a finger in his eye i didnt even think about it when i lived there mary said shed had to use the privy while she was there though the stink was enough to make her eyes cross it wasnt so bad in the wintertimebut during the winter you didnt want to expose any part of your anatomy to the cold what weve got here is better mort said a lot better of course it is mary said weve got each other that made mort smile which was what shed had in mind she didnt talk about what canada didnt have freedom independence its own laws its own people running its shops its own police in the streets its own soldiers guarding the frontiers mort knew his country lacked all those things too but mary didnt want to remind him about them lest he wonder if shed put the bomb in the general store it wasnt that she didnt trust him if she hadnt trusted him she never would have married him but some burdens she remained convinced had to be borne alone this was one of them she carried alexander arthur pomeroy up the stairs her brothers name went on so did her fathers and so did the quiet war theyd waged against the usa election day brought hipolito rodriguez into baroyeca to vote it also brought him in to make sure things went the way they were supposed to he thought people had learned their lessons during the election of when jake featherston became president of the csa and from the revenge on the freedom partys foes that followed but was four years gone by now sometimes people forgot lessons or needed to be reminded rodriguezs trip into town this year was different from the ones that had gone before with him strode miguel and jorge both of his older sons had finished their time in the freedom youth corps now they were strong young men broadshouldered deepchested hardmuscled both of them several inches taller than their father they werent old enough to vote yet but they were old enough and tough enough to knock heads if heads needed knocking a new set of poles marched down from the mountains parallel to the ones that had brought the telegraph into baroyeca for generations those were spindly and sunfaded they leaned now this way now that the new poles by contrast were perfectly spaced they were thicker than the poles that held the telegraph wire and every one stood perfectly straight even the wire on them wrapped in its heavy coat of black insulation seemed altogether stronger and tougher than the wire for the telegraph pointing to the line of new poles miguel said we did that pride rang in his voice i know you did hipolito rodriguez answered and im proud of you who would have thought baroyeca would have its own electricity a falcon spiraled down and perched on a power pole a couple of hundred yards away it didnt stay long as the rodriguezes drew near it flew off again screeching shrilly it landed on a telegraph pole but flew up at once when the pole shifted under its weight jorge said somebodys going to have to take care of those telegraph poles one of these days before too long his father had a pretty good idea who those somebodies might be the freedom youth corps was made for projects like that it always had plenty of eager active bodies and it didnt pay any of them very well when he got into baroyeca he saw boys from the youth corps working under the direction of a master mason from another town laying bricks for a new town hall and jail they labored like men possessed with a rhythm alien to sonora where things generally found their own pace not here this was a breath of businesslike virginia or north carolina set down at the far end of the confederate states miguel and jorge watched the youths with a mixture of scorn for those younger than themselves and respect for what they were doing miguel said they may be clumsy but they arent lazy he spoke in english it was the language of the youth corps and seemed to be the language he and jorge always used these days to think and talk about work the two of them werent lazy now that theyd come back to the farm they pitched into chores with an enthusiasm hipolito rodriguez found almost frightening they ate them up and went looking for more his own natural pace was slower he used maсana to mean one of these days when he got around to it they used the word scornfully to mean something that would never get done he stopped using the word so much the youth corps attitude began rubbing off on him this year the polling place was in the alcaldes front room several freedom party stalwarts stood just outside they waved to hipolito as he came up carlos ruiz had a list in his hand pointing to it rodriguez asked did any of those fellows try to vote this time only one ruiz answered we gave him a set of lumps and sent him home rodriguez walked inside to cast his ballot he voted the straight freedom party ticket the way the ballot was printed that was easy voting for the whigs or the radical liberals was much harder he put the completed ballot in the box hipolito rodriguez has voted intoned the clerk in charge of the box hearing his name spoken so seriously always made him feel important another clerk wrote a line through his name on the registration roster so he couldnt vote twice he wondered how much difference that made the people who would count the ballots were freedom party men back in the days when sonora had been in the radical liberals pockets rodriguez had often wondered how much announced counts had to do with real ones he still did the freedom party seized advantages whenever and however it could after voting he took his sons to freedom party headquarters robert quinn had seen them before but not lately por dios seсor rodriguez you did not tell me you were raising football players he said in his deliberate spanish where did you get these enormous young men miguel and jorge both stood even taller and threw back their shoulders to make them look wider they liked the idea of being football players the new usstyle game with forward passing had really caught on in sonora since the great war some open ground goal posts and a ball were all you needed miguel said all the good food we got in the freedom youth corps helped us finish growing hed said the same thing to rodriguez not long after coming home and in the sameenglishwords rodriguez guessed hed heard it a lot in the corps hastily though miguel added we eat well at home too and jorge nodded their mother had been hurt when they praised the food theyd eaten in the freedom youth corps quinn nodded now im sure you do he said still in spanish he bent over backwards not to seem to be ramming english down anyones throat in that he and other freedom party men in sonora were the opposite of a lot of englishspeakers rodriguez had known the freedom youth corps operated mostly in english but the younger generation was already more at home in the language of most of the confederate states quinn went on and what will you do now that youve been discharged from the corps help father on the farm for now sir jorge said i wish we could do something more for the country though miguel said it could be the day will come when you can quinn answered smoothly miguel wants to be conscripted thats what hes saying though he doesnt even know it the realization struck rodriguez like a thunderbolt and jorge was nodding ill talk with them their father thought he hadnt wanted to be conscripted but when his time came during the war the government was shooting young men in sonora who refused to report hed gone in and taken his chances with yankee lead he was still here so he supposed hed done the right thing robert quinn went on meanwhile of course doing things for the partido de libertad is almost the same as doing things for los estados confederados your father is a good man a patriotic man youll follow in his footsteps eh miguel and jorge both nodded then rodriguez said i will tell you what i am i am a man who is lucky in his sons there is no luck better than that quinn said do you want to grab a club and take the afternoon shift on watching the polling place bring your boys along let them see how its done then come back here now that we have electricity ive got a wireless set to let us hear returns he pointed to the box on his desk good rodriguez said nodding to the wireless almost as if it were a person we will see you here then after the polls close come on boys out they went and back to the alcaldes house when miguel and jorge saw that one of the men outside the polling place with their father was felipe rojas whod shown them the ropes when they joined the freedom youth corps they were very impressed when they saw that rojas didnt roar at their father like the wrath of god but treated him as an equal and a friend they were even more impressed rodriguez carefully concealed his amusement and then his amusement dried up and blew away for here came don gustavo his old patron straight for the polling place don gustavos name was on the list felipe rojas held he came up to the freedom party men as if he were still a great power in the land the power hed been before his white shirt and string tie his sharply creased black trousers and widebrimmed black felt hat his silver belt buckle and patentleather shoes all declared that he was no peasant but a person of consequence so did his thin little mustache and his prominent belly buenos dнas he said affably enough excuse me please for i am going to vote he had nerve hed come without bodyguards more than once the men loyal to him had come up against those who followed the freedom party theyd come off second best every time and paid a heavy price in blood now don gustavo was doing his bold best to pretend none of that had ever happened no matter how bold that best was it wasnt going to get him into the polling place freedom felipe rojas said in english you would do better seсor to go home and stay there in peace don gustavos nostrils flared angrily you speak of freedom and yet you say i am not free to vote he stuck to spanish and spanish of almost castilian purity his face was fiery red scorn came off him in waves his hand slid toward his pocket by the way the pocket sagged a small pistol hid there hipolito rodriguez tightened his grip on his club dont do that seсor he said you may shoot us you may even march in there and vote but if you do you are a dead man your family will die with you the partido de libertad knows how to take revenge do you doubt it he waited slowly the high color faded from don gustavos cheeks and forehead leaving him almost corpsepale hed seen how the freedom party struck back damn you he said the party men answered not a word don gustavos shoulders sagged he turned and walked away ўbueno papa jorge said softly hipolito rodriguez was only a peasant doing his best to make a living from a farm that could have been bigger and could have been on better land but for the moment he felt ten feet tall felipe rojas took a pencil from a trouser pocket and checked don gustavos name off on the list of those who werent going to vote the tiny sound the pencil point made on the paper was the sound of a system centuries old a system that had endured under the flag of spain the flag of mexico and the flag of the confederate states falling to ruin he backed down did he quinn said when the freedom party men returned to party headquarters hes not a hundred percent stupid then is he he knows things have changed in sonora and changed for the better too the sound of the wireless set was another sound of change the announcer who spoke mostly english but an english larded with spanish words and turns of phrase told of one freedom party victory after another in congressional races and in state and local elections the whole confederacy lined up behind president featherston and the party hed built well almost the whole confederacy rodriguez said he does not talk about the elections in louisiana robert quinn frowned as if he wished rodriguez hadnt noticed louisiana is a problem he admitted but the freedom party solves problems you can count on that the remembrance was a great ship her displacement matched that of any battleship in the us navy all the same the storm in the atlantic flung the aeroplane carrier around like a toy boat in a bathtub also inhabited by a rambunctious fouryearold sam carsten was glad he had a strong stomach plenty of sailors didnt the air in the ships corridors carried a faint but constant reek of vomit somewhere off to the east lay the coast of north carolina the remembrance and her aeroplanes were supposed to be keeping an eye on what the confederates were up to in weather and seas like this she could neither launch aeroplanes nor land them once launched about all she could do was pick up this that and the other thing in the wireless shack when carsten wasnt on duty he spent a fair amount of time hanging around in the shack finding out whatever he could a lot of the wireless traffic coming out of the csa was in morse which he understood only haltingly a lot of it was in code which not even the sailors taking it down understood but every now and then they tuned in to stations from wilmington or elizabeth city or norfolk up in virginia those fascinated him up until about the time his father was born the usa and the csa had been one country half an hour of listening to confederate wireless was plenty to show him theyd gone their separate ways since the war of secession oh the music the confederates played wasnt that much different from what he would have heard on a us station even there though the confederates tunes often had wilder rhythms to them than any band in the usa would have used carsten had heard people say that was because a lot of musicians in the csa were negroes he didnt know if it was true but hed heard it in between songs the advertisements were all but identical to their us equivalents that made perfect sense to him people trying to separate other people from their money probably sounded the same regardless of whether they were speaking english or italian or japanese or hindustani a hustler was a hustler no matter where he lived but when the news came on sam knew he was hearing voices from another country for one thing all the stations carried the same stories word for word sam had thought so and the men in the wireless shack confirmed his impression the broadcasters were all getting their scripts from the same place and by the way things sounded that place was a freedom party office somewhere in richmond as far as the wireless was concerned the freedom party could do no wrong jesus might have walked on water but if you listened to the smoothvoiced men in the wireless web freedom party officials from president featherston down to homer duffy the dogcatcher in pig scratch south carolina walked on air and choirs of angels burst into song behind them whenever they deigned to open their mouths and let the masses benefit from their godlike wisdom that especially held true when the announcers introduced a speech by jake featherston to listen to them moses was coming down from mount sinai to enlighten an undeserving and sinful people it wasnt just an act either or carsten didnt think it was they meant it and they expected everybody listening to feel the same way im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth the confederate president would say in his harsh accent and then hed spew out lies and hate if he spoke in front of an audience people would go nuts whooping and hollering and cheering to beat the band if he was by himself for a talk the broadcaster would sugarcoat it afterwards do the confederates really believe the crap that guy puts out sam asked after a particularly virulent tirade from featherston about colored terrorists one of the yeomen in the wireless shack shrugged if they say they dont sir they end up slightly dead he answered or more than slightly besides the other yeoman added they cant say anything against the government not in public they cant is it a country or a jail carsten asked near as i can tell sir the second yeoman said its a jail the more time sam spent in the wireless shack the more he was inclined to agree with the man who monitored signals coming out of the csa the other thing he noticed was that everybody on the wireless sounded happy about being in jail if people in the confederate states were unhappy about anything that was going on in their country they didnt say so where any large number of other people had the chance to hear them when carsten remarked on that one of the yeomen said youre close sir but youre not quite right when you hear em talk about louisiana youll think the devil lives there little by little sam discovered the man was right it took a while the men who read the news didnt like talking about louisiana any more than sams mother had liked talking about the facts of life sometimes though they couldnt help it they sounded as if they were gloating when they noted how the state militia there was having trouble putting down negro uprisings within its borders whenever governor long made a speech the broadcasters couldnt ignore they went out of their way to heap scorn on it they even seemed to celebrate when the new orleans tigers the numberone football team in the state lost to elevens from atlanta or richmond why do the rest of the confederate states hate louisiana carsten asked in the officers mess one day at suppertime youve noticed that have you lieutenant commander dan cressy said uh yes sir sam replied more than a little nervously cressy was the remembrances executive officer answerable to no one aboard the carrier except captain stein attracting his attention could be good or could be anything but depending on why you attracted it anyone else here notice it cressy inquired sipping his coffee he had a long thin pale highly intelligent face and a pair of the coldest gray eyes sam had ever seen like any good exec he acted like a son of a bitch so the skipper didnt have to a lot of people said he wasnt acting rumor had it that he translated latin poetry in his quarters carsten had no idea if that particular rumor was true commander cressy waited but none of the other officers in the mess said anything he set down the thick white china mug and nodded to sam very good lieutenant youre dead right of course louisiana is the pariah of the csa how did you come to realize that why didnt the rest of you notice that bubbled just below the surface of his voice three or four officers sent sam resentful looks he was the least senior man in the mess except an ensign just out of annapolisand that smoothcheeked ensign had a much brighter future in the navy than a middleaged mustang picking his words with care sam answered that sure is the way it sounds on the wireless sir he wondered whether commander cressy would land on him like a ton of bricks for listening to the wireless but cressy didnt his eyes stayed cold carsten didnt think they could warm upbut the light in them was undoubtedly approval good he said the more ways you can find out about the enemy the better formally of course the confederate states werent the enemy but among the fruit salad on cressys chest was the ribbon for a purple heart hed got a broken ankle aboard a us destroyer torpedoed by a cs submersible in after another sip of coffee he went on but you asked why didnt you uh yes sir carsten said the exec nodded again thats always the right question because everything else comes out of it not what not how why know why and what and how and often when and where and who take care of themselves this time why is pretty easy louisiana is the only confederate state the freedom party doesnt own lock stock and barrel long the governor there is a radical liberal and hes pulled off the same kind of coup inside the state as the freedom party has in the rest of the csa outside of louisiana what jake featherston says goes inside louisiana its what governor long says carsten nodded that told him what he needed to know all right it also raised another question can he get away with it before commander cressy could answer that the generalquarters klaxon started hooting cressy and carsten and all the other officers sprang to their feet the exec said well take this up another time if you like meanwhile meanwhile he was the first one out the door trotting toward his station on the bridge sam was only a step behind cressy as he hurried to his own post down in the bowels of the remembrance he wondered how many times hed gone to general quarters either as a drill or during real combat he wouldnt have cared to give a precise number but it had to be up in the hundreds he also wondered whether this was a drill or the real thing you always did if you had any sense he heard sailors asking one another the same question as they clattered up and down iron staircases and rushed along corridors nobody seemed to have an answer which was par for the course he was panting a little when he got to his own post too goddamn many cigarettes he thought theyre hell on the wind thinking of them made him want one but the smoking lamp went out during general quarters the pack stayed in his pocket whats up sir asked one of the sailors in the damagecontrol party beats me sam answered heres lieutenant commander pottinger though maybe he knows he turned to the officer who headed the damagecontrol party you know whats going on sir i think so hiram pottinger said dont know for a fact but the scuttlebutt is somebody spotted a periscope off to port that produced excited chatter from the sailors in the party one of them an enormous redhead named charlie fitzpatrick asked the cogent question whose subs dont usually fly flags on top of their periscopes pottinger said dryly in these waters though that boat isnt awfully goddamn likely to be japanese the sailors laughed but then somebody said the confederates arent supposed to have any submersibles and the laughter stopped everybody in the us navy was convinced the csa had quite a few things the armistice at the end of the war forbade carsten remembered those sleek aeroplanes with confederate citrus company painted on their sides they hadnt been armedhe didnt think they had anyhowbut theyd looked mighty ready to take guns no way to know the submarine is confederate pottinger said it could be british or french too that didnt make sam any happier the british whod been beaten but not crushed had been allowed a few submarines after the war the french hadnt but kaiser bills germany wasnt pushing them about that for one thing the kaiser was an old old man these days for another the action franзaise regime like the freedom party in the csa wanted to do some pushing of its own and for a third germany kept looking anxiously toward the balkans where restive south slavs were making austriahungary totter the same way they had a quarter of a century before fifteen minutes later the allclear sounded carsten warily accepted it but as he headed up to the flight deck he couldnt help wondering how long things would stay all clear the southbound train hurried through the night anne colleton had done a lot of traveling and a lot of sleeping in pullman cars she had trouble sleeping now here in mississippi she couldnt help wondering if machinegun fire would stitch its way along the side of the train or if a charge of dynamite buried in the roadbed would blow the engine off the tracks the confederate army was doing its best to put down the simmering negro uprising but guerrillas werent easy to quell as soon as they hid their guns they looked like any other sharecroppers and plenty of blacks who wouldnt go out bushwhacking themselves would lie for and conceal the ones who did this wasnt a revolt like the one in that one had hoped to topple the confederacy and had come too close to success this was more like a sore that didnt want to heal anne feared jake featherston and the freedom party had pushed blacks too hard after taking powerpushed them too hard without being able to crush them if they did rise up now the country had to pay for that lack of foresight eventually she did doze off when she woke the sky was getting light nobody had shot up the train she yawned enormously trying to drive away sleep a few minutes later a colored steward came by with a pot of coffee she all but mugged him to get her hands on a cup even as she drank it though she wondered if the man had any connection to the guerrillas you never could tell shed found that out the hard way she knew to the minute when the train passed from mississippi down into louisiana billboards with jake featherstons picture and freedom party slogans disappeared to be replaced by those with governor longs picture and his slogans long called himself a radical liberal but in fact he was just as much a strongman in louisiana as featherston was in the csa as a whole hed learned a lot from the way the freedom party had risen learned and applied the knowledge in his own state fortified by that cup of coffee anne got dressed and went to the dining car for breakfast she was just finishing when the conductor came through calling baton rouge next stop is baton rouge she went back to her compartment threw her nightclothes into a suitcase and waited for the train to stop a porter came to collect the luggage another negro and so another man to wonder about no matter how fulsomely he thanked her for the tip she gave him flashbulbs burst in a startling fusillade when she got down onto the platform from the pullman car welcome to louisiana miss colleton boomed a pudgy darkhaired man in his midforties governor huey long he swarmed forward first to shake her hand then to plant a kiss on her cheek more flashbulbs popped the papers in louisiana were as much in his pocket as those in the rest of the confederacy were in jake featherstons thank you very much anne answered slightly dazed i hadnt expected such a fancy reception shed expected to be met by a driver and possibly bodyguards and to be whisked from the station to the state capitol but huey long didnt operate that way anything worth doing is worth overdoing he declared and turned to play to the crowd on the platform aint that right folks people burst into noisy applause you tell em kingfish a woman called as if to a preacher long lacked some of president featherstons fiery intensity but he seemed a more likable more human figure they both got what they wantedpeople did as they told them tobut by different roads that aint was a nice touch huey long had a law degree such language wasnt part of the way he usually talked but he brought it out naturally using it to connect with the crowd come on he told anne lets get on over to the statehouse and talk she nodded that was what jake featherston had sent her to louisiana to do the governors limousine was a bentley with a hood as long as a battleship featherston would never have set foot in such a flashy motorcar he had so to speak risen from the ranks and didnt want to lose the common touch governor long by contrast reveled in luxury motorcycles ridden by state troopers preceded and followed the limousine so did police cars with red lights flashing and sirens blaring long turned the short trip from the station to the capitol into a procession more photographers were waiting for him and anne as they went up the steps into the impressively domed building hardfaced guards surrounded them going up those steps more guards waited at the entranceway still more patrolled the corridors however much huey long posed as a friend of the people he didnt trust them very far a horde of sweepers also patrolled the hallways and kept them spotlessly clean if im rushing you just sing out long told anne you want to go to a hotel and freshen up maybe even take a day to rest its all right by me thank you but im fine she said im here now we may as well talk now dont you think however you want it thats how itll be he said grandly suppose you go on and tell me why youre here thats simple governor im here to deliver a message for president featherston anne answered you must understand that or you wouldnt have given me such a splendid reception well now i want you to know it was my pleasure long said and then as if relishing the phrase repeated it my pleasure ill be glad to listen to this here message whatever it is even though i have trouble seeing what sort of a message the president of the csa would want to send to me im just minding my business here in louisiana and i reckon he ought to do the same outside my state thats part of what the message is about anne replied much more nervous here than shed ever been while dealing with action franзaise if governor long didnt like what she had to say she might not get home to south carolina he nodded now though all graciousness go on then he told her you understand that this is unofficial anne said if you quote me the president will either call you a liar or say i wasnt speaking for him long nodded impatiently hed trumpet what came next anyhow and featherston would disown it but now the formalities of things unofficial had been observed so anne went on you could call this a warning governor if you dont bring louisiana into line with the rest of the csa youll be sorry huey long scowled bring it into line you say whats that supposed to mean knuckle under to the freedom party pardon my french miss colleton but ill be damned if ill do that youll be damned if you dont anne thought aloud she said the president is concerned about the direction youre taking louisiana in im not doing anything he hasnt done long said he was right of course but hed started later and had only a state to work in that wasnt enough not when he was up against the rest of the country if he didnt see that if he didnt see that maybe he was too full of himself to see it anne said youd do better not to get all stiffnecked about this governor the president is very determined whats he going to do invade my state long snorted ridiculing the mere idea if he does well fight by god im just as good a confederate patriot as he is any day of the week despite his threat he didnt take the idea seriously anne did one thing she was sure of jake featherston would tolerate no threats to his own authority she said i dont know what hell do whatever it is do you really think you could stop it this is only one state after all ill take my chances said the governor of louisiana we havent seen much freedom since the freedom party took over but featherston cant run again in its against the confederate constitution i think maybe i can whip anybody else in the party willy knight he gave a contemptuous shrug if he hadnt climbed onto featherstons coattails hed still be a loudmouthed texas nobody he wasnt wrong about that either or about the single sixyear term to which the confederate president was limited more than once anne had wondered what jake featherston intended to do about that what could he do she didnt know to huey long she said thats all then ive told you what i came here to tell you i have a reservation at the excelsior may i go there it wasnt an idle question long might want to hold her hostage just so you know the president wont pay ransom or anything like that to get me back oh yes i know run along long said youre not a big enough centipede in my shoe to get excited about that stung of all the things anne least wanted to be called smalltime ranked high on the list smiling as if he knew as much long escorted her to the limousine the driver put the car into gear without asking where she was going five minutes later he pulled up in front of the excelsior here you are maam thank you she tipped him a colored bellboy put her suitcases on a cart and wheeled them into the hotel anne went to the front desk after fuming while she waited in line she gave her name to the clerk oh yes miss colleton of course and how are you this lovely afternoon anne hesitated a split second before answering shed expected to hear that precise question but not so soon tired she told him if shed said just fine the world would have been a different place she didnt know how not for certain but one response meant one thing the other something else the clerks face showed none of that with a sympathetic smile he said you take it easy here weve got fine rooms and the best restaurant in town too all right ill try it she collected her room key and went upstairs the bellboy trailing along behind her she tipped him and the elevator operator then unpacked and indulged in the luxury of a bath before going down to the best restaurant in town it lived up to the desk clerks description she soon saw why a lot of the plump prosperous men who ate there were louisiana legislators talk of power and of business filled the air the restaurant gave a view of roselawn the street that led north to the capitol anne was about halfway through an excellent plate of lamb chops when chaos suddenly erupted outside sirens screaming and red lights blazing police cars and ambulances raced toward the statehouse several of the important men in the restaurant wondered what was going on some of them loudly and profanely a telephone in the corridor that led to the place jangled a waiter hurried from the corridor to one of the tables full of prominent people a handsome grayhaired man went back with him a moment later curses as explosive as any anne had ever heard filled the air the grayhaired man rushed back into the room crying governor longs been shot shot i tell you nigger janitor was carrying a gun goddamn niggers dead but governor long hes hurt bad pandemonium filled the restaurant men sprang to their feet shouting frightful oaths women screamed a few men screamed too anne went right on eating her lamb chops she was supposed to get out of town tomorrow and hoped the state authorities would let her leave if they started wondering what connection she had to a desk clerk and a desperate janitor all she knew about was one code phrase no she knew one other thing when jake featherston gave her this assignment shed known better than to ask too many questions you cant do this to me the silverhaired lawyer insisted it violates every tenet of the constitution of the confederate states of america jefferson pinkard shrugged broad shoulders if i had the time i could tell you theres martial law in louisiana and so whatever the constitutions got to say doesnt matter worth a hill of beans if i had time i could do that but i dont have time and so he slapped the lawyer in the face then backhanded him with a return stroke then he punched the silverhaired fellow in the pit of the stomach the man tried to double up but the guards who had hold of him wouldnt let him in friendly tones pinkard asked see what i mean he wondered if the lawyer would say something stupid and need another dose some of these people did theyd run things in louisiana for a long time and had trouble figuring out they werent in charge any more they ran their mouths off and they paid for it oh yes they paid plenty this one though seemed smarter than most he also needed half a minute or so to catch his breath before he could say anything at all i get it he choked out his face gray with pain a little disappointed jeff jerked a thumb toward the interior of the camp take him away he said and the guards did jeff laughed he wondered if the men whod voted to build camps in louisiana ever imagined theyd wind up in them he doubted it people didnt work that way but whether people believed it or not things changed mighty easily huey long had imitated in miniature jake featherstons system of running up prison camps to hold people who might cause trouble for him with long dead with the president declaring martial law in louisiana to deal with the vile terrorism of black insurrection the freedom party and all its apparatus had swooped down on the state like a hawk swooping down on a plump chicken men whod defied the freedom party since long before were finally getting what was coming to them the swoop came so hard and fast state officials hadnt had any chance to resist president featherston declared martial law the minute he heard governor long was dead soldiers and freedom party guards and stalwarts swarmed into louisiana from north east and west so many of them had been in texas and mississippi and arkansas so very close to the border that pinkard wondered if they hadnt waited there for longs assassination he wondered but he kept quiet men who shot off their mouths about things like that didnt run prison camps they got locked up in them and besides jeff was more inclined to see this whole operation as good planning than as an invasion longs wardens had used a little more imagination on the names of their prisons than the freedom party bothered with this one just outside alexandria was called camp dependable that amused jeff not least because the fellow who had been in charge of this place was now an inmate here so was one of huey longs brothers the other had suffered an unfortunate accident shortly after the forces necessary for martial law began entering louisiana jeff had heardunofficially of coursethat the accident involved a burst of machinegun fire that wasnt in the papers or on the wireless he couldnt prove it was true but he wouldnt have been surprised either he went out to the perimeter of camp dependable freedom party stalwarts were strengthening it with more barbed wire it already had more machinegun emplacements than longs people had been able to afford martial law had been declared to put down the negro insurrection in louisiana that insurrection still simmered and still needed defending against somehow though just about all the inmates in the prison camp were white men whod backed huey long to the hilt everything tight pinkard asked a helmeted freedom party guard who manned a machine gun you bet warden the man answered tight as a fiftydollar whores snatch pinkard laughed thats the way its supposed to be he said and continued on his rounds freedom he added over his shoulder freedom the machine gunner echoed that greeting hadnt been heard much here since huey long seized the reins with martial law in place though with louisiana being brought into line with the rest of the confederate states freedom here now had the importance it deserved a few hundred yards away motorcars rolled along the highway that ran down to new orleans governor long had done a lot for the roads in the state building roads meant lots of jobs out in the rest of the csa president featherstons dambuilding program did the same thing only after hed trumped the entire perimeter did pinkard relax a little hed got into the habit down in the empire of mexico there he hadnt been able to rely on the guards as much as he would have liked if he didnt see things with his own eyes he couldnt know for sure how they were going he still remained convinced he had a better chance of heading off trouble if he kept an eye on everything himself with a couple of guards he also strode through the interior of camp dependable having an escort was part of regulations where he didnt make the rules he followed them making people follow the rules was the point of a prison camp after all but rules or no rules he didnt much worry about being taken hostage new prisoners had tried that once with another warden a couple of days after governor long died the ensuing massacre showed what they could expect if they tried it again hey warden somebody called can we get better food youll get what the regulations say you get pinkard answered and youll be sorry if you whine about it you understand the prisoner didnt answer he wore his striped uniformregulation in louisianawith an odd sort of pride hed sounded like an educated man when he asked the question jeff wondered what hed been before huey longs rule collapsed a lawyer a professor a writer whatever hed been he was only a prisoner now and he hadnt really figured out how to be a prisoner or he wouldnt have kept quiet when the warden asked him a question pinkard nodded to the guards he needed to do no more than that they fell on the man and beat him up he howled which helped him not at all the other prisoners nearby watched wideeyed none of them said a word or tried to interfere they were learning when the beating ended the guards stepped back they werent even mussed slowly painfully blood running down his face the prisoner struggled to his feet you understand jeff asked him again yes warden he choked out stand at attention when you speak to the warden you worthless sack of shit a guard growled the prisoner did his best it wasnt very good since he could hardly stand upright at all here though making the effort counted yes warden he repeated and then warily he added sorry warden sorry doesnt cut the mustard pinkard snapped what are you what the prisoner frowned one of the guards snarled in hungry eagerness he snarled a little too soon though and gave the man a hint im a worthless sack of shit warden he blurted pinkard answered with a brusque nod and a handful of words grits and waterten days he waited if the prisoner protested if he even blinked he would be a lot sorrier than he was already but he only stayed at attention and tried to look as if hed got good news pinkard nodded again and walked on he would have less trouble from here on out with everybody whod watched and listened no one gave him any more lip till he got to the infirmary then it came not from a prisoner but from a whitecoated doctor warden if these men keep getting rations of hominy grits and a little fatback and nothing else youll see more cases of pellagra than you can shake a stick at what else am i supposed to feed them jeff asked vegetables fruits wheat flour the doctor said they havent been here very long but some of them are already starting to show symptoms feeding em that other stuffd cost more money wouldnt it pinkard asked well yes the man in the white coat admitted but pellagras no joke it will kill its only the past few years weve found out that something missing from the diet causes it do you want to burden yourself with a lot of disease you can easily prevent jeff shrugged i dont know about that what i do know is these people are enemies of the confederate states they dont deserve anything fancy well go on the way we have been thank you very much he waited he couldnt punish the doctor the way hed punished the prisoner the doctor was only trying to do his job he was supposed to be politically sound he took a look at the guards standing behind pinkard and visibly wilted all right he said but i did want to keep you informed fine pinkard said im informed freedom this time the handy word meant shut up and stop bothering me freedom the doctor echoed he couldnt say anything else barbed wire separated the wardens office and quarters and the guards quarters from the prisoners barracks pinkard nodded to himself when he passed out of the area where the prisoners lived they were nothing but trouble that was even more true here than it had been in alabama there whigs and rad libs had guessed for a long time what would happen to them once the freedom party came out on top not here in louisiana not after long got in the rad libs here had thought theyd stay on top forever as pinkard went up the stairs of the mess hall to grab himself a snack he had a lot more choices than grits and fatback a flight of aeroplanes buzzed by overhead they were painted in bright colors instead of the cs battle flag they had confederate citrus company painted on wings and fuselage but they meant business when confederate forces entered louisiana after governor long was gunned down a few state policemen and militiamen had tried to resist they didnt try for long not after those confederate citrus company machines bombed and machinegunned them from the sky and the aeroplanes had been useful since too pounding negro guerrillas who hid in swamps and bays inaccessible except from above the confederate states werent supposed to have aeroplanes that carried bombs and machine runs that was what the united states had been saying since anyhow president smith had sent president featherston a note about it jeff remembered hearing about that on the wireless set in his quarters and president featherston had written back too saying they were armed only for internalsecurity reasons and that the csa would take the weapons off as soon as things calmed down again so far the usa hadnt said anything more it had been two or three weeks now since the first protest as far as jeff could see that meant his country had got away with it he grinned as he went into the mess hall the damnyankees had been kicking the confederate states around for more than twenty years but their day was ending the csa could walk proud again could and would a colored cook fixed him a big meaty roastbeef sandwich with all the trimmings he got himself a cup of coffee rich and pale with cream and full of sugar mayonnaise ran down his chin when he took a big bite of the sandwich life wasnt bad no sir not bad at all every time clarence potter put on his uniform he looked in the mirror to see if he was dreaming no dream butternut tunic a colonels three stars on each collar patch the cut of the tunic was slightly different from what hed worn in the great war it was looser less binding under the arms and the collar didnt try to choke him every time he turned his head whoeverd redesigned it had realized a man might have to move and fight while he had it on going to the war department offices in richmond seemed a dream too although hed been doing it for a year and a half now the sentries outside the building stiffened to attention and saluted when he went by he returned the salutes as if hed done it every day since the war ended the first few times hed saluted though hed been painfully embarrassingly rusty more visitors to the war department walked up the stairs near the entrance or paused to ask the sergeant sitting at a desk with an information sign where they needed to go the sergeant was plump and friendly and helpful few people went down the corridor past his desk another sign marked it authorized personnel only the friendly sergeant nodded to potter as he strode by he went halfway down the corridor with the intimidating sign then opened a door labeled supplies amp requisitions with careful even fussy precision he closed the door behind him three more guards stood on the other side of that door instead of bayoneted tredegars two of them carried submachine guns short ugly weapons good for nothing but turning men into hamburger at close range the third guard had a instead he said your identification colonel as always potter produced the card with his photograph on it as always the guard gave it a onceover to make sure photo matched face satisfied the man with thewhod been careful not to get in his comrades line of firestepped back he pointed to the log sheet on a table past the guards potter put the card back in his wallet then logged himself in he looked at his watch before adding the time hed had to get used to military hours again too stairs led down from the door marked supplies amp requisitions the room where potter worked was in a subbasement several stories below street level down here fans whirred to keep air circulating it felt musty anyhow in the summer it was airconditioned like a fancy cinema house it would have been unbearable otherwise potter sat down at his desk and started going through us newspapers most of them a day or two or three out of date know your enemy had to be the oldest rule in intelligence work papers in the usa talked too much they talked about all sorts of things the government would have been happier to see unsaid movements of soldiers of barrels of aeroplanes of ships stories of what was made where and how much and for how much railroad schedules pieces about how the bureaucracy worked and often how it failed to work papers in the csa had been the same way before the freedom party took over they offered much less to wouldbe spies now every so often clarence potter remembered hed come up to richmond to assassinate president featherston he knew why hed come up here to do it too he still believed just about everything he had during the olympics but he wasnt interested in shooting featherston any more he had too many other things going on hed known featherston was shrewd but he hadnt realized just how clever the president of the csa was not till he saw from the inside the way featherston operated after shooting the negro whod opened fire on featherston before he could himself potter could have been patted on the back and then suffered a dreadful accident instead featherston had done something even nastier hed given potter a job he really wanted to do a job he could do well and a job where who his boss was didnt matter a bit oh yes potter murmured when that thought crossed his mind id want revenge on the usa no matter who the president was featherston hadnt used him in the subjugation of louisiana potter hadnt even known that was in the works till it happenedwhich was all by itself a sign of good security there were all sorts of things he didnt need to know and would be better off not knowing the people whod planned and brought off the louisiana operation didnt know what he was up to either he hoped like hell they didnt anyhow he was banging away at a typewriter putting together a report on us navy movements out of new york harbor when his nine oclock appointment showed up ten minutes early randolph davidsons collar tabs bore the two bars of a first lieutenant he was in his late twenties blond blueeyed with very red cheeks and a little wisp of a mustache saluting he said reporting as ordered colonel potter potter cocked his head to one side listening intently weighing judging not bad he said in judicious tones how did you come to sound so much like a damnyankee he sounded a lot like one himself the intonations hed picked up at yale before the war had stuck after the war sir my father did a lot of business in ohio and indiana davidson answered the whole family lived up there and i went to school there youd certainly convince anyone on this side of the border potter said the younger man looked unhappy i know that sir people dont trust me on account of the way i talk i swear id be a captain now if i sounded like i came from mississippi i understand ive had some trouble along those lines myself potter said in sympathy now the next question is could you pass for a damnyankee on the other side of the border davidson didnt answer right away those blue eyes of his widened and became even bluer in the process so thats what this is all about he breathed thats right potter spoke like one of his yale professors this is what happens when two countries that dont like each other use the same language you can usually tell somebody from mississippi apart from somebody from michigan without much trouble usually but with the right set of documents somebody who sounds like a damnyankee can go up north and be a damnyankeeand do all sorts of other interesting things besides what do you think of that lieutenant when do i start davidson said its not quite so simple clarence potter said with a smile youve got some training to do and weve got some more checks to do but you look good you sound good thank you very much sir davidson said where most confederate citizens would have answered thank you kindly potter nodded approval the younger mans grin said he knew what potter was approving i will be in touch with you lieutenant potter said you can count on that yes sir davidson also knew dismissal when he heard it he got to his feet and saluted freedom that word still rankled it reminded clarence potter of what he had been he didnt care to think about how the man whod redonned confederate uniform had come to richmond with a pistol in his pocket he wanted to pretend he hadnt heard the word he wanted to but he couldnt lieutenant davidson was definitely a man who spoke with a yankee accent that didnt mean he wasnt also a freedom party spy checking on the loyalty of a suspect officer im old news now potter thought if anything happens to me it wont even show up in the papers i cant afford to make people worry about me the calculationone hed gone through beforetook less than a heartbeat freedom he echoed not with the enthusiasm of a stalwart but in a crisp businesslike military way davidson left the underground office potter scribbled a couple of notes to himself they both had to do with the background checks hed have to make on the officer whod gone to school in ohio and indiana some of those checks might show whether davidson was reporting back to the freedom party others might show whether he was reporting back to us army intelligence headquarters in philadelphia potter muttered under his breath that was the chance he took when running this kind of operation somebody who sounded like a damnyankee was liable to be a damnyankee the csa spied on the usa but the usa also spied on the csa if the united states could slide a spy into confederate intelligence that could be worth a corps of ordinary soldiers when a second round of fighting broke out facing a foe who spoke your language was a twoedged sword and could cut both ways anyone who didnt realize that was a fool i hope im not a fool potter muttered as he went back to plugging away at his paperwork i hope im not that kind of fool anyhow how could you know though how could you be sure during the great war potter had worried more about the tactical level than the strategic this new job was more complex less well defined here he couldnt write something along the lines of interrogation of us prisoners indicates an attack in map sector a will commence at day after tomorrow what he was looking for was subtler more evanescentand when he thought he saw it he had to make sure he wasnt just seeing something his us opposite number for he surely had one wanted him to see damn you he said under his breath that was aimed at jake featherston but potter knew better than to name names someone might besomeone almost certainly waslistening to him the trouble was featherston had known exactly what made potter tick i solve puzzles im good at it point me at something and i will get to the bottom of it tell me it helps my countryno let me see with my own eyes that it helps my countryand ill dig four times as hard to get to the bottom of it above potters head the fans in the ventilation system went on whirring the sound got to be part of him after a while if it ever stopped hed probably exclaim what was that the vibration had made his fillings ache when he first came here no more now it seemed as basic as essential as the endless swirl of blood through his veins a major walked past him after twelve the man said you going to work through lunch colonel potter looked at his watch in amazement where had the morning gone hed done more plugging than he thought not me he said and got to his feet intelligence had its own mess hallthe secret lunchroom he thought with wry amusementso men who dealt in hidden things could talk shop with no one else the wiser he got himself a pastrami sandwicha taste hed acquired in connecticut and not one widely shared in the csaand a glass of dr hopper then sat down at a table he had it to himself even after a year and a half he was still new here still not really one of the gang a lot of the officers in intelligence the elite in the cs army had served through the lean and hungry times after the great war they had their own cliques and didnt readily invite johnnycomelatelies to join they were still deciding what to make of him too some of them despised jake featherston others thought him the second coming with one foot in both those camps potter didnt fit either and so instead of gabbing he listened you learn more that way he told himself a yankee spy would have learned a lot especially hearing the way names like kentucky and houston got thrown around potter had suspected that much even before he came back to intelligence as anyone would he liked finding out he was right x snow swirled through the air colonel abner dowling stood at stiff attention ignoring the raw weather even when a flake hit him in the eye he didnt he wouldntblink ill be damned if i let salt lake city get the best of me now he thought stubbornly a military band struck up the starspangled banner beside dowling his adjutant drew himself up even straighter than he had been when the last notes of the national anthem died away dowling moved he marched forward half a dozen paces to face the newly elected governor of utah who stood waiting in a black suit an undertaker might have worn a mechanism might have given dowlings salute governor young he said heber young returned a nod at least as precisely machined colonel dowling he replied his tone as cool and formal as the officers flashbulbs popped recording the moment for posterity purple and green spots filled dowlings vision he did his best not to blink on account of the flashbulbs either governor young he said at the order of president smith utah is now taking its place as a state like any other in the united states its long military occupation coming to an end i wish you and your fellow citizens good fortune in years to come and hope with all my heart that the peace and tranquility established here may long continue thank you very much colonel dowling governor young replied and more flashbulbs popped we of utah have waited a long time for this moment now that our government is in our own hands once more you may rest assured that we will be diligent and careful in serving the public good hes as big a liar as i am dowling thought utah wasnt a land of peace and tranquility and the new civilian governmentthe new mormon government since latterday saints held all the elected offices in the executive and solid majorities in both houses of the legislaturewould do whatever it damn well pleased young went on for more than half a century now the united states have persisted in believing that the people of utah are different from others who call the usa home at last we will have the opportunity to show the countryto show the entire worldthat that is not so we are our own masters once more and we will make the most of it dowling listened politely which took effort young hadnt mentioned a few things polygamy was one disloyalty was another after an attempted secession during the second mexican war an armed rebellion during the great war and an assassination in front of dowlings own eyes were the people of utah really no different from others who called the usa home dowling had his doubts but president smith evidently didnt and smiths opinion carried a lot more weight than dowlings even if dowling himself carried a lot more weight than smith removing the us garrison from utah would save millions of dollars that might be better spent elsewhereprovided the state didnt go up in flames and cost more money not less well find out dowling thought i will work closely with the government of the united states to make sure peace prevails heber young said utah has been born again with gods help our liberty will long endure he nodded once more to dowling what did that mean get out you son of a bitch and dont come back probably though young a thorough gentleman would never have said such a thing dowling gave him another salute to show that civilian authority in the united states was superior to military then the commandantnow the former commandantof salt lake city did a smart aboutface and marched back to his men the ceremony was over civilian rule had returned to utah for the first time in more than fifty years trucks waited to take the soldiers to the train station dowling and captain toricelli went in a greengray automobile instead toricelli said five minutes after we leave the state the mormon temple will start going up again what makes you think theyll wait that long dowling asked and his adjutant laughed though he hadnt been joking he went on how much do you want to bet that gilded statue of the angel moroni will go on top of the new temple too sorry sir but i wont touch that one captain toricelli answered the gilded copper statue that had surmounted the old mormon temple had disappeared before us artillery and aerial bombs brought the building down in the occupying authorities had put up a huge reward for information leading to its discovery in more than twenty years no one had ever claimed that reward and the statue remained undiscovered i wonder what the mormons will do now that theyre legal again dowling said in musing tones young had to promise they wouldnt bring back polygamy toricelli said the president did squeeze that much out of him bully dowling replied at which his adjutant a much younger man looked at him as if amazed anyone could say such a thing dowlings ears heated his taste in slang had crystallized before the great war if he sounded oldfashioned then he did that was all no one shot at the auto or the trucks on the way to the station dowling had wondered if his men would have to fight their way out of salt lake city but the withdrawal hadnt had any trouble maybe the mormons didnt want to do anything to give al smith an excuse for changing his mind dowling wouldnt have either not in their shoes but you never could tell with fanatics the mormons did find ways to make their feelings known pictures and banners with beehivestheir symbol of industry and the emblem of the republic of deseret theyd tried to set upwere everywhere and dowling saw the word freedom painted on more than a few walls and fences maybe that just meant the locals were glad to be getting out from under us military occupation but maybe it meant some of them really were as cozy with jake featherstons party and the confederate states as winthrop w webb had feared dowling hoped the skinny little spy was safe as far as he knew no one had ever figured out that webb worked for the occupying authorities but again you never could tell at the station most of the soldiers filed into ordinary secondclass passenger cars they would sleepif they sleptin seats that didnt recline dowling and toricelli shared a pullman car dowling remembered train rides with general custer he didnt think he was as big a nuisance as custer had been no matter what he thought hed never broached the subject to captain toricelli custer was a great hero to the usa but not to abner dowling as dowling knew too well no man was a hero to his adjutant any more than he was to his valet toricelli stayed polite that sufficed with a squeal of the whistle and a series of jerks the train began to move toricelli said i wont be sorry to get out of utah sir and thats the lords truth neither will i dowling allowed i wonder what the big brains in philadelphia will do with me now he had to wait and see hed spent ten years as custers adjutant and if that wasnt cruel and unusual punishment he didnt know what would be and all the time since in utah what next hed proved he could put up with cranky old men and religious fanatics what else did that suit him for he himself couldnt have said maybe the general staff back in the de facto capital would have some idea military engineers kept the train tracks in utah free of mines dowling hoped they were on the job as the army garrison left the state he also hoped trains wouldnt start blowing up once the engineers stopped patrolling the tracks when the train passed from utah to colorado dowling let out a silent sigh of relief or maybe it wasnt so silent for captain toricelli said by god it really is good to get out isnt it i spent fourteen years in the middle of mormon country dowling answered after that captain wouldnt you be glad to get away his adjutant thought it over but only for a moment hell yes he said ive been there too damn long myself the farther east the train got the more dowling wondered what sort of orders would wait for him in philadelphia all he knew was that he was ordered to the war department that could mean anything or nothing he wondered if he still had any sort of career ahead of him or if they would assign him to the shore defense of nebraska or something of the sort the farther east the train got the more he worried too he was an outspoken democrat whod been adjutant to one of the most outspoken democrats of all time and he was coming home in the middle of a socialist administration hed met omens he liked better captain toricelli seemed immune to such worries but toricelli was only a captain dowling was a colonel hed been a colonel a long time if he didnt get stars on his shoulders pretty soon he never would and a superannuated colonel was as pathetic as any other unloved old maid on the way to philadelphia the train went through illinois and indiana and ohio not through kentucky going through kentucky was less dangerous than going through houston but only a little freedom party men whether homegrown or imported from the csa made life there a pretty fair approximation of hell long military occupation and memories of a lost uprising had helped cow the mormons nothing seemed to cow the militants in the states taken from the confederacy think of it this way sir captain toricelli said when dowling remarked on that when we put them down our men are getting real combat training dowling was tempted to go bully again but feared his adjutant wouldnt understand instead he said well so we are but the confederates get it too yes sir thats true toricelli might have bitten into a lemon at the prospect then he brightened they dont if we kill all of them right dowling said there was bloodthirstiness the irascible george armstrong custer himself would have approved of even a luxurious pullman car palled after a few days dowling began to wish hed taken an airliner from salt lake city more and more people were flying these days still he doubted the government would have held still for the added expense the train was going through pittsburgh when he saw flags flying at half staff alarm shot through him whats gone wrong he asked captain toricelli but his adjutant of course had no better way of knowing than he did no one else on the train seemed to have any idea either all he could do was sit there and fret till it pulled into the station in downtown philadelphia he hurried off intending to ask the first man he saw what had happened but a general staff lieutenant colonel was waiting on the platform and greeted him with welcome to philadelphia brigadier general dowling im john abell he saluted then stuck out his hand in a crimson daze of delight dowling shook it he heard captain toricellis congratulations with half an ear lieutenant colonel abell led him to a waiting motorcar they think ive done something worthwhile with my time after all he thought hed wondered as any man might not for hours afterwards did he think about the flags again it hadnt been a disaster after all he learned only a sign of mourning for the passing of former president hosea blackford flora blackford felt empty inside empty and stunned the rational part of her mind insisted that she shouldnt have hosea had been getting frail for years failing for months dying for weeks hed lived a long full life fuller than he could ever have imagined it before he chanced to meet abraham lincoln on a train ride through dakota territory hed risen from nothing to president of the united states and hed died peacefully without much pain and flora had loved him and being without him felt like being without part of herself that made the emptiness no matter what the rational part of her mind told her she felt as if shed just walked in front of a train joshua took it harder yet her son wasnt quite fourteen he didnt have even the defenses and rationalizations flora could throw up against what had happened she knew joshua was a child born late in the autumn of hoseas life that her husband had been lucky to see their son grow up as far as he had all joshua knew was that hed just lost his father to a boy heading toward manhood losing a parent was more a betrayal than anything else your mother and father were supposed to be there for you and be there for you forever in their new york apartment flora said think of cousin yossel he never got to see his father at all because his father got killed before yossel was born you knew your father your whole life up till now and youll remember him and be proud of him as long as you live thats why i miss him so much joshua said his voice cracking between the treble it had been and the baritone it would be tears ran down his face he fought each spasm of sobs fought and lost a few years younger and crying would still have seemed natural to him he would have done it without selfconsciousness now though he was near enough a man to take tears hard flora held him i know dear i know she said so do i joshua let himself be soothed for a little while then broke free of her with a mans sudden heedless strength and bolted for his bedroom he slammed the door behind him but it couldnt muffle the painfilled sound of fresh sobs flora started to go after him but checked herself what good would it do he was entitled to his grief the telephone rang flora stared at it with something close to hatred hosea was only one day dead and shed already lost track of how many reporters and wireless interviewers shed hung up on shed put out a statement summing up her husbands accomplishments and her own sorrow but did that satisfy them not even close the more she had to deal with them the more convinced she grew that they were all a pack of ghouls staring at the telephone didnt make it shut up muttering under her breath she went over to it and picked it up hello flora dear this is al smith that rough new york voice couldnt have belonged to anybody else i just wanted to call and let you know how sorry i am thank you very much mr president flora mentally apologized to the telephone thank you very much i appreciate that believe me he was a good man he did everything he could the collapse wasnt his fault and fixing it isnt easy the president sighed hoover found that out and im doing the same damn thing not fair he should be stuck with the memory of it i know flora answered ive been saying the same thing since the next person who pays attention will be the first im paying attention smith said the services will be out west thats right he wanted to be buried in dakota that was home for him ill do what he would have wanted good thats good across the miles flora could all but see the president nod you have any trouble dealing with a goyishe preacher in spite of everything she laughed the usa was a special country all right and new york a special statewhere else would a catholic leader come out with a perfectly fitting bit of yiddish everything seems all right so far she answered fine smith said he gives you any tsuris though you tell him to talk to me ill fix himyou see if i dont thank you flora said that made quite a picture too a catholic president offering to browbeat a methodist minister she went on joshua and i are going to fly back to dakota this afternoon well finish making arrangements on the spot and well be ready when when hosea gets there her husbands body was coming by special train charlie will come out to the funeral smith said now flora found herself nodding when hosea was vice president one of his duties had been going to important peoples funerals too la follette would only follow a long tradition there and al smith himself didnt want to seem too closely associated with hosea blackford even in death people still blamed blackford for the business collapse and smith didnt want that to rub off on him no matter how unfair it was flora said president sinclair has already left for dakota he can afford to smith answered hes not going to run again year after next yes they were both thinking along the same lines and hoover asked if he was welcome she added what did you tell him the president asked hes not going to run again either not after the way i kicked his tukhus more yiddish jut as fitting i said yes flora replied i dont agree with a lot of the things he did hosea couldnt stand a lot of the things he didbut hes an honest man you have to respect that if you ask me hes a stiffnecked sour prig smith said but have it your own way flora didnt think that verdict was wrong maybe she had a bit of stiffnecked prig in herself too though even if she did hope she wasnt sour the president went on if theres anything i can do you let me know you hear dont be shy about it i wont she promised they said their goodbyes as soon as she hung up the telephone she started running around again too many things to do before she had to leave for the airport not enough time to do them the airport itself was in newark new york city had a major airport under constructionlargesse from a hometown president and many many jobs for local workers all paid with federal moneybut it wouldnt be done for another couple of years the aeroplane was a twinengined curtiss skymaster it carried thirtytwo people in reasonable comfort west to omaha flora and joshua spent the night in a hotel there then boarded a smaller ford trimotor for the trip north to bismarck that flight was like falling back through time the ford was smaller with corrugatedmetal skin rather than smooth aluminum the seats inside were smaller too and more cramped when the aeroplane took off it was noisier too it didnt fly so high either which meant the ride was bumpier they flew around a storm on the prairie even the rough air on the outskirts was plenty to make flora glad the airline provided airsickness bags she turned out not to need hers and neither did joshua but some of the other passengers werent so lucky the rest of the flight was unpleasant even with the bags without them well without them it would have been worse a black limousine waited at the field on the outskirts of bismarck it took her down to the little town of frankfort on the james river hosea blackfords nephew william owned a farm just outside of frankfort the former president would lie in the churchyard there william blackford and flora werent far from the same age the farmer and the congresswoman from new york city were about as different as two americans could be but they had an odd sort of liking and the farm fascinated joshua so did williams daughter katie who was blond and blueeyed and very pretty flora watched that with more than a little amusement william blackford did too maybe youll have to bring the boy out some other time he said his voice dry maybe i will flora couldnt keep herself from smiling or maybe you could visit new york or philadelphia her husbands nephew shook his head no thanks for one thing you dont mean me and ive seen philadelphia i dont care to go back more people on the sidewalks i think than there are in all of dakota he wasnt far wrong and flora knew it he went on i grew up with elbow room i dont know what to do without it flora had grown up with none whatsoever her family had crowded a coldwater flat and theyd taken in boarders besides to help make ends meet she took people and noise as much for granted as william blackford took wide open spaces and peace and quiet the first time hosea brought me to dakota i felt like a bug on a plate she said there was too much country too much sky and not enough me ive heard folks from back east say that before her host replied nodding i reckon its heads to my tails but he broke off alarm on his face here let me get you a handkerchief i have one flora reached into her handbag pulled out a square of linen and dabbed at her eyes sometimes it catches me by surprise thats all i remember the good times i had with hosea the things he showed me and then i remember we wont have any more and this happens she blew her nose william blackford nodded i know how that goes sure enough i lost a brother in the war now and again ill still think about going trout fishing with ted just like it was day before yesterday when we did it last and ill be darned if i dont still puddle up every once in a while too three days later dignitaries and reporters crowded frankforts tiny white clapboard church the building might have come straight from new england the enormous sweep of the horizon beyond it though could only have belonged to the west waiting had torn at flora now she sympathized more than ever with the jewish custom of holding the funeral as quickly as possible after death these days in between were nothing but a torment the reverend albert talbot had a face like a fish with pale skin big blue eyes and a perpetually pursed mouth his eulogy to floras ears was purely conventional and caught little of what hosea blackford had stood for little of what he had been she started to get angry wondering if she should have sicced president smith on him after all but she didnt need long to decide the answer was no everyone else in the church including joshua seemed satisfied with even moved by those ordinary phrases that was what really mattered as long as the ministers audience went away pleased with what they heard nothing else counted for much and the vice president and two former presidents of the united states served as pallbearers helping joshua and william blackford and a more distant relative carry the coffin out to the graveyard under that vast sky he was a good mana fine man upton sinclair said he was indeed herbert hoover agreed they nodded to each other and to flora socialist and democrat they agreed on very little but they would not quarrel about that flora nodded too though more tears stung her eyes here they were both right brigadier general daniel macarthur was not a happy man colonel irving morrell had trouble blaming his superior macarthurs cigarette holder jerked in his mouth by all appearances the us commandant in houston was having trouble not biting right on through the holder ridiculous he burst out absolutely ridiculous how are we supposed to keep this state in the usa if we go easy on all the rebels and traitors inside it morrell gave him the only answer he could sir ill be damned if i know may houston and everybody in it be damned macarthur growled that would be just what itand theydeserve its a running sore we ought to cauterize it with hot metal he meant hot lead from rifles and machine guns morrell didnt disagree on the contrary he said its hard to operate where everybody in the country where youre stationed wants you to go to the devil and does his best to send you there i thought canada was bad next to this canada was a walk in the park next to this hell is a walk in the park colonel macarthur gestured to the officers club bartender another one aristotle yes suh general suh aristotle did the honors then slid the whiskey across the bar to macarthur well hes loyal anyway morrell thought any negro who preferred jake featherston to al smith wasnt just a traitorhe was certifiably insane morrell wished houston held more negroes they would have made a useful counterweight to all the proconfederate fanatics but they were thin on the ground here after a sipno a gulpfrom the new drink daniel macarthur went on by god colonel there were stretches of the front during the great war where a man was safer than he is in houston today during the war only cowards got shot in the back here it can happen to anybody at any hour of the day or night yes sir morrell agreed mournfully taking hostages after someone does get shot hasnt worked so well as i wish it would have macarthur looked disgustednot with him but with houston and perhaps with the world some of these sons of bitches seem glad to die its not that im not glad to see them dead either but yes sir but morrell turned the word into a complete and gloomy sentence he went on i think were doing a better job of making martyrs for the freedom party than we are of making people decide not to take shots at us unfortunately you are correct even more unfortunately i dont know what to do about it macarthur stubbed out the cigarette he stuck another one in the holder lit it and puffed moodily then he looked at the pack finest quality tobacco from the confederate states of america he read and made as if to throw it away reluctantly he checked himself god damn it to hell and gone they do have the best tobacco yes sir morrell agreed when they asked for a ceasefire in the officer who came into our lines with a white flag gave me one of his smokes after three years of the chopped hay and horse turds we called cigarettes it was like going to heaven id like to send half this state to heaven assuming anybody here would go in that direction macarthur growled but even that wouldnt do much good he finished the whiskey with another gulp instead of asking for another refill he sprang to his feet and stalked out of the officers club trailing smoke from his cigarette he was hot enough he might have trailed smoke without it your glass is empty suh aristotle said to morrell you want i should get you another one no thanks he answered youve lived here a good long time havent you he waited for the bartender to nod then said all right fine what would you do to keep houston in the usa the black mans eyes widened me suh he needed a moment to realize morrell meant the question seriouslyafter the time morrell had had in houston he would have meant it seriously if hed asked it of an alley cat aristotle said i reckon the first thing you do is you blow off that jake featherstons head i reckon youre absolutely one hundred percent right morrell said the real greek philosopher couldnt have solved the problem better if anything would do the job that was it unfortunately suppose we cant in that case suh i dunno aristotle said but i know one thing you yankees ever decide you leavin this here state you take me with you you hear i hear you what morrell heard was naked terror in the mans voice he soothed him as he would have soothed a frightened horse dont you worry weve been here twenty years we arent going anywhere not even if they have one o them plebiwhatever the hell you call them things aristotle asked i dont think you need to fret about that colonel morrell told him we paid for houston in blood i dont expect well give it back at the ballot box that seemed to get through to the bartender he pulled out a rag from under the bar and ran it over the already gleaming polished wood though aristotle seemed happier morrell was anything but the colored man probably didnt pay much attention to what al smith said because of the nature of morrells duties he had to he didnt like what hed heard talk of democracy and selfdetermination sounded very noble hed had some things to say on the subject himself when the ottoman turks were persecuting armenians but when democracy and selfdetermination ran up against a countrys need to defend itself morrell supposed the united states could lose houston without hurting themselves too badly though losing the oil found in the s would be a nuisanceand seeing it fall into confederate hands would be a bigger one the same applied to sequoyah where the indians most cordially despised the us occupiers who hadnt even deigned to let the state enter the usa losing kentucky though wouldnt be a nuisance losing kentucky would be a disaster during the war of secession lincoln had said he hoped to have god on his side but he had to have kentucky losing the war and the state hed proved to have neither i take it back let me have another drink morrell said suddenly aristotle fixed it for him on the house suh he said you done set my mind at ease and im right grateful thanks morrell felt guilty about taking the free drink but couldnt insist on paying without making the barkeep worry again morrell was worried himself if the northern border of the confederate states returned to the ohio river why had so many soldiers from the united states died to push that frontier south what had they died for anything at all morrell couldnt see it but if president smith let a plebiscite go forward houston sequoyah and kentucky would all vote to return to the csa morrell was sure of that and if smith didnt let the plebiscite go forward jake featherston could cuss him up one side and down the other for trampling on those wonderful things democracy and selfdetermination featherston had done some trampling on them himself but not that much he might well have won a completely honest election and morrell was painfully aware of it that featherston had triumphed in elections with a third of his countrys population disenfranchised never once crossed morrells mind negroes were politically invisible to him as they were to most whites in the usa morrell swallowed his guilt and his worries along with the free drink then he left the officers club fences and sandbags guarded against snipers as he made his way to bachelor officers quarters he was sick of boq but he didnt intend to bring agnes and mildred down from fort leavenworth he got paid to risk his life for his country the people he loved didnt more sandbags and barbed wire and machinegun emplacements protected the barrels outside of lubbock morrell went out to them early the next morning a few enthusiastic houstonians had tried to sneak in and sabotage them in spite of the defenses the locals next of kin were surely most unhappy the wouldbe saboteurs themselves no longer cared one way or the other but no one had ever caught the enterprising fellows whod lobbed mortar rounds into the us encampment from somewhere inside lubbock large rewards for their capture had been highly publicized but nobody in houston seemed interested in collecting that kind of reward crewmen started showing up only a couple of minutes after morrell got to the barrel park good morning sir sergeant michael pound said i thought id beat you here sometimes he did which annoyed morrell not today he answered i spent too much of last night thinking about the way things look pound shook his head youre braver than i am sir thats a dangerous thing to do these days what would you do if you were king morrell asked interested to see what the sergeant would come up with abdicate pound said at once which jerked a laugh out of him the underofficer went on its a lousy time to be a king sir all these damned democrats aroundsmalld of course but if i had my druthers id smash the confederate states now before jake featherston uses our own better instincts to steal territory from us that we really ought to keep and before he starts building barrels the way hes building tractors these days that marched much too well with what morrell was thinkingright down to the remark about tractors a factory that turned out engines or caterpillar treads for one type of vehicle wouldnt have much trouble converting to make parts for another type before long a squad of three barrels was rumbling through the streets of lubbock yankees go home was amongst the mildest of the graffiti on the walls these days so was freedom a lot of messages told what the scribblers wanted to do with everyone in the state government of houston who didnt belong to the freedom party morrell had seen a good deal in his time some of those suggestions sickened him freedom party banners flew everywhere the reversedcolor cs battle flag was legal being the symbol of a political party like the socialists red flag and the democrats donkey morrell thought socialist al smith was a donkey to let that inflammatory flag fly here but smith did featherston uses our own better instincts to steal from us michael pounds words came back uncomfortably and then a middleaged man on the street pulled out a pistol and fired at morrell who as usual rode with his head and shoulders and upper torso out of the cupola so he could get a better look at what was going on the bullet clanged off the barrels armor plate morrell ducked the turret machine gun of the barrel behind him chattered when morrell stood straight again a moment later he had his own out and ready no need the shooter was down in a pool of blood the pistol still in his outstretched hand a man and a woman whod been near him were down too the man writhing and howling the woman very still her skirt flipped up carelessly over one gartered thigh plainly she wouldnt rise again screams filled the air after the gunfire stopped people whod thrown themselves flat when it started now cautiously got to their feet a woman looked from the corpse of the man whod tried to plug morrell to him then back again she pointed a rednailed finger at the us officer in the barrel and shrieked one word murderer jonathan moss pushed the stick forward the nose of the wright went down he opened the throttle the fighter dove like a stooping hawkdove faster than any hawk dreamt of flying acceleration shoved him back in the seat he eyed the airspeed indicator with something like awe now that was easily three times as fast as a great war fighting scout could have flown and he wasnt giving the aeroplane everything it had he watched the altimeter unwind at an awesome rate too if i dont pull up pretty soon im going to make a big hole in the ground major finley wont be very happy with me if i do that neither will laura reluctantly he pulled back on the stick he did it a little at a time not all at once he had a good notion of the fighters limits even so the wings groaned at the force they had to withstand pulling out of a dive like this would have torn the wings right off a machine built of wood and canvas his vision grayed for a couple of seconds as blood poured down out of his brain but then color returned jesus he said hoarsely when he was flying level once more he caressed the curved side of the cockpit as if it were the curve of a lover hed never known never imagined an aeroplane that could do things like this he looked around wondering where the hell he was puffy cloud shadows dappled the green and gold geometry of ontario fields and woodlots then he spotted the thames the river naturally led his eye back to london the labatts brewery was much the biggest building in town once he spied it he also knew where the airfield outside would be as he flew back toward the field the wireless set in the cockpit crackled to life a this is a do you read me over a was another fighter moss peered here and there till he spotted him at ten oclock high i read you loud and clear a go ahead over he had to make himself remember to thumb the transmit button hed never had to worry about wireless chatter in the great war up for a dogfight oldtimer the pilot of a asked punk kid moss thought scornfully the younger man went on loser buys the beer at the officers club over youre on sonny boy over and out moss snapped with altitude the other pilot had the edge moss pulled back on the stick to climb he gave the fighter all the gas he had so he wouldnt lose too much airspeed his opponent zoomed toward him he spun away heading for one of those pretty little clouds he beat the other fighter to it then snapped sharply to his left still climbing for all the wright was worth a moment later he whooped like a wild man the guy in a had done just what moss thought he would flown straight through the cloud and looked around for him that wasnt good enough not anywhere close moss dove on his foe from behind of itself his thumb went to the firing button atop the stick he pulled his nose up and fired past the other aeroplane a startled squawk came from the wireless set at the sight of tracer rounds streaking by laughing exultantly moss said sonny boy you are dead as shoe leather that beers going to taste mighty good over how did you do that the pilot of a had to remember to say over i was playing these games when you were a gleam in your old mans eye moss answered the aeroplanes change the tricks dont or not much shall we go on in now yeah the young fighter pilot like any good flier had thought he was the hottest thing in the sky chagrin filled his voice when he discovered he wasnt or at least not today moss had to find the thames and london and the airstrip all over again he was slower doing that than the kid in a and wasnt ashamed to follow the other fighter in he had to remind himself to lower his landing gear too that was one more thing he hadnt had to worry about during the great war he jounced the landing hard enough to make his teeth click but a came to a stop before the end of the runway the prop spun down to immobility moss pulled back the canopy and got out of the fighter only then with the breeze on him did he realize he was drenched in sweat the dogfight had squeezed it out of him hed known it wasnt real but his body hadnt major rex finley came trotting up those were your tracers he demanded moss nodded finley put hands on hips i wouldnt have been very happy if youd shot jimmy down neither would he as a matter of fact sorry said moss who was anything but he challenged me he called me an old man i whipped him and i wanted to make damn sure he knew it he waved to the other pilot who walked toward him shaking his head whos buying that beer looks like i am jimmy said ruefully sweat plastered his darkblond hair to his head and glistened on his face his body had thought it was the real thing too he caught major finleys eye he got me good sir he knows what hes doing up there well weve had to scrape some rust off finley remarked moss nodded he couldnt argue with that he hadnt flown for twenty years and the state of the art had changed but finley nodded ive seen worse thanks moss said i dont know why i gave this up its more fun than damn near anything i can think of i guess when the war ended i just wanted to get back to what i was doing beforehand major finley nodded a lot of people did hed stayed in uniform himself of course doing his job so most people in the usa could get back to what theyd been doing beforehand moss knew as much finley had to know he knew but none of that showed in the officers voice as he went on of course having fun isnt the only reason youre doing this not a whole lot of folks get to have fun with the taxpayer footing the bill congressmenthats about it moss agreed finley and jimmy both laughed laughing or not though finley said thats about the size of it yeah so all rightyouve proved you can still play on the first team im not talking about conscripting you but if we run into trouble can we count on you jonathan moss let out a long breath before he answered yes he said at last but if you try to put me in the air to shoot up canucks in another rising well im not the best man for that job and you or whoever else i serve under had better know it ahead of time the army knows who your wife is and what youve been doing since you moved up to canada finley said dryly we do sometimes have to break parts in our machine we try not to put parts into places where theyre bound to break thinking back to his own flying days moss decided finley was probably right not certainlynothing that had to do with the army was certainbut probably he said how about that beer now itll taste twice as good with somebody else buying the grin jimmy gave him was half sheepish half ill get you next time jonathans grin said only one thing oh no you wont but moss wasnt grinning when he drove back to berlin he understood why major finley worried about where his pilots would come from the usa had been holding canada down for more than twenty years now the canucks showed no sign of wanting to become americans none at all despite a generations worth of schooling and propaganda but the united states couldnt just turn them loose and wave goodbye if they did the british would be back twenty minutes later and then encirclement moss muttered that had been the us strategic nightmare from the end of the war of secession to the end of the great war with the confederate states feeling their oats again encirclement would be a disaster the way the world looked wasnt the only reason moss grin slipped on the way home daddy dorothy squealed when he walked in the door and did her best to tackle him that best was pretty good it would have drawn a penalty on any football field from edmonton down to hermosillo hi sweetie moss squeezed his daughter too though not with intent to maim wheres your mom im here laura called from the kitchen where else would i be after disentangling himself from dorothy moss went into the kitchen and gave his wife a kiss she kissed him back but not with any great enthusiasm what smells good he asked pretending he didnt notice roast pork she said and then did you have a good time shooting up the countryside her voice had an edge to it i didnt shoot up the countryside moss answered steadily i would have shot down one american half my age if this were the real thing hed hoped the prospect of a yank going down in flames would cheer laura but it didnt she said if anything really happened the two of you would fly on the same sideand youd fly against canada are you going to tell me im wrong they wouldnt do that to me moss said i was talking about it with major finley ha she said if fighting started theyd do whatever they pleased she could have been right but jonathan shook his head no i dont think so they know what ive been doing since i came to canada they want people they can trust to carry out their orders and i dont think i qualify are you sure isnt it likely they just want yanks who know how to fly that paralleled moss own worries too closely for comfort angry because it did he snapped you sound like those canadians who want to murder me because i was born in the united states no matter what ive tried to do up here laura turned red there are canadians who want to murder me too because you were born in the united states me she sounded furious she was descended from and named for the first laura secord who in the war of had done for the canadians what paul revere had for the americans in the revolution warned of oncoming enemy soldiers and saved the day laura was proud of her ancestry and was as much a canadian patriot as her ancestor had been yes i know that moss said if you think it doesnt worry me youre crazy hostages to fortune he thought unhappily if anything happened to you and dorothy id youd what laura broke in hop in an aeroplane and machinegun my people from the sky for revenge thats not the right answer you know maybe it wasnt it was exactly what moss had been thinking he knew he couldnt say that to his wife he kissed her again instead she looked as if she would rather have gone on arguing to his relief she didnt hipolito rodriguez hadnt been on a train for a long time not since he laid down his rifle at the end of the great war and came home to baroyeca from west texas then hed had the taste of defeat in his mouth sour as vomit after too much beer now as the car rattled and jounced toward hermosillo along the twisting track he was having the time of his life why not many of his friends from baroyeca rode with him among others carlos ruiz and felipe rojas and robert quinn whod brought the freedom party to his home town and better yet jorge and miguel rode with him too what could be better than going into action with your own sons at your side nothing he could think of everybody in the car seemed to feel the same way men chattered and sang snatches of freedom party songs and passed bottles of tequila and whiskey back and forth nobody got drunk but a lot of people got happy rodriguez knew he was happy he kept an eye on his boys he didnt want them making fools of themselves and embarrassing him in front of his comrades but they did fine they mostly stared out the window watching the landscape change even in the freedom youth corps they hadnt gone so far from home as the crow flew hermosillo was about miles northwest of baroyeca the railroad line from the little mining town to the capital of sonora was no crow it went west from baroyeca to buenavista south to terim west to guaymas on the coast and then at last north to hermosillo that made the journey take twice as long as it would have by a more direct route but rodriguez didnt mind no he didnt mind at all he nodded to robert quinn gracias muchas gracias seсor for arranging to have the freedom party pay for our fares we never would have been able to come otherwise el gusto es mio quinn answered with a smile the pleasure is also that of the partido de libertad this is important business we are going to tend to in hermosillo we need all the help we can get we need it and we are going to have it no one can stop us no one at all hipolito rodriguez nodded again no of course not hadnt he seen don gustavo his onetime patron turned away from the polling place in baroyeca hadnt he helped turn him away yes indeed nothing could stop the freedom party they got into hermosillo late that afternoon it was as big a city as rodriguez had ever seenbig enough to make his sons eyes bug out of their heads the train station stood a couple of miles north of downtown rodriguez wondered whether they would have to march down to the plaza zaragoza the square where they would go into action but buses draped with partido de libertad banners waited for them the men from baroyeca werent the only freedom party members whod come to hermosillo on the train by the time everybody filed aboard the buses there werent many empty seats the ridge line of the cerro de la campaсa rose higher in the southern sky as the buses rolled down toward the plaza zaragoza rodriguez noted the hill only peripherally he was used to mountains the profusion of houses and shops and restaurants and motorcars was something else again more than half the signs he noted were in english which had a stronger hold in the city than in the sonoran countryside hermosillos two grandest monuments stood on either side of the plaza zaragoza to the west was the catedral de la asunciуn to the east the palacio de gobierno a cathedral had stood next to the plaza since the eighteenth century when sonora passed from the empire of mexico to the confederate states in the early s the original adobe building had been crumbling into ruin the replacement not completed till the early years of the twentieth century dwarfed its predecessor in size and splendor with its two great bell towers and elaborate ornamentation it put rodriguez in mind of a gigantic white wedding cake it dwarfed the palacio de gobierno on the other side of the square though that brickandadobe structure was impressive in its own right and since the palacio de gobierno housed the governor and legislature of the state of sonora it was of more immediate concern to the freedom party than the cathedral god could take care of himself secular affairs needed a nudge in the right direction freedom party men already jammed the plaza zaragoza they greeted the latest set of newcomers with calls of freedom and ўlibertad and handed out signs some in spanish others in english rodriguez looked up at the one he got in english it said repeal the seven words robert quinn translated for him knowing he didnt have much written english abrogan las siete palabras the freedom party man went on you understand what that means oh sн sн rodriguez said the constitution thats right quinn nodded the way it is now it sayshe switched from spanish to english the executive power shall be vested in a president of the confederate states of america he and the vicepresident shall hold their offices for the term of six years but the president shall not be reeligible but if we take out the last seven words president featherston can run again next year rodriguez said exactamente quinn agreed thats what the constitutional amendment the legislature is debating will do south carolina and mississippi demanded that the congress in richmond call a constitutional convention so it did and the convention reported out this amendment as soon as twothirds of the states in the csa ratify it it becomes the new law it will become law wont it rodriguez asked anxiously oh yes absolutamente quinn grinned the partido de libertad has a big majority in both houses of the legislature here in sonora and in all the other states it needs to pass the amendment this demonstration is mostly for show but show is an important part of politics too eh yes rodriguezs time in the freedom party had left him sure of that if people see many other people want the change made they will all be happy with it just so you are a clever fellow seсor rodriguez quinn hesitated then asked have you ever thought of doing anything but farming not for myself its what i know and i am not ready to move to the big city to try something else rodriguez answered for my sons thoughwell who knows the sun sank toward the western horizon rodriguezs belly growled and rumbled he wondered what he would eat and if he would eat anything quinn hadnt told him to bring food along he wished the freedom party man would have even a few tortillas would have helped hold emptiness at bay but he started worrying too soon here and there fires began to burn in the plaza zaragoza the savory smell of cooking meat rose from them form lines somebody shouted form lines to the nearest fires form lines and youll all be fed a lot of the freedom party followers were veterans they knew how to queue up some of the younger fellows in the plaza milled about at first but not for long shouts and elbows got them into place a woman whose features said she had more spanish blood than indian handed rodriguez two rolled tortillas filled with carne asada when he got to the head of the line gracias seсora he said de nada she answered ўlibertad ўlibertad he echoed and then got out of the way so she could feed the man behind him he took a big bite from one of the tortillas carne asada was a sonoran specialty the grilled spicy beef came with chilies that made him long for a cold beer to put out the fire in his mouth he looked around hopefully but didnt see anybody passing out bottles of beer after a while though he did hear someone calling ўagua agua fresca aquн he got into another line eating as he snaked forward a dipperful of fresh water gave him most of what he wanted though he still would rather have had beer he wondered if anyone would pass out blankets nobody did he hadnt slept on bare ground since the great war ended he also wondered if his sons would complain but they didnt he supposed theyd spent their fair share of time sleeping outdoors in the freedom youth corps they knew enough to close up with him and several other men the night got chilly but all that body warmth kept anyone from having too bad a time rodriguez woke before sunup he didnt remember getting so stiff and sore in the trenches in texas of course that had been half a lifetime earlier when miguel and jorge climbed to their feet they seemed fresh enough more lines formed these for tortillas for breakfast and for strong coffee partly tamed with lots of cream more freedom party men came into the square in the early morning hours they dressed like townsfolk not peasants rodriguez guessed they were native hermosillans they didnt need feeding but they got their signs on the edge of the plaza things had to look right and things had to sound right when the real demonstration got under way a little past nine the chants had been carefully organized ўabrogan las siete palabras the freedom party men roared in rhythmic unison and then in english repeal the seven words after that came choruses of featherston and ўlibertad and freedom then the cycle began again newsreel cameras filmed the crowd in the plaza zaragoza rodriguez wondered how many state capitals had chanting crowds putting pressure on legislators and governors enough he was sure of that the freedom party would make sure the constitutional amendment took effect well before next years elections not everything that happened in the plaza zaragoza was official and planned in advance somebody behind rodriguez tapped him on the shoulder when he looked around a man with a big black mustache passed him a flask he swigged expecting tequila good brandy ran down his throat instead ўmadre de dios he said reverently and handed the flask to jorge who stood next to him his son gulped coughed and then grinned the bells in the cathedral had just struck twelve when a man in a somber black suit came out of the palacio de gobierno he held up his hands little by little the demonstrators stopped their choruses i am pleased to inform you he called in english that the amendment to our dear confederate constitution has passed both houses of the legislature of sonora we have voted to repeal the seven words freedom then he said the same thing in spanish the plaza zaragoza went wild men threw hats in the air others threw their signs in the air still others cursed when those came downthey were heavy enough to hurt freedom some shouted others yelled ўlibertad rodriguez shouted in spanish then in english and then in spanish again which language he used didnt seem to matter the freedom party had won jake featherston had won that made him feel as if hed won too someone started a new chant nothing can stop us he gladly joined in how could he not believe that when it was so obviously true armstrong grimes didnt want to get out of bed he mumbled and tried to stick his head under the pillow when his mother shook him awake get up edna grimes said sharply annies already eating breakfast you dont want your father coming in here do you youd better not thats all ive got to tell you he didnt with a last resentful mutter he got to his feet and went into the bathroom to take a leak and brush his teeth and splash cold water on his face he looked at himself in the mirror trying to decide whether he needed to shave he had his mothers long oval face but his coloring was darker more like his fathers hell with it he said to his reflection hed shaved the day before and at sixteen he didnt have much more than peach fuzz to begin with he also had pimples which made shaving even less fun than it would have been otherwise back to his room he put on a checked shirt and a pair of slacks he would rather have worn blue jeans but his father wouldnt let him get away with it not when he was going to high school some of his friends wore dungarees all the time hed pointed that out to his old manpointed it out in loud shrill piercing tones it hadnt done him any good at all merle grimes wasnt a man to bellow and carry on but once he said no he wasnt a man to change his mind either with a martyred sigh armstrong carried his threering binder and the books hed brought home the night before out to the kitchen annie who was four was making a mess of a bowl of oatmeal armstrongs mother had a plate of scrambled eggs and toast and a glass of milk waiting for him his father was digging into a similar breakfast except he had coffee instead of milk morning he said morning pa armstrong answered breakfast resigned him to being up then his father had to go and ask did you get all your homework done yes pa armstrong said as much of it as i understood anyhow he added but only to himself his junior year which had started two weeks earlier hadnt been much fun so far if algebra wasnt something satan had invented to torment indifferent students he couldnt imagine what it was youd better keep your grades up then merle grimes said he could do algebra armstrong gave him a resentful look his father could do algebra with effortless ease what he couldnt do was show armstrong how he did it because this is how it works hed say and wave his hands and cast a spell that was how it looked to armstrong anyway and come up with the right answer and when armstrong tried waving his hands hed add when he should have subtracted or hed forget what to do with a negative number or hed just stare at a problem in helpless horror with no idea how to start it let alone finish his father got his pipe going and worked his way through the newspaper he didnt have to get to the office till half past eight so he could take his time armstrong had to be at roosevelt high at eight oclock sharp or else the truant officer would start sniffing around that meant he had to gobble his breakfastno great hardship for a sixteenyearold boy but he didnt like getting up from the table while his old man lingered annie waved goodbye his mother called so long son as he went out the front door his only answer was a grunt as soon as he got around the corner he lit a cigarette the first drag made him cough he felt woozy and lightheaded and a little sick he was just learning to smoke then his heart beat harder and he felt more alert he enjoyed that feeling even if it wasnt the main reason hed started smoking people he liked smoked so did people he wanted to be like that counted for more he smoked two cigarettes on the way to roosevelt but made sure the pack was out of sight before he got to the campus smoking there was against the rules the principal had a big paddle in his office and he wasnt shy about using it morning armstrong a boy called hey joe armstrong answered can i get some answers to the algebra from you joe shook his head i dont know how they do that stuff im gonna flunk and my old mans gonna beat hell out of me me too armstrong said dolefully he still had a couple of periods to go before he had to turn in the math homework such as it was he didnt look forward to english literature which he had first with any great enthusiasm either memorizing chunks of the canterbury tales in the original incomprehensible middle english wasnt his idea of fun but getting walloped because he didnt do it also wasnt his idea of fun so he tried english lit did have one compensation he sat next to lucy houlihan a redhead who had to be one of the three or four prettiest girls at roosevelt high that would have been even better had lucy had the slightest idea he existed but she didnt she had a boyfriend frankie sprague the star tailback on the regiment still she couldnt shoot armstrong for looking at her as long as he didnt drool too much while he was doing it the textbook naturally didnt include the millers tale herb rosen one of the class brains had found out about it and started whispering by the time the whispers got to armstrong they were pretty distorted but the piece still sounded juicier than anything the class was studying he wondered why they couldnt read the good stuff instead of boring crap about sweet showers a trail of sniggers ran through the class the millers tale would do that and what is so funny miss loomis inquired she was a tall muscular spinster with a baritone voice she didnt use a paddle she wielded a ruler instead with deadly effect nobody said anything the sniggers didnt stop but they did ease miss loomis looked at the students over the tops of her halfglasses that will be quite enough of that she declared and got on with the lesson as soon as miss loomis turned back to the blackboard lucy asked armstrong why is everybody laughing she hadnt heard then well some guys would be shy about saying such things to a girl armstrong wasnt shy about anythingand having lucy notice him for any reason at all was a reasonable facsimile of heaven he gleefully told her everything hed heard about the millers tale odds were chaucer wouldnt have recognized it it was still plenty to make lucy turn pink armstrong watched the blush in fascinationso much fascination that he didnt notice miss loomis bearing down on him whack the ruler scorched his knuckles he jumped and yelped in pain miss loomis fixed him with a glare that would have paralyzed jake featherston that will be enough of that she said and marched back up to the front of the classroom lucy damn her didnt even say she was sorry he was glad to flee english lit for government even though miss thornton who taught it was almost as big a battleaxe as miss loomis she didnt look so formidable being round rather than tall with a bosom about the size of the uss remembrance but she was a stickler for detail and naturally she picked on him why is the new confederate constitutional amendment so important she demanded uh he said and said no more he remembered his father saying something about the amendment but couldnt remember what to save his lifeor his grade zero miss thornton said crisply and wrote it in the roll book she asked herb rosen herb didnt just read chaucer for fun he even read textbooks for fun because now their president can be elected for lots of terms not just one he answered it looks like the freedom party is setting things up for him to be president for life a girl stuck up her hand miss thornton nodded to her she said i dont think thats true our presidents can be elected more than once and nobodys ever been president for life thats because weve got a custom of stopping after two terms even teddy roosevelt lost when he tried for a third one herb said that touched off a discussion about the role of unwritten custom in government armstrong grimes listened with no more than half an ear somebody was going to be on top and somebody else was going to get it in the neck that was how things worked as far as he could see and nobody could do anything much about it the most you could do was try to be the fellow who came out on top miss thornton left him alone for the rest of the period but when the class ended he had to go on to algebra and he got it in the neck mr marr the algebra teacher had lost his right arm during the war hed had to teach himself to write and eat lefthanded hed done it too and come away convinced that anybody could teach himself to do anything but armstrong hadnt been able to teach himself to do algebra he had to go up to the board to try a problem he butchered it mr marr glared at him if you multiplied one side of the equation by six why didnt you multiply the other side by six too he snapped uh i dont know armstrong answered helplessly well thats obvious mr marr said sit down he did the problem himself when he did it it looked easy multiply subtract and what do you know x equals seven armstrong knew he wouldnt be able to do it himself not if he lived to be a hundred not your day today somebody said when the bell rang and they escaped to lunch a periods worth of freedom no kidding armstrong said they cant teach for beans and im the one who gets in trouble on account of it that a lot of the other students in his classes were having no trouble at all didnt occur to him far easier to blame his teachers than himself after lunch came chemistry hed had hopes for chemistry if theyd shown him how to make things that blew up he would have worked hard but learning that lithium was always oxygen was always and carbon was left him cold he staggered through a quiz and hoped he got a c wood shop went better his hands had some skill in them even if hed never make a big brain he was making a spice rack for the kitchen and everything was going about as well as it could mr walsh stopped and watched him work with a file and sandpaper the shop teacher nodded not bad grimes he said you keep it up and youll have no trouble finding a job when you get out of high school the only reason armstrong intended to graduate was that he knew his old man would murder him if he didnt he didnt tell that to mr walsh if the teacher hadnt heard it a million times before he would have been amazed at last pe and armstrong came into his own he was stronger and faster than most of the other boys in his class and he reveled in it and from pe he went straight to football practice he was only a secondstring defensive end but he threw himself into every play as if his life depended on it the harder he practiced the more playing time hed get when the game came friday night and there across from him taking snaps in the single wing was frankie goddamn sprague think youre going to get your hand under lucy houlihans blouse do you armstrong spun past the tackle trying to block him steamrollered the fullback and knocked frankie sprague right on his ass xi im off chester martin blew rita a kiss and carl another one his wife and their son sent kisses through the air back toward him too he was glad to get them as he went out the door and headed for the bus stop it had rained the day before the first rain of the season in los angeles the sky was a brilliant blue now as if the rain had washed it clean even late in october the weather would get up into the seventies chester remembered toledo with a fondness that diminished every year he stayed in california you couldnt beat this weather no matter how hard you tried a bum slept in a doorway a blanket wrapped around him living here without money was easier than it was in the eastern usa because people didnt have to worry so much about shelter idly martin wondered if florida and cuba had more than their share of outofwork people in the csa for the same reason he needed a southbound trolley today he was heading down to hawthorne a suburb south of the airport and not far from the beach mordechais crew was running up a pair of apartment buildings people with jobs kept moving to southern california too and they all needed places to live when the trolley rolled up martin threw his nickel in the fare box paid two cents more for a transfer and then sat down with his toolbox in his lap even though that toolbox was a sign he had work to go to he didnt stop worrying the way things were these days who could he wondered if he would be able to go on working after mordechai retired the foreman with the missing fingers on his right hand had to be past sixty whoever replaced him might have new favorites who needed jobs in a trade without a union that sort of thing was always a worry posters praising candidates for the upcoming congressional elections sprouted like toadstools on walls and fences and telephone poles democratic red white and blue against socialist red and here and there republican green trying to guess whod win by seeing who had the most posters up was a mugs game which didnt mean people didnt play it all the time by the way things looked here the two big parties were running neck and neck outside of a few states in the midwest republicans had a hard time getting elected their ideas were stuck between those of the democrats and the socialists and oldtimers still associated them with the nineteenthcentury disasters the usa had suffered under lincoln and blaine martin changed lines on el segundo he got off the trolley at hawthorne boulevard and walked two blocks south and three blocks east mordechai waved to him when he came up calling morning chester morning martin answered about half the crewwho lived all over the los angeles areawere already there it was still only a quarter to eight chester didnt expect many people to show up after eight oclock you did that more than oncetwice if you were luckyand some hungry son of a bitch would grab your job with both hands this morning only dushan came in late he was plainly hung over mordechai said something to him he nodded in a gingerly way then got to work he depended on construction work less than most of the other men for he could make cards and dice behave the way he wanted them to that let himor he thought that let himget away with showing up late every once in a while he buckled down willingly enough even if the banging of hammers made him turn pale the fellow working alongside chester a big pole named stan said goddamn if dushan dont look like a vampire left out in the sun the past few years thered been a lot of films about vampires and werewolves and other things that should have been dead but werent that probably put the comparison in stans mind it was good enough to make martin nod all the same he said dont let dushan hear that hes from the old country and hes liable to take it the wrong way let him i aint afraid stan said he was bigger and younger than dushan so he had reason to be confident still dont push it now chester sounded a plain warning why start trouble youre not my grandma stan said but to martins relief he went back to driving nails and let dushan alone it didnt last chester might have known it wouldnt something in him had known it wouldnt but he couldnt do anything but watch when the trouble started he was two stories up nailing rafters to the roof pole when stan got in front of dushan down on the ground and made as if to drive a stake through his heart dushan looked at him for half a second then his cold face revealing nothing of what he intended he kicked stan in the crotch had his booted foot gone home as he intended there wouldnt have been a fight because stan wouldnt have been able to give him one but maybe because of his hangover the kick got stan in the hipbone rather than somewhere more intimate stan roared with pain but he didnt fall over clutching at himself which was what dushan had had in mind instead he surged forward and grappled with the other man they fell to the ground slugging and gouging and spitting out a couple of different flavors of guttural consonantfilled slavic curses oh for christs sake chester descended as fast as he could he was cursing too almost as angry at himself as he was at stan and dushan hed seen trouble coming but he hadnt been able to stop it fight fight the shout brought construction workers running just as it would have brought kids running on a highschool campus most of the workers only stood around and watched without trying to break it up it was entertainment something to liven up the day something to talk about over the supper table tonight come on lets get em apart chester said still enjoying the show the men at his side looked at him as if he were crazytill mordechai got there a few seconds later not much made mordechai mad anything that slowed down work and threatened the job would do the trick though swearing like the veteran navy man he was he shoved through the crowd of workers most of whom were twice his size and half his age seeing that chester did some pushing and shoving of his own the two of them grabbed dushan and stan and pulled them apart once they actually started doing that they got some belated help from the other men dushan twisted in chesters grasp trying to wade back into the scrap that might have been more for forms sake than anything else he hadnt been getting the better of it he had a bloody nose and a black eye and a scraped cheek hed hung a pretty good mouse on stan too but the pole hadnt taken anywhere near so much damage as he had what the hell happened here mordechai couldnt have sounded more disgusted if hed tried for a week dushan and stan both gave highly colored versions of recent events some of the builders whod been watching supported one of them some the other and some gave versions of their own that had very little to do with anything that had really gone onthat was how it seemed to chester anyhow mordechai listened for a little while then threw up his hands enough he said too goddamn much he used his mutilated right hand to point first to stan then to dushan somehow his two missing fingers made the gesture seem even more contemptuous than it would have otherwise youre fired and youre fired too get the fuck out of here both of you i dont want to see either one of your goddamn ugly mugs again either and you both blow all of todays pay a sigh went through the workers nobodyd expected anything different dushan never changed expression stan said fuck you asshole but his bravado rang hollow word would get around and get around quick hed have a tough time landing construction work from here on out he was just an ordinary worker easily replaceable by another ordinary worker if mordechai had stopped there nothing more would have come of it but he was furious and he held the whip hand and the rest of you pussies he said glaring at the men around him the rest of you pussies lose half a days pay for standing around while all this shit was going on thats not fair chester martin exclaimed several other men muttered and grumbled but he was the one who spoke out loud mordechai glowered you dont like it you know what you can do about it he meant nothing but martin wasnt a veteran of union strife in toledo for nothing or to take nothing lying down yeah he said stonily i know what i can do about it as soon as people went back to work he started doing it he hadnt done any union agitating for years but he still knew how some of the men didnt want to listen to him youre gonna get your ass fired and everybody elses too was something he heard more than once but others were ready to go along mordechai had hit too hard when he punished workers for something they hadnt done and a lot of the men whod come to california to find jobs had belonged to unions back east they remembered the gains theyd made gains theyd had to throw away to find any work at all out here weve got to spread the word chester warned if we just strike at this site theyll crush us but if we strike at all the building sites around los angeles the bosses will have to deal with us he hoped they would anyhow and if they didnt well hed gone on strike before when he got his pay at the end of the dayhalf a days pay for a whole days hard workhe said im taking this under protest the paymaster shrugged take it and like it or take it and stick it up your ass he had a couple of bully boys with pistols behind him to make sure the payroll stayed safe he could afford to talk toughor thought he could anyhow martin thought he was playing into the workers hands several other men said im taking this under protest too the paymaster went right on shrugging he didnt see the resentment he was raisingeither that or secure in his power he just didnt care that evening when chester told rita what had happened she looked at him for a long time before asking are you sure you want to go through with this he knew what she meant now that he had a child hed given fortune a hostage he sighed do you want me to knuckle under his wife bit her lip after half a minutes silence she said no theyll own you if you do he kissed her hed thoughthed hopedshe would say that she was a stronger socialist than he was he spent the next few weeks working his shift during the day and agitating during his free time he talked with workers he talked with socialist party officials the socialists gained seats in the house and senateand in the california legislaturein the offyear elections that strengthened his hand he hoped it did anyhow one morning early in december he got to the construction site at the same time as a pickup truck instead of going in to work he grabbed a sign from the back of the truck he wasnt the only one who did inside of two minutes three dozen unfair signs went up in a picket line picketers were hitting other sites all over town too on strike chester and the other men shouted join us they cursed a worker who crossed the picket line another worker thought better of it you sons of bitches mordechai shouted youll pay for this weve paid too much for too long already chester answered wondering how much he would have to pay from here on out as soon as the engineer waved and the red light in the studio came on jake featherston leaned toward the microphone like a lover toward his beloved im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth he wondered how many times hed said that over the years he always believed it at least while he was talking truth is for the past twenty years and more the united states of america have been holding on to what doesnt belong to them at the end of the war the usa stole kentucky and sequoyah and what they call houston the people in those states dont want to belong to the usa theyve made it plain every way they know how that they dont want to belong to the usa but the united states government doesnt want to listen to them he paused to let that sink in then went on if they held fair and honest elections in those places the people there would show what they wanted they would show they want to come home to the confederate states of america president smith knows that as well as i do hes a clever man and i reckon hes an honest man he didnt think smith was anything close to clever and couldnt have cared less whether he was honest he did want to butter up the president of the united states he had his reasons i challenge president smith to allow plebiscites in kentucky and sequoyah and what they call houston i challenge him to abide by the results of those plebiscites i challenge him after the confederate states win those plebiscites to let those states come home featherston banged his fist down on the table the microphone jumped a little he loved sound effects like that they made people pay attention to what he was saying president smith has talked big about what hed do to restore peace in the stolen states hes talked big but he hasnt done anything much hes even said hed come to richmond to hash things out hes said that but he hasnt done it i tell him hes welcome here and id like to talk to him and i tell him one more thing something hed better listen to back during the war the usa helped our niggers when they rose up against us well that was wartime and maybe we can let bygones be bygones on account of it was but the blacks still dont know their proper place and the united states are still sneaking weapons down across the border to em that has got to stop its cost us a lot of lives and its cost us a lot of money to keep the niggers in check weve had to bump up the size of the army weve even had to put guns and bombs on our aeroplanes its been expensive we could have done better things with that money we could have but we didnt get the chance and thats the usas fault inside he was laughing here he was blaming the united states for what hed most wanted to do anyhow the black guerrillas had given him the perfect excuse for rearming even the usa hadnt squawked much about it had the guerrillas been white he thought the usa would have but the united states loved negroes hardly more than the confederate states did theyd made it very plain they didnt want the ones who tried to flee to the north he didnt know whether the united states were arming the guerrillas he knew he would have if he were in charge in philadelphia but coming up with usmade weapons and putting them in the hands of dead negroes so photographers could snap pictures of them was the easiest thing in the world president smith says the united states want peace they act like they want trouble we would rather have peace too but if they think we cant handle trouble they had better think again that was a bluff nothing else but if the united states pushed hard against the confederate states he hadnt a prayer of resisting but the usa had seemed ever more reluctant to hang on to their conquests if they couldnt even manage that they werent very likely to do anything more in the control room the engineer held up a hand fingers spread five minutes jake nodded to show hed seen the signal hed had a good notion of what the time was but he wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly north america is a big place he said were not all crowded together the way they are in europe theres room on this continent for two great countriesmaybe even for three if the united states ever bother to recollect what theyve done up in the north a smile that was half snarl flitted across his face he enjoyed nothing more than sticking a needle in the usa if the united states think the confederate states cant be great again if they think we shouldnt be great again then they had better think again about that too all we really want is for them to take their noses out of our affairs to take them out and to keep them out thats what good neighbors do bad neighbors get doors slammed in their faces and they deserve it too but i dont really expect well have any trouble if theyre just reasonable well get on fine to featherston if theyre just reasonable meant if they do what i want that the phrase could mean anything else never occurred to him hed just said the last word when the engineer drew a finger across his throat and the red light went out jake got to his feet and stretched as usual saul goldman waited for him right outside the studio door goldmans titledirector of communicationsdidnt sound like much any more than the little jew looked like much but it meant that goldman was in charge of the way the freedom party and the confederate states presented themselves to the world good job mr president he said now thank you kindly saul jake answered he spent more politeness on goldman than on most people a recognition of how valuable he thought the other man was the party and the csa could get by without a lot of fellows who brought only fanaticism losing somebody with brains would have hurt much more brains were harder to come by goldman said you do remember youve got the rally tonight thats going to be the speech about agriculture and about the dams and electricity i remember jake said indulgently got to talk about whats going on inside the country thats what most folks worry about first wouldnt want anything to go wrong with my reelection he laughed nothing would go wrong but saying the word felt good up till now no elected confederate president had or could have been reelected now that the amendment had repealed those seven nasty words though jake could go on about his business without worrying about leaving office after only six years he clapped goldman on the back you did real good with the campaign for the amendment too thank you mr president goldman said youre the one who will have to make it worthwhile and i intend to featherston said he was feeling pretty cocky as he strode out of the studio and got into his armored limousine back to the gray house the driver asked thats right virgil jake answered virgil joyner had been driving him for yearsever since the party struggled for survival after grady calkins assassinated president hampton featherston trusted him as far as he trusted anybody outriders on motorcycles pulled away from the curb before the limousine got going featherston didnt believe in taking chances he didnt have to he wanted to make sure he got to enjoy his second term the limousine glided past capitol square everything there was clean and tidy and orderly no more shantytown right at the heart of the csa all the hungry squatters had been cleared away well before the olympics and they hadnt come back freedom party stalwarts made damn sure they didnt come back but instead of turning left to go up shockoe hill to the presidential residence the driver hit the brakes what the hell jake said theres a wreck up ahead joyner answered well have to go around sure enough not just two but three autos had tangled at the corner of twelfth and capitol steam jetted from smashed radiators drivers and passengers stood by the wreckage arguing about whod done what to whom joyner blew his horn which did no good at all featherstons outriders descended from the motorcycles to push the wreckage out of the way which was a lot more practical another big motorcar raced down twelfth street it screeched to a stop on the far side of the accident three men in the white shirts and butternut trousers of freedom party stalwarts got out jake didnt think anything about that till they raised submachine guns and started shooting get the hell out of here he shouted as his guards started falling the men who were dressed like stalwartsor worse really were stalwartsran forward shooting as they ran one of them fell which meant they hadnt picked off all the outriders but the others came on virgil joyner put the limousine in reverse but it could only limpthe assassins had shot out the two front tires their bullets starred the windscreen pretty soon theyd punch through even bulletproof glass could take only so much rifle rounds would have smashed through the glass right away featherston and his driver both hadsnot the best weapons to use against submachine guns but a hell of a lot better than nothing a heartbeat before the windscreen finally blew in and sprayed fragments of glass all over the passenger compartment jake threw himself flat in the back seat bullets thudded into the upholstery just above his head and then the stream of bullets punishing the limousine stopped that meant at least one of the bastards out there had gone through a whole magazines worth of ammunition and needed to reload featherston popped up and fired out through the hole the assassins had shot in the windscreen with a pistol you had to aim you couldnt just spray bullets around and hope some of them would hit something one of the gunmen started to grab for his face he never finished the motion instead he crumpled to the ground the back of his head blown to red ruin as the round that killed him tore out the limousines horn blared that was joyners body slumping forward onto the buttonthe assassins fire had struck home after all one son of a bitch left jake thought one son of a bitch and me and im the meanest sob this country ever saw if hed been out there he would have jumped up on the hood stuck the submachine gun through the nowshattered windscreen and finished the job the last surviving assassin didnt maybe losing two of his buddies had unnerved him must be a kid went through featherstons mind hes never seen action before and he doesnt quite know what to do what the assassin did was go around to the side of the motorcar where jake had been sitting he grabbed for the door handle intending to yank the door open and shoot through the gap what he intended wasnt what he got featherston kicked the door from the inside with both feet using all his strength it caught the assassin in the midsection with a startled squawk he went down on his wallet he hung on to the submachine gun but he was still trying to swing it back toward the limousine when jake shot him in the belly he was trying to shoot him in the balls but didnt quite get what he wanted the assassins shriek was satisfying enough as things were featherstons next shot more carefully aimed blew off the bottom half of his face ears ringing jake looked around for more trouble he didnt see any only cops and ordinary people running toward the limousine to find out what the hell had happened all of a sudden he regretted that last vengeful shot with just a bullet in the gut the last assassin might have lived long enough to tell him a lot about what the hell had happened as things were he was dying fast and couldnt talk even if he wanted to but ill find out anyhow jake said and nodded slowly to show how much he meant it oh yes you just bet i will even now the negroes of augusta managed to snatch fun where they could the joint called the ten of clubs was a case in point its sign showed the card for which it was named lots of black spots on a white background scipio got the joke he was sure everybody who lived in the terry got it so far no white man seemed to have figured it out which only made it more delicious he and bathsheba paid fifty cents each at the door drinks werent cheap either but the best bands came to the ten of clubs if you wanted to cut a rug in the terry this was the place to do it scipio slipped the headwaiter another half dollar for a tiny table by the dance floor he pulled out one of the chairs so bathsheba could sit down you spoil me she said smiling hope so scipio answered his butlers training back at marshlands made such politesse automatic in him his wife still didnt know about that and shed pretty much given up nagging him to explain how he could pull a different way of speaking out of the woodwork just when they needed it most he ordered a bottle of beer bathsheba a whiskey the air was thick with cigarette smoke cheap perfume and sweat people wore what finery they had jewelry flashed on the women most of it was cheap costume jewelry but in the dim light of the ten of clubs rhinestones did duty for diamonds colored glass for rubies and sapphires a comic in white tie and tails several sizes too big for him came out and stood behind the microphone surveying the audience he sadly shook his head you aint here for me you is here for the band you dont make my life no easier you know he was right of course people in the shabby little night spot were waiting for the band which was on a tour that took it to colored districts of major towns all over the confederate states a heckler called why dont you shut up and go away how many hecklers had the funny man faced and faced down during his own years on the road hundreds surely you aint gonna git rid o me that easy he answered now sides aint it sweet how the white folks loves the president just as much as we does that brought not only giggles but a few horrified gasps from the crowd the papers had been full of jake featherstons latest escape from assassination these assailants had been white from everything scipio could gather theyd been freedom party men unhappy with featherston for seeking a second term nobody in public said much about who might have been behind them nobody said anything at all about imposing a fine on the white community like the one that had been taken from the csas negroes after that frankfurterseller tried to ventilate the president at the olympics that surprised scipio not a bit bathsheba leaned forward and said he got nerve he gots more nerven he gots sense scipio replied even in a place like thismaybe especially in a place like thisinformers were bound to be listening plenty of negroes would betray their own people for a little money or simply for the privilege of being left alone by freedom party goons scipio thought they were fools whatever tiny advantages they got wouldnt last long but a lot of menand womencouldnt see past the end of their noses when i heard they was shootin at the president i prayed the comic said i tell you i got down on my knees an prayed i prayed god keep mistuh featherston a long ways away from me more giggles more gasps too scipio wondered again whether the comic had more nerve than sense he skated awfully close to the line in fact he likely skated right over the line in how many towns in how many rooms full of strangers had he told jokes like that and got away with them then scipio had another thought one that chilled him worse than the december weather outside maybe the funny man wasnt worried about informers maybe he was an informer himself maybe he was trying to smoke out rebellious negroes in the audience they would come to him because he said what they were thinking and then then theyd be sorry scipio shivered again he didnt know that was true that it could even occur to him was a measure of the time he lived in reckon you heard satchmo and the rhythm aces is from new orleans the comic went on with a sly leer but i reckon you dont know why they is from new orleans an not in new orleans he paused setting up his punch line the freedom party gits in there they gits outa there it might even have been true a lot of bands from new orleans had started touring when huey long met an assassin who unlike those whod tried for jake featherston had known how to shoot straight had long been easier on negroes than the freedom party he couldnt have been much tougher and any which way a joke about the party was bound to draw a laugh from this crowd that only made scipio wonder again whether the funny man was a stalking horse for the people he pretended to mock no way to know not for sure but even the question spoiled his enjoyment of the comics lines he ordered another overpriced beer after what seemed a very long time the comic retreated and satchmo and the rhythm aces came out the trumpeter who led the band was an engagingly ugly fellow with a froglike bass voice when he raised the horn to his lips and began to play scipios eyes went wide not only at the sounds he produced but also at the way his cheeks swelled up he looked like a frog too like a spring peeper calling from a tree but the way he played made scipio and everybody else forget about the way he looked in his hands that trumpet didnt just speak it laughed and it moaned and it wept and when it did everyone who heard it wanted to do the same the rhythm acesfiddler sax man bass man drummercouldnt have backed him better and the music that poured from the band sent people hurrying from their seats and onto the dance floor now and again in the huntsmans lodge scipio had heard rich white men sneering about nigger music but the wilder freer rhythms blacks enjoyed had also infected whites music in the confederate states you could hardly find a song or a record on the wireless that didnt sound as if the musicians no matter how white had been listening to what came out of new orleans and mobile and atlanta and other towns with a lively colored music scene sometimes they didnt seem to know it themselves but the alert ear could always tell especially when a song from the usa got played for comparison music from north of the border wasnt necessarily bad but it was different more staid less surprising even in the confederate states though white musicians borrowed only some of the trimmings from what blacks played for themselves and among themselves any white band that played like satchmo and the rhythm aces assuming a white band could do any such thing which struck scipio as unlikelywould have been booed off the stage or just possibly idolized before scipio could decide which bathsheba reached out and tapped him on the arm why you sittin there she demanded lets us dance all right we do dat he got to his feet he wasnt the most enthusiastic dancer god ever made but you didnt come to the ten of clubs if you didnt want to get out on the floor he wasnt the most athletic dancer god ever made either he never had been hed always owned too much of a sense of his own dignity to let loose as fully as a lot of people and he wasnt so young as he had been either he did his best knowing bathshebas was betterand as he watched some of the youngsters cavort knowing there were things he hadnt even imagined some of the moves they made were as far beyond him as satchmos music was beyond a bored army bugler he shruggedand found himself trying to do it so it fit the beat he must have managed bathsheba didnt seen too exasperated all the same he felt like a sparrow among hummingbirds that could hover and fly backwards and zoom straight up and do a million other things no ordinary bird could ever hope to manage satchmo seemed ready to play all night eyes bugging out of his head trumpet aimed at the sky as if to let god and the angels hear he wailed on and on scipio wasnt ready to dance all night though his wife might have been but when he mimed exhaustion she went back to the table with him so he could catch his breath he realized that while out on the floor he hadnt once thought about jake featherston or the sorry plight of negroes in the csa the music had driven all his worries clean out of his head he might almost have been making love he laughed some of the young couples out there might almost have been making love while they danced for all he knew maybe some of them had at two in the morning the manager said we gots to close we git in trouble with the police if we dont is right sorry but i dont want no trouble with the police not the way things is a few people grumbled but nobody really raised a fuss the way things were these days a black man had to be crazy to court trouble with the police in augusta or anywhere else scipio and bathsheba got their coats and hats from the girl whod checked them and walked out into the night the terry was quietalmost deserted but for the people leaving the ten of clubs a chilly drizzle had begun to fall the crowd scattered quickly the negro district remained technically under curfew though the cops hadnt bothered enforcing it lately still nobody wanted to get caught and beaten up or shaken down bathsheba hoisted an umbrella scipio who didnt have one pulled his hat low on his forehead and looked down toward the ground to keep the rain out of his eyes lord im so glad tomorrows sunday his wife said he shook his head today sunday it be sunday coupla hours now do jesus i thanks de lawd we aint got to work most sundays he would have gone to church to thank the lord bathsheba believed even if he had trouble this morning though it looked as if they would both sleep in and so would the children he turned a corner then stopped short men were moving up ahead he couldnt see muchstreet lights in the terry hadnt worked for years but if those werent rifles being passed back and forth if they werent hed never seen any he turned around and without a word signed for bathsheba to back away raising a finger to his lips to show she needed to be quiet while she did it for a wonder she didnt argue for a bigger wonder none of those men with rifles came after them maybe theyd been so intent on their own business they hadnt noticed the people whod spotted them maybe the drizzle had helped too whatever the reason scipio knew he was lucky to get away in one piece he and bathsheba took a different street home as they made their escape a snatch of whistled music pursued them it wasnt any tune satchmo and the rhythm aces played but hed heard it before just the same it was the internationale reds had comecome backto the terry theyd come back and they had guns holy jesus one of the yeomen in the uss remembrances wireless shack yanked off his earphones and stared at his pal you hear that zach sure as hell did zach answered scribbling furiously on the pad in front of him whats up sam carsten asked as usual when not on duty he was killing time in the wireless shack it was warmthe aeroplane carrier cruised between florida and the usoccupied bahamasbut at least he was out of the sun he wished the yeomen werent wearing earphones that way he could have heard whatever it was too but they liked to get rid of distractions from the outside worldnosy officers for instancewhen they listened to morse zach finished writing then dropped the pencil signal going out in clear to the confederate army and navy sir he answered their vice president willy knight his name ishas resigned and hes under arrest christ sam said the other yeomanhis name was freddywas on the phone to the bridge with the news carsten heard a startled squawk on the other end of the line when it went through he felt like squawking himself instead he asked how come for the love of mike story theyre giving out is he was the fellow behind the stalwarts who tried to take out featherston a couple weeks ago zach said christ carsten repeated louder and with more emphasis this time thats the kind of crap that happens in argentina or nicaragua or one of those places not up here yes sir the yeoman nodded he knew better than to come right out and contradict an officer no matter how stupid that officer had just been he got his barb in all right but politely except it just did well what do they do now sam asked they arrested knight you say they going to give him a blindfold and a cigarette and stand him up against a wall no report on that sir zach answered only an alert he has resigned he has been arrested no orders issued in his name are to be obeyed sam wondered exactly what that meant too had willy knight tried to get the army or some of it to move against jake featherston if he had it didnt sound as if hed had much luck luck or not though nobody in either the usa or the csa had ever tried to play that particular game before he wanted to put on a napoleon suit but it turned out to be three sizes too big sam judged both yeomen in the wireless shack nodded this time he hung around the wireless shack hoping for more details but no more seemed forthcoming about ten minutes later the klaxons began to hoot ordering the crew to general quarters he thought it was a drill he hoped it was a drill he got down to his station in the bowels of the remembrance in jig time even so what the hells going on sir a sailor in the damagecontrol party asked they aint sprung one of these on us in a while im not sure said sam who had a pretty good idea maybe lieutenant commander pottinger knows more about it than i do but when pottinger got there half a minute later he said now what in tones mightily aggrieved he proceeded to explain himself i was in the head god damn it when the hooters started screeching a couple of sailors smiled nobody laughed that had happened to every man whod been in the navy more than a few months carsten said well sir i dont know for certain but he told what hed heard about willy knight shit pottinger didnt usually talk that way maybe his recent misadventure preyed on his mind he gathered himself and went on what the hell are the confederates going to do now beats me sir sam answered but i expect it explains the generalquarters call they want to make damn sure they dont go and do it to us makes sense pottinger agreed he shifted uncomfortably if they keep us here too long though im going to need a honey bucket again nobody laughed carsten approved of an officer who wouldnt abandon his post even in the face of what would ordinarily have been an urgent need the allclear sounded before lieutenant commander pottinger was reduced to such indignities the officer in charge of the damagecontrol party left with dignified haste carsten headed back to the wireless shack he found the door closed against snoopy interlopers like himself somebody on the remembrance was taking the news out of the csa very seriously indeed sams suspicions fell on commander cressy taking things seriously was how the exec earned his pay balked from getting more news sam went out on the flight deck by the rumors flying among the sailors there the powers that be had shut the door to the wireless shack too late somebody claimed willy knight had already been shot somebody else said he was still in jail awaiting trial as a us spy a grizzled bosun insisted knight had been trying to flee up into maryland when he was caught other claims seemed to spring from thin air some of them were probably true sam had no idea which though he listened to them all admiring the ones he found most impressive he might have done the same thing watching girls on a street corner in a liberty port the remembrance pitched a little as she steamed south but the sea was a lot calmer here than it would have been in the open waters of the north atlantic at this time of year the sun shone down out of a sky mostly blue in these latitudes even the winter sun could burn sams tender hide sea birds scudded along the breeze or dove into the ocean after fish but that buzz carsten heard didnt come from gulls or petrels those were aeroplane motorsand they werent the motors of the machines aboard the remembrance this was a different note peering west sam saw several brightly painted aeroplanes nearing the carrier they zoomed past low enough for him to read the words confederate citrus company on their sides a sailor saluted the machines from the csa with his middle finger another man said i hear those bastards all have guns in em these days sam had heard the same thing as with the news about willy knight he didnt know how much to believe but there was probably a fire somewhere under all that smoke a petty officer said we ought to splash a couple of em fish em out of the drink and damn well see for ourselves that took things right to the edge because a lot of sailors were nodding sam felt he had to draw back a step or two and he did we dont shoot at them unless they shoot first or unless we get orders from the skipper which means orders from the navy department back in philadelphia that petty officer muttered something carsten decided he didnt have to notice in any official way just as well too for it wasnt a compliment the fellow knew he was a mustang and wondered why he took the attitudes of ordinary officers that was what it amounted to anyhow the way the petty officer put it it would have knocked down one of those confederate citrus company machines without bothering about the carriers antiaircraft guns both the flyby and the news out of the csa got kicked around in the officers mess that evening the foulmouthed petty officer might have been surprised for a lot of the officers hed sneered at agreed with him those confederate bastards are just poking at us seeing how much they can get away with was a common sentiment we ought to break their fingers for em remind em who won the last war maybe this business with knight means theyll start fighting among themselves and leave us alone for a while a lieutenant said dont bet on it commander cressy entered the fray with his usual authority if theyd got rid of featherston then maybe the way things are he just gets the excuse to clamp down harder wonder if knight really was spying for us a lieutenant commander said in your dreams carsten thought he didnt say that not to an officer two grades senior to him but he held the opinion very strongly and he wasnt the only one for the executive officer snorted and said not likely hes done us too much harm over the years to make it easy to believe he was on our side all along but we can deny it till were blue in the face and that wont do us any good wonder what excuse knight had for getting rid of him someone said whatever it was too bad it didnt work featherston is going to run again and knight didnt think he should sam said knight figured he was going to get elected this coming november but their constitutional amendment screwed his chances could be commander cressy said could be but we dont know for sure the confederates are saying knight was the guy behind those fellows who tried to shoot featherston but how do we know thats true far as i can see we dont featherston might be using the assassination attempt as an excuse to get rid of knight regardless of whether he really had anything to do with it that cynical assessment stopped talk in its tracks at last lieutenant commander pottinger whistled in reluctant admiration you dont believe in anything do you sir he said not without evidence cressy answered at once we havent got any except for what the confederate wireless says and the confederate wireless lies it lies like a drunk telling his wife what happened to the grocery money are you going to trust it just because it says something you might want to hear again no one spoke for a little while sam eyed the exec with real respect he had believed the wireless reports from the csa they were the only news he had so why not believe them he hadnt found any reason not to but commander cressy hadand a damn good reason too makes it harder to figure out what the confederates are up to if we cant believe anything they say he remarked thats not our worry cressy said the way i look at things is we dont believe any of it till we either have evidence of our own that we should or until our superiors tell us whats true and what isnt you can bet theyve got spies inside the csa finding out what the straight dope is i hope they do theyd be damn fools if they didnt carsten thought that cheered him but not for long a lifetime in the navy had convinced him that a lot of his superiors were damn fools and the only thing he could do about it was try to keep them from causing as much harm as possible he did say i wonder how many spies the confederates have in the usa nobody answered the question which produced a chilly silence in the wardroom he might have started talking about whorehouses hed known at a womens club meeting the remembrances officers were willing enough to think about their own spies but not about the other fellows commander cressy looked thoughtful though he didnt say anything but then commander cressy always looked thoughtful so sam wasnt sure how much that proved or whether it proved anything at all every once in a while boston cast up a mild springlike day even if the calendar said it was early february if it was a saturday too well all the better people whod stayed indoors as much as they could since winter slammed down emerged from their nests blinking at the watery sunshine and the pale blue sky they might almost have been animals coming out of hibernation sylvia enos certainly felt that way with the mercury in the high forties one reckless weatherman on the wireless even talked about the fiftiesshe wanted to be out and doing things she didnt need to worry about long johns or overcoat or mittens or thick wool muffler all she had to do was throw a sweater on over her blouse and go outside and gratefully she did mary jane didnt even bother with a sweater perhaps because her blouse was wool perhaps because she wanted to show off while she had the chance sylvia minded that impulse less than shed thought she would in a daughter mary jane was heading from her mid toward her late twenties and hadnt snagged a husband yet she didnt seem unduly worried about it either as far as sylvia was concerned a little display might be in order they went to quincy market next to faneuil hall the grasshopper on the weather vane atop faneuil hall showed the wind coming out of the south pointing to it sylvia said thats the only good thing from the confederate states the weather i mean she paused to light a cigarette then shook her head no i take it back their tobaccos nice too the rest forget it let me have one of those will you mary jane said sylvia handed her the pack then leaned close to give her a light mary jane sucked in smoke she blew it out and nodded thats pretty good all right a sailor on leave whistled at her she ignored him sylvia would have ignored him too he was a little bowlegged fellow with a face like a ferrets ten seconds later he whistled at another woman she didnt pay any attention to him either mary jane said hows ernie or dont i want to know hes not that bad sylvia said defensively hes been sweet lately his writing is going better that always helps ernie said it helped him starve slow instead of fast as long as sylvia had known him though hed always managed to make at least some kind of living from his typewriter hurrah mary jane said hasnt pulled a gun on you lately not lately sylvia agreed i dont care how sweet he is hes trouble her daughter said she was probably right noshe was right and sylvia knew it that didnt mean she wanted to dump ernie if shed wanted to she would have long since the whiff of danger he brought to things excited her actually it was a good deal more than a whiff but sylvia refused to dwell on that and if anything his shortcoming posed a challenge when she pleased him she knew shed accomplished something how to put that into words he may be trouble but hes never dull he may not be dull but hes trouble her daughter said again sylvia didnt argue she just kept walking past the stalls and shops of quincy market people sold everything from homecanned chowder and oyster stew to books to frying pans to furniture to jewelry to hats mary jane admired sterlingsilver cups that aped ones made by paul revere sylvia admired the cups too but not their prices those horrified her theyre for rich tourists she said i know mary jane answered but they are pretty someonenot a tourist by his accent which was purest bostontook a silver gravy boat up to the shopkeeper and peeled green bills out of his wallet sylvia sighed it must be fun to be able to afford nice things she said mary jane pointed to a new stall across the way those look nice she said and they might not be too expensive sylvia read the sign clogstons quilts she shivered knowing winter wasnt over in spite of this mild day some of the blankets are getting pretty ratty all right lets go have a look the quilts on display made a rainbow under a roof of waterproof canvas they were carefully laid out with an eye to which colors went with others and that only made the display more enticing some duplicated colonial patterns while others were brightly modern hello ladies said the proprietor a pleasant woman in her early forties with a wide smile and very white teeth help you with something do you make all these mary jane blurted i sure do chris clogston at your service she dipped her head in the same brisk way a man running a shop might have used when you dont see me here youll find me at the sewing machine when do you sleep mrsuh missclogston sylvia asked awkwardly changing the question when she noticed the other woman wore no ring sleep whats that i just hang myself in a corner now and then to get the wrinkles out chris clogston laughed it was a good laugh a laugh that invited anyone who heard it to share the joke she went on i do stay busy but i like making quilts picking out the colors and making sure everything is strong and will last it doesnt seem like work and it beats the stuffingshe laughed againout of going to a factory every day oh yes sylvia had done her share of that and more what sort of living do you make if you dont mind my asking im still here the shopkeeper answered actually im new here new in quincy market the rent for this space is twice what i paid where i was before but i get a lot more customers so its worth it her gray eyes widened a little and what can i interest you in that ones pretty sylvia pointed chris clogston nodded seeming pleased im glad you like it that patterns been in the family for i dont know how longsince before the revolution anyhow im a ninthgeneration clogston in america john the first one we know about came to boston before out of belfast wow mary jane said wow is right sylvia said i cant trace my pedigree back past my greatgrandfather and i dont know much about him my granny was mad for family history and she gave me some of the bug chris clogston said she picked up the quilt now this particular one is stuffed with cotton i also make it stuffed with goose down if you want it extra warm that will cost you more though how much is this one and how much would it be with the down sylvia asked this ones the quiltmaker answered its nice and toasty too dont get me wrong if you want it with goose down though it goes up to sylvia didnt need to think about whether she could afford the downstuffed quilt she knew she couldnt the cotton even the cotton was a reach but she said ill take it you wont be sorry chris clogston said itll last you a lifetime mary jane pointed to a small quilt in pink and blue lets get that one too for george and connies baby sylvia hesitated not because she didnt like the quilt but because she couldnt afford to spend the money mary jane said dont worry ma ill spring for it itll use up some overtime i got last week she grinned easy come easy go the small quilt cost mary jane did pay and didnt blink sylvia hadnt known about the overtime she wondered if it was mythical she didnt quarrel with her daughter though george and connie would be happy to have the quilt for their little boy thank you very much ladies chris clogston called as sylvia and mary jane left the stall thank you sylvia answered well pleased with the quilt shed bought she looked up at the blue sky and the bravely shining sun i wonder how long this weather will hold as long as it does mary jane said we just have to enjoy it till its gone i intend to sylvia said and then after a few steps through the crowded quincy market its like that with ernie and me too you know mary jane only shrugged i cant talk sense into your head about that ive tried and it doesnt work but i still dont think hes good for you good for me sylvia hadnt worried about that hes interesting things happen when hes around and you never know beforehand what theyll be maybe mary jane said but some of the time i bet you wish you did she was right sylvia knew it ernie had frightened her in ways no one else had matched or even approached she sometimesoftenthought he was most in earnest when his mood turned blackest even so never a dull moment she said that counts for something too pa would have said the same thing wouldnt he after his destroyer dodged a torpedo mary jane replied but one day the destroyer didnt dodge and thats how come i hardly remember my own father yes thats right sylvia said i paid him back though roger kimball was dead sure enough but that didnt wouldnt couldnt bring george enos senior back to life mary jane would never have the memories she was missing all sylvia had left were her memories mary jane changed the subject as abruptly as anyone could lets go over to the union oyster house for an early supper i cant remember the last time i was there why not sylvia said thinking in for a penny in for a pound theyd already spent a lot of money today after that what was a little more the union oyster house was only a couple of blocks from the market square the building in which it operated had stood on the same spot since the early eighteenth century the restaurant itself had been there for more than a hundred years people said daniel webster had drunk at the cramped little bar almost everything about the union oyster house was cramped and little from the stairs people descended to get down to the main level to the panes of glass in the windows to the tiny wooden booths into which diners squeezed sylvia and mary jane snagged a booth with no troublethey got in ahead of the evening rush the one place where the restaurant didnt stint was on the portions the plates of fried oysters and fried potatoes a harriedlooking waiter set in front of the two women would have fed a couple of lumberjacks or possibly a couple of football teams how am i going to eat all that sylvia asked then she did mary jane cleaned her plate too going home happily full carrying things theyd wanted to buy made a good end to a good day and two men on the trolley car stood up to give sylvia and her daughter their seats that didnt happen all the time either spread on the bed the quilt looked even finer than it had in chris clogstons stall it promised to be warm too sylvia wanted to burrow under it right then and there how about that ma mary jane said sylvia nodded yes how about that she wondered what ernie would say when he saw the quilt probably something sarcastic she thought well if he does too bad for him lucien galtier cleaned the farmhouse as if his life depended on it he was not the sort of slob a lot of men living by themselves would have been marie wouldnt have liked that and he took his wifes opinions more seriously now that she was gone than he had while she was there to enforce them but he knew he couldnt hope to match the standard she set and he hadnt tried hed set his own less strict standard and lived up to that now though he tried to match what marie would have done that meant a lot of extra scrubbing and dusting it meant cleaning out corners where dirt lingeredthough he still didnt attack the corners with needles as marie might have done it meant putting things in closets and deciding what was too far gone even to linger in a closet any more it meant a lot of extra work he did the extra work not merely from a sense of duty but from a sense of pride he was going to bring йloise granche here and he wanted everything perfect if she thought he lived like a pig in a sty well so what some part of him jeered she doesnt want to marry you anyhow he ignored the internal scoffing he didnt so much think it wrong as think it irrelevant seeing a clean house wouldnt make йloise change her mind and want to live here when she spoke of patrimony and the problems marriage would cause both families she was firm she was decisiveand as far as lucien could see she was dead right that wasnt why he worked till his lungs burned and his heart pounded and his chest ached worked harder than he did on the farm at any time of the year but harvest he worked himself into a panting tizzy for one of the oldest reasons in the world he wanted to impress the woman he cared about they were already lovers impressing her wouldnt get him anything but a smile and perhaps a quick offhand compliment he knew that his mother hadnt raised a fool hoping to see that smile kept him slaving away with a smile on his own face after he couldnt find anything else left to clean he cleaned himself he made lavish even extravagant use of water he heated on the stove on a warmer day he could have luxuriated in the steaming tub for a long time letting the hot water soak the kinks out of his back but water didnt stay hot forever not in winter in quebec it didnt when it started to cool off which it did all too soon he got out and dried off in a hurry he thought about putting on his black wool suit when he went to get йloise thought about it and discarded the notion in the next breath she would think someone had died and he was on his way to the funeral and besides the suit smelled so strongly of mothballs it would have made her eyes water it stayed in the closet he put on the clothes he would have worn to a dancework clothes but the best he had and also impeccably clean if he wouldnt go to йloises reeking of mothballs he wouldnt go reeking of stale sweat either hed just set a warm wool cap on his head and was putting on his overcoat when someone knocked on the door tabernac he snarled who the devil would come bothering him now when he had more important things to worry about than a neighbor whod run out of chicken feed before he went to the door he shrugged on his overcoat i was just going out would cut any visit short with dramatic suddenness he threw the door open whoever was out there lucien intended to make him feel guilty dr leonard odoull stared at him surprised but not visibly afflicted with guilt what have we here galtiers soninlaw asked is it that you are so eager to escape my company yes galtier thought but he couldnt say that i was about to go out for a drive he replied in this odoull waved at the swirling snow now he sounded more than surprised he sounded astonished me i had to come down to the hospital today and from the hospital it is but a short hop here but why would you go out for a drive if you dont have to to visit a friend lucien replied which was part of the truth though he was careful to say un ami and not une amie he didnt want odoull knowing his friend was of the feminine persuasion realizing his soninlaw wouldnt disappear in the wind he stepped aside come in no point letting the heat out of the house no certainly not odoull did come in and stamped snow all over the tidy entry hall lucien did his best not to wince slowly he shed his own coat and cap leonard odoull slithered out of his overcoat with a sigh of relief he went on i wont keep you long since its plain you have such important business elsewhere galtier pretended not to notice the sarcasm unfortunately i do he said which made odoull raise a gingery eyebrow lucien waved him to the couch but sit down what sort of gossip have you heard at the hospital at the hospital nothing much odoull stretched his long legs out in front of him to galtiers relief he didnt put his feet up on the table as hed sometimes been known to do still though gossip does come to a doctors office does it lucien said tonelessly well yes as a matter of fact it does his soninlaw replied and it could even be that the gossip that comes is true though i did not think so before i knocked on your door since you have not told me what this gossip is i have no idea whether it is true or not lucien said should i care were people starting to talk about йloise and him leonard odoull didnt directly answer that instead he asked mon beaupиre are you a happy man that question took galtier by surprise he thought for a moment then answered most of the time i am too busy working even to wonder all right never mind dr odoull smiled i hope when you do have time away from your work i hope you are happy however you get to be that way i hope so and so does nicole and i have talked with charles and georges and denise they all feel the same way i have not talked with your other two daughters but i am sure they would agree are you would they lucien said and why is everyone so intimately concerned with my happiness that didnt quite take the bull by the horns but it came close odoull smiled at him because of the gossip as i said well and what is this gossip and why are you acting like an old woman and listening to it there now lucien would find out whatever there was to find out so he thought anyhow but odoull only smiled and said that it could be you have some reason for happiness well if i do that reason is not a beaufils who comes around snooping after what i am doing lucien said pointedly this time leonard odoull laughed out loud as if you never did any snooping of your own he said the only comeback galtier found for that was dignified silence so he used it but even silence made his soninlaw laugh at him odoull got to his feet well mon beaupиre i wont keep you any more i hope you find happiness wherever you can he didnt even wait for an answer he just put on his hat and overcoat and left through the howl of the wind lucien heard his soninlaws old ford roar to flatulent life the motorcar sputtered up the path from the farmhouse to the road then its noise faded away as soon as quiet returned lucien put on his own warm clothes again he hoped the chevrolet would start it did the battery might be going but it wasnt quite gone he let the engine get good and warm then put the auto in gear and drove off to йloise granches what kept you she said when he knocked on the door i expected you half an hour ago my soninlaw paid me a call he answered with a shrug from what leonard says there may be some gossip about us do you mind does it bother you no not at all йloise said with a shrug of her own ive always expected it we should be grateful its taken this long to show up who knows whether it has lucien said its taken this long for one of us to hear about it yes but thats different who knows how long people have been mumbling this that or the other thing йloise looked thoughtful slowly she nodded yes it could be that you are right still it is a small thing shall we go certainly lucien replied he held the passenger door of the chevrolet open for her then went around to the drivers side again the motorcar started lucien surreptitiously patted the steering wheel the machine might be less reliable than a horse but it was doing what it was supposed to do hardly any traffic was on the road as he drove back to his own farmhouse the autos and trucks that did appear seemed to come out of nowhere loom enormously for a moment through the swirling snow and then disappear as abruptly as theyd come into view everything goes by so fast йloise murmured tu as raison galtier said that was what gave me the hardest time when i learned to drive after the war up till then he hadnt had a prayer of affording a motorcar only a bargain with the americans for the land theyd taken from his farm for their hospital had let him do it he went on in a buggy or a wagon you have time to look away from the road and back again in a motorcar no mon dieu no if you do not pay attention every moment you will have a wreck he got back to his house without having a wreck he was anxious even so as he handed йloise out of the chevrolet the anxiety grew on the short walk to the front door he thought the place was reasonably tidy but what did he know what did he really know he was only a man after all when he opened the door he distracted йloise for a moment by flipping the switch and turning on a lamp across the room electricity she said and nodded to herself yes i knew you had it its so much brighter and finer than kerosene a moment later lucien wondered whether that fine bright light was what he wanted it would let her see every flaw in his housekeeping mercifully though she didnt seem inclined to be critical she let him guide her through the house every so often nodding again very nice she said when the tour was done very nice indeed i am glad youre comfortable i have worried about you living here by yourself she raised an eyebrow somehow though i doubt everything is quite so neat when you are not having company over lucien looked back at her nothing but innocence on his face why my sweet what can you possibly mean by that йloise started to explain exactly what she meant then she caught the glint in his eye and started to laugh instead you she said fondly you are a devil arent you if i am it is because you make me one galtier answered he took her in his arms to show just what kind of devil she made him her lips were sweet against his she didnt kiss quite like mariebut she was probably thinking he didnt kiss like her dead husband and so what either way they were kissing each other and nothing else mattered not right then xii cincinnatus driver wasnt happy about walking upstairs from his apartment he knew he should have been happy knowing that only made him more unhappy yet he sighed and muttered something under his breath the more you looked at it the more you lived it the more complicated life got he knocked on the door of the apartment just above his the wireless was on inside pretty loud he had to knock twice before anybody in there heard him suddenly the wireless got softer a few seconds later the door opened evenin mr chang cincinnatus said how are you today oh hello mr driver said the father of cincinnatus daughterinlaw joey chang was polite hed always stayed polite with cincinnatus even if he didnt much care to have achilles in his family he hesitated then brightened i just make new batch of beer you want some if cincinnatus had come up about homebrew then maybe they wouldnt have to talk about other things and cincinnatus smiled and nodded and said id love to have some for true he meant every word of it iowa was a dry state with liquor of any kind hard to come by and chang made damn good beer but that wasnt why cincinnatus had come upstairs i got some news you need to know news mr chang asked and cincinnatus nodded again the chinaman sighed much as cincinnatus had while climbing the stairs he stepped aside you come in you tell me news thank you kindly cincinnatus said evenin mrs chang he called to the woman sitting close by the wireless set it was playing a comedy about a trolley driver and his friend who worked in a sewer cincinnatus wondered how much mrs chang followed her english wasnt as good as her husbands as if to underscore that joey chang spoke to her in chinese she answered in the same language cincinnatus understood not a word but she didnt sound happy mr chang sighed again on exactly the same note he lit a cigarette then offered cincinnatus one once they were both smoking he said what is this news achilles and grace they gonna have themselves another baby toward the end of the year cincinnatus answered baby mrs chang said sharply she might not have a whole lot of english but she sure understood that yes maam thats right cincinnatus said this is good news here you wait joey chang went into the kitchen he came back half a minute later with three small glasses he gave one to his wife one to cincinnatus and kept the third for himself a baby kampai he said and knocked back his glass mud in your eye cincinnatus followed suit this wasnt beer it scorched his gullet all the way down and exploded like a bomb when it hit his stomach whew he eyed the empty glass with respect you make that yourself not me chang shook his head this place too small for proper still beer easy can make beer anywhere but need more room for still need place where neighbors no smell smoke he scowled that wasnt the word he wanted after a moment he found the right one fumes neighbors no smell fumes for this i trade plenty beer with fellow i know you want more if youve got it to spare i wouldnt mind another one dont want to put you to no trouble though no trouble mr chang took cincinnatus glass and disappeared into the kitchen again when he returned he had a refill too this time cincinnatus sipped cautiously instead of sending the hooch down the hatch it was some kind of brandy not whiskey and strong enough to grow hair on his chestor on joey changs chest which was a bigger challenge another baby chang murmured his eyes for a few seconds soft and far away grandfather again yeah cincinnatus said dreamily then he pointed at mr chang youd like it a lot better if you saw the new baby when it comesand if you saw the grandbaby you already got once in a while i know i know chang stared down into the glass he held but grace she run off she get married when we say no she not do what her mother her father say she marry fellow who is not chinese things hard on account of that he was a little man more than a head shorter than cincinnatus but he spoke with enormous pride reckon hed say the same thing if i was white too cincinnatus thought bemused he hadnt imagined a chinaman could also look down his nose at whites the mere idea broadened his mental horizon mrs chang spoke a sharp singsong rattle of chinese her husband answered in the same language then returned to english for cincinnatus benefit she say we not angry because your boy colored fellow we angry because grace disobey us for chinese this is very bad hard to forgive dont know nothin about that said cincinnatus who suspected chang was lying some for politeness sake but wasnt quite sure he went on i do know you aint just missin out on grace though you missin out on your grandbaby you gonna be missin out on two grandbabies your pride worth all that now mr chang spoke in chinesetranslating the question cincinnatus figured mrs chang answered right away again her tone said everything cincinnatus needed to know you bet your life pride is worth it that was what shed told him all right cincinnatus wondered whether mr chang would show any backbone from everything the negro had seen mrs chang was the one who said jump frog her husband asked how high on the way up but he said something more and then something more and then something more again after his last sally mrs chang burst into tears embarrassed cincinnatus turned away i better go he mumbled all right you go mr chang said but you see achilles and grace you say they can come by here we be glad to see them this go on too long mrs chang protested again her husband for a wonder overrode her they were still arguing when cincinnatus slipped out the door and went downstairs well elizabeth asked when he walked into their apartment mr chang say they can come visit cincinnatus answered and his wifes face lit up he raised a warning hand mrs chang aint very happy about it pretty fair chance she make him change his mind elizabeth sighed theys powerful proud folks she said cincinnatus walked over and gave her a kiss she eyed him with as much suspicion as pleasure whats that for on account of thats the very same word the changs used when they was talkin about themselves he said and only a clever lady like you would figure it out all on her lonesome that a fact elizabeth said cincinnatus solemnly nodded she wagged a finger at him i tell you a fact you only talk so sweet to me when you want somethingan i generally know what it is you want if she hadnt been smiling the words would have flayed as things were cincinnatus laughed sure enough you got what i want he said elizabeth snorted cincinnatus laughed again but though he might have been trying to butter her up he hadnt been lying he hoped she felt the same way shed never given him any signs she didnt when he came home two or three days later elizabeth pointed to an envelope on the kitchen table you got a letter from covington she said she hadnt opened it shed acquired her letters only after they came to iowa and still didnt read fluently they also had a family rule that mail belonged to the person whose name was on the envelope and to nobody else cincinnatus eyed the envelope with a mixture of pleasure and apprehension his father and mother still lived in kentucky and they did write to him every so oftenor rather they had a literate neighbor do it for they couldnt read or write he was always glad to hear from them and always suspicious when he did back in the s the kentucky state police had used a false message from them to lure him to covington and flung him into jail for sedition as soon as he got off the train he opened the envelope and took out the sheet of paper inside he was frowning when he put it down whats it say elizabeth asked he says mas startin to forget things act like she was a little child again cincinnatus scowled at the letter up till now livia had always been the rock at which the family anchored senecas health had been shaky now and again but hardly ever hers tears stung cincinnatus eyes this wasnt anything a doctor could fix either he knew that too well thats hard to bear sweetheart thats right hard to bear elizabeth said both her parents though were long dead so her sympathy went only so far sudden anxiety sharpened her voice as she asked he dont want you to go down there he better not after all you went through no no cincinnatus shook his head he say my pas managin for now but then he shook his head in a different more thoughtful way reckon maybe i could though aint no more kentucky state police to fling me in jail sure aint but that wasnt agreement from his wife it was sarcasm and there aint on account o the freedom partys runnin things in kentucky nowadays freedom party fellers they love to have another nigger come down to their state an commence to raisin trouble i wouldnt raise no trouble cincinnatus said all id be doin was seein my own mother while shes still on this earth elizabeth shook her finger at him as if he were a naughty little boy you stay right here where you belong aint goin nowhere already told you that but things aint as bad as you think in kentucky and thats the truth yeah they got them freedom party fellers runnin things now but they cant do like they done down in the confederate statescant beat up all the folks who dont like em and keep them folks from votin they lose the next election theys gone you goes down there yous gone elizabeth said sides you goes down there whats amanda an me supposed to do for money it dont grow on treesor if it do i aint found the nursery what sells it even if i was to go i wouldnt be gone long cincinnatus said itd be to see my ma say goodbye to her while she still know who i am that kind of forgettin it just gits worse an worse somebody live long enough he dont even know who he is let alone anybody else elizabeth softened slightly thats so she admitted and hugged cincinnatus all right we take it like it comes see how she do if you got to go then you got to go and thats all there is to it she started to let go of cincinnatus but now he squeezed her i love you he said youre the best thing ever happen to me i better be elizabeth said on account of you dont know how to stay out of trouble on your own cincinnatus wanted to resent that or get angry about it he wanted to but found he couldnt no alexander arthur pomeroy declared like a tycoon declining a merger offer mary had just asked him if he wanted a nap at two and a half he was liable to mean that no too and to be fussy and cranky at night because he hadnt had it one of these days before too long hed stop taking naps for good and then mary wouldnt get any rest from dawn till dusk either she looked forward to that day with something less than delight most of alecs milestones had delighted her first tooth first step first word last nap though last nap was different of course alec might also have been saying no just for the sake of saying no he did that a lot from what other mothers said every twoyearold went through the same maddening phase maddening though it was it could also be funny slyly pitching her voice the same way as she had when asking him if he wanted a nap mary said alec do you want a cookie no he said again a pintsized captain of industry then he realized hed made a dreadful mistake the horror on his face matched anything in the moving pictures yes he exclaimed cookie want cookie he started to cry mary gave him a vanilla wafer he calmed down the way hed wailed though said he needed a nap whether he wanted one or not she didnt ask again but scooped him up sat down in the rocking chair and started reading a story she kept her tone deliberately bland after about ten minutes alecs eyes sagged shut she rocked a little longer then carried him to his crib she put him down with care sometimes his head would bob up if she wasnt gentle but not today mary let out a sigh of relief now she had anywhere from half an hour to an hour and a half to herself time had been a luxury more precious than ermine more precious than rubies ever since alec was born coffee mary said and headed for the kitchen shed always liked tea better come to that she still did like tea better but coffee had one unquestionable advantage it was stronger with a babynow a toddlerin the house strength counted shed long since given up trying to figure out how far behind on sleep she was a gently steaming cup beside her she sat down in the rocking chair again this time by herself she unfolded the rosenfeld register and prepared to make the most of her free time the register was just a weekly and so didnt bother with much news from abroad but it did have one foreign story on the front page confederate states resume conscription featherston of the csa said he was doing it because of the continuing national emergency in the country and blamed rebellious blacks president smith of the usa hadnt said anything by the time the register went to press mary glanced over to the wireless set she couldnt remember anything smith had said since the register went to press either she thought about turning on the set and listening to some news but she didnt have the energy to get up whatever the president of the usa said shed find out sooner or later regardless of what president smith said mary knew what she thought if the confederates werent getting ready to spit in their northern neighbors eye she would have been surprised she hoped they spat good and hard during the war canada and the confederates had been on the same side shed wondered about that then the confederate states hadnt hung out a lamp of liberty for all the world to see they still didnt by all appearances but whether they did or not one ancient rule had still applied the enemy of my enemy is my friend these days mary would gladly have allied with the devil against the united states only trouble was old scratch appeared uninterested in the dealor maybe hed taken up residence in philadelphia as for her country it remained subjugated she saw no grand uprising on the horizon the canadians had tried that once tried failed and seemed to decide not to repeat the experiment that left mary furious she wanted to be part of something bigger than herself something more than a rebellion of one other people made bombs too and made more of them she read and heard about the bangs every so often and had the feeling the papers and wireless didnt talk about all of them the others attacked real soldiers and administrators too the way her father had they didnt limit themselves to a greek whod come up to canada to run a general store mary looked up toward the heavens and asked god or perhaps her father well what else could i do other parts of life had got in the way of her thirst for revenge one of those other parts was working in the diner across the street another was sleeping in the crib she knew next to nothing about the people who planted other bombs but she would have bet they didnt have babies to worry about local stories filled most of the registers pages local stories and local advertising the wedding announcements and obituaries were as stylized as the serials that ran ahead of main features on the cinema screen if youd seen one youd seen them all only names and dates changed as for the ads many of those were even more formulaic than the announcements peter karamanlides bought space to plug his store every week so did dr shipley the painless dentist mary often wondered why when they had the only general store and dentists office for miles around the same applied to the laundry and the haberdasher and to the newspaper itself if you didnt use their services whose would you use advertisements from farmers often followed formulas too those for stud services did offspring to stand and walk was the stock phrase if the offspring did fine if not the stud fee had to be refunded but some of those ads were different there was no standard format for instance for selling a piano there was no formula for the little stories speckled through the inner pages of the rosenfeld register either the editor no doubt would have called them human interest pieces mary sometimes wondered about the sanity of any human being who was interested in stories about a twoheaded calf nursed by two different cows or a man who pulled a boxcar with his teethand false teeth at that but she looked at the filler pieces herself a story about a mother cat nursing an orphaned puppy could make her smile so could one about two former sweethearts whod both moved away from the small town where they grew up then didnt see each other for twentyfive years till they were standing in line at the same toronto cinema one had never married the other was a widower theyd fallen in love all over again some of those human interest stories made mary grit her teeth because propaganda poisoned them the one about the yank flier whod requalified as a fighter pilot after twenty years away from aeroplanes was particularly sappy she had to resist the impulse to crumple up the register and throw it across the living room the last paragraph said our bold hero now also a successful barrister specializing in occupation affairs is married to the former laura secord a descendant of the paul revere of canada who had the same name they have one daughter thus we see that the two lands are becoming ever more closely intertwined mary saw nothing of the sort what she saw was a traitor living high on the hog because shed married a yank and hadnt laura secord been one of the people whod betrayed the uprising in the s mary nodded to herself she was sure she remembered that she wouldnt forget the name not when shed learned it in school before the yanks started changing what was taught had the woman been intertwined with this yank flier even then the lewd image was enough to make marys cheeks heat shed promised herself vengeance on the people whod made the uprising fail shed promised and then she hadnt delivered her father would have been ashamed of her up there in heaven arthur mcgregor probably was ashamed of her ill take care of it she whispered ill take care of it if its the last thing i ever do then she had to take care of something else because alec woke up with a yell pooping potty that was his signal that he needed to use the toiletor sometimes that hed just gone mary rushed in to lift him out of the crib and see which it was this time youre dry she exclaimed in glad surprise after a hasty checkhe did have accidents in his sleep dry as a fly he answered echoing one of the things she said to him what a good boy mary took him out of the crib gave him a kiss and stood him on a stool in front of the toilet he did his business and almost all of it went where it was supposed to go mary cleaned up the rest with toilet paper what a good boy she said again another woman in the block of flats insisted babies didnt turn into people till they were toilettrained mary thought that went too far most of the time his clothes set to rights alec went off to play mary went off to keep at least one eye on him while he was playing to make sure he didnt knock over a table or pull a lamp down on his head or try to swallow a big mouthful of dust or stick his finger in an electric socket or do any of the other interesting and creative things small children did in their unending effort not to live to grow up this afternoon he made a beeline for the ashtray oh no you dont mary said and got there first hed tried that before once hed managed to swallow one of morts cigarette butts as hed proved by puking it up keeping an eye on her son mary understood how her mother had come to have gray hair every so often she cast a longing glance across the street at the diner when mort got back shed have another pair of eyes in the flat to keep watch on alec one toddler left two parents only slightly outnumbered dealing with alec by herself mary often felt not just outnumbered but overwhelmed but when mort did come home he sank down into the rocking chair with a bottle of moosehead and complained about how busy hed been all day at the diner lord its good to get off my feet he said i have the same feeling when alec takes a nap mary said pointedly her husband didnt take the point it was a madhouse over there today he said we made good money but they kept us hopping alec always keeps me hopping mary said this little fellow this little fellow here mort grabbed alec and stuck him on his lap alec squealed with glee and cuddled up if i tried that hed pitch a fit either that or hed just jump off ten seconds later mary thought mort ruffled the toddlers fine sandy hair youre not so tough are you tough alec yelled gleefully tough youre not so tough mort said again and turned him upside down alec squealed in delight mary hid a sigh by turning away mort could do things with their son that she couldnt shed seen that very early on he could get alec to pay attention and do what he was told when she couldnt maybe it was just that he had a deep rumbling mans voice maybe it was that he was gone more and alec wanted to please him while he was around whatever it was it was unquestionably real so was laura secords treason alec has his father mary thought i made a promise to mine a long time ago i havent kept it yet but that doesnt mean i wont oh no it doesnt mean that at all she nodded to herself then she smiled she wasnt annoyed at mort any more not even a little bit conscripts were filling out the ranks of the confederate army it got stronger week by week confederate aeroplanes carried guns and bombs the fastest confederate fighters could go up against anything the usa built and the united states while theyd grumbled hadnt done anything but grumble as far as clarence potter was concerned that would do for a miracle till a bigger one came along jake featherston had thought it would work like this if it hadnt whether featherston gotextortedthe right to run for a second term wouldnt have mattered a hill of beans worth the country would have thrown him out on his ear if the usa didnt take care of the job the confederate states were ever so much stronger than they had been potter knew just how strong they wereand how strong the united states were a fight would have been no contest but no fight came featherston had been sure none would and hed been right by god hes earned a second term for that potter muttered at his desk down below the war department building he shook his head in something halfway between bemusement and horror did i say that did i say that he wondered by god i did i meant it too hed spent more than fifteen years as one of jake featherstons sincerest enemiessincerest because hed known featherston longer and better than any of the other people who couldnt stand him and now he had to admit jake had known what he was doing after all potter wouldnt have dreamt the usa would sit quiet and let the csa rearm he would have thoughthell he had thoughtyoud have to be crazy to take a chance like that featherston had taken the chance and hed got away with it so what did that make him a crazy man saw things nobody else could see but what about someone who saw things nobody else could seebut that turned out to be there after all there was a word for people like that too the word was genius potter didnt like using that word about jake featherston he still remembered the weight of the revolver hed carried up to the olympic swimming stadium intending to get rid of jake once for all but he hadnt hed got rid of the colored wouldbe assassin instead and the whole world was different on account of it he looked down at his butternut uniform he wouldnt have put that on again not in a million years here he sat analyzing reports from confederates in the usa who talked as if theyd grown up there the reports of course werent addressed war department richmond virginia csa somehow that might have made even the sleepy united states open eyes wide and perhaps raise an eyebrow instead the letters and telegrams had come to a variety of businesses scattered all over the confederate states they were all coded too so they didnt talk directly about barrels or aeroplanes not all the codes were particularly subtle but theyd defeat casual snoopers potter wished the reports could come straight to him as things were he got them anywhere from several hours to several days after they reached the csa as long as the united states and confederate states stayed at peace the delay didnt matter too much if they ever went to war he laughed at himself if the usa and the csa went to war again the only way letters and telegrams crossed the border would be through the international red cross he suspectedno he knewthey would be a lot slower than they were now he drummed his fingers on the desk took off his spectacles and carefully polished them replaced them on his nose and then did some more drumming however much he despised the usa he hoped another war wouldnt come the confederacy would be fighting out of its weight and all the more so because the united states had no second front against canada this time did jake featherston see that it seemed pretty plain to potter as far as he could tell from cautious conversations it seemed pretty plain to most of the officers in the war department the trouble was of course that featherston wasnt an officer and never had been one he was a jumpedup sergeant remarkably shrewd but not trained to look at the big picture how much would that matter if it really came to another fight the president would surely be shrewd enough to let trained commanders take charge of things potters musings were interrupted when a uniformed officernot a soldier he realized after a moment but a freedom party guardstrode up to his desk saluted and barked out freedom freedom potter echoed in more crisply military tones and what can i do for you ah chief assault leader the other officer wore a captains three bars on either side of his collar but party guards had their own titles of rank potter didnt know if they thought the armys werent good enough for them or if they thought those were too good it wasnt the sort of question he could ask not if he wanted to keep wearing his uniform and not one with a big p stenciled on the back sir i am ordered to bring you to the president at once the chief assault leader answered ordered are you well then youd better do it eh potter said pushing back his chair and stowing papers in a drawer that locked the freedom party guard nodded seriously clarence potter didnt smile hed been pretty sure a man who became a party guard wouldnt recognize irony if it piddled on his shiny black boots he asked do you know what this is about no sir the officer said i have my orders a motorcar is waiting outside he turned and marched machinelike toward the stairs potter followed at a more human amble the motorcar was a birmingham painted butternut it flew a freedom party flag though not the confederate battle flag an army vehicle would have sported potter and the stonefaced chief assault leader got in the driver also a freedom party guard whisked them away from the war department and up shockoe hill to the presidential residence a bodyguard there relieved potter of his pistol that was routine these days if the guard knew potter had once carried a pistol intending to use it on the president he gave no sign reporting as ordered sir potter said when the captainno the chief assault leadertook him into featherstons office formality helped if he spoke to the president of the csa he wouldnt have to thinkso muchabout the fiery foulmouthed artillery sergeant hed known during the war wouldnt have to think that the sergeant and the president were one and the same good to see you colonel sit down jake featherston replied returning the salute maybe he was using formality to suppress memory too as soon as potter was in the chair featherston waved to the party officer thatll be all randy you just run along close the door on your way out randy looked unhappy but he did what everybody seemed to do around featherston he obeyed the president turned back to clarence potter and got straight to business i need more from your people in kentucky sir potter needed a moment to shift gears featherstons scowl made him look like an angry hungry wolf kentucky he repeated impatiently things are heating up there and im going to want to know more about whats going on im going to want to be able to make things happen there too i havent got but a handful of men in kentucky mr president potter said my specialty is people who talk like yankees and thats not what we mostly use there because the accent is closer to our own men from tennessee dont stand out in kentucky the way they would in pennsylvania or kansas i know what youve got in kentucky featherston reeled off the names and positions of almost all of potters men in the state he wasnt looking at a list he knew them knew them by heart those names and supporting details had surely gone to him in one report or another but that hed remembered them clarence potter was more nearly flabbergasted than impressed at that grasp of detail i didnt know he had it in him he thought the president went on the point is three or four of your people are in slots with the state government or a city government where they can be useful to us because everybody reckons theyre yankees they can do some of that potter said cautiously but not too much if they dont act like what theyre supposed to be theyll make the real yankees wonder why they dont that wouldnt be good the last thing we want is to make the united states suspicious this time featherstons scowl was of a different sort potter had no trouble identifying it though it was the scowl of a man who wasnt used to people telling him anything he didnt want to hear well too damn bad the intelligence officer thought youre the one who brought me back into the army now you have to take the consequences im not one of your party hacks and youd better remember it you telling me you cant do what i need the presidents voice was harsh and dangerous potter shook his head no sir thats not what i said at all but i am asking you to make sure in your own mind that what you get now is worth the risk of losing a lot later on if the damnyankees start looking hard for confederate spies theyre bound to find some and if they find some theyll look for more and all right featherston held up a hand i see what youre saying but whats the point of having all these goddamn spies in place if we cant get any use out of em we do get use out of them potter said for all his grasp of detail jake featherston was missing the big picture here we get information without it were blind thats really what theyre there for as far as were concerned if they step out of their roles they may give themselves away featherston grunted his eyes showed his own hard suspicion regardless of whether his guards did he remembered the pistol in clarence potters pocket and he had to know why potter had had it there if we cant use our people to nudge things along there how the hell do we do it he snapped we can use our people the ones i run just arent the right set of tools for the job potter answered demonstrations riots stories in the papers wireless shows we can do all that about the most my men can do is pretend they havent seen telegrams things like that if they try to do much more the fellows they work for will start giving them fishy stares do you see what im saying he waited for jake featherston to blow as long as hed known him featherston had had a short fuse now the president of the csa didnt have anybody set above him to make him pull back if he wanted to lose his temper he could and who would say boo but potter had been as cool and dispassionate as he could and the president seemed to respond well to that or at least not to take it as a threat all right then he said well try that and see how it works i do want to leave your people in place on account of were not done with kentucky oh no were not done not by a long shot that state is ours and i aim to get it back clarence potter could have found any number of things about which to disagree with the president of the confederate states not about getting kentucky back though he stood came to attention and saluted yes sir he said flora blackford remembered when going out on the floor of congress had been a thrill it wasnt any more not these days the freedom party congressmen from houston and kentucky made sure of that they werent there to do the nations business they were there to disrupt it and they were good at that the pair of representatives utah had elected after the end of the military occupation werent much better they seemed more interested in complaining about what had happened over the past twentysometimes over the past sixtyyears than in trying to make the next two better congressman nephi pratt was complaining even as flora took her seat i accept your correction with all due humility mr speaker he was saying i would have been more fully abreast of these matters had the government not labored so long and hard to suppress my creed and oppress my state thereby depriving me of the opportunity to participate in the decisions made by this august body since the end of the war up jumped a young pepperpot democrat from new mexico perhaps the distinguished gentleman will state on the record in which direction he pointed a gun during the war at the foes of the united states or at her soldiers pratt was a portly man with a mane of white hair he tossed it angrily now i need not answer that you just did seems to me the democrat shot back mr speaker i resent the imputation pratt said mr speaker i resent having to share the chamber with a damned traitor the congressman from new mexico said bang bang bang the speakers gavel descended like the crack of doom mr pratt mr goldwater you are both out of order he said any further outbursts from either of you and i will have the sergeantatarms remove you from the floor the united states hanged my grandfather nephi pratt said i see things have not changed much since he had it coming by god congressman goldwater snapped bang bang bang sergeantatarms congressman cannon of missouri said the speaker looked thoroughly disgusted as he continued you and your assistants are to escort the two contentious gentlemen to separate waiting rooms in which places they shall remain until they see fit to comport themselves in civilized fashion congressman pratt left the room with majestic dignity congressman goldwater shouted defense of the truth is no vice i should not be removed he scuffled with the men who tried to take him away and landed one solid blow before they did all the freedom party men stood up and cheered at the chaos they for once had not created that made flora signal to the speaker a fellow socialist he pointed back intoning the chair recognizes the distinguished congresswoman from new york mrs blackford thank you mr speaker she waited till the din died down a little then said in my opinion the freedom party has been the source of most of the problems and most of the bad manners in both houses of congress even if members of other parties have caught the disease from it the freedom party she couldnt go on not right away for the house chamber echoed with angry shouts from the freedom party congressmen and cries of hear hear from socialists republicans and even a good many democrats speaker cannon again plied the gavel with might and main at last something like quiet returned flora resumed the freedom party as i was saying before its congressmen so neatly proved my point differs from other parties in the united states in one particular that its members do not truly wish to take part in the serious business of making this country a better place to her surpriseindeed to her amazementcongressman mahon of houston sprang to his feet crying mr speaker mr speaker if the distinguished congresswoman from new york will yield the sight of a freedom party man following proper parliamentary procedure must have astonished congressman cannon as much as it did flora mrs blackford the speaker asked i will yield for a brief statement or question flora said not for a harangue even that didnt upset mahon i will be brief he promised flora nodded the speaker pointed to the houstonian mahon said i would like to note that the freedom party representatives do not wish to serve our states here in philadelphia or in washington we this time shouts of shame drowned him out the speaker of the house rapped furiously for order with some reluctance he said the gentleman from houston has the floor he may continue thank you mr speaker mahon said willing to be courteous since the presiding officer of the house had ruled in his favor we dont care to be here i say because we would rather represent our states in richmond since they rightfully belong to the confederate states of america freedom freedom freedom his fellow freedom party members chanted and plebiscite plebiscite plebiscite roars of treason and never came from democrats republicans and some socialists again speaker cannon had to ply his gavel with might and main to restore quietor at least lower the noise he might have done better by firing a pistol round into the ceiling but if hed had a pistol other congressman would have too and they might have aimed them at one another the speaker said mrs blackford has the floor you may go on mrs blackford thank you mr speaker flora said however much pleasure most of us would take from no longer having the company of the members from the freedom party i am also certain more than a few of us would not care to give them the satisfaction of gaining anything they want simply because they have made themselves so obnoxious to us that brought jeers from the congressmen from houston and kentucky jeers largely drowned out by a storm of applause from representatives of other parties flora wasnt particularly proud of herself despite the applause she knew shed sunk to the freedom partys level in condemning it hosea wouldnt have done that she thought when hed been a congressman hosea blackford had got on well with everyonehed got on better with reactionary democrats than flora ever had but the men from the freedom party werent just reactionaries they were reactionaries on the march in the same way as the reds in the failed uprisings in the csa and russia had been radicals on the march up till the past few years the world hadnt had to worry about revolutionary reaction it did now wearily speaker cannon fought yet again for order when he finally got it he spoke in wistful tones do you suppose we could possibly return to discussion of the trade bill before us at the moment they did go on in due course the speaker let congressman pratt and congressman goldwater return to the floor they started sniping at each other again but withinsometimes narrowly withinthe rules of house decorum the freedom party congressmen from houston and kentucky went back to ignoring the rules as they usually did they cared nothing for them and admitted as much they didnt want to be here in the first place and seemed to operate on the theory that if they made all the colleagues hate and despise them their states became more likely to leave the usa for the csa what worried flora was that they might well prove right thanks to their unending shenanigansand thanks to the basically uninspiring nature of trade billsthe day crawled past on hands and knees speaker cannon didnt look for a motion to adjourn till well past six that evening when he did a throng of representatives tried to make it and another throng tried to second it wearily the members left the floor competition for cabs outside was as fierce as anything that had gone on within the hallowed hall flora normally polite and gentle brawled with the best of them she wanted to get home to joshua as fast as she could thanks to a judicious elbow she quickly won a ride her son looked up from his homework in surprise when she came through the door hello he said his voice at fifteen as deep as a mans i didnt expect you back so soon werent you going to do some office work before you came here the session ran long so i came floras voice trailed away also in surprisenot at what hed said but at what she smelled thats cigarette smoke when did you start smoking cigarettes last year not long after father died joshua answered resolutely nonchalant everybody at school does it and it doesnt hurt anything it hurts me that youve been sneaking cigarettes behind my back flora said if you thought i wouldnt mind why didnt you come out and tell me well her son looked uncomfortable but he finally said mostly because youre so oldfashioned about some things oldfashioned flora yelped if that wasnt the most unkind cut of all for someone whod always prided herself on her radicalism she couldnt imagine what would be i am not oh yeah joshua said a colloquialism that made his mother incline more toward reaction than radicalism he went on if you werent oldfashioned you wouldnt flabble about cigarettes as fifteenyearold boys are wont to do he acted monstrously proud of his own logic flora blinked at the slang then figured out what it had to mean i dont flabble about cigarettesfor grownups she said instead of seeming pleased that shed understood him joshua merely looked scornful that she was trying to speak his language she might have guessed he would suppressing a sigh she forged ahead no matter what you think youre not a grownup yet father was smoking cigarettes when he was fifteen joshua said he was right about that however much flora wished he werent your father grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere she answered when he was fifteen he was going to the bathroom in a privy bathing once a month and eating food his folks had cooked over buffalo chips do you want to imitate him there too for a moment she thought he would say bathing once a month didnt sound so bad but he visibly changed his mind and changed the subject if cigarettes are so terrible how come everybody smokes them not everybody does just about joshua said by which he doubtless meant three or four people he liked did this time flora didnt suppress her sigh she knew a losing fight when she saw one and she saw one here whether she liked it or not joshua was going to smoke she said from now on you dont need to sneak any more that made him happy she wished it would have made her happy too sylvia enos came out of the movingpicture theater with ernie she looked happyshed liked the film he didnt and hadnt what was wrong with it she asked it was exciting and it had a good love story what was wrong with it he echoed i will tell you what was wrong the men who made it never saw war they were boys in they had to be either that or they were cowards half the things in the film could not have happened soldiers would have gone to the guardhouse for the other half its only a story sylvia said its not supposed to be true but it pretends to be true ernie said that offends me she didnt want him angry when he got angry he got angry at the whole world not just at what had bothered him in the first place she said lets go somewhere and well have a couple of drinks and well forget about it all right he said that film deserves forgetting they ended up having more than a couple of drinksconsiderably more in ernies case then they went back to sylvias apartment mary jane was out with friends and wouldnt be back till late they had the place to themselves sober or drunk ernie made a conscientious lover he did what he needed to do to make sylvia happy then she tried to do the same for him shed had pretty good luck with that lately not tonight though try as she would nothing happened she did her best to make light of it saying see what those last couple of cocktails will do to you my cock has more wrong with it than cocktails ernie answered which was unfortunately true halfcocked he muttered that was what sylvia thought she heard anyhow he shook his head it is no good it is no goddamn good at all thats not true sylvia exclaimed it was fine just last week he didnt want to listen no good at all he said again sometimes i wonder why the hell i bother what is the use there is no use i know that i know that much too well dont be silly sylvia told him it can happen to anybody at all not just to you it does not happen to a real man ernie said that is what it means to be a real man and what am i his laugh told what he thought he was a leftover something from the scrap heap i ought to go to spain i could fight there a nationalist uprising backed by trance and britain had half the country up in arms against king alfonso xiii kaiser wilhelm had belatedly sent the monarchists weapons to resist their wouldbe overthrowers but things didnt look good for them even so sylvia shook her head what does shooting people have to do withthis she set her hand on the part or part of a part that hadnt quite worked ernie twisted away kicking the quilt shed got from chris clogston down onto the floor you do not understand i knew you would not understand damn you anyway he all but jumped out of the bed theyd shared and started putting on his clothes maybe i would understand if youd talk sense once in a while sylvia said you are only a woman what do you know ernie stormed out of the apartment slamming the door behind him sylvia sighed as she picked up the quilt and put on a nightgown this sort of thing had happened before it would probably happen again she sighed once more went into the bathroom to brush her teeth and then came back and fell asleep whatever time mary jane came in sylvia never heard it george jr his wife connie and their children came over for supper the next evening sylvia enjoyed spoiling her grandchildren bill the baby boy for whom mary jane had bought another quilt was toddling now sylvia also enjoyed listening to her sons stories about life on a fishing boat they took her back to the days when her husband had told the same kind of stories hard to believe george was more than twenty years dead hard to believe but true and how are you ma george jr asked hows ernie sis said you went to the cinema with him last night he sounded earnest himself the pun made sylvia laugh a little he wants me to be happy she thought he really does thats sweet but she had to answer hes been better she said slowly but hes been worse too her sons sigh had an indulgent quality one that made her wonder whod raised whom you really ought to he began sylvia held up a hand and cut him off i really ought to do whatever i think is the best thing for me to do and you really ought toshe enjoyed turning george jrs phrase back on himmind your own beeswax give up george connie said you dont let her tell you what to do how can you blame her if she doesnt want to let you tell her thats right sylvia beamed at her daughterinlaw fine i give up hereim throwing in the towel george jr took his napkin off his lap and tossed it into the middle of the table but im going to tell you one more thing before i shut up i know what youre going to say sylvia held up her hand again like a cop stopping traffic i dont want to hear it i dont care im going to say it anyway george jr stuck out his chin and looked stubborn that guy is bad news ma there im done about time too sylvia knew her son was right ernie was or could be bad news she would have known even if mary jane hadnt told her the same thing the feel of dangerwithin limitswas part of what made him attractive whether he would ever break those limits but he hadntquitein all the time sylvia had known him and he had reasons for being the way he was sylvia didnt think george jr knew about those she couldnt very well talk about such things with a man and especially not with her son she wondered whether george jr could keep from bringing up ernie again for the rest of the evening she would have bet against it but he managed that made time pass a lot more pleasantly only when he and his family were leaving did he say take care of yourself ma and havent i been doing that since before you were born sylvia said a fishermans wife who cant take care of herself is in a pretty sorry state thats all ive got to tell you she looked to connie am i right or am i wrong oh youre right all right her daughterinlaw said you bet i am sylvia spoke with great certainty fishermen were away at sea so much their wives had to do things on their own behalf if the wives didnt nobody would or could and sylvia had gone from fishermans wife to fishermans widow nobody gave a widow a helping hand shed discovered that the hard way for that matter no elves emerged from the walls to help her with the dishes she did them herself the way she always had she couldnt go to bed without being angry at herself till they were done her hardearned hardlearned selfreliance ran deep and when ernie showed up at her door with flowers two days later to ask her out the next saturday she didnt say no she didnt even ask him if he would behave himself a question like that would just have made him angry and all the more determined to act up she couldnt blame him for that not when she felt the same way herself when saturday came he took her to the union oyster house she smiled remembering her last visit there with mary jane unlike mary jane though ernie washed down his fried oysters with several stiff drinks are you sure you want to do that sylvia picked her words with care he did have more trouble in the bedroom when he was drunkand he had plenty when he was sober and when he was drunk he had a harder time coping with the trouble he had but he didnt want to listen to her tonight any more than shed wanted to listen to george jr earlier in the week i am fine just fine he said loudly the way he said it proved he was nothing of the sort but also proved he would pay no attention if she tried to tell him so if you cant lick em join em she thought and waved to the waiter for another drink of her own after another one and then another one yet she stopped worryingat any rate she stopped curingabout how many ernie had had though he kept pouring them down too she took him by the arm where shall we go she asked laughing at how bold and brassy she sounded we will go back to my place he answered and when we get there we will see what comes up that made sylvia laugh too though ernie wasnt joking the way another man might have in fact he seemed to be trying to persuade himself something would come up under his leer or perhaps stirred into it was enough desperation to give sylvia pause though she was a long way from sober herself maybe we ought to have some coffee or something first she said ernie took her arm come on he said and effortlessly hauled her up out of the booth he was very strong even if he didnt show it all the time she went along with him thinking the walk will sober him up it may even sober me up too her head still buzzed when they got to ernies apartment she didnt want to think about what it would feel like in the morning but the morning seemed a million miles away ernie closed the door behind them then took her in his arms and kissed her hard he tasted of whiskey and pipe tobacco he picked her up and carried her into the cramped little bedroom and half set half dropped her on the bed come on he said again and started taking off his clothes sylvia did the same quickly his strength and the whiskey in her and the taste and smell of him all combined to excite her if hed been any other man he would have thrown himself on her and done what he wanted to do but he couldnt he hadnt been able to do anything like that for more than twenty years if he was going anywhere she would have to get him there she sat up and leaned forward and took what there was of him in her mouth as he stood by the side of the bed and nothing happened he groaned again and again but always in frustration not release try as she would it was no use she did everything she knew how to do nothing helped sweat ran down his face down his chest damn you he muttered and then damn me she looked up at him what do you want she asked ill do anything you think will do you good you know i will shed turned on the lamp by the bed a little while before sometimes watching helped him not tonight he looked at her looked through her his eyes might have belonged to a dead man his voice sounded as if it came from the other side of the grave too it makes no difference not any more what do you mean she said of course it does next time well she broke off what are you doing the blued metal of the pistol he took out of the nightstand gleamed dully in the lamplight nothing matters any more he said and pointed it at the side of his own head no hed played such games before this time sylvia didnt think he was playing she grabbed for the pistol ernie cursed and hit her she tried to knee him in the crotch he twisted away they wrestled both of them shouting both of them swearing there on the bedroom floor loud as the end of the world the pistol went off she never knew whether hed intended to shoot her it made no difference it didnt matter the bullet tore into her chest and the world was nothing but pain and darkness as if from very far away ernie shouted sylvia dont die damn you i love you she tried to say something but blood filled her mouth from even further away she heard another shot and the thump of a falling body and then nothing nothing at all jefferson pinkard was not a happy man hed come to louisiana to help run a camp for political prisoners and what had they gone and done theyd taken out most of the politicals and filled the camp full of colored guerrillas the politicals had been sober civilized middleaged men who did as they were told the negroes on the other hand though pinkard didnt want to admit it even to himself the captured negroes scared him to death they had taken up arms against the confederate states not in hope of victoryas the colored reds had a generation earlier but because they simply couldnt stand the way things were now that theyd been taken prisoner they expected nothing from the men into whose hands theyd fallen they expected nothingand they were seldom disappointed camp dependable was a rougher place now than it had been when inoffensive politicals filled it these days guards always carried submachine guns they carried the weapons with safeties off and they always traveled in pairs in areas where prisoners went so far the blacks hadnt managed to steal a submachine gun from a guard jeff hoped that record would last he wondered if it could he had other worries too though not of the lifeanddeath sort just keeping track of the prisoners was a recordkeepers worst nightmare they didnt come into the camp with passbooks in the pockets of their dungarees he assumed most of the names they gave were false even had those names been genuine they wouldnt have helped much negroes in the csa had never been allowed to take surnames as they were in the usa with passbooks the powers that be didnt have too much trouble sorting out who was who without them the camp had an underofficer who specialized in taking fingerprints and forwarding them to baton rouge and to richmond for identification if the people in baton rouge and richmond had cared as much as pinkard did about matching those fingerprints to the ones in their files he would have been happier as things were he wasnt sure who most of his prisoners were the only thing he was sure of was that they had good reason for concealing their identity weve got to be careful dammit he would tell the guards every morning these nigger bastards dont want to argue with us like the politicals did they want to kill us thats why theyre here thing we cant do is give em the chance work parties that left the barbedwire perimeter of the camp made him especially nervous the blacks who went out on roadbuilding details and other hard labor were chained to one another they wore balls and chains on their left ankles they couldnt possibly run so jeff told himself he worried even so and it was all his baby when the politicals had gone off to another camp the warden at camp dependable had gone with them you made this place a going concern he told pinkard before he went away you know it best and that makes you best suited to keeping these black devils in line here maybe hed even been right regardless of whether he had jeff didnt love him and never would the thenwarden had had a choice between an easy job and a hard one hed taken the easy one himself and left the hard one to somebody else if hed fought in the war he would have sent patrols forward while he stayed in a nice safe dugout in his own trench line jeff had known officers like that hed despised them too higher rank fancier emblems on his collar tabs a bigger paycheck every month pinkard approved of all those things but he didnt approve of the way hed got them he checked the clock in his office half past five about time for the working party to come back pinkard heaved himself out of the swivel chair which creaked under his weight he headed for the front gate he always liked to watch the gangs come in if he could get a report on the spot he didnt give the guards a chance to come up with any lies he knew such things happened hed done the like himself and didnt want it done to him his timing was good he got to the gate two or three minutes before the work party returned the negroes clanked along slowed by their chains and the weights attached to their anklesand slowed also by doing work they didnt want to do and coming back to a place where they didnt want to be how did it go jeff called to the chief guard a stocky hardfaced man named mercer scott another day scott answered with a shrug he shifted a plug of tobacco and spat a stream of brown juice on the ground three niggers keeled over two of em croaked and we flung em in the swamp the other one got back up on his feet when we thumped him a couple times lazy bastard just wanted a break ill break his black ass he tries that kind of shit with me he spat again who died pinkard asked ive got to try and keep the records straight you know yeah yeah mercer scott screwed his face into a parody of deep thought one was that mincing little faggot named dionysus hes been poorly since that big buck beat him up last month and the other one hell who was the other one he turned to another guard who was the other nigger we pitched in the swamp bob the skinny bastard bob answered cicero thats his name oh yeah thats right i couldnt recollect if he was today or yesterday scott turned to jeff thats who it was all right dionysus and cicero no loss either one of em pinkard nodded and scribbled a note to himself the camp held several ciceros but only one of them was in this work gang so he wouldnt have any trouble with that he said good enough make sure the count matches then bring em on inside a mosquito lit on the back of his wrist he smashed it hell might have more mosquitoes than louisiana but he wasnt sure anyplace else did one by one the negroes counted off the reek of their unwashed bodies was harsh in pinkards nostrils the guards smelled nearly as ripe in this heat and humidity everybody stank one of pinkards aides pounded on the door to his quarters at half past twelve that night he woke up grabbing for his pistol nobody would bother him at that time of night for anything but trouble as far as he was concerned trouble came in two flavors escape and uprising what the hell he demanded throwing the door open in just his pajamas warden they need you at the front gate right away the aide said jeff shoved his feet into slippers and jammed his hat down onto his head so people would have some idea of who he was im coming he said what am i walking into i dont exactly know the aide answered and jeff wanted to clobber him with the pistol he went on theres folks from richmond there reckon theyll tell you what you need to know from richmond pinkards mind raced was he in trouble what kind of trouble could he be in he couldnt think of anything hed screwed up hed done his job here hed done it back in alabama too hed been a good freedom party man since the days just after the war and hed stayed in the party through the hard times after grady calkins shot president hampton hell hed broken up with his wife because emily was fooling around on him on nights when he went to meetings get out of my way goddammit he pushed past the aide and hustled to the gate none of the guards said a word about what he had on he could deal with them later when he was in proper uniform the men at the gate wore the regalia of freedom party guards highranking ones their cold hard faces would have scared the bejesus out of even a thoroughgoing son of a bitch like mercer scott you are jefferson pinkard one of them asked he didnt say anything about how pinkard was dressed either thats right jeff answered who thedevil are you chief assault band leader ben chapman the accent wasnt virginia it was alabama much like pinkards own i have a prisoner to deliver to this camp you are to acknowledge receipt you do i am pinkard said the party officer nodded well who the hell is he jeff asked testily and what are you doing bringing him here in the middle of the goddamn night orders chapman said as if orders were the most important thing in the world well maybe he had a point there and the prisoner ishe lowered his voice so pinkard could hear but the guards at the front gate couldnt a fellow by the name of willy knight holy jesus jeff exploded having the vice president of the csawell the former vice president after his resignation and imprisonment to say nothing of his impeachment and convictionin his prison camp was the last thing he wanted the responsibility if something went wrong and things were only too likely to go wrong didnt anybody tell you this here camp is full of niggers chief assault band leader chapman shrugged he had an athletes grace and an athletes watchful eyes too goddamn spooks deserve whatever happens to em he said and the goddamn son of a bitch we brought down here deserves whatever happens to him too nobody will say a word if he comes out of this place feet first that took a load off pinkards mind but still cautious he asked will you put that in writing nothing about this business goes down in writing chief assault band leader chapman said scornfully nothing except your name on the form that says we got knight here in one piece i might have known jeff muttered and chapman nodded as if to say yes you might have with a sigh the warden nodded too ill signas soon as i see him so i can make sure he is in one piece right ben chapman turned to his henchmen bring him on up the door to a motorcar at the edge of camp dependables lights opened and then slammed shut more freedom party guards hustled someone forward chapman pointed see for yourself he told pinkard it was willy knight jeff had seen him in birmingham on the campaign trail he was still tall and blond and still in a way handsome but where he had been full of piss and vinegar he was thin to the point of gauntness and suffering haunted his faceespecially the eyes go ahead and laugh he said to pinkard one of these days the son of a bitch will turn on you too shut up you bastard chief assault band leader chapman told him chapman thrust a clipboard and a pen at jeff youve seen him sign jeff did his men took charge of the fallen confederate hero and led him into the camp xiii hipolito rodriguez had never been a rich man he was reasonably confident he would never be a rich man but he was and always had been a proud man the confederate states were and always had been a proud nation and sonora and chihuahua were and always had been states where pride counted for even more than it did elsewhere in the csa a poor man who could hold his head up often gathered more respect than a rich man who could not meet his neighbors eyes when rodriguez brought his youngest son into baroyeca he strode along with pride unusual even for him pedro seemed a good deal more diffident than his fatheror maybe his feet hurt he had on the sturdy shoes hed got from the freedom youth corps he hadnt worn them much since getting out of the corps a few months earlier sandals were plenty good for farm work but he didnt want to seem like a peasant when he came into town they will make a man of you rodriguez said as he and pedro started up the main street toward the alcaldes residence i thought the freedom youth corps already did that his son replied he was taller than hipolito rodriguez and wider through the shoulders too like his brothers he spoke more english than spanish these daysexcept sometimes with his mother i have nothing bad to say about the freedom youth corps rodriguez told him but it is what its name says it is it is a thing for youths the army of the confederate states of america is a thing for men he hadnt thought about it that way when he was conscripted he remembered as much remembered very clearly but times had changed hed gone into the confederate army in the middle of the great war and been thrown straight into action first against red negroes in georgia and then against the usa in west texas his son would serve in peacetime with luck he would get his hitch out of the way and come back to the farm without ever firing a shot in anger rodriguez hoped so anyhow when you were shooting in anger the people on the other side had a nasty habit of shooting back he didnt know how hed come through the war unwounded luck no doubt luck and the virgin watching over him out of jaime diazs general store came felipe rojas when pedro saw the freedom youth corps drillmaster he automatically stiffened to attention right there in the middle of the street rojas smile showed several gold teeth you dont need to do that today pedro he said i dont give you orders any more just as well that he stay in practice hipolito rodriguez said ive brought him into town to report because hes been conscripted has he rojas eyes widened how the years do get on he would be old enough of course but still it hardly seems possible not so long since we had rifles in our own hands is it no indeed i was just thinking that rodriguez said of course theyd both had tredegars in their hands a lot more recently than theyd been mustered out of the army theyd shown the big landowners whod run things in sonora for so long that the freedom party was the new power in the land and that anyone who thought otherwise had better think again a soldier rojas slapped rodriguezs son on the back with a big hard hand hell do well what we showed him in the youth corps will help him and hes a fine young man yes im sure hell do very well indeed wed better go on to the alcaldes residence rodriguez said i wouldnt want him to get in trouble for reporting late no that wouldnt be the right way to start felipe rojas agreed he clapped pedro on the back again go with god and god go with you youll be fine i know you will show them what we taught you theyll build on that sн seсor gracias seсor pedro said proudly another youth and his father were also at the alcaldes residence he and pedro started chattering theyd gone to school together and served in the freedom youth corps together and now they were going into the army together rodriguez shook his head it hardly seems possible rojas had said and wasnt that the truth no matter how it seemed though it was the truth the years had a way of piling on whether you looked at them or not his son had to fill out most of the inevitable paperwork but there was plenty for hipolito too because pedro was of course under twentyone he signed his name a dozen times mostly without bothering to look at what he was signing more than half the forms were in english anyhow and he read it less well than he spoke it at last it was done essentially hed deeded his son to the confederate states he hugged pedro and kissed him on both cheeks be strong he said do what they tell you and be strong then he left the alcaldes residence in a hurry so neither the clerk there nor his son would see him cry he headed for la culebra verde if he wasnt entitled to drown some sorrows after giving his son to the army when could he not even magdalena would complain about that he hoped before he got to the green snake though a couple of young men hed never seen before came up to him they were both dirty and ragged and wearylooking one was barefoot the other wore a pair of sandals that had more patches than original shoe leather buenos dнas seсor the barefoot man said in spanish do you by any chance need someone to help you with your work no for i have three strong sons thank god rodriguez answered in the same tongue out of curiosity he switched to english do you know this language no seсor lo siento mucho the stranger said solamente espaсol rodriguez had expected nothing different dropping back into spanish himself he asked from which province in the empire of mexico do you come both newcomers in baroyeca looked alarmed the man with the patched sandals who was older and stockier than his friend replied you have made a mistake seсor like you we are citizens of los estados confederados bullshit rodriguez said in english they couldnt even understand that and he couldnt imagine a sonoran or chihuahuan who didnt he returned to spanish dont tell me lies do you think im too stupid to know the difference times are hard here but i know theyre worse south of the border the ragged men sighed in equally ragged unison that older fellow said very well seсor usted tiene razуn we have come from near mocorito in sinaloa province rodriguez nodded unsurprised sinaloa lay just south of sonora the other man went on we have to have work or we will starve so will our families if we cannot send them money it is as i told youi have no work for you to do rodriguez said if you keep looking though maybe you will find someone who does he waited to see what would happen next if the sinaloans were hungry enough desperate enough or maybe just stupid enough they might try to get his money without working if they did he aimed to fight back but their shoulders slumped and they went on down the street as they went they exclaimed about how fine and fancy everything was if that didnt prove they werent from the csa rodriguez couldnt think of what would he wondered if they would find someone whod pay them they werent the first men from the empire of mexico hed seen passing through baroyeca he was sure they wouldnt be the last even though the town now boasted electricity it was a backwater in sonora and sonora was a backwater in the csa by the standards prevailing farther south though even a confederate backwater seemed rich and bustling i have a dollar in my pocket he thought to those fellows that makes me a rich man god help them poor devils he walked into la culebra verde robert quinn sat at the bar drinking a bottle of beer hola seсor rodriguez he said what brings you to baroyeca this morning pedro reports to the confederate army today rodriguez answered i came in with him to fill out papers and to say goodbye congratulations to you and congratulations to him quinn said in his deliberate spanish this is a good time to be a young man in the confederate states we arent going to be pushed around any more rodriguez wasnt so sure whether that made this a good time or a bad one he almost said as much then he remembered the two men from sinaloa who thought times in the csa were better than those in the empire of mexico he spoke of them instead meanwhile sitting down beside the freedom party man and ordering a beer for himself quinn nodded more and more men keep coming north he said enough of them do find work to encourage others we are trying to tighten things at the border buthe shruggedit is not an easy job if they do work no one else will or no one else can i do not suppose it is so very bad rodriguez said sipping his beer but if they take jobs away from confederates that would not be good at all we have to take care of ourselves first quinn agreed after another pull at his beer hipolito rodriguez began to laugh quinn cocked his head to one side a quizzical look on his face what is the joke in other parts of the confederate states people worry the same way about sonorans and chihuahuans taking their jobs yes they do some not so much as they used to i do not think quinn answered seriously they have seen that people who come from these parts are good and loyal and work hard and they have seen that los mallates are the worst enemies the confederate states have yes rodriguez said the same thing in englishniggersjust to show he knew it in this country los mallates are nothing but trouble they have never been anything but trouble los estados confederados would be better off without them quinn waved to the bartender another beer for me rafael and another for my friend here as well he turned back to rodriguez it is because you understand this that you are a member of the partido de libertad is it after thinking that over rodriguez shook his head no i am sorry but no that is not the reason the bartender set the beers in front of his customers robert quinn gave him a quarter and waved away his five cents change after a sip that left foam on his upper lip he asked why then ill tell you why rodriguez drank from his beer too i joined the freedom party because it was the only one in sonora that didnt take me for granted you really wanted to have me for a member and you want vengeance against los estados unidos men from los estados unidos tried to kill me i have not forgotten i want vengeance against them too but if pedro fights them they will shoot back he took a big sip from his new beer life wasnt simple dammit ah yes the united states quinn said as if reminded of the existence of a nation hed forgottenand been glad to forget well my friend you are right about that every dog has its day but theirs has gone on for too long if we fight can we beat them rodriguez asked i am no general the freedom party man replied but i will tell you this if jake featherston says we can beat them then we can somewhere up aheadsomewhere not very far up aheadthe state of houston and the usa ended and the state of texas and the csa began colonel irving morrell bounced along in a command car bounced was the operative word too for the command cars springs had seen better years while the roads in these parts went from bad to worse however bad its springs might have been though its pintlemounted machine gun was in excellent working order morrell had carefully checked it before setting out if it hadnt been in excellent working order he wouldnt have got into the command car in the first place above the growl of the engine the driver a weatherbeaten private named charlie satcher said looks quiet enough it always looks quiet enough morrell answered then they start shooting at us satcher nodded big country he remarked really i hadnt noticed morrell said deadpan the driver started to say something caught himself and grunted out a little laughter instead it was a very big country indeed the horizon seemed to stretch for ever and ever the sun beat down out of a great blue bowl of a sky the only motion in the landscape was the tan trail of dust the command car had kicked up slowly dispersing in the breeze that and morrell suddenly swung the machine gun to the right and as suddenly took his hands off the triggers that was only a roadrunner loping through the dry brush with a lizards tail hanging out of the side of its mouth nothing but miles and miles of miles and miles charlie satcher said as if he were the first one ever to bring out the line not quite nothing morrell answered somewhere out there those freedom party fanatics are bringing guns and ammo into houston calling them fanatics made him feel better if he could paint them as villains even if only in his own mind he could do a better job of trying to deal with them when he wasnt thinking of them as fanatics he had to think of them as tough clever foes not all of them belonged to the freedom party nobody in the confederate states had much liked losing houston and not many people in houston liked being part of the usa either the people who did like it kept quiet if they didnt keep quiet their neighbors made them pay miles and miles of miles and miles satcher liked to hear himself talk again he wasnt wrong the confederates put up a few border checkpoints between texas and houston but only a few and they mostly cared about things passing into texas not things leaving it as far as they were concerned things passing from texas into houston didnt really cross a border if the united states felt otherwise then it was up to the united states to do something about it and the united states hadnt even with all the unresthell the outandout rebellionin houston the united states hadnt morrell understood why it would have cost too much in money and in men the usa would have had to put up barbedwire emplacements the whole length of the border and would have had to man them with an army it would have been almost like a trench line from the great war no government democrat or socialist had been willing to do the work or deploy the manpower and so the border remained porous and so rebellion went right on simmering all that unhappy musing flew out of morrells head the moment he spotted a plume of dust not much different from the one his command car was kicking up this one though was coming from the east and heading west heading straight into houston he had every reason to be where he was and doing what he was doing did that other auto fat chance he thought he tapped charlie satcher on the shoulder you see that he said pointing the driver nodded sure as hell do colonel what do you want to do about it stop the son of a bitch morrell answered he may not want to stop satcher observed i know morrell reached for the machinegun triggers we have to persuade him he does want to after allhe just doesnt know it quite yet persuade him the drivers grin showed a broken front tooth right you are sir he turned toward the motorcar that was raising the other dust trail excitement flowered in morrell he was going into action all on his own hed seen plenty of action in houston much of it brutal and unpleasant armored warfare against people who flung featherston fizzes couldnt very well be anything but brutal and unpleasant this though this seemed different this was fox and hound cat and mouse it was out in the open too nobody could fling a bottle of flaming gasoline from a window and then disappear before long whoever was in the other motorcar spotted the one that held morrell and his driver whoever he was he kept on coming maybe that meant he was an innocent though what an innocent would be doing sneaking over the border was beyond morrell more likely it meant he hadnt recognized the command car for what it was as the two machines got closer morrells driver said theyve got a lot of people in thereand whats that one bastard sticking out the window a muzzle flash said it was a rifle nothing hit the command carnot for lack of effort morrell was sure which side of the border is he on do you think he asked if hes shooting at me hes on the side where i can shoot back satcher answered without hesitation i like the way you think morrell said the fellow with the rifle in the other motorcar fired again this time a bullet slammed into the command car it must not have hit anything vital because the machine kept running and no steam or smoke or flame burst from its innards morrell squeezed the machine guns triggers brass cartridge cases flew from the breech and clattered down around his feet tracers guided the stream of bullets towards and then into the other motorcar smoke immediately poured from its engine compartment it skidded to a stop the doors on the far side flew open several men got out and ran a bullet knocked one of them down another man shot at morrell from behind the automobile morrell hosed bullets back at him the motorcar caught fire the rifleman had to pull away from it that made him an easier target down he went too and once the auto started burning it didnt want to stop as soon as the flames reached the passenger compartment ammunition started cooking off some of the rounds were tracers they gave the fire a fourth of july feel ha charlie satcher said they were running guns did you expect anything different morrell asked the driver shook his head a bullet cracked past morrells head that wasnt one from the fireworks display in the motorcarit had been deliberately aimed he ducked not that that would have done him any good had the round been on target hed known only a handful of men who could go through a fire fight without that involuntary reaction it wasnt cowardice just human nature he tapped the driver on the back and pointed go around there and give me a better shot at that fellow right satcher steered the car in the direction morrell indicated the rifleman from the auto coming out of texas scrambled away trying to keep the burning vehicle between the command car and himself that scramble proved his undoing he was behind the trunk when either the fire or one of the rounds going off in the passenger compartment reached what the men from texas had been carrying there the explosion sent flaming chunks of motorcar flying in all directions one slammed down about a hundred feet in front of the command car satcher almost rolled it steering clear no more aimed shots came though morrell needed a little while to be sure of that because rounds did keep cooking off every now and then with a poppoppop that would have been merry if he hadnt known what caused it he got a look at the texan whod been shooting at him and wished he hadnt the rear bumper had torn off the mans head and his left arm the grim sight didnt unduly upset his driver for all i care they can bury the bastard in a jam tin satcher said either that or leave him out for the buzzards if i was a buzzard id sooner eat skunk any day of the week his words seemed to come from a long way off firing the machine gun left morrells ears temporarily stunned he hoped the stunning was temporary anyhow some of it probably wasnt he knew he didnt hear as well as he had when he was younger would he go altogether deaf in another ten or twenty years he shrugged not much he could do about that it wasnt the rarest ailment among soldiers sir charlie satcher said what is it morrells own voice seemed distant too i heard you had balls the driver answered the guy who told me though he didnt know the half of it morrell shrugged the motion told him how tense his shoulders had got in the fire fight he didnt think of himself as particularly brave when the shooting started he didnt think much at all reaction took over they started it charlie he answered yeah satcher said admiringly and you sure as hell finished it i wonder which side of the border were on morrell shrugged again doesnt matter much not when their auto went up like that nobody can say they werent running guns into houston damn well better not try the driver said me i thought i was gonna shit myself when that goddamn back seat landed in front of us back seat is that what it was morrell said charlie satcher nodded morrell managed a laugh ive got to tell you i didnt notice i was busy just then you did a hell of a job getting around it i noticed that neither one of us wouldve been real happy if i hit it satcher said morrell couldnt very well argue with that the driver asked shall we head on back to lubbock sir i think wed better morrell replied i want to report to general macarthur and hell want to report to the war department i suppose theyll report to the president or maybe to the state department somebody will have to figure out how loud we squawk squawk hell satcher said we dont scream our heads off they deserve to roll like that last confederate fuckers morrell only shrugged i wont tell you youre wrong but the people in philly are liable to because i can tell you what richmonds going to say richmonds going to say they didnt know anything about these fellows they didnt have anything to do with them and they arent responsible for them my ass charlie satcher said succinctly now that you mention it yes morrell agreed and the driver laughed but morrell went on you know its crap i know its crap and jake goddamn featherston knows its crap too but how do you go about proving its crap screw proving it satcher said blow the bastards to hell and gone anyway i do like the way you think morrell said brigadier general abner dowling remembered george armstrong custer there had been timesa great many timeswhen dowlings dearest wish would have been to forget entirely the officer whose adjutant hed been for so long things didnt seem to work that way though all those years with custer had marked him for life scarred him for life he would have been inclined to say in his less charitable moments this was one of those days when dowling thought of custer nowadays he thought of the general after the great war when custer had come back to philadelphia to fill an office and count corks and write elaborate reports on the best deployment of paper clips in the us army with nothing real nothing important to do custer had wanted to jump out of a window dowling often thought the only thing that stopped him was his offices being on the ground floor and now dowling knew exactly how his superior had felt since coming back from salt lake city after the occupation of utah ended hed filled an office and written elaborate reports on the best way to transport rubber bands to combat units that was how it seemed anyhow he was on the shelf and he was damned if he knew how to get off again if he was going to be stuck in philadelphia hed hoped the war department might at least channel reports of what was going on in utah through him hed spent a lot of yearsa lot of thankless yearsin the state he wondered if winthrop w webb was still in business or if the mormons had figured out who webbs real bosses were and arranged an accident for him try as dowling would he couldnt find out somebody in the war department was surely tending to affairs in utah whoever it was it wasnt dowling he couldnt even find out who it was the only thing his efforts to find out got him was a visit from lieutenant colonel john abell the more dowling saw the general staff officer the less he liked him even though abell had been the one whod told him hed made generalofficer grade the man was slim and paledownright bloodless in fact had the us army been made up of ghosts rather than men he would have been one of the handsomest ones in it as things were he made dowling want to turn up the heat in the office even though the day was warm sir you have been poking your nose into matters that do not concern you abell said we discourage that we you have a tapeworm dowling wondered he remembered irving morrell talking about abell during the war at the time hed been sure morrell was exaggerating now he found the other man had been speaking the gospel truth he eyed the general staff lieutenant colonels lean pallid countenance and picked his words with care i dont believe utahs affairs can fail to concern me not when i was there so long if the war department feels otherwise why should you disagree lieutenant colonel abell inquired because if i had anything to do with utah i could be useful to the department dowling answered with what people have me doing nowi mean not doing nowim useless useful is better dont you trust the judgment of your superiors as to what is useful and what is not abell asked silkily by the way spoke he might have been one of those superiors even if dowling outranked him general staff officers dowling thought scornfully and tried not to let his annoyance show even if abell had a lower grade he enjoyed much better connections and so still speaking carefully dowling said a quartermaster sergeant could do most of what ive been doing since i came back here whereas ive got some specialized knowledge no sergeant can match using me without using that knowledge is inefficient possibly abell said which meant he wasnt about to admit it a pleasure talking to you he got to his feet and started for the door with a hand on the knob he turned back you know colonel morrell dont you oh yes dowling nodded we worked together on the breakthrough that took nashville that might have been impolitic since the breakthrough had violated war department doctrine on how to use barrels dowling didnt much care since it had also gone a long way toward making the confederates throw in the towel how interesting lieutenant colonel abell said with a smile that displayed a lot of expensive dentistry and then silent as a specter he was gone dowling wondered if he ought to have his office exorcised hed hoped abells questions would lead to something better in the way of work for the next couple of weeks his hopes were disappointed he read about irving morrells encounter with gun runners on the border between texas and houston in the newspapers nobody in the war department asked him about it in any official way he wondered why abell had bothered confirming that they were acquainted the better to blackball me he thought but somewhat to his surprise he did see the general staff officer again when john abell next appearedmaterializedin his office the lieutenant colonels face bore a smile that seemed less than perfectly friendly so you are friends with colonel morrell are you abell said a note of challenge in his voice and youve done the same sort of work have you dowling hadnt said he was friends with morrell he admired morrells talent what morrell thought of him he wasnt nearly so sure but sensing that a yes would annoy lieutenant colonel abell more than a no he nodded defiantly and said thats right very well brigadier general dowling in that case i have some orders for you abell spoke as if washing his hands of him to dowling anything would have been better than what he was doing now and those orders are he asked eagerly abell heard that eagerness it made him blink by the fruit salad on his chest hed stayed in philadelphia through the great war he no doubt thought his role more important than those of soldiers who actually went out and fought the enemy too he might even have been right but dowling didnt care to dwell on that sir you will be sent to kentucky he said now your duty there will be similar to colonel morrells in houston you will help control agitation against the government of the united states this does also relate to your experience in utah would you not agree yes id say thats true dowling answered cautiously youre coming as close as you can without a real war to sending me into combat arent you isnt that what you wanted abell asked with sardonic satisfaction but that satisfaction slipped when dowling gave him another yes instead of a no saying you bet it is ive wanted to get into the field for years they wouldnt take me away from utah when we fought the japs dammit well youre going to get your wish lieutenant colonel abell plainly thought he was out of his mind when do i leave dowling asked where exactly do i go all over kentucky or somewhere in particular i dont have the precise details yet abell said i assure you they will be passed on in good time in the meanwhile you are to continue with the duties you have already been assigned thank you so much dowling said sourly the general staff officer took no notice of his tone which might have been just as well abell departed with a salute that mocked military courtesy instead of reinforcing it now dowling was the one who ignored the slight he would have ignored not only a slight but a large if that meant escaping from philadelphia knowing the speed at which the war department moved he expected in good time to mean a month or six weeks in reality he got his orders eleven days after lieutenant colonel abells visit on reflection he was less surprised than at first glance the military bureaucrats in war department headquarters were probably as glad to see him gone as he was to go hed been general custers righthand man after all and custer and the war department had got along like rattlesnake and roadrunnerand whod ended up eating whom was anybodys guess he was on a train the next day bound for kentucky he could have left philadelphia even sooner if hed wanted to take an airliner he was content to stay on the ground when he was a boy thered been no such things as airliners when he was a boy thered been no such things as aeroplanes or airplanes as he saw the word spelled more and more often in newspapers and magazines if one of them could carry two dozen people in reasonable comfort three or four times as fast as a train or a motorcar ran thats nice dowling thought in an emergency he would have flown without an emergency no for one thing trains boasted dining cars nothing hed heard about food on airliners tempted him to sample it the meals aboard the pennsylvania railroads cincinnati limited on the other hand fully measured up to dowlings exacting standards he was sorry to have to leave the train and cross the ohio into kentucky it was late afternoon when a driver took him from cincinnati over the bridges across the river and into covington a long line of northbound autos waited to cross the bridge whats their trouble dowling asked they have to be searched sir the driver answered youre new here arent you we dont want those freedom party bastards running guns and explosives up into the real united states the real united states those four words spoke volumes dowling had ordered such precautions himself in utah he hadnt thought they would be necessary here but maybe hed been naive youre new here arent you that spoke volumes too this game was being played for keeps no one fired at his motorcar on the way to the local army encampment no one fired but he got plenty of hints he was in hostile country just the same the graffiti shouted freedom or csa they showed either a blue or a red st andrews cross quick takes on the confederate battle flag and the freedom party banner based on it in utah the occupation authorities would have cracked down on people who scribbled such things in utah though the occupation authorities had been the only formal power in the land here here there was also the state governmentand that was in the hands of the freedom party the army faced an uphill fight it hadnt had to worry about farther west you want to hear something funny sir the driver said as the greengray ford pulled up in front of boq i dowling answered most sincerely would love to hear something funny you know who our biggest backers here are the soldier asked from everything i saw i wondered if we had any backers here dowling said oh we do sir theres one bunch of folks in this townone bunch of folks in this whole goddamn statewhod do anything in the world for us anything at all thats the niggers they dont want one goddamn thing to do with the confederate states and can you blame em not me dowling admitted but he couldnt see how theyd help much either a chilly nasty rain fell on augusta georgia scipio didnt like the rain he had to put on a long coat and rubber overshoes and to carry an umbrella to protect the tuxedo he had to wear at the huntsmans lodge newsboys hawking their papers doubtless liked the rain even less they got their copies of the constitutionalist wrapped in yellow wax paper but it didnt always keep them dry customers who bought a newspaper with the consistency of bread soaked in milk were apt to say unkind thingsand to demand a fresh copy without forking over another five cents election today the newsboys shouted from under their umbrellas president featherston seeking second term scipio didnt buy a paper why would he want a constitutionalist when jake featherston was violating everything the confederate constitution had stood for since before the first shot was fired in the war of secession oh featherston had rammed through the amendment that let him run again but so what even a blind man could see that was a putup job and even a blind man could see the election was a putup job too yes the whigs and the radical liberals had nominated candidates but they had only a slightly better chance of winning than scipio would have if hed run against the incumbent president the freedom party dominated the wireless web and the newspapers the other candidates got only brief and unflattering mention despite the rain freedom party stalwarts prowled outside polling places freedom party officials would count most of the votes jake featherston wouldnt lose with a snort scipio walked past another newsboy as if elections applied to him or the likes of him anyway hed never had any choice in who ruled the confederate states and he never would he wondered how many of the black men whod earned the franchise fighting for the csa in the great war still had the nerve to try to use it he also wondered how many of those who tried succeeded not many and even fewer unless he missed his guess as usual he got to the huntsmans lodge in good time he shed the coat and galoshes with sighs of relief and hung the umbrella on a peg so it dripped down onto the rug in a hallway then he went into the kitchen to remind himself of the days specials at least this was tuesday not monday they wouldnt be making specials out of whatever hadnt moved over the weekend evening xerxes jerry dover said how are you tolerable suh scipio told the manager is tolerable how you is not bad dover answered can we talk a little yes suh what you want scipio did his best not to sound too alarmed whenever a boss said something like that it usually meant trouble dover said youre a hell of a good worker xerxes dont get me wrong you read and write and cipher better than most white men i know what i want to ask you is do you have to talk the way you do this heah onliest way i knows how to talk scipio answered that of course wasnt true as bathsheba could have testified if he hadnt been able to sound like an educated white man they and their children would have died in the riots after the freedom party took power but if he talked that way without direst need some white man or other who heard him would connect his voice with the marshlands plantation and anne colletonwhereupon very shortly he would be dead would you be willing to take lessons jerry dover asked not knowing he could have given them instead once upon a time i try dat scipio lied it dont do no good i still sounds like dis i could make it worth your while dover said menander the headwaiters going to retire before too longhes been sickly for a while now you know youd be the perfect fellow to take his placeif you didnt talk like such a nigger everything else i know you can do it but you got to sound better scipio wondered if he could fake the lessons and end up sounding a little better than he did now but not a lot he had his doubts dover wasnt wrong unless he sounded like a collegetrained white which the restaurant manager didnt know he could do at all he sounded like someone whod come straight from the swamps by the congaree that wouldnt do for a headwaiter compromise between the two dialects he saw none he also saw danger in sounding even a little like the way he had at marshlands he couldnt afford to be recognized not after hed been a spokesman for the congaree socialist republic hed been coerced into playing that role but who would care no one at all and so not without regret he said reckon i better stay where i is dover exhaled angrily dammit wheres your getupandgo and if you tell me it got up and went ill kick your ass so help me hannah he might have meant it literally scipio shrugged sorry mistuh dover suh you is a good boss he meant that but you gots to see i never want to be nobodys boss atall all right all right dammit why didnt you say that sooner jerry dover remained disgusted but he wasnt furious any morenow he faced something he understood or at any rate something he thought he did ive seen it before you dont want to play the white man over your own people is that it yes suh scipio said gratefully dat just it there was even some truth in what he said he hadnt wanted to open up his own cafe in the terry for exactly that reason hed told other negroes what to do for years in his role as butler at marshlands and hadnt cared for it a bit it was less important to him than his other reason for turning the manager down but it was there dover said if you want to know what i think i think youre a damn fool somebodys got to do it why not you instead of somebody else especially why not you if you feel that way wouldnt you make a better boss than some other buck who did it just to show what a slave driver he could be he was shrewd he was very shrewd in fact to use that last argument and to contrast scipio who remembered slave drivers with one if not wanting to boss other blacks had been the only thing troubling scipio the restaurant manager might have persuaded him as it was he shrugged again and said mebbedisagreeing too openly with a white man wasnt smart either his boss knew what that mebbe meant dover waved him away go on go to work then id fire some people for telling me no but youre too good to lose if you dont want the extra money i wont pay you with a sigh of relief scipio went into the dining room tonight he felt much better about dealing with customers than with his own boss the huntsmans lodge was not the sort of place that kept a wireless set blaring away while people ate but he got his share of the news anyway sure enough jake featherston was easily winning a second term all the whites in the restaurant seemed happy about it every so often somebody at one table or another would call out freedom and glasses would go high in salute no one asked scipios opinion he didnt offer it and wouldnt have if asked he did pocket some larger tips than usual as often happened when people were happy the rain had stopped by the time he headed for home a little past twelve hed gone about half a block from the restaurant when a rattling wheezing birmingham pulled up to the curb alongside of him a young black man got out he and scipio eyed each other for a moment scipios heart thudded in his chest all too often negroes stole from other negroes not least because whites cared little about that kind of crime but then the youngster grinned disarmingly you aint never seen me grandpa you know what im sayin you aint never seen this here motorcar neither was he fooling around with someone elses woman that was the first thing that occurred to scipio no the second for that grandpa rankled still if the required price was no higher he could meet it aint never seen who he said peering around as if someone invisible had spoken he got another grin for that in the groove grandpa somebody talkin to me again scipio pretended not to see the man right in front of him then he started back down the street toward the terry behind him the young negro laughed he walked warily even so ready to run in case the other fellow came after him but nothing happened the man whod parked the birmingham might have forgotten all about him by the time he woke up the next morning hed just about forgotten the young man bathsheba who had to go to her cleaning job much earlier than he needed to leave for the huntsmans lodge was heading out the door when an explosion tore through the morning air do jesus scipio exclaimed the windows rattled and shook he thought they might break but they didnt what was that antoinette asked that was somethin blowin up scipio said heavily mebbe it was an accident but mebbe it was a bomb too oh sweet jesus whod want to blow things up bathsheba burst out aint we seen enough sufferin out she went shaking her head when scipio headed for work later that day he had to take a detour to get to the huntsmans lodge he got a glimpse of the street where the bomb had gone off the building closest to where it went off had fallen down windows or pieces of faзade were missing from several others it wasnt till he looked down the street from above the huntsmans lodge that he realized just where the explosion had taken place you aint never seen me that grinning young negro had said you aint never seen this here motorcar neither nobody would ever see it again scipio was sure of that how much dynamite had it held enough more than enough even here a good long block from where the bomb had gone off there were bloodstains under scipios shoes how many dead how many hurt plenty he could see that do jesus he said again only shards of glass jagged as knives remained in the windows of the huntsmans lodge the door had a jagged hole in it as scipio started to go in a policeman barked let me see your passbook boy he handed it over the policeman matched the photograph and his face then gave it back you work here yes suh scipio said is a waiter you kin go ask mistuh dover suh never mind the grayuniformed cop said impatiently you see anything funny when you went home last night anything at all that wasnt regular scipio looked at him he wore a freedom party pin next to his badge no suh the black man answered i didnt seen nothin i didnt see nobody jus go home an mind my business the policeman snarled in frustration somebody must have dammit we catch the son of a bitch who did this hell be begging to die before were through yes suh scipio repeated in studiously neutral tones kin i go to work suh the cop didnt say no scipio walked into the huntsmans lodge without another word with their third socialist president in office with a socialist working majority in both houses of congress the united states should have been a country where labor had the advantage on capital they should have been as chester martin had bitterly discovered they werentand nowhere was that truer than in los angeles when construction workers picketed a site goons often came out in force to break up their picket lines the cops backed the goons so did the newspapers as far as the los angeles times was concerned strikers were red revolutionaries who deserved hangingshooting was too good for them chester remembered the days of the steelmill strikes in toledo next to this those had been good times that to him was a genuinely frightening thought but it was also true back in toledo hed had a feeling of solidarity with his fellow strikers a feeling that their hour was come round at last theyd been doing something epochmaking winning strikes that had always been lost before paving the way for socialist victories at the polls that had never been seen before what was another strike nowadays just another strike some were won more were lost nobody except the immediate partiesand the timesgot very excited about most of them and even the immediate parties didnt always bother the strikes put chester in mind of some of the later battles on the roanoke river front during the great war they would tear up the landscape and cause a lot of damage and pain to both sides but things wouldnt change much no matter who won either way the next fight on the same ground would loom around the corner when he said as much to rita one morning before heading out to the latest picket line she frowned that wasnt what you told me when you first led the construction workers out on strike she said then you thought you were doing something worth doing something important i know he tried to recapture the feeling of outrage the feeling of urgency hed had then it wasnt easy it was after more than a year next to impossible too much has happened since and not much of it good have we got enough money for groceries this week his wife nodded and for the rent when the first rolls around youre making as much as an agitator as you ever did building houses swell he said when i build a house though ive got something to show for it something i can see something people can live in same when i was making steel once i was done it was there it was real i dont even know that im doing any good by agitating plenty of people arent making as much money now as they were before we started striking they will though theyll make a lot more if you get your just demands a solid socialistmore solid than chesterrita assumed the demands were just hed been sure of that at the beginning of the strikes he wasnt sure of anything any more he shook his head he was sure of one thing he had to get out the door to get to the picket line by the time the construction crew got to the site some of the workers were leery of crossing picket lines and the ones who were were usually the real builders the men who knew what they were doing half the time the scabs the contractors hired to take strikers places couldnt tell a chisel from a braceandbit chester wouldnt have wanted to live in a house put up by such halftrained workers the sun hadnt risen december days in los angeles were longer than they were in toledo but sunrise still came late and by los angeles standards it was cold it had dropped down into the forties chester martin found the idea that that could be chilly laughable he wore a denim jacket over a cotton shirt and a pair of dungarees he might have put on the same outfit in april in toledo in december he would have frozen to death with it but his real coldweather gear had sat at the back of the closet for years hed finally given most of his winterweight coats and heavy wool mufflers to the salvation army he didnt think he would ever need to wear that kind of outfit again he had to watch where he was going as he made his way down to the trolley stop one thing where toledo beat los angeles hollow was street lights they were few and far between here whole neighborhoodshis for instancedid without them altogether long winter nights made that especially noticeable street lights or not the southbound trolley came on time chester tossed his nickel in the fare box and bought a couple of transfers too he rode down toward the suburbs where most of the building was going on right now dawn came as he rattled along it was a leaden dawn the sky full of gray clouds he wondered if it would rain that would shut things down better than any picket line probably not though even by los angeles standards had been a dry year torrance where he got off reminded him of gardena the little town to the north of it where hed started building houses after coming to california groves of figs and walnuts and oranges and lemons and alligator pears still flourished truck gardens many of them run by farmers from japan shipped strawberries and lettuce and carrots and other produce to half the country thanks to refrigerated freight cars and here and there clusters of houses with clapboard sides mostly painted white sprouted among the greenery at the site where the picket line went up the houses were still sawdustsmelling wooden skeletons strike headquarters was a big tent on a vacant lot two blocks away four or five burly men guarded the tent day and night contractors had tried to get the police to remove it but the man who owned the lot was a good socialist and wouldnt swear out a trespassing complaint one of the guards tipped his battered fedora to chester mornin he said pot of coffees going inside you want a cup good deal chester said any trouble all the guards shook their heads not a bit answered the one whod spoken before bastards dont bother anybody they figure hell fight back this time all of his friends nodded that wasnt true the class enemies and their lackeys werent cowards they defended their interests no less earnestly than proletarians things would have been easier if they hadnt chester said nothing about that why hurt the guards morale he just ducked into the tent sure enough a coffeepot perked above the blue flame on some canned heat several not very clean cups sat on a card table nearby hed drunk from far worse during the war there was a sugar bowl but no cream sugar would do he poured himself a cup quickly drained it and took a picket sign it said shame and unfair to workers so it could be used in almost any strike the handle was a good solid piece of wood tear off the sign and it turned into a formidable bludgeon shouldering the sign martin went back outside another picket was walking across the lot toward the tent morning john chester called morning john answered chilly today you say so chester smiled no he didnt think hed ever get used to los angeles notions about weather he had a good picket line in place around the houses under construction before many workers started showing up some turned away as if glad for an excuse not to go to work others squared their shoulders and crossed the line the pickets showered them with abuse they had to watch what they said some of the scabs could have been plainclothes cops general curses and insults were all right threats like we know where you live or wait till you get off work could land a man in jail on an assault charge lawyers were expensive using them drained a strike fund in a hurry around and around and around in a field across the street crows and brewers blackbirds with golden eyes pecked for worms and bugs and seeds hammers started banging at the construction site the pickets cursed scabs they shouted around and around and around halfway through the morning a whitehaired sunbrowned man in a windbreaker fell into step with chester the man was missing most of two fingers from his right hand what the hell you want mordechai martin asked to talk with you if you care to talk the foreman answered some of this mess is my fault maybe i can help fix it decent chopsuey joint around the corner and a block and a half down ill buy you lunch if youll let me chester considered the exnavy man was a pretty good guy even if he had sold out to the exploiters ill eat with you chester said i wont let you buy for me deal mordechai said at once and no sneaking in more scabs at lunchtime the way you guys have done before martin said mordechai nodded chester studied him if he was a liar he was a fine one chester nodded too all right well do that at noon they walked to the chopsuey place together it wasnt bad martin had certainly had worse he ate without saying much if mordechai wanted to talk he could talk after a while he did how can we settle this i flew off the handle and people have paid for it all over town you can have your job back no trouble there same with most of the people on your side if you wouldve said that then idve slobbered all over you idve been so happy now chester shook his head if i give in now i sell out my pals i cant do that the people you work for have got to recognize that the unions come to los angeles we dont want the moon but theyve got to bargain with us and theyve got to do it in good faith mordechai frowned he ate another forkful of strange vegetables and bits of fried meat if you think theyll recognize the union thats wanting the moon and the stars to boot with a shrug chester answered i figured youd say that so what the hell have we got to talk about well go on with the class struggle and see how this round comes out oh dont give me that socialist crap mordechai said impatiently it isnt crap chester set his jaw it works if it worked in the steel mills in toledo itll work here too how do you like being a scab mordechais weathered features darkened with anger dont you call me that well what else are you im a foreman and im a damn good one too by god pride rang in mordechais voice i never said you werent chester answered youre a damn fine foremanmost of the time but that doesnt mean youor some prick whos a foreman toocan act like jesus christ on roller skates whenever you want thats why we need a union despite his mutilated hand mordechai ate faster than chester did he finished lunch and pushed his chair back from the table afraid you were right he said this was just a waste of time youre not going to win this strike though you know you cant they said that in toledo too they were wrong there and youre wrong now sooner or later a construction outfit will decide theyd rather not have all this trouble and theyll give us a contract we can live with dont hold your breath mordechai advised he tossed down a quarter the silver coin rang sweetly he walked out chester set his own quarter beside it and also headed back to the halfbuilt tract the strike would go on january in the north atlantic tested a ships construction the endless storms and enormous seas tested a mans construction too the uss remembrance handsomely passed the test sam carsten wasnt so sure about his own innards he had a good stomach but the endless rolling and pitching started to make him feel as if he were riding a horse that hadnt been broken and he had to strap himself to his bed every night to keep from winding up on the deck he always hated that it needed doing though one sailor who slept in a top bunk forgot the strap and broke his arm when he fell out to add insult to injuryin the most literal sense of the wordsthe captain busted him to ordinary seaman too sam didnt suppose hed lose officers rank if he pulled a rock like that but he didnt care to find out either he was up and about when general quarters came getting to his station in the bowels of the remembrance without breaking his neck was an adventure in this kind of weather but he did it he cussed most of the way there though the skipper had to be in an especially nasty mood to order general quarters in seas like this it was bound to be just a drill too the united states werent at war with anybody besides at the moment the carrier wasnt anything more than an oversized light cruiser anyhow no way in hell she could launch her airplanes in seas like this that left her with guns to defend herself and she didnt pack a whole lot of firepowernot that kind of firepower lieutenant commander pottinger arrived at their station at the same time as sam did panting he asked do you think its true lieutenant do i think whats true sir sam asked in turn he was panting too hed been in the navy thirty years now these mad dashes werent so easy as they had been once upon a time why the captain called the general quarters pottinger answered i cant begin to tell you sir sam said i just heard the hooter and ran like hell what do you know i ran like hell too the head of the damagecontrol party said some men heading the other way said wed spotted a royal navy ship or maybe a royal navy squadron i heard the same thing sir a sailor named szczerbiakowicz said damned if i know whether its true but i heard it did you eyechart carsten used szczerbiakowiczs universal nickname nobody but another pole could have hoped to pronounce his real one sam turned to lieutenant commander pottinger if thats so sir you think the limeys mean trouble i couldnt begin to tell you pottinger replied but i think maybe the skipper thinks they might yes sir does seem that way doesnt it sam looked at all the faces in the damagecontrol party he realized he was the only one there old enough to have been at sea during the great war even more than the way his heart pounded after the run to general quarters that told him how many years he was carrying he said the royal navys a damn good outfit they were still on their feet in we never did knock em flat we starved england into quitting when we finally shut down the grain and beef imports from argentina the remembrance rolled steeply everybody grabbed for a handhold to steady himself the ship straightened then rolled back the other way eyechart szczerbiakowicz said i dont care how good they are sir what can they do to us in seas like this damned if i know sam said talking like the petty officer he had been rather than the officer he was ill tell you this though i sure as hell dont want to find out the hard way nobody disagreed with him nobody wanted to see anything happen to the remembrance the men might not remember the great war but most of them had been through the inconclusive scrap against the japanese they knew too well how vulnerable to disaster even the mightiest warship could be huddling down here far below the main deck away from fresh air and natural light only served as a reminder no one would do this if he didnt have to when the allclear sounded sam let out a sigh of relief maybe the seas were too high to let the limeys launch torpedoes or to allow for accurate gunnery but he didnt want to have to see by experiment as he left his station he laughed at himself for one thing as hed thought before the united states were at peace with britain even if the two countries were a long way from friendly with each other for another he didnt know for a fact that there were any royal navy ships within a hundred miles of the remembrance along with everybody else in the damagecontrol party hed been building castles in the air sailors coming from other stations were also buzzing about the limeys if they were wrong they were all wrong the same way carsten shrugged if hed had a dollar for every time hed seen unanimous rumor prove mistaken he could have quit the navy and lived ashore in style he headed for the officers mess both to grab a sandwich and some coffee and to find out what was going on from some people who might actually know when he got there he discovered that most of the other officers were as much in the dark as he was before too long though commander cressy came into the mess every head swung toward the executive officer sam was far too junior to ask the question about which he was so curious but that didnt matter because a lieutenant commander from engineering did it for him did we really bump into the limeys sir the exec paused to time the ships roll and put cream in his coffee with the least likelihood of spilling it all over the deck that done he nodded we sure as hell did oh not literally but in dirty weather like this we have to worry about that too cant spot anything till its right on top of you theyre patrolling farther west than they have for a while another officer said i know commander cressy nodded again not very happily we have no agreement with them that says they cant but they havent up till now they still have a long reach damn them think they could link up with the confederates sir sam asked now isnt that an interesting question cressy said you have a way of asking interesting questions carsten almost shyly sam dipped his head at the praiseif that was what it was the exec went on the short answer is i dont know for that matter the long answer is i dont know too we havent spotted the confederates doing a whole lot to build up their surface fleet some destroyers and cruisers but no new battleships no carriers they would have a devil of a time building those without our noticing submersibles submersibles are a different story im afraid the officer whod first asked about the royal navy was a flamehaired irishman named george toohey he said they started building those fuckers pardon my french siryears before that featherston bastard grabbed the reins you can bet they havent stopped since we should have made em say uncle the second we caught em at it another lieutenant commander said it would have saved us a lot of grief their boats gave us fits in the last war theyre liable to do worse than that if we ever have to tangle with them again nobody said he was wrong nobody in the navynobody sam carsten had ever heard anyhowwould have said he was wrong but commander cressy only shrugged no use crying over spilt milk he said crisply were stuck with the world weve got not the one that might have been for better or worse the political will to clamp down tight wasnt there if we ever do have another war god forbid i think well see royal navy subsand french ones toorefitting in confederate harbors and cs boats doing the same thing on the other side of the atlantic his smile bared sharp white teeth makes our job a little more interesting doesnt it gentlemen they wont be using bermuda or the bahamas or canada as bases against us anyway lieutenant commander toohey said not this time around they wont or newfoundland either commander cressy was relentlessly precise if the confederate states have a lot of submarines holding on to the bahamas could get expensive sam remarked long haul down from philadelphia and new york city and every mile of it right past their coast a very young ensign said baltimores closer cressy withered him with a glance a look at the map would remind you that baltimore also lies within chesapeake bay one assumes the mouth of the bay will be thoroughly mined one also assumes the confederates in norfolk will not sleep through the commencement of hostilities the ensign turned pink he left the mess in a hurry the exec was imperturbable shall we go on discussing reasonable possibilities even if the confederates dont have carriers how many landbased bombers have they got a lieutenant asked that struck sam as a possibility altogether too reasonable he said i was aboard the dakota in when british bombers attacked her from the argentine mainland that wasnt much funand the airplanes now are a lot better than they used to be commander cressy nodded one reason we have carriers is to keep landbased aircraft off our fleets even so though the days of operating battleships in coastal waters may be gone for good the lieutenant whod asked about landbased bombers said in that case sir why do we keep building them i am not the right person to whom to direct that particular question mr hutton the exec replied i suggest you ask your congressman your senators and the secretary of the navy you may be sure i have done so his smile was cynical you may also be sure my letters have done just as much good as you would expect carsten had been in the navy his entire adult life he understood how the top brass thought we got some use out of battleships in the last war he said so of course well need them in the next one yes of course but that wasnt agreement from the executive officer it was raw sarcasm by that way of thinking its a miracle we have any carriers at all these days another of those frightening smiles but of course we know everything is exactly the way it should be in this best of all possible worlds dont we gentlemen no one in the officers mess quite knew how to answer that sam hoped somebody in the navy department did xiv if it had been up to armstrong grimes he would have dropped out of high school as soon as he could and gone to work he wanted everything work could give him money money and well money he didnt think his mother would have minded she and aunt clara were keeping grannys coffeehouse going to bring in extra cash armstrong snickered and cursed at the same time hed never liked his aunt and it was mutual they were only a couple of years apart but these days the gap seemed wide as the grand canyon clara had escaped from school while armstrong was still stuck in it not matter what he thought his old man was bound and determined that he get his highschool diploma armstrong quarreled with his father but hed never had the nerve to take things too far merle grimes walked with a permanent limp yes but that was no sign of weakness it as much as said dont mess with me punk the confederates shot me and i kept going so why the devil should i be afraid of you and so armstrong had to endure another six months of theodore roosevelt high school before he could escape into the real world he said as much one night resentfully over supper his father laughed once you do graduate youll probably be conscripted two years in the army will show you whats real all right they dont conscript everybody in a whole yearclass the way they did in your day armstrong said ive got a pretty good chance of just being able to get on with my life your country is part of your life merle grimes said if you dont help it why should it help you i would if we go to war or something armstrong said but now he spread his hands as if that would tell his father what he wanted instead of a greengray uniform heading the list were his own apartment his own auto and a goodlooking girlfriend the first two items would impress the peacetime army is a steady place his father said the way things are these days that counts for a lot who knows whatll be out there if your grades were better he gave his son a dirty look so im no greasy grind armstrong said returning it with interest i do good enough to get by good enough to get by isnt good enough his father insisted as far as armstrong was concerned he might have been speaking chinese on the way to school the next morning armstrong lit his first cigarette of the day he didnt smoke all that much because his father didnt like him doing it around the house the first drag he took made him a little sick and gave him a little buzz both at the same time he didnt pay much attention in class he would get by and he knew it the teachers couldnt do anything to make him study harder not when he would escape their clutches for good in a few months a lot of the seniors especially the boys acted the same way more because he was a senior than for anything in particular hed done his football career had been decent but no more than decenthe found himself a big man on campus the younger kids all looked up to him hed had that happen before when hed worked his way up from first grade all the way to eighth in elementary school as an eighthgrader hed been a big shot then all of a sudden hed been nothing but a freshman at roosevelt and freshmen were nobodies hed spent the rest of his time here getting back on top he was on his way from math to us government when he stopped so suddenly the kid behind him bumped into him he hardly even noticed hed just had a very nasty thought once he got out of high school hed fall right down to the bottom of the totem pole again he wouldnt be a big man on campus hed be a kid fighting for a break against men twice his age how long before he got back on top again twenty years ever armstrong tried to imagine twenty years he couldntit was longer than hed been alive in twenty years hed be close to forty and if forty wasnt old what was hed intended to sneak another smoke in the boys room on the way to government but he didnt worrying about falling to the bottom of the totem pole had slowed him down and he didnt want to be tardy they still handed out swats to kids who came in late even to seniors mr wiedemann the government teacher walked with a limp almost identical to that of armstrongs father he wore the ribbon for a purple heart on his lapel so hed been hurt during the war too we dont look at secession the way we did before he said can anyone tell me why we dont several hands shot into the air armstrongs wasnt one of them but wiedemann pointed at him anyway grimes he didnt need to be one of the big brains to figure that out on account of the confederate states he said very good mr wiedemann had a wide sarcastic streak as long as he wasnt aiming it at you it made him pretty funny to listen to and from to the great war what happened to the border between the usa and the csa he cupped a hand behind his ear dont everybody talk at once nothing a girl said without raising her hand she would have got in trouble if she were wrong but wiedemann nodded very good for a long time people thought that border would never change were they right herb rosen the greasiest grind in the whole class stuck up his hand everyone said he would end up at harvard if he could make it into the quota for jews there the government teacher pointed to him herb said maybe they were that made armstrong sit up a little straighter he knew the united states had taken land away from the confederate states the way his father went on he would have needed to be dead not to know it it wasnt the answer mr wiedemann had expected either the teacher said suppose you explain yourself he didnt come right out and call herb a blockhead when it came to splitting hairs herb could hold his own with anybody and hed won a couple of arguments with wiedemann in class no one else could claim that now herb said the way things are going kentucky and houston will end up back in the csa and maybe sequoyah too god help us if youre right mr wiedemann said why did we spend so much money and so much blood and so much pain to win them if were going to give them back to the confederate states he tapped the end of his walking stick against the floor as he spoke armstrong didnt think he knew he was doing it like armstrong herb rosen hadnt been born while the great war was going on for him it was as much ancient history as the reign of caesar augustus unlike the teacher whod done his own bleeding and hurting herb could think and talk about that time dispassionately thats the point im trying to make mr wiedemann we took them but did we really win them wouldnt most of the people in those states sooner live in the csa than the usa isnt that why weve never let them have a plebiscite to decide mr wiedemann turned a blotchy purplish color what are you saying he asked his voice shaking are you saying we were wrong to take the spoils of victory are you saying we should have left the confederates on the banks of the ohioand in easy artillery range of this very classroom that last got home to armstrong his mother and grandmother had had plenty of stories of what washington was like under bombardment most of them had to do with the long us barrage that had preceded the reconquest of the city but theyd talked about the confederate shelling before the occupation too his mother didnt go on about those things the way she had when he was younger but she still talked about them every now and again herb plainly had struck a nerve armstrong wondered if he would back down kids who got too far under the skin of grownups usually regretted it they might be clever but grownups were the ones with the clout im saying things have changed since the war of secession herb sounded brash as ever back then states were more important than countries didnt you say kentucky even declared itself neutral after the war started and for a long time the usa and the csa both had to honor that yes i did say that mr wiedemann admitted but i dont see what herb charged ahead can you imagine a state trying to be neutral during the great war things were different countries counted most you thought i live in the united states or im a confederate you didnt think im a new yorker first or im from georgia and so when we took kentucky and houston away from the csa the people there didnt stop thinking they were confederates the way their grandfathers might have im saying thats why weve had so much trouble the germans have too havent they in alsace and lorraine before the government teacher could answer the bell rang wiedemann looked like a prizefighter whod been saved by it dismissed he croaked and sat down behind his desk armstrong didnt usually have much to do with herb rosen in the tightly tribal world of high school they traveled in different packs as they left the classroom though he made a point of going up to herb boy you tied him in knots he said admiringly herb shrugged skinny shoulders i like to try to get to the bottom of things its interesting you know what i mean till just now i didnt think government class could be interesting armstrong said and had he been coming out of math or science or literature he would have said the same thing herb blinked behind thick glasses he looked just like what he was a smart little sheeny armstrong realized hed taken him by surprise first by speaking to him at all and then by what hed said after another blink herb said its like putting a puzzle together for me i want to see where all the pieces go only once in a while as today did armstrong get the feeling there was a bigger puzzle that held pieces in a pattern keeping track of one piece at a time seemed plenty hard enough to him he said you see more of them than old man wiedemann does i hope so herb rosen answered he doesnt know all that much he surprised armstrong again teachers knew more about what they taught than armstrong did himself so hed always been willing to believe they knew a lot believing anything else hadnt even occurred to him now it did he suddenly saw teachers as people like store clerks or truck drivers or trombone players all doing their jobs some good at them some not so good they werent little tin gods even if they wanted kids to think they were youre all right you know armstrong said herb blinked again then beamed hed probably been wondering if he was going to get the snot knocked out of him you too he said and hurried off to his next class armstrong went off to his too in what was for him an unusually thoughtful state of mind cincinnatus driver sighed as he pulled his truck over to the curb in front of his apartment building he was angry at himself when he got out of the truck it was a big growling studebaker only two years old the hauling business had been good lately it would have been better yet if he could have got achilles to throw in with him he could have afforded a second truckand if theyd had two they would have had more before very long cincinnatus could see himself as somebody in charge of a real trucking outfit trouble was achilles didnt want to drive a truck he would have made more money than he did clerking but he didnt want to come home to grace and his children dogtired every night with beatup hands and an aching back part of cincinnatus scorned his son for being soft another part though admired achilles for getting by on brains instead of brawn cincinnatus went into the lobby of the apartment building and checked his mail he sighed again once he had this time in relief no letter from his parents neighbor in covington that meant no more news about his slowly failing mother but even the relief held sorrow it didnt mean his mother was getting better she wasnt she wouldnt once you went into your second childhood you didnt come out again he trudged up the stairs to his flat how tired he really was washed over him then his back felt as if hed been carrying an elephant up a mountain ever since he got up in the morning he looked forward to a long soak in a hot tub that would get some of the kinks out when he went upstairs he also understood exactly why his son wanted no part of the business hed spent so long building up if achilles didnt have to why would he want to feel like this and what happens if you throw your back out cincinnatus didnt want to think about that but sometimesespecially when things in there ached more than usualhe couldnt help it he knew what would happen hed be in trouble and so would his whole family the key went into the lock he opened the door amanda sat at the diningroom table doing homework her face was set in concentration her tongue stuck out of the corner of her mouth cincinnatus smiled his daughter never noticed when she did that both my children gonna graduate high school he thought and the smile got wider that wasnt bad at all not for a black man who hadnt been allowed to go to school at all growing up in confederate kentucky hed learned to read catch as catch can and hed had to be careful about letting white people know he could do it iowa wasnt paradisefar from itbut it was better than what hed known when he was small hello sweetheart he said amanda jumped i didnt hear you open the door i know you waswerethinkin about your schoolwork test tomorrow she said and sank down into that sea of study cincinnatus went into the kitchen elizabeth was wrapping spiced ground beef in cabbage leaves cincinnatus mouth watered he loved pigs in blankets his wife looked over her shoulder he gave her a quick kiss hows things she asked not bad he answered busy day im tired sore too i bet elizabeth said i can see it way you move he nodded she wasnt wrong she went on why dont you take your bath now an soak for a while these aint gonna be ready for at least half an hour all right i do that cincinnatus said i was thinkin comin up the stairs hot water feel good maybe i put the wireless set in the hall so i can listen to it in there too that way i dont have to turn it on so loud itll bother amanda well go on then elizabeth told him longer you stand here talkin less time you got to git clean and git warm when they moved in it had been a coldwater flat theyd been happy enough because it had electricity which theyd done without in covington heating water on the stove hadnt seemed like much these past few years though the building had changed hands and the new owner had put a water heater in the basement along with the furnace the rent had gone up a few dollars a month to pay for it but cincinnatus didnt know a single tenant who was inclined to complain all the hot water you wanted without having to heat it and carry it if that wasnt a bargain he didnt know what was he put the wireless on the floor in the hall and ran it back to a plug in the bedroom with an extension cord if he left the door open a couple of inches he could hear just fine he picked the station that would carry the football game in a little while the tristate association wasnt a top league but the des moines hawks were one of the two or three best teamsand they were playing keokuk a doormat tonight dutch will be along at half past the hour with the game the announcer said earnestly first though here is the news soaking in a steaming tub cincinnatus was inclined to be tolerant go on then tell me he said the announcer did starting with the latest scandal at the state house it sounded as if some socialist legislators were going to spend some time in quarters less fancy than their present offices but you never could tell more than a few politicians here had managed to wiggle off the hook farm news came next most of iowa was farm country they took prices for grain and hogs and cattle seriously here they had to an awful lot of people either made a decent living or didnt depending on whether those prices went up or down only after the local and state news did the announcer bother to admit a wider world was out there president smith remained optimistic or said he did that an oldage pension bill would finally fight its way through congress the socialists had been saying that for years the democrats had been filibustering for years smith was quoted as saying if they vote against it theyll pay at the polls next november and theyll deserve to cincinnatus had long since decided he would believe in the pension when he saw his first check someone in houston had taken a shot at the us commandant there hed missed and been killed by the officers guards for his trouble someone in sequoyah had blown up an oil well a spectacular fireball the announcer said and damage in the hundreds of thousands of dollars he sounded almost gleeful about having such exciting news to read and in kentucky he went on a plot to wreck the bridges crossing from covington to cincinnati was foiled by the vigilance of soldiers commanded by brigadier general abner dowling dowling is quoted as saying kentucky will stay in the usa as long as he is in charge there and radicals and agitators had better get used to the idea cincinnatus was sure the man on the wireless would have been more cheerful if hed got to talk about the bridges falling into the ohio river in the csa an auto bomb had gone off in montgomery killing four three whites and a negroand wounding seventeen the newsman said like most of the recent rash of auto bombs this is surely the work of negro guerrillas although no one has claimed responsibility for it in richmond president featherston has vowed vengeance for the attack and has stated that if necessary he will hold the entire colored community responsible for the actions of the bombers who in his words are cowards destroying innocent lives but afraid to come out and fight like men cincinnatus snorted if you fought somebody stronger than you were you had to be a fool to meet him face to face cincinnatus despised the idea of blowing up innocent bystanders but he also despised what the freedom party was doing to blacks in the confederacy how could he blame them for hitting back with whatever weapons they found in south america talks between venezuela and the empire of brazil on their latest border dispute are said to have made some progress the announcer said however argentina and chile have recalled their ambassadors from each others capitals they are said to be closer to war with each other than at any time since cincinnatus remembered that one of the south american countries had been on the usas side in the great war the other on the csas sprawling there in the nice warm tub he couldnt have said which was which they were both too far away king charles of france has demanded a plebiscite in alsace and lorraine much as president featherston has demanded a similar vote in kentucky and houston the announcer declared no immediate reply is expected from kaiser wilhelms government not least because of the kaisers failing health in britain prime minister churchill announced his support for the french demand saying the germans have decided only to be undecided resolved to be irresolute adamant for drift solid for fluidity allpowerful to be impotent from what cincinnatus had seen in the papers this churchill was a reactionary the only reason he was prime minister was that the conservatives had named him to the post to keep the silver shirts from eating their party the way the socialists had eaten the republicans in the usa he was an old man and cartoonists liked to show him with jowls like a bulldogs but he could turn a phrase churchill has also introduced a bill instituting conscription in britain the newsman went on in his speech in the house of commons he said come on now all you young men all over the kingdom you are needed more than ever now to fill the gap of a generation shorn by the war you must take your place in lifes fighting line raise the glorious flags again advance them upon the new enemies he pointed to the achievements of the british unicorn legion in spain and its role in helping the nationalists seize madrid from the germanbacked monarchists surely wellington would have praised their pluck he said amidst loud applause who was wellington cincinnatus supposed the british knew achilles and amanda might have known too he had no idea himself he didnt much care either after giving the days stockmarket figures dismal as usual and the weather forecast not much better the newsman went away the excited background mutter from a packed football stadium came out of the wireless speaker hello hawks fans a very pleasant good evening to you wherever you may be the sportscaster said this is your pal dutch bringing you tonights game between des moines and the keokuk colonels des moines has to be the favorite but youve got to watch out for keokuk because theyre coming off a win against waterloo and ahhh cincinnatus knew he would enjoy hearing the game regardless of whether the hawks won or lost even if it was at the half dutch would find a way to keep the broadcast exciting till the final gun sounded dutch could read the telephone book and make it interesting if there ever was a great communicator he was the man and then with the hawks driving there they go again dutch said after yet another gain elizabeth spoiled things by yelling suppers ready cincinnatus didnt want to get out of the tub but he did jonathan moss was chewing a piece of roast beef when dorothy looked across the table at him and asked daddy why are you a damned yank he didnt choke it took an effort but he didnt after carefully swallowing he looked not at his little girl but at his wife laura shook her head ive never called you that jonathanwell never where dorothy could hear he believed her she was straightforward in what she thought and said he couldnt imagine her lying about it to his face turning back to dorothy he asked who called me that dear some of the kids at school she answered they said mommy was a collabosomething i dont know what that means laura turned red she bit her lip she knew what it meant too well quickly jonathan said it means those kids dont know what theyre talking about thats what oh dorothy said all right she went back to her supper but it wasnt all right and jonathan knew it he read stories to dorothy while laura did the dishes they all listened to the wireless for a while dorothy changed into a long flannel nightgown brushed her teeth and came out clutching her favorite doll for goodnight kisses after shed gone to bed laura looked at jonathan and said hello you damned yank he didnt say hello you collaborator or even hello you collabosomething that would only have made things worse he just shook his head and said kids shell know what a collaborator is soon enough laura said bitterly he wouldnt be able to escape the word by not mentioning it then he hadnt really thought he would though he had hoped his wife went on the schoolchildren will make sure of that shell know youre not a collaborator too moss said you still cant stand yanks even though you married one and there are plenty of yanks whod say im the collaboratorcollaborator with canucks i mean not as many as there used to be laura said not since you started flying again ha shows what you know moss told her you should hear the way the fellows at the airdrome outside of london needle me i dont want to hear them i dont want anything to do with them she answered if i did i really would be a collaborator she glared at him daring him to tell her she was wrong he didnt want to argue about it they argued enoughthey argued too muchwithout looking for reasons to lock horns he said i want to review those papers i brought home im going to have to put in a lot of work on that appeal when i get to the office tomorrow a military judge had sentenced one of his clients to five years for lying about his past in the canadian military when applying for a liquorstore license moss was convinced the judge had ignored the evidence he thought he had a decent chance of getting the verdict overturned the military courts in occupied canada werent nearly so bad nowadays as they had been shortly after the war but he also wanted to remind laura of what he did for a livingwhat hed been doing for years to his relief she nodded all right she said will it bother you if the wireless stays on i like the music program thats coming up next i dont mind a bit he said i wont even notice it as he headed out the door the next morning he wondered if he should have asked dorothy which children at the local elementary school were calling laura and him names that probably said something about how their parents felt about the us occupiers he shook his head he didnt want to know the sun shone on sootstreaked snow as usual in early march berlin was a gloomy frozen place moss warily looked around before getting into his auto he saw nothing out of the ordinary relieved but not reassured he got in and started the motor the day seemed just like any other all the same he didnt go to his law office by the route hed used the day before hed had too many threats to care to make things easy for anyone who might want him dead and while the bomb that had blown up occupation headquarters hadnt been aimed at him in particular it would have killed him just the same if hed been there when it went off he came by his caution honestly getting out of the ford and walking half a block to the office building was another small thoughtful stretch of time no matter how he went from his block of flats to the office he got there in the end somebody could be waiting nobody was not today not outside not in the lobby not on the stairs not in the office moss nodded to himself now he could get on with business he lit a cigarette plugged in the hot plate and got a pot of coffee going the first cup would be good he prepared to enjoy it by the end of the day the pot would be mud and battery acid he knew hed go right on pouring more from it he was his own secretary he could have afforded to hire a typist but the idea had never once crossed his mind he started pounding away on a typewriter not much younger and not much lighter than he was the letters that appeared on the sheet of paper were grayer than he would have liked when he looked in the desk drawer to see if he had a new ribbon he found he didnt he muttered under his breath he thought hed bought two the last time he needed them either he hadnt or this was the second and not the first before long he would have to go shopping again ribbons for this ancient model were getting hard to come by hed dealt with some ordinary correspondence and was working on the appeal when his first client of the day came in mr godfrey isnt it moss said turning the swivel chair away from the typewriter stand and toward the front of the office how are you today sir ill do mr moss thank you toby godfrey did not look like the plump redfaced english squire his name might have suggested he was skinny and sallow and wore a perpetually worried expression since the occupation authorities were taking a long and pointed look at his affairs he had reason to wear that kind of look but moss suspected hed had it long before the great war started let me check your file mr godfrey jonathan got up and pulled it out of a steel fourdrawer cabinet looking at what was there reminded him of what wasnt you were going to get me your certificate of discharge and your certificate of acceptance a canadian man whod fought in the great war and couldnt prove he had accepted us authority after the surrender in had a very hard time of it indeed if he ever came to the notice of a military court godfrey coughed a wet sound half embarrassed half perhaps tubercular i have the certificate of discharge he said as for the other he coughed again i would of course be happy to sign a certificate of acceptance now that would be better than nothing wouldnt it a little moss said glumly a military prosecutor would claim godfrey had signed the certificate only because of his dispute with the occupying authorities he would also claim everything godfrey had done over the past twentyodd years was illegal because hed done it without having a certificate on file a military judge would be inclined to listen to that kind of argument too because occupation law presumed the worst about men whod tried to kill us soldiers im sure youll do your best godfrey said if you cant find that certificate im making bricks without straw moss warned youd do better trying to settleif they will but ive lived a quiet peaceable life since no one can say otherwise toby godfrey protested that must count for something a little moss said again even more glumly than before godfrey seemed not to hear that glumnessseemed to refuse to hear it in fact clients were often like that full of their own hopes and fears they became deaf and blind to anything that ran against whatever they already had in their minds the canadian said im sure youll do your very best mr moss moss nodded i will but i tell you frankly ive taken a lot of cases where i liked the odds better if you can arrange a compromise with the occupying authorities godfrey wouldnt hear of it he must have thought it was a way of asking for more money for he set ten crisp new tendollar bills on the desk your very very best mr moss he didnt even wait for a reply he got up and stuck out his hand moss took it his client left the office moss scooped up the money ill have to mail him a receipt he thought sighing he would do his best if you were fighting a foe too much bigger and stronger than you were sometimes your best wasnt good enough the canadians had found out all about that during the great war and jonathan moss had been one of the men who taught them the lesson he turned the swivel chair back to the typewriter stand and started banging away again hed just got up a good head of steam when somebody knocked on the door come in he called who the devil went though his mind clients didnt usually knock and he had no one scheduled till the afternoon the mailman didnt knock either besides the mail wouldnt get here for at least another hour just in case moss hand found the pistol hed taken to keeping in a desk drawer in walked major rex finley moss pulled his hand out of the drawer hello major he said this is a surprise what brings you here a governmentissue chevy and i hope itll bring me back to london too answered the officer who commanded the airdrome there laughing jonathan pointed to the chair across from his desk and said well sit down and tell me what i can do for you ive come to say goodbye finley said ive been transferred to wright field outside of dayton ohio captain trotter will be in charge of things here from now on youll be able to keep flying dont worry about that before too long we may want every trained man we can find his voice had an edge to it dayton moss said musingly thats down toward the border isnt it major finley nodded it sure is and itll be even closer if theres a plebiscite in kentucky and we lose neither of them said anything after that for a little while if there was a plebiscite the usa would lose everything moss knew about kentucky told him as much by finleys expression he had the same opinion at last moss asked do you really think it will come to that i dont know finley replied i dont know but i wouldnt be surprised well well moss whistled tunelessly do you want to go out and get drunk too early in the day for me finley said with genuine regret and like i said i have to be able to drive back to london but dont let me stop you ive got work to do myself jonathan looked for a silver lining maybe were wrong heres hoping were wrong major finley nodded yes heres hoping but he didnt sound as if he believed it mary pomeroy cut up pieces of fried pork chop and put them on alecs plate along with some string beans her son ate string beans only under protest he would eat them though and only rarely required threats of imminent bodily harm not even threats of imminent bodily harm would make him eat spinach bodily harm itself wouldnt mary and mort had both made the experiment which had left everyone in the family unhappy mort dug in thats good he said thanks mary answered whats the news at the diner not a whole lot her husband said two different tables of yank soldiers talking about whether therell be a whatchamacallit down south a plebiscite mary asked mort nodded thats it i hear it a dozen times a day and i never remember it if there is one the people down there will vote to leave the united states theyll vote to be confederates again mary said i suppose so mort lit a cigarette he didnt care one way or the other that he didnt care disappointed mary she did her best not to let it infuriate her what do you suppose would happen if we had one of those plebiscites here in canada she asked mort didnt answer right away he was blowing smoke rings for alec he was good at it he could send them out one after another his son watched in goggleeyed fascination only when mort ran out of smoke did he shrug and say i dont know dont you think wed vote to be canadians again to be free again mary blazed dont you think wed vote to send the yanks packing i suppose so but mort still didnt sound very excited but were not going to get to vote you know why not mary said if the people in those states ever get to we should too i dont want to be a yank any more than somebody in houston does after another virtuoso set of smoke rings mort said ill tell you why not because those other places have the confederate states shouting for em all the time whos going to shout for us we cant even shout for ourselves canadians didnt shout or not very much one surefire way to tell yanks in canada was by how much noise they made mary didnt just want to shout she wanted to scream we ought to be shouting for ourselves were just as much a country as the united states are i suppose we could be if mort began alec interrupted more smoke rings daddy but mort stubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray next time i light up sport he told the little boy and turned back to mary i suppose we could be if they let us he said picking up where hed left off but they arent going to let us and theres nobody who can make them let us were stuck we might as well get used to it if we do maybe theyll ease up on us a little more mary had never imagined hating her husband she came unpleasantly close to it now mort wasnt a collaborator mary never would have had anything to do with him if he were no matter how he stirred her but he was what would you call somebody like himan accommodator that was it he knew he was a canadian he even liked being a canadian and was proud of it he didnt think staying a canadian was worth a big fight though all he wanted to do was get along from one day to the next more and more canadians seemed to be accommodators these days that made mary want to scream too accommodate enough accommodate long enough and you werent a canadian any more were you not as far as she could see didnt you turn into a pale imitation of a yank instead you want to go to the cinema saturday night mort asked the new film about roosevelts unauthorized regiment is supposed to be good and they say marion morrison makes a firstrate tr i dont think so mary said tightly fighting hard against despair mort already sounded like a pale imitation of a yank he would have denied it if shed called him on it she didnt she didnt want a fight life was too short wasnt it if you dont fight arent you giving up too she asked herself she supposed that was partly true but only partly she still cared about the wrongs the americans had committed in occupying her country she didnt she wouldnt forget oh mort said almost slipped my mind what mary asked you know freddy halliday mort said that was a silly question rosenfeld wasnt such a big town that everybody didnt know everybody else mary nodded impatiently her husband went on he says the public library really will open in two weeks he says cross my heart and hope to die do you think it will happen mary asked freddy halliday had been trying to bring a public library to rosenfeld for years he hadnt had much luck till lately now he actually had a building a few doors down from the general store he had it because the pharmacist who was supposed to come up from minneapolis had got cold feet but he did have it whether he had anything besides the building was a subject of much speculation in town he says he has a permit from the occupying authorities in winnipeg and a budget and books mort answered i dont know if he really does if he doesnt we ought to ride him out of town on a rail to teach him not to get our hopes up my hopes are up mary said you can have as much fun in a library as you can at the cinema and it doesnt cost you anything she turned to alec i wonder if itll have any childrens books for you read me a story alec asked cued by the word books after supper mary said that made alec shovel food into his mouth like a stoker fueling a fast freight mary hoped most stokers had better aim than her little boy did it began to look as if freddy halliday had all the things he claimed he had a brass plaque that said rosenfeld public library went up above the door to the forsaken pharmacy a formidably stout maiden lady a miss montague moved into a groundfloor flat in the pomeroys block of flats and began spending all her waking hours in the building a large truck brought crates of something to the place if those crates didnt hold books what was in them the promised opening day came and went everybody in town joked about iteverybody except freddy halliday who remained resolutely upbeat a week later the rosenfeld public library did in fact open its doors mary wasnt there for the opening alec came down with a cold which meant he had to stay home which meant she had to stay home too she didnt get to the library for another week it was a bright spring day the sky a deep almost painful blue overhead the few white clouds dappling it only made the glorious color deeper out on the farms beyond the edge of town people would be taking advantage of this glorious weather to plant mary could just enjoy it walking along with alecs little hand in hers she felt guilty about not doing more in the library miss montague sat behind a large wooden desk and under an almost equally large quiet please sign she did smile at alec and pointed to sure enough the childrens section she didnt even breathe fire when alec whooped with delight at finding books he hadnt seen before mary arranged to get a library card for herself and one for mort she stole brief glimpses of novels and nonfiction books encyclopedias and magazines and newspapers look at all the telephone books she said trying to keep alec interested so she could go on looking around you can find out the telephone number of anybody in canada or the united states she refused even to name the republic of quebec stolen from her country as kentucky and houston had been stolen from the csa why alec asked her so you can call them if you want to but we dont got a telephone dont have a telephone but if we did we could why alec asked again that string of questions could go on all day knowing as much mary said and heres a book of maps of the whole world the big colorful atlas distracted alec it also distracted mary but only for a little while if i could call anybody who would it be what would i say the thought was enough to make her dizzy shed used a telephone only a handful of times in her life the diner had one but the flat didnt and of course there hadnt been one on the farm if she had a telephone and if the farm had one too she supposed she would talk to her mother whenever she got the chance she couldnt think of anyone else except her sister julia she wanted to call the people she knew in rosenfeld she could visit whenever she pleased while no telephone would ever let her talk with her brother or her father but even if she didnt have a telephone lots of people in canada and even more in the usa did the telephone book for toronto for instance had to be an inch and a half thick mary pulled it off the shelfshe didnt care even to open a telephone book from the united states the first name she looked for was mcgregor the one shed been born with she found almost a page of mcgregors each name with not only a telephone number but also an address beside it that must be handy she thought especially in a big city where you dont know where everybody else lives after the mcgregors she checked the pomeroys there werent so many of themonly a little more than a columns worth she smiled at the obvious superiority of her own birth name but then when she saw the seven pages of smiths she decided quantity didnt make quality alec got impatient watching his mother flip pages back and forth want to go home he said hush mary told him dont talk loud in the library want to go home alec didnt care where he was and knew where he wanted to be all right mary said she was ready to go too but then as they were on their way out she suddenly stopped alec tugged at the pleats of her skirt wait a second she told him and went over to the librarians desk excuse me miss montague but could i borrow a pencil and a little piece of paper why of course the librarian gave them to her alecs face clouded up when she went back itll only be a minute she said i want to see something he didnt burst into tears on the spot which was something if he had she would have had to take him homeand she would have warmed his fanny too as things were she found what she was looking for inside of two minutes she wrote down what she needed to know gave the pencil back to miss montague with a nod of thanks and walked out of the library alec behaved on the way back why not he was getting what he wanted as mary walked past the building that housed the rosenfeld register she gave the newspaper a nod of thanks too lucien galtier started up his motorcar the chevrolet roared to life right away hed finally had to replace the battery the new one was much stronger than the old one had been but he still grumbled at the expense when he was driving a horse he hadnt had to buy new pieces for it every so often once the motor warmed up he put the auto in gear and drove up toward riviиreduloup today was his sixtysomethingeth birthday he didnt care to contemplate the exact number and nicole and dr leonard odoull had invited him to their house for supper to celebrate part of him wondered why people celebrated getting older another part the part that still ached for marie told him the answer because the alternative was not getting older and that was dreadfully final it had been a quarter of a century now since wars clawed hand raked across the countryside young men said you couldnt see the scars any more lucien knew better time had softened those wounds but they were still there if you knew where to look and shells still lay buried in the ground every so often they worked their way to the surface most of the time dйmineurs took them away and disposed of them once in a while one of them went off when a plowshare struck it or it suffered some other mischance of that sort the great war was still killing people and would go on killing for years to come he drove past the post office the republic of quebecs fleurdelys flag fluttered in the breeze in front of it he was used to that flag now but it still didnt feel like the flag of his country he didnt suppose it ever would not when hed spent his first forty years in the province of quebec rather than the republic were things better now worse or just different for the life of him he had trouble saying there was the house where nicole lived with leonard odoull he parked in front of the walk that led to the front porch the grass on the lawn was green again when he got out of the auto he took the key with him on the farm he left it in the ignition half the time that probably wouldnt do here in town where a stranger might hop in and decide to go for a spin the door opened before he could knock there stood his oldest grandson by what magic had lucien odoull grown taller than the man for whom he was named happy birthday mon grandpиre he said come in that same magic whatever it was had given him a mandeep voice too merci lucien galtier said and then after an appreciative sniff what smells so good an instant later he held up a hand no dont tell me ill find out he followed his grandson down the short entry hall to the living room as soon as he got there a flashbulb went off in his face what sounded like a million people shouted surprise osti lucien muttered flinching with what was indeed surpriseshock probably came closer with a large purplishgreen spot swimming in front of his eyes he needed a moment to see how jammed with people the living room was hed expected nicole and leonard and little lucien and they were there but so were denise and charles and georges and susanne and jeanne and their spouses and their children and he realized after another startled heartbeat so was йloise granche surprise they all shouted again even louder than before nicole wriggled through the crowd and kissed galtier on the cheek happy birthday cher papa her husband raised the camera again another flashbulb froze the moment lucien was at least partly braced for the second blast of light he wagged a finger at his offspring you are a pack of devils every one of you he said you did your best to make this the last surprise i would ever have this side of the pearly gates he mimed clutching his breast and falling over dead his children and grandchildren laughed and cheered йloise granche said if they are a pack of devils where do you suppose they get it that brought more laughter yet йloise rose from the sofa and threaded her way past children and out to lucien as nicole had she said happy birthday and kissed galtier leonard odoull took yet another photograph well well lucien said i suspect you have all been plotting this for a very long time oh no papa georges shook his head your american soninlaw drove round to our houses a couple of hours ago and since we werent doing anything special tonight nonsense galtier said if there hadnt been so many women and children there he would have said something more colorful than that but nonsense would do his younger sons head had always been full of it most of the grownups had glasses close by them some full some empty plaintively galtier asked could it be that i might get something to drink well seeing that it is your birthday leonard odoull said with the air of a man granting a great concession and it could also be that i should prescribe something for that greenaroundthegills look you have would you like whiskey or apple brandy yes galtier said a reply worthy of georges his soninlaw made a face at him which you cantankerous creature apple brandy by choice lucien answered he would drink whiskey readily enough but he wasnt wild about it he turned to йloise and what are you doing here why wishing you a happy birthday of course she answered demurely i hope it is a happy birthday it seems to be so far he answered coming right out and admitting he was happy struck him as a show of weakness he turned to leonard odoull you see you have been listening to gossip again and what if i have odoull replied are you complaining me not at all i am glad i am here i am glad everyone is here galtier said and i do mean everyone he smiled at йloise he wanted to kiss her again but he wouldnt do that not in front of his children and grandchildren they mightmost of the ones old enough to understand surely didknow he and йloise were more than friends but there was a difference between knowing and showing one little kiss had been all right two would have been excessive the difference mattered to him that it might matter much less to his offspring never once crossed his mind nicole disappeared into the kitchen when she came out it was with some of the most arresting words in any language suppers ready fried chicken lamb fragrant with garlic rabbits stewed with plums fresh spinach and peas stewed turnips endless snowy mounds of mashed potatoes plenty of whiskey and applejack and beer to wash them down any man who couldnt be happy after a feast like that wasnt trying hard enough lucien ate till he wanted to curl up on his chair and go to sleep nor was he the only one who went above and beyond the call of duty georges could easily have built a whole new chicken from the mound of bones on his plate everyone groaned with horrified pleasure when nicole brought out an enormous birthday cake a single large candle topped it leonard odoull grinned evilly at lucien we did not want to put a candle for each year he said for fear you would burn the house down when you tried to blow them out an old man hasnt got enough wind to blow out that many candles anyhow georges put in i gave you the strap when you were little lucien told his younger son but not enough of it i see well le bon dieu is still listening i did not know dishonor thy father and mother was one of the commandments dont be silly i wouldnt think of saying a word against maman georges face was the picture of innocence galtier snorted charles struck a match and lit the candle blow it out papa so we can eat the cake he said sensibly unlike georges he had no wildness in him but he made a good solid man blow it out lucien did everybody cheered nicole cut the cake she gave her father the first piece he had no idea how he found room for it but he did his children and their spouses groaned as they ate his grandchildren might have been a swarm of locusts lucien marveled that they left any of the cake undevoured now nicole said briskly presents galtier tried to wave them away that i am here with my family is enoughmore than enough he said nobody listened to him he hadnt thought anyone would now that hed made the protest he could enjoy his gifts and not be thought greedy from charles he got a soft tweed jacket better suited to a gentleman of leisure than to a working farmer that was how it seemed to him anyhow but йloise said its perfect to wear to a dance he hadnt thought of that once she said it though he saw she was right georges gave him a fancy pipe and some even fancier tobacco when he opened the tin the rich fragrance filled the room calisse he said reverently that smells so good i wont even have to smoke it and whats this this came from nicole and leonard odoull it was a big bottle of real calvados not the imitations turned out by local craftsmen who didnt care for the republic of quebecs tedious excisetax regulations this fine brandy is patronized by his majesty king charles xi king of france galtier read from the label mais certainement his soninlaw said i personally wrestled this very bottle from king charles own hands you certainly are a muttonhead lucien said йloise granche gave him a maroon wool sweater everyone said it was very handsome again lucien thought it finer than what he usually wore but it was thick and warm it would do nicely in spring and fall and under a coat in wintertime too i hope you like it йloise said i do very much he said it is always pleasant when a friend thinks of me he spoke with a straight face йloise nodded so did galtiers children and their spouses most of his grandchildren were too young to care one way or the other decorum was preserved later when he was carrying booty out to the chevrolet йloise said could you give me a ride back to my house cher lucien i would not care to impose on dr odoull to drive me both ways it would be no trouble at all leonard odoull said politely no no dont put yourself to the trouble galtier said everyone has done so much for me today it would be my pleasure to do this his soninlaw let himself be persuaded i hope you had a happy birthday йloise said as they rolled out of riviиreduloup and into the countryside very happy now lucien could admit it he chuckled i have not had a surprise party since i was eight years old when they pulled up in front of her house she smiled and asked and is there anything else you might like for your birthday it could be he said yes it could be they went inside together except from the roof of the us embassy the stars and stripes had not flown in richmond for almost eighty years only a handful of ancient men and women remembered the days when virginia was one of the united states now though as jake featherston waited in the june heat inside the railroad station to receive the special train southbound from washington us and cs flags flew side by side throughout the confederate capital no president of the united states had ever made an official visit to richmond till now featherston wore the uniform of a freedom party guard almost identical in cut and color to that of the confederate army the summerweight cotton cloth was cooler and more comfortable than a suit would have been with jakes rangy height the uniform was also much more impressive on him photographers snapped away newsreel cameras ground out footage reporters waited for quotes jake reminded himself that he had to be extra careful about what he did and said in public the confederate press crews would make him look and sound the way he and saul goldman thought he should the crews from the usa were a different story though halfmore than halfof them were here hoping to see him look and sound like a fool and he couldnt keep them out of the csa not when president smith was coming just have to be smarter than they are he thought and smiled a little nastily shouldnt be hard a stalwart in white shirt and butternut trousers put down a telephone and hurried over to him the trains about two minutes away boss he said thanks ozzie jake answered the stalwart drew back are you loyal featherston wondered are you really loyal ever since willy knight tried to do him in hed wondered about almost everyone around himeveryone except ferd koenig and saul goldman and a handful of other old campaigners hed chosen his new vice president a senator from tennessee named donald partridge not least because don was an amiable nonentity who couldnt hope to threaten him here came al smiths train schoolchildren on the platform started waving the stars and stripes and the stars and bars a military band struck up the battle cry of freedom a tune both sides had usedwith different lyricsduring the war of secession the train came to a stop a colored attendant brought up the little stepped platform people used to descend to the station freedom party guardsnot stalwarts who were less likely to be trustworthywith submachine guns fanned out to make sure there were no unfortunate international incidents the door to smiths pullman car opened the first men out were the us presidents bodyguards they wore civilian suits not butternut uniforms but otherwise were stamped from the same hardfaced mold as the freedom party men when president smith himself emerged the band began to play the starspangled banner a tune heard as seldom in richmond as the stars and stripes were seen under a jaunty fedora smiths hair was snow white he looked older and wearier than jake featherston had expected but he managed a smile for the swarm of cameramen and reporters and walked up to jake with a friendly nod pleased tmeetcha mr president he said right pleased to meet you too mr president jake answered flash photographs and the newsreel cameras recorded their handshake for posterity jake had heard al smith on the wireless and in newsreels hed found the other presidents new york city accent hard to follow then it proved no easier in person smith highlighted sounds anyone from the confederate states would have swallowed and chopped up what a confederate would have stretched out looking forward to hashing things out wit you smith said welcome to richmond featherston said about time we did sit down and talk face to face best way to settle things best way for you to give me what i want you betcha smith said jake took that to be agreement the military band switched from the us national anthem to dixie president smith took off his hat and stood at attention also at attention beside him jake featherston admitted to himself it was a nice touch when the confederate anthem ended jake said shall we go on to the gray house and do a little horsetrading thats a deal al smith said surrounded by bodyguards from both countrieswho eyed one another almost as warily as they examined bystandersthe two presidents went out to featherstons new limousine the previous motorcar had been armored this one could have been a barrel except it didnt have a turret anyone who tried to murder the president of the csa while he was in it was wasting his time unfortunately with the thick windows rolled up traveling in the limousine was about as hot as traveling in a barrel al smith promptly rolled his down a few inches they want to take a shot at me they can take a shot at me he said at least i wont roast suits me jake did his best to stay nonchalant his guards and smiths were probably all having conniptions well too damn bad he thought the parade route from the station to the gray house jogged once that way smithand the reporters with himdidnt see the damage from an auto bomb red negroes had set off two days before featherston hated the black man whod come up with that tactic it did a lot of damage it spread even more fear and it was damned hard to defend against too many negroes too many motorcarshow could you check them all you couldnt worse luck if president smith noticed the jog he was too polite to say so he smiled out at the flagwaving children and adults lining the route nice crowd he said with no trace of irony featherston could hear did that mean he didnt realize theyd been specially brought out for the occasion jake hoped so when they got to the gray house smith stared at it with interest comparing it to the white house jake thought or to that place in philadelphia they posed for more pictures in the downstairs reception hall and then in jakes office then they shooed the photographers out of the room care for a drink before we get down to business featherston asked hed heard al smith could put it away pretty good and he wasnt so bad himself sure why not the president of the usa said a colored servant brought a bottle of hundredproof bourbon some ice cubes and two glasses jake did the honors himself he raised his glass to al smith mud in your eye he said they both drank ah smith said thats the straight goods he took another sip anyone that whiskey didnt faze had seen the bottom of more than one glass in his day sure as hell after featherston poured refills he said you know what i want mr president you know whats right too by god as far as he was concerned the two were one and the same let the people choose well take our chances with that and in the meantime youll keep murdering anybody in kentucky and houston who doesnt go along smith said we havent got anything to do with that jake lied without compunction the president of the usa let out a laugh that was half a cough my ass featherston blinked nobodyd come right out and called him a liar for a long time he said youre just afraid of a plebiscite on account of you know whatll happen if i was afraid of a plebiscite i wouldnt be here al smith answered but if we go that way ive got some conditions of my own lets hear em jake said maybe he wouldnt be able to grab everything on the table if he got it served to him course by course though that would do first thing is no bloodshed in the time before the plebiscite smith said if people are going to vote let em vote without being afraid if you call a plebiscite i expect the folks in the occupied states will be happy enough to go along with that featherston said at once he could rein in most of his people and say the ones he didnt rein in werent his fault besides everybody knew by now what the freedom party could do it wouldnt have to add much more in the runup to a plebiscite to keep the message fresh all right number two then al smith said you want the people to vote the people should vote all the peopleeverybody over twentyone in houston and kentucky and sequoyah ive been saying that all along jake answered despite his thunderings he didnt know if he would win in sequoyah settlers from the usa had flooded into it since the war before the confederates had kept white settlement slow out of deference to the five civilized tribes of indians whod helped so much in the war of secession the united states had always been hard on indians which was why the creeks and the cherokees and the rest were so loyal to the csa but president smith shook his head i dont think you get it when i say everybody i mean everybody whites and negroes whites and negroes jake was genuinely shocked that hadnt even occurred to him niggersve never been able to vote in the csa they sure as hell wont vote once they come back either hell they cant vote in those states now theyll vote in the plebiscite smith said theyve got surnames these days we can keep track of em make sure its fair and honest they arent slaves any more in the usa theyre citizens even if they dont vote if theyre going to change countries they have to be able to help make the choice jake considered smith had neatly turned the tables on him hed been yelling let the people vote now smith said let all the people vote how could he say no to that without looking like a fool he couldnt and he knew it all right goddammit he ground out that made sequoyah even iffier but he didnt think it would hurtexcept as far as precedent wentin kentucky or houston smith seemed a little surprised hed accepted even if grudgingly he gave his next condition any state that changes hands stays demilitarized for twentyfive years thats a bargain jake didnt hesitate for even a moment there he knew he would break the deal inside of twentyfive days he could always manufacture incidents to give him an excuseor maybe if the blacks got uppity he wouldnt have to manufacture any what else these have to be your last demands as far as territorial changes go smith said that would leave the united states with part of virginia part of arkansas part of sonoramaybe enough to claim theyd still made a profit on the war well of course featherston said again without hesitation if i get that much ill get the rest tooyou bet i will anything else yesone more thing the us president said we can announce an agreement now but i dont think the vote itself oughta come before we should have a proper campaignlet both sides be heard what featherston frowned wondering what sort of fast one smith was trying to pull there then suddenly he laughed al smith would run for reelection in november he wanted to be able to say hed made peace with the confederate states but he didnt want to have to hand over any territory to them before election day afterwards hed have plenty of time to repair the damage he thinks so anyway all right mr president jake said youve got yourself a deal xv anne colleton had heard that people danced in the streets in richmond when woodrow wilson declared war on the united states now the newsboys here shouted plebisciteand people danced in the street maybe that was because they thought there wouldnt be a war now but maybeand odds were more likelyit was because they thought the confederate states would finally get back what theyd lost in the war she thought as much herself she felt proud of herself for backing the right horse before the freedom party came to power who would have believed the united states would ever even think of turning loose the lands theyd stolen from the csa but the stolen states had grown too hot to hold on to the united states kept burning their fingers and if that wasnt jake featherstons doing whose was it the right horse sure enough anne thought smugly celebrations in capitol square across the street from fords hotel were noisy enough to keep her awake at night she hadnt thought of that when she checked in there were of course plenty of worse problems to have even if she needed her sleep more regularly than she had when she was younger she was in richmond to pay a call on the french embassy some of the men with whom shed conferred in paris years before had risen in prominence since she could talk with one of them informally but still leave him certain he understood where the confederate government stood she hadnt had much chance to speak french lately but she expected her accent wouldnt be too barbarous across from the french embassy east of capitol square stood the much bigger building housing the us embassy a manhigh fence of pointed iron palings protected the neoclassical white marble pile above which flew the stars and stripes anne understood why the us embassy needed that kind of protection how many times had her countrymen wanted to give it what they thought it deserved but not today today people cheered the us military guards in their greengray uniforms the guards stood impassive at the entrance to the embassy their faces showed nothing of what they were thinking all the same anne wondered what that would be how happy did the prospect of a plebiscite in the annexed states make them not very i hope colonel jeanhenri jusserand had been french military attachй in the confederate states since sailing across the atlantic with anne aboard the charles xl so good to see you again mademoiselle colleton he said bowing over her hand it has been too long a time yes i think so too she said i hope you are well i must confess the weather here in summer is a trial jusserand replied other than that though yes thank you and i must also say that i am full of admiration for the extraordinary achievement of your government cest formidable merci beaucoup anne said i hope that france will soon have similar good fortune with respect to alsace and lorraine colonel jusserands narrow intelligent face twisted who can say the germans delay and delay they delay endlessly and we cannot even tax them for it overmuch for the kaiser delays dying he delays and delays delays almostendlessly and while he is dying what can be decided why nothing of course there are ways to make them decide anne murmured to go to war do you mean the military attachй asked anne nodded jusserand sighed it is not so simple i wish it were but it is not we have to know what the english will do and the russians and the italians until we are sure how can we move the boches have beaten us twice in a lifetime if we lose for a third time we are ruined forever when we came across the atlantic from france to the confederate states a few years ago your country was ahead of mine anne said you poked and prodded at the germans while we could not do much with the united states things are different now cest dommage the frenchmans eyes flashed yes it is a pity he agreed you will understand i hope that there are those who wish to move faster and we wish to be certain that if we do move we shall not move alone if the united states are not distracted if they land on our back while we face the german empire anne had gone to the french embassy to pass along a message now she saw she was getting one in return i do not believe my dear colonel that you need concern yourself on that score ah vraiment colonel jusserand looked alert may i pass this interesting news on to my superiorsunofficially of course yesas long as it is unofficially anne answered he nodded they understood each other after some small talk she stood to go he bowed over her hand he even kissed it but it was politeness and politeness only no spark leaped anne could tell that politeness felt like a little death twenty years ago he would have drunk champagne front my slipper she thought bitterly as she left the embassy she hated the calendar hated the mirror and what it showed her every morning a handsome woman thats what you are she would almost rather have been ugly then she wouldnt have to remember the beauty she had been not so long ago she had walked to the french embassy it was only three blocks from her hotel she thought hard about taking a taxi back all the heat and humidity had manifested themselves while she talked with colonel jusserand the sun beat down from a sky like enameled brass the air was thick as porridge sweat rivered off her and had nowhere to go every step felt enervating stubbornly she kept on the hotel bar was airconditioned just then she would have crawled through broken glass to get out of the heat not many whites were on the sidewalks though plenty drove past but most of the pedestrians were negroes by their clothes a lot of them hadnt been in richmond long she had no trouble recognizing sharecroppers thrown off the land as farming grew increasingly mechanized shed seen plenty of them in st matthews some of them turned to odd jobs in town others to petty theft the big farms the farms that raised cotton and tobacco and grain seemed to get on fine without them tractors and harvesters could do the work of scores even hundreds of men scuse me maam but could you spare me a quarter a gaunt colored man asked touching the brim of his straw hat is powerful hungry anne walked past him as if he didnt exist she heard him sigh behind her how many times had whites pretended not to see him she didnt care if he thought she was heartless hed been old enough to carry a rifle in the uprisings during the war as far as she was concerned that meant she couldnt trust him she was glad a good number of policemen and freedom party stalwarts tramped along the streets she walked past three or four more black beggars before getting back to fords hotel one of them cursed softly when she went by without taking notice of him he couldnt have been in richmond long or he would have got used to being ignored at the hotel the colored doorman in his magnificent uniform smiled and bowed as he held the door open for her before the war she would have taken that subservience as no less than her due now she wondered what lay behind itwondered and had no trouble coming up with a nasty answer when she strode into the bar she let out a sigh of relief the cold air gushing from the vents seemed a blessing from on high she ordered a gin and tonic and took the drink back to a small table five minutes later she was fighting not to shiver shed never imagined that air conditioning could be too effective but it was here she felt as if shed gone from subtropical richmond to somewhere just north of the arctic circle a bespectacled officera colonel she saw by the three stars on his collar tabssitting at the bar picked up his drink and carried it over to her table may i join you he asked his accent sounding more like a yankees than that of a man from the csa clarence she said and sprang to her feet to give him a hug wonderful to see you againits been years i remember when you got your name in the papers at the olympics but id forgotten they put you back in uniform had to find something to do with me clarence potter answered lightly but with a hint of bitterness underneath how have you been anne you still look damn good she couldnt remember the last time a man told her something like that and sounded as if he meant it when she and clarence had briefly been lovers down in south carolina nothing personal drove them apart but shed backed the freedom party while he despised jake featherston despite the saying politics had unmade them as bedfellows imwell enough she said she and potter both sat down she couldnt help asking what do you think of the plebiscites im amazed he said simply if youd told me five years ago that we could annoy the united states into calling elections theyre bound to lose if youd told me we could get kentucky back without going to war i would have said you were out of your everloving mind thats what i would have said but i would have been wrong not many men as anne knew too well ever admitted they were wrong for any reason all the same she couldnt help asking and what do you think of the president now hes sharper than you figured i never figured he wasnt sharp i figured he was crazy potter didnt hold his voice down hed never been shy about saying what he thought and hed never worried much about what might come after that after a sip at his own drinkanother gin and tonic anne sawhe went on if he is crazy though hes crazy like a fox so maybe im the one who was crazy all along you cant argue with what hes accomplished she noticed he still separated the accomplishments from the man in the csa these days people were encouragedto put it mildlyto think of jake featherston and his accomplishments as going together no clarence had never been one to join the common herd anne didnt mind that neither had she what are you doing in the army these days she asked intelligence same as before he answered and then not another word given the four he had used that wasnt surprising after a moment he asked a question of his own why did you come up to richmond parce que je peut parler franзais bien she said it didnt faze him he nodded as if shed given him a puzzle piece he needed he hesitated again then asked how long are you going to be here another few days she looked him in the eye shall we make the most of it shed never been coy and the older she got the less point to it she saw that didnt faze him either he nodded again why not he said colonel irving morrell didnt think hed ever seen people dance in the streets before not outside of a bad musical comedy on the cinema screen here in lubbock people were dancing in the streets dancing and singing plebiscite and yanks out and whatever other lovely lyrics they could make up the people of the state of houston had been his fellow citizens ever since it joined the usa after the great war if hed been carrying a machine gun instead of the on his belt he would have gunned down every single one of them he saw and he would have smiled while he did it too sergeant michael pound who strode down the sidewalk with him was every bit as appalled as he was what are they going to do with us sir once we have to get out of this state the gunner asked i dont know morrell said tightly hed tried not to think about that he couldnt help thinking about it but hed done his best not to sergeant pound on the other hand seemed to take a perverse pleasure in analyzing what had just happened he probably enjoys picking scabs off to watch things bleed too morrell thought this is a defeat sirnothing but a defeat pound said how many divisions would those confederate sons of bitches have needed to run us out of here more than theyve got by god ill tell you that democracy morrell answered will of the people president smith says so before sergeant pound could replycould say something that might perhaps have been prejudicial to good disciplineone of the local revelers whirled up to the us soldiers and jeered now you damnyankee bastards can get your asses out of texas and go to hell where you belong colonel morrell did not pause to discuss the niceties of the situation with him he punched him in the nose instead sergeant pound kicked the reveler on the way down he didnt get up again anybody else morrell asked the had left its holster and appeared in his right hand with almost magical speed before president smith and president featherston agreed on the plebiscite the us officer would have touched off a riot by slugging a houstonian now the rest of the dancers left him and sergeant pound alone theyd already got most of what they wanted and morrell knew they would get the rest as soon as the votes from the plebiscite were counted and most of them didnt want to give the us army big overt provocations any more those could jeopardize what theyd been screaming for sergeant pound must have been thinking along with morrell for he said freedom party goons will probably thump that bigmouthed son of a bitch harder than we ever did good morrell said and said no more a womana genteellooking middleaged womansaid something inflammatory about us soldiers and their affections for their mothers morrell still held the in his hand ever so slightly his index finger tightened on the trigger he willed it to relax after a few seconds the rebellious digit obeyed his will an army truck took morrell and pound out of lubbock and back to the army base outside of town as far as morrell could tell army bases and colored districts were the only parts of houston where anybody still gave a damn about the usa a young lieutenant waylaid morrell as soon as he jumped down from the truck sir brigadier general macarthur wants to see you in his office right away thank you morrell said in lieu of something more pungent sergeant pound went on his way a free man morrell sighed the guards outside macarthurs office glowered at him despite his uniform as he approached but relaxed and passed him through when they recognized him and decided he wasnt an assassin in disguise he saluted daniel macarthur reporting as ordered sir the lanternjawed us commander in houston returned the salute then waved morrell to a chair easier to fiddle sitting down while rome burns eh colonel sir i just had the pleasure of coldcocking one of those goddamn houstonian bastards morrell explained exactly what hed done on the streets of lubbock and why the only thing he didnt do was name michael pound the responsibility was his not the sergeants macarthur heard him out i have two things to say about that the general said when he was done the first is by this time tomorrow jake featherstons pet wireless stations will be baying about another damnyankee atrocity in the occupied lands morrells opinion about where the president of the csa could stick his wireless stations was anatomically improbable but no less heartfelt on account of that sideways he added indeed daniel macarthur stuck a cigarette into the long long holder he affected he lit it and blew out a cloud of smoke the second thing i have to say colonel is that im jealous you have no idea how jealous i am you keep managing to hit back while ive had to turn the other cheek again and again and again its enough to make me wonder about christianity it truly is er yes sir morrell said not knowing how else to respond to that on the whole though things have been a lot quieter since president smith agreed to the plebiscite of course they have brigadier general macarthur exploded the miserable fool has given the confederate states exactly what theyve always wanted is it any wonder that theyre willing to take it no wonder at all morrell agreed sir if smith had told featherston to go jump in a lake do you think the confederates would have gone to war with us over houston and kentucky and sequoyah i would have liked to see them try macarthur answered with a contemptuous snort i dont care how fast theyre rearming there is such a thing as fighting out of your weight thats what infuriates me so theyll likely win with the ballot box what they couldnt on the battlefield morrell wondered about that hadnt houston and kentucky and sequoyah been battlefields for the past several years that was the way it seemed to him the confederates sympathizers had taken a lot more casualties than theyd inflicted on the us army and us sympathizers in the disputed states but they hadnt cared theyd thought it was all worthwhile the united states hadnt held the same opinion about the losses theyd suffered in the end that made all the difference daniel macarthur saw things the same way we have sustained a total unmitigated defeat he said michael pound had said the same thing without the fancy adjectives being a general entitled macarthur to use them in fine rhetorical fettle he went on do not let us blind ourselves the road to the ohio the road that points to pittsburgh and the great lakes has been broken throughout these days the president has believed in addressing mr featherston with the language of sweet reasonableness i have always believed he was more open to the language of the mailed fist yes sir morrell said i wish i could have punched him instead of that fanatic a little while ago punched whom macarthur asked smith or featherston that was an interesting questionto say nothing of inflammatory it was so interesting morrell pretended he hadnt heard it he asked a question of his own if things really have quieted down around here sir what do we do till they finally hold the plebiscite we get ready to leave macarthur said bluntly or do you think the usa will win the vote if we were going to win this vote sir they wouldnt need the army to hold the lid on here morrell said macarthur nodded thats how i see it too the other thing well do is make sure all the eligible niggers in houston come out and vote in the plebiscite it wont help morrell said well still lose i am aware of that thank you daniel macarthur might have been talking to the village idiot colonel morrells ears heated his superior went on nevertheless the more independence those people show the more trouble theyll cause the confederate state after we lose the election well yes sir morrell allowed but they wont cause all that much trouble on account of there arent enough of them in houston and the confederates have never been shy about shooting negroes whenever they thought they needed to with featherston in the saddle they dont even think twice have you any other observations to make macarthur asked icily no sir morrell knew he couldnt very well observe that brigadier general macarthur had a thin skin and couldnt stand having anybody disagree with him it was true enoughmacarthurs chagrin just now showed how true it wasbut the other officer would only get angrier if he said so sure enough macarthur imperiouslyand imperiallypointed toward the door with the cigarette holder in that case colonel you are dismissed morrell gave him a salute extravagant in its adoration his aboutface would have won praise from a drill sergeant on a west point parade ground as he marched out of the brigadier generals office though he reflected that he was probably wasting irony macarthur would accept the gestures as no less than his due back during the war general custer had shown the same sort of blindness come to think of it macarthur had served under custer during the war had he learned that sort of arrogance from the past master possible morrell decided but not likely odds were macarthur would have been a cocksure son of a bitch even if hed never met george armstrong custer the guards outside the office saluted morrell he returned their salutes in proper casual style they hadnt done anything to raise his blood pressure no that distinction belonged to the us commandant in houstonand to all the houstonians who didnt want to belong to the united states he blamed them less than he blamed daniel macarthur he and macarthur were supposed to be on the same side instead of going back to boq and getting drunk at the bar or brooding in his hot airless little cubicle morrell headed over to the barrel park the big lumbering machines were always breaking down even when they werent broken down they needed constant maintenance to keep running the way they were supposed to getting his hands and his uniform dirty was at least as good a way of blowing off steam as getting a snootful of whiskeyand he wouldnt have a thick head in the morning either he wasnt surprised to find michael pound in the barrel park fiddling with a carburetor hello sir the sergeant said and how is the grand high panjandrum today im going to pretend i didnt hear that morrell said sternly suppressing the urge to snicker and youre goddamn lucky im going to pretend i didnt hear it too yes sir sergeant pound said innocently well in that case how is brigadier general macarthur he sounded no more respectful than he had a moment earlier since irving morrell wasnt feeling particularly respectful toward the commandant he overlooked the sergeants tone this time brigadier general macarthur doubts that the usa can win the upcoming plebiscite morrell said he is unhappy about returning houston to the csa that was like canned rationsit kept the substance and lost the flavor and was there any us soldier in houston happy about returning houston to the confederacy if there was morrell hadnt met him sergeant pound asked does he suggest anything we can actually do about it such as morrell said president smith has the right to do what he wants here if he thinks a plebiscite is a good idea he can order one if he thinks a plebiscite is a good idea hes an idiot pound said well pay for it down the road probably not very far down the road either once more morrell wished he thought the sergeant was wrong colonel clarence potter was about as happy as a naturally dour man could be part of his somber joy came from the upcoming plebiscite for more than twenty years hed wanted to see the stolen states brought back into the confederacy and now it seemed they would be he gave jake featherston all the credit in the world for that he gave it reluctantly but not insincerely hed thought jake was out of his mind maybe jake was but hed read al smith like a book and part of potters present happiness had very little to do with jake featherstonat least directly hed never been a man who had extraordinary luck with women hed never married and hed never come particularly close to marrying like a fisherman he had sometimes talked about the one that got away for him that had been anne colleton theyd always got on well down in south carolina but he hadnt been able to stand the freedom party and shed ended up backing it that had been plenty to keep the two of them from staying together potter had thought he would never see her again except possibly over gunsightsand he hadnt been sure which of them would be aiming the gun now now lazy in the afterglow he sprawled on the bed in fords hotel you see he said you just wanted me to tell you i was wrong well of course anne answered and poked him in the ribs what else does a woman want to hear from a man how about i love you how about youre beautiful potter suggested those are nice too she agreed with a smile as far as im concerned though nothings better than you were right he believed her he didnt tell her so she was too likely to take it the wrong way to think he meant she was tough and bossy and as a matter of fact he did think she was tough and bossy to his way of thinking though that was a compliment he had as little use for a woman who couldnt take care of herself as for a man who couldnt take care of himself you are beautiful you know he said the smile didnt just fade it blew out like a candle flame i used to be she said bleakly you dont need to butter me up clarence i know whats there when i look in the mirror youre not young any more so what potter shrugged the motion made the mattress shake beneath him im no spring chicken these days either and have you looked at all of you in a mirror lately he ran a hand along the length of her youve got nothing to worry about like hell i dont anne said my tits sag im thick in the middle and im spread in the butt youre not young any more so what he said again you still look damn good i might lie but do you think he would hes either sincere or he doesnt work at all especially at my age anne laughed a moment later though she rolled over onto her stomach and started sobbing into her pillow startled potter put a hand on her shoulder she shook it off whats the matter he asked honestly bewildered you son of a bitch she said her voice muffled i dont remember the last time a man made me cry i didnt think anybody could any more and then you went and did it i didnt mean to he said i know she sat up a wry smile on her tearstreaked face if youd been trying you couldnt have done it in a million years you caught me offguardand look what happened no no no potter shook his head thats what the united states are supposed to say to us one of these days anne laughed but she nodded too oh yes she leaned forward hed caught her interest in a different waywhich was probably just as well since he wasnt good for more than one round a day himself any more she asked how likely is it how soon he shrugged again all i know is what i read in the newspapers like that comic from sequoyah says anne colleton laughed again this time at him tell me another one colonel potter if you cant tell me who can the president most likely potter answered but believe me he doesnt confide in colonels that wasnt altogether true from things potter had heard and from others that had crossed his desk he could make what he thought were some pretty good guesses about how things might go he didnt tell her what they were with another woman he would have been joking about the president but anne knew jake featherston could jake put her up to finding out whether one clarence potter colonel in intelligence ran off at the mouth potter didnt think so but he wasnt a hundred percent sure she pointed an accusing redtipped fingernail at him so you wont talk eh not me not a word nothing but name rank and pay number he rattled them off wild horses couldnt pull more out of me who said anything about wild horses annes voice went soft and breathy a mischievous glint sparked in her eyes wild horses went out with the covered wagons what we do these days is she started doing it after a while potter discovered there were still days when he was good for more than one roundwith sufficient encouragement that is panting his heart pounding he said my goodness tortures certainly come up in the world since the last time i ran into it i should hope so this is a highclass outfit here as if to prove as much anne pulled up the sheet and daintily dabbed at her chin then she assumed what she fondly imagined to be a us accent and said so tell me the score colonel if its all the same to you i think id rather hold out for more torture he said she poked him in the ribs again hard enough to come closer to torture than hed looked for monster she said he made as if to salute she made as if to poke him one more time instead she aimed that forefinger at him once more this time as if it were the barrel of a tredegar all right you you impossible person be that way dont tell me what you know tell me what you think you cant get in trouble for thinking as seriously as he could potter answered i think that if i tell you what i think ill get in trouble for telling you what i think she started to get angry so did he he went on dammit anne what do you think my job is finding out secrets and keeping them thats what how long do you think i could do it if i ran my mouth like a heavy freight tearing downhill with the brakes gone every once in a while when she heard the plain truth it would disarm her completely clarence remembered that from the days of their unhappy affair in south carolina it was one of the things hed liked most about her then now he saw it again i hadnt looked at it like that she admitted in a small voice never mind he sat up in bed put on his glasses and swung his feet down to the carpet still wondering whether hed passed his own test hers or jake featherstons through the gauzy curtains on the window he could see people bustling along the paths in capitol square and others lying on the grass in the shade of the trees doing their best to fight the oppressive weather on the sidewalk down below the window a negro said spare some change for a hungry man spare some change for a hungry man spare some change for oh god bless you maam i wouldnt give a nigger a dime anne said coldly i wouldnt give a nigger a penny by god if they cant find work to hell with them let em starve clarence judiciously pursed his lips a lot more of them looking for work these days you know with tractors and farm machinery driving sharecroppers off the land yes ive seen that so what she said if they cant figure out some way or another to make themselves useful who needs them the whole country would be better off without them would it i wonder whod do the nigger work without niggers machines could do a lot of it the way they do on a farm anne answered some of it anyway clarence admitted but where are you going to get a machine that waits on tables or cuts somebodys hair if we didnt have niggers whites would need to do things like that he started getting dressed it could happen anne said stubbornly i do all sorts of things for myself i used to have servants do back before the war i suppose so potter said nigger work must get done in the usa too and they dont have that many niggers to do it but things are different here an awful lots of whites here say i may be poor and stupid but by god im white and im better off than those niggers and i dont have to do the things they do slyly he added an awful lot of them vote freedom too anne colleton didnt rise to the bait she just nodded i know they do but if they didnt have any choice theyd do what needs doing if we had another war we could even make them feel patriotic about doing what needs doing at first potter thought that was one of the most monstrously cynical things hed ever heard and hed heard some doozies then he realized that no matter how cynical it was it probably wasnt wrong he leaned over and kissed her do you want to write that down and pass it on to the president or do you want me to do it he asked whichever you please she answered but what do you want to bet hes already thought of it himself clarence thought it over he didnt need to think very long i wont touch that one he said youre bound to be right featherston was plenty cynical enough to use patriotism to get people to do what he wantedand plenty good enough at leading to get them to follow one of us ought to do it anne said just on the off chance it hasnt occurred to him ill take care of it then potter said knotting his butternut tie unless you really want to i mean no its all right go ahead anne laughed the funny thing is here we are both trying to give him good advice and he doesnt trust either one of us as far as he can throw us weve known him too long and weve known him too well and at one point or another weve both stood up and told him no potter said that doesnt happen to him very often and he doesnt much like it true anne laughed again on a lower less amused note and now were both following his orders even so everybody follows his orders these days hes the president potter set his shinypeaked officers cap on his head hes the president and hes been right how do you lick a combination like that as far as i can see youre better off joining him would he have said that before jake featherston brought him back into the army he knew he wouldnt but that was almost four years ago now and in serving featherston he also served his country his country counted most so he told himself and told himself and george enos carefully coiled the last line that had held sweet sue to t wharf the fishing boats diesel rumbled under his feet pungent exhaust poured from the stack the sweet sue began to move although for the first few seconds it seemed more as if the boat were standing still and the wharf sliding away from it but then there could be no doubt the fishing boat was leaving boston and boston harbor behind george let out a slightly hungover sigh of relief hed been putting to sea for his entire adult life almost half of his thirty years but hed never been so glad to watch his home town slide below the horizon as he had this past year and a little more if he didnt have to look at boston he didnt have to be remindedso muchof the place where that writer son of a bitch had shot his mother and then shot himself hed told her ernie was no goddamn good for her told her and told her his sister had told her the same thing fat lot of good it did i shouldnt have just talked he thought for the thousandth time i should have kicked the crap out of that bastard his fists clenched his jaw knotted his teeth ground he hadnt done it and it was too late now it would always be too late he was so lost in his own gloom he jumped when somebody clapped him on the back how you doin junior johnny oshea asked im all right johnny george answered it wasnt really true but the older man couldnt do anything about what ailed him nobody could not even himself you looked a little green there oshea said fiddling with one upturned end of his oldfashioned gray kaiser bill mustache he was a wiry little fellow whose strength and endurance belied his sixty years he and a few other oldtimers whod known georges father were the only ones who called him junior george didnt mind anything that helped him connect to his old man was welcome george had only vague memories of him hed been just seven when that confederate submersible sank the uss ericsson before that his father had been in the navy or on a fishing boat most of the time if the sweet sue sinks tomorrow my kids wont remember me at all theyre too little that was a hell of a cheerful thought with which to put to sea he realized he hadnt answered johnny a little too much beer last night thats all he said ill be all right talking about the other would have shown weakness he refused osheas laugh showed missing teeth a few stubs stained almost the color of tobacco juice and a plug of chewing tobacco big enough to choke a clydesdale a little too much beer he said a little sweet jesus christ what a milkandcookies lot weve raised up to take our places when were gone when i was your age and id be going out to sea the next morning id drink till i couldnt see and fuck till i couldnt get it up for a month afterwards and let the skipper worry about having me on board when we got going if youre gonna do these things for gods sake do em right george had made sure connie had something to remember him by too that was one of the reasons he hadnt drunk too much to excess if you didnt know who you were your john henry wouldnt know who he was either he was damned if he felt like talking about what hed done in the bedroom though instead his voice sly he asked how about last night for you then oh i got drunk oshea said take enough aspirins drink enough coffee and that aint so bad the next day and i found me a girl too but ill tell you something junior and its a goddamn fact enough fucking so you cant get it up for the next month is a hell of a lot less when youre my age than it is when youre yours he spat a stream of tobacco juice into the sea a lot of men would have sounded bitter saying something like that johnny oshea thought it was funny he slapped george on the back and went off to chin with one of the other fishermen he got even less in the way of response from carlo lombardi than he had from george aspirins and coffee might have been enough to beat johnnys hangover but carlo looked as if hed been ridden hard and put away wet under his perennial fiveoclock shadow his face was fishbelly pale he had a hat jammed down low over his eyes to shield them from the sun and they were nothing but bloodshot slits he answered oshea in monosyllables and then stopped answering him at all johnny thought that was funny too george didnt hed been where carlo was a few timeswell maybe more than a few timesand he hadnt enjoyed it a bit a couple of the other fishermen looked as much the worse for wear as lombardi by the time they got out to the grand bank theyd be sober enough the only liquor aboard the sweet sue was a bottle of medicinal brandy under lock and key in the galley every so often captain albert would dole out a nip as a reward for a job well done davey hatton whose territory the galley was had also been known to pour out a little brandy every now and then but that was unofficial even if the skipper winked at it back in georges fathers day most fishing boats leaving t wharf had made for georges bank about five hundred miles offshore some still did but georges bank had been fished so hard for so long it didnt yield what it had the grand bank though out by newfoundland seemed inexhaustible some people said basque fishermen had been taking cod and tuna there since before columbus discovered america george enos didnt know anything about that one way or the other he did know there were a hell of a lot of fish left boston sank below the edge of the sea he wasnt sorry to see it go or all the little islands that marked the way into the harbor a couple of miles off to port a us navy minesweepernot a very big warship but a giant when measured against fishing boatsopened up with its guns a few seconds later a big column of water rose from the atlantic the flat harsh crack of the explosion took ten or twelve seconds to reach the sweet sue when it did carlo lombardi looked as if he wished his head would fall off or maybe as if it just had george felt the blast in his teeth and sinuses too even so he nodded in satisfaction theres one mine we wont have to worry about any more he muttered during the war the usa had mined the approaches to boston harbor to a faretheewell to make sure confederate and british raiders and submarines couldnt sneak in and raise hell and the confederates had sown mines to give us shipping a hard time some of those mines still floated in place some of the ones that had been moored came loose with the passage of years and drifted free a menace to navigation fishing boats and the occasional freighter blew up and sank with all hands finding mines and disposing of them had kept the navy hopping since the end of the war and how long would it be before the navy stopped sweeping for mines and started laying them again george didnt like the headlines coming out of the states that had changed hands between the csa and the usa president smith was loudly declaring hed removed the last reasons for war on the north american continent george hoped he was right as far as he could see everybody hoped the president was right gulls glided along overhead they always followed fishing boats hoping for handouts from the garbage and offal that went over the side they did better when the boats were farther out to sea and actually fishing but that didnt keep them from being optimistic whenever they saw fishermen george stopped in the cramped little galley for a mug of coffee he took it up to the sweet sues bow and drank it there the hot sweet creamy brew and the fresh breeze from the fishing boats passage helped submerge the last of his headache his cure wasnt so drastic as johnny osheas but he hadnt hurt himself so badly the night before either going out to the grand bank was a long haul once the ocean surrounded the sweet sue on all sides she might not have been moving at all no landscape changed to prove she was every so often she would pass an inbound fishing boat captain albert would get on the wireless then doing his best to find out exactly where the fish were biting best when my old man went to sea his boat didnt even have wireless george thought he remembered his mother saying his father hadnt know that crazy serb had blown up the austrian archduke till he got back to t wharf after a fishing trip and when a confederate commerce raider captured him and sank his boat his skipper back then hadnt been able to yell for help hed been interned in north carolina for months before the confederates finally let him go on georges first night in the tiny cramped bunk up at the bow he tossed and turned and slept very badly he always did his first night at sea hed got used to a bed that didnt shift under him to one where he could roll over without falling out to one where he could sit up suddenly without banging his headhell to one with connie in it sweet and warm and mostly willing he knew hed be all right tomorrow but tonight was tough more coffee persuaded his eyes they really did want to stay open the next morning he poured in the cream as if there were no tomorrow so did everybody else even on ice it wouldnt stay fresh through the cruise so they enjoyed it while they could by the same token davey hatton did up enormous plates of scrambled eggs for the fishermen by god cookie yesterday idve puked these up johnny oshea said this morning theyre goddamn good he shoveled another forkful into his face hatton was a round redfaced man with a barbed wit if somebodyd lit a match under your nose yesterday he couldve used your breath for a blowtorch he replied today youre on your way to remembering your name fuck you johnny said sweetly the cook nodded thereyou see i knew that was it the men in the crowded galley laughed even johnny laughedhe knew hed lost that round when the sweet sue finally got out to the grand bank there was little more time for laughter boats from the usa the csa the republic of quebec occupied canada and newfoundland britain ireland france and portugal bobbed here and there on the ocean captain albert found a place at the edge of one pack of boats and started fishing george lost track of how many big hooks he baited with frozen squid the process was as automatic as breathing for him if hed thought about it he probably would have stuck himself every so often somebody did then it was the nasty business of pushing the barb through and snipping it off the even nastier business of iodine and if a man hadnt had one in a while a tetanus shot from the firstaid kit and with his hand bandaged hed go back to fixing hooks but when the lines came in when the lines came in work really started gaffing a wriggling tuna that weighed as much as a man gutting it kicking the offal over the side and getting the fish into the ice in the hold went on hour after hour sometimes it wouldnt be a tunait would be a tuna head proof that a shark had found the fish first off the hook over the side sometimes a shark would be on the hook gaff him gut him so he stayed dead and pitch him overboard the endless fishing went on for the next three weeks by then the sweet sue had more than twenty tons of tuna in her hold and rode noticeably lower in the water than she had when she set out from t wharf george still didnt know how good a trip it was he wouldnt till the skipper sold the tuna but he knew he was finally ready to head back to boston after all he had to remind his kids who he was brigadier general abner dowling was not a happy man he felt betrayed not only by the war departmentwhich would have been nothing tremendously unusualbut also by the entire government of the united states having the whole government gang up on him didnt happen every day but dowling certainly felt it had happened here hed come to covington to help keep kentucky in the united states hed got a good start on doing just that too and then al smith had jerked the rug out from under him by going to richmond and agreeing to a plebiscite the only way the usa could win that plebiscite would be for jesus christ to appear in louisville and curse jake featherston with words that glowed like burning coalsand even then it would be close now ironically what dowling was watching over was the presidential election campaign up till al smith said there would be a plebiscite after all he couldnt have got elected dog catcher in kentucky now red socialist posters were everywhere in covington they showed smiths face and the slogan the happy warriorhes kept us out of war more went up all the time too the democrats were running senator bob taftson of longtime congressman william howard taftfrom across the river in ohio in a normal year he would have scored well in conservative kentucky this wasnt a normal year nor was kentucky a normal state the freedom party had ambushed the local democrats from the right and the freedom party taking its cue from richmond was loudly for smith besides taft had denounced the plebiscite like most democrats he remained in favor of holding on to the gains the usa had made in the great war that would have doomed him here anyway isnt it grand dowling said at supper one evening kentucky will vote socialist in february and then itll vote freedom in january tell me how that makes sense all the officers with whom he was eating were junior to him of course none of them ventured to claim that it didnt make sense or that he was worrying too much a major did say at least the freedom party is on its best behavior from now until january bully dowling exploded which made the younger officers look at one another he caught the looks and knew why they made them they didnt say bully and they thought only dinosaursanyone who remembered the nineteenth century certainly qualifieddid dowling was too exercised to care he went on of course those bastards will be on their best behavior they dont have to blow things up any more to get what they want all they have to do is wait wouldnt you be on your best behavior too uh yes sir the major replied the only trouble is their being quiet goes a long way toward making our presence here irrelevant wouldnt you say like hell i would dowling growled if we werent here if we werent doing the job were supposed to do how much worse would things be the major being only a major did not presume to contradict that helped ease dowlings minda little he kept up a bold front not least for the sake of the men he commanded he wasnt about to admit he thought his presence in kentucky was irrelevant he wouldnt admit it to anyone but himself anyhow when he looked at the name of the man with whom he had his first appointment the next morning it rang a bell he went through some files and nodded to himself the homework hed done before taking command in covington had paid off good morning mr wood he said when the man strode into his office and what can i do for you today lucullus wood held out his hand dowling reached out and shook it with he hoped no noticeable hesitation even if he wasnt used to treating a negro as his social equal wood was in his early or midthirties a wideshouldered man blocky rather than fat with high cheekbones and an arched nose that argued he might have a little indian blood in him without preamble he said kentucky got troubles general yes indeed dowlings voice was dry do you aim to stop them or cause more before answering wood sat down across from dowling dowling hadnt invited him to but he didnt say anything when the black man smiled he looked like a predatory beast depends on for who you mean he answered adding reckon you know who i am then when i got here they told me you made the best barbecue in town dowling said ive tried it they were right hell they was lucullus wood sounded affronted i make the best barbecue in the whole goddamn state so did my old man dowling looked down at the notes hed taken your father was apicius wood i hope im saying that right he waited for the negro to nod then went on and one after the other you and he have been the two biggest reds in town or are you the two biggest reds in the whole goddamn state woods blinked at that after a moment he decided to laugh maybe he was maybe i is maybe we aint never been he said folks who talk about that stuff they dont always do it folks who do it they dont always talk about it well if you dont do it if youve never done it why am i wasting my time talking to you dowling asked tell me what youve got on your mind and well see if we can do some business lucullus wood blinked again you aint what i reckoned you would be he said slowly abner dowlings shrug made his chins quiver life is full of surprises now come on mr wood piss or get off the pot come january a lot of colored folks is gonna want to git the hell out of kentucky wood said reckon you got some notion why we wont stop them dowling answered theyre us citizens we will respect that some whites will want to leave the state too some a few wood spoke with dismissive scorn some colored folks though some colored folks is gonna stay dunno how many but some will some damn fools in every crowd i suppose if i were a negro i wouldnt stay in kentucky dowling said woods eyes went to the shiny silver star on the right shoulderboard of dowlings greengray uniform dont suppose they lets no damn fools turn into generals he remarked as far as dowling was concerned that only proved the colored man didnt know as much about the us army as he thought he did custer for instance had worn four stars not just one but custer while doubtless often a fool had been a very peculiar kind of fool and so with an effort dowling tore his thoughts away from the man hed served for so long fair enough he said to lucullus wood im sure youre right about what will happen some negroes will stay here some people dont know to get out of a burning building till too late either but if the us army has to leave kentucky after the plebiscite what concern to us are they if we was white folks you wouldnt talk like that about us wood didnt try to hide his scorn dowling wondered if a negro had ever reproached him like that before he didnt think so he hadnt dealt with a whole lot of negroesnot many people in the usa hadand the ones he had dealt with were all in subordinate positions after a deep angry exhalation wood went on you reckon the niggers in kentucky gonna like all them damn white bastards runnin around yellin freedom all the goddamn time i wouldnt dowling answered if hed called negroes niggers lucullus wood might have tried to murder him being one himself wood could use the label but then that thought slipped away and another took its place what do you suppose theyll want to do about it anger dropped away from wood like a discarded cloak no general you aint no damn fool you got to understand i aint in love with the usa revolution comin to yall too but we gots to make a popular front with whoevers on our side even a little when it comes to them freedom party cocksuckers how much of a nuisance do you think your people can be and how much help do you want from the united states dowling asked the more we can set up before the plebiscite the better off well be more we kin set up before the plebiscite better off the usall be wood said cynically aint gonna be no more good times for the niggers here after that but i figure we kin raise some kind of trouble for the confederates when they comes marchin back in here it would be nice if you could arrange as much for them as the freedom party fanatics did for us here and in houston dowling said be nice for yall yeah but dont hold your breath on account of it aint gonna happen wood said lots mo white folks here and down there than there is niggers revolutionary he got to swim like a fish in the school of the people us blackfish we is a smaller school he didnt sound like an educated man but when it came to the business of revolution he spoke with an experts authority abner dowling found himself nodding i suppose youre right he said regretfully but if you people just happened to find some wireless sets and rifles and explosives lying around you might figure out what to do with them eh we might lucullus wood nodded too yes suh general we just might cipher out what theys for i ought to get war department authorization for this dowling thought he rejected the notion the minute it occurred to him the war department might not want to get officially involved in resisting confederate occupation then again some of the people in the war department might just get cold feet im here they put me in charge ill take care of things god damn it all right then he said well see to that and i know youre not doing us any special favors but what works against the csa works for the usa thats how things are wood nodded again thats how things is he agreed we is fellow travelers on this here road for a while even if wes goin different places fellow travelers brigadier general dowling tasted the phrase yes i can live with that you been fair to me general so i be fair to you wood said come the revolution we go different ways come the revolution i reckon i try an kill you nothin personal you understand but you is one o the pressors and you got to go to the wall fair is fair dowling said so ill tell you something too you want to be careful about threatening a man with a weapon in his hand he has a nasty habit of shooting back with a sour smile he too added nothing personal sure enough the negro said imperturbably them freedom party fellas they done found that out down further south reckon mebbe we teach em some new lessons here in kentucky is that a bargain thats a bargain dowling heaved himself to his feet and held out his right hand once more lucullus wood took it the negro dipped his head and sauntered out of dowlings office dowling looked down at his own right palm had he ever shaken a colored mans hand before today he didnt think so kentucky was proving educational in all sorts of ways sorry kid the man who shook his head at armstrong grimes didnt sound sorry at all he sounded as if hed said the same thing a million times before he doubtless sounded that way because he had i cant use you i want somebody with experience armstrong had heard that a million times since finally escaping high school his temper which had never been long snapped how the hell am i supposed to get experience if nobodyll hire me on account of i dont have any lifes tough the man in the hiring office answered which meant to hell with you jack ive got mine he lit a cigarette but didnt quite blow smoke in armstrongs face maybe his first long drag made him feel a little more like a human being because he unbent enough to say one way to do it is to oddjob for a while sometimes you can get hired by the day even if somebody doesnt want you for keeps yeah ive tried some of that armstrong said but its a day on and a week off itll take me forever to do enough of anything to get the experience to make anybody want to take me on for good and ill starve to death in the meantime the man looked him over other thing you could do is join the army youre a big strong fellow theyll take you unless you just got out of jail maybe even if you just got out of jail the way things are nowadays you can sure as hell learn a trade in there maybe armstrong said his father had made the same suggestion made it loudly and pointedly in fact that would have prejudiced him against the idea even if hed liked it to begin with they dont pay you anything much in the army and youre stuck there for three years if you volunteer have it your way pal you think i give a rats ass about what you do youve got another think coming the clerk behind the desk looked up at the line of poor hungry men desperate for work next seething armstrong stormed out of the hiring office if he hadnt thought the clerk would sic the cops on him he would have whaled the stuffing out of the bastard sitting there like a little tin jesus who the hell did he think he was but the answer to that was mournfully obvious he thinks hes a man whos got a job and the son of a bitch is right armstrong inquired at a furniture factory a trucking company and a joint that made polish sausages before heading for home no luck anywhere his old man wanted him out there tryinginsisted on it as a matter of fact if he didnt pound the pavement he wouldnt get fed merle grimes had been most painfully clear about that armstrong wished he thought his father were bluffing since he didnt when he got home he found his mother in tears he hadnt seen that since granny died what happened he exclaimed without a word she held out an envelope to him his name was typed on it the return address was printed in an oldfashioned hardtoread typeface government of the united states war department another smaller line below that said office of selection for service oh he said it felt like a punch in the breadbasket hed known it was possible of course but he hadnt thought it was likely oh shit edna grimes nodded thats what i said too armstrong when i saw the damn thing but theres nothing you can do about it if they conscript you and you pass the physical youve got to go yeah armstrong nodded glumly from some of the things hed heard the only way to flunk the physical was not to have a pulse too he did his best to look on the bright side of things if they conscript me its only for two years thats a year less than id spend if i joined up on my own i know but still his mother gave him a hug of the sort he hadnt had from her in years youre my baby armstrong i dont want you going off to be a soldier what if we have another war being his mothers baby didnt appeal to armstrong fighting a war did if you were going to be a soldier what point was there to being one when nothing was happening none he could see that he might get hurt or killed never crossed his mind he was after all only eighteen but he was smart enough to know that if he told his mother what he really thought shed pitch a fit so as soothingly as he could he said there wont be any war ma were giving the confederates those plebwhatchamacallits so theyve got nothing left to fight about jesus i hope youre right his mother said some people though if you give em an inch theyll want to take a mile the way the freedom party carries on im afraid theyre like that armstrongs little sister met the news that he was going to go off and be a soldier with complete equanimity so long annie said when do you leave not tonight you little brat he said she stuck out her tongue at him he wanted to belt her a good one but he knew he couldnt shed just go yelling to their mother and then hed end up in trouble annie was almost as big a pest as aunt clara who would no doubt hope he never came back when he went off to wherever theyd ship him for training when his father got home and found out though he slapped armstrong on the back and poured him a goodsized slug of whiskey something hed never done before congratulations son merle grimes said theyll make a man out of you since armstrong was already convinced he was a man that impressed him less than it might have to show what tough stuff he was he took a big gulp of the whiskey he hadnt done a lot of drinking the hooch felt like battery acid going down the pipe and exploded like a bomb in his stomach thats good he wheezed in a voice that sounded like a ghost of its former self glad you like it his father answered gravely if he knew that armstrong had just injured himself he was polite enough not to let on that was more discretion than he was in the habit of showing he took a smaller sip from his own glass and asked when do you go in for your preinduction physical next wednesday armstrong said i can hardly wait he meant that ironically but merle grimes took it seriously good he said thats real good you ought to be eager to do something for your country its been taking care of you all along right armstrong said tightly he could have done without his father sounding like a goddamn recruiting poster next wednesday naturally rain poured down in buckets armstrong had to walk three blocks from the trolley stop to the building where the government doctors waited to get their hands on him he was half soaked by the time he made it inside seeing several other guys his own age who were just as bedraggled as he was made him feel a little better more fellows with wet hair and pimples came in the door after him too a pair of clerks marched into the room at the same time as one was saying line up in alphabetical order by last name the other declared line up according to height after some confusion alphabetical order won armstrong would have ended up about the same place either way as a g he was fairly close to the head of the line but not right at it he was also taller than most of the young men there for their physicals but not a real beanpole either he had a chance to look things over before the system got to work on him first came the paperwork he would have bet money on that his old man made a living pushing papers around for the government and had plenty to do armstrong filled out about a million forms and carried them with him to the eye chart which came next the fellow in front of him had some trouble i can see the little bastards just fine he told the guy in the white coat in charge of the test only thing is i cant no way read em let me see your paperwork the man in the white coat said armstrong got a glimpse of a couple of pages too just about everything was blank the man in charge of the test frowned youre illiterate seeing the puzzled look on the young mans face he tried again you cant read and write fraid not the youth said i can sign my name thats about the size of it didnt you go to school a couple years i never was much good though i been workin ever since well uh slaughter no matter how good a name youve got for a soldier you need to be able to read and write to enter the army youre not even in the right place in line youll be excused from conscription i dont know if your exclusion will be permanent or if theyll class you as fit for service in an emergency but we wont take you now he glanced towards armstrong grimes next armstrong thought about pretending he couldnt read too too late thoughhed already filled out his paperwork and done it right he stepped up to the line and went down the chart as far as he could switching eyes when the man in the white coat told him to give me your papers the man said then nodded youve passed here proceed to the next station he saw even more guys in white coats than he had at the polish sausage works where hed tried to get a job they measured and weighed him one of them listened to his heart another one took his blood pressure another one this one with a brand new pair of rubber glovestold him to drop his pants turn his head to one side and cough as he did the man grabbed him in some highly intimate places no rupture he said and wrote on armstrongs papers now bend over and grab your ankles what armstrong said in alarm youre not going to but the man in the white coat was already doing it that was a lot less pleasant than being told to turn his head and cough prostate gland normal the man said he took off the gloves and tossed them into a corrugatediron trash can then he wrote on the papers again as soon as he gave them back he started putting on a fresh pair of gloves you must go through a lot of those armstrong said he pulled up his pants in a hurry still stinging a little you bet i do sonny the man in the white coat agreed all things considered would you rather i didnt armstrong hastily shook his head well neither would i the man said go on to the next station they drew blood there a big strapping fellow passed out just as armstrong arrived the fellow with the hypodermic syringe put it down in a hurry and managed to keep the big young man from banging his head on the floor he dragged him off to one side and glared at armstrong youre not going to faint on me are you this guy was the third one today roll up your sleeve i dont think i am armstrong said what do you need to do this for anyway see if youre anemic see if youve got a social disease see what your blood group is for transfusions hold still now the man swabbed the inside of his elbow with alcohol the needle bit armstrong looked away as the syringe filled with blood he felt a little queasy but only a little the man yanked out the needle stuck a piece of cotton fluff on the puncture and slapped adhesive tape over it he wrote on armstrongs papers thats it youre done did i pass armstrong asked unless youre anemic as hell or youve got syphilis you did the man replied youre healthy as a horse youll make a hell of a soldier oh boy armstrong said xvi hes kept us out of war flora blackford repeated the socialist party slogan to a streetcorner crowd in her district hes kept us out of war and hes done everything he could to keep food on the working mans table if you want to see what the democrats will do about that look at what herbert hoover did nothing thats what people in the mostly proletarian crowd clapped their hands a sprinkling of hecklers at the back started a chant taft taft robert taft flora pointed at them i served in congress with senator tafts father william howard taft was an honorable man so is robert taft i dont say any differently but i do say this senator taft would be horrified at the way his supporters are bringing freedom party tactics into this campaign that got more applause next to nobody in this strongly socialist district had a good word to say about jake featherstons gang but one of the hecklers yelled al smiths the one whos in bed with the freedom party al smith is against war i am against war i had a brotherinlaw killed and a brother badly wounded in the great war flora said if you are going to tell me you are for warif you are going to tell me senator taft is for waryou will have a hard time selling that to the people of this district taft is for keeping kentucky and houston the heckler called how can you keep a state in the country when its own people dont want to be here flora asked that was the lesson of the war of secessionyou cant some things you can buy at too high a price the crowd applauded again but less enthusiastically than before flora understood why they wanted to have their cake and eat it too to have peace and to hold on to kentucky and houston she wanted the same thing she understood the people who said the usa had sacrificed too much even to think about giving back the two states at least half the time she felt that way herself she would have liked the idea much better if it didnt involve giving them back to jake featherston i dont love the freedom party she said but it is in power in the confederate states and we cant very well pretend it isnt and hope it will go away what can we do if we dont try to deal with it she was trying to convince herself as well as her audience and she knew it id sock it in the nose that ironlunged heckler yelled taft will sock it in the nose no he wont flora shook her head if he does hell have a war on his hands and i cant believe he wants one he may talk tough but his foreign policy wont look much different from president smiths and his domestic policy she rolled her eyes he grows like an onionwith his head in the ground she said it in english some of the people her age and older in the crowd echoed it in yiddish she managed to get through the rest of her speech without too much harassment she had a pretty good idea why too the democrats didnt think they could beat her shed never lost an election in this district the democrats had elected a candidate here while she was first lady but shed trounced him as soon as she returned to the hustings at the end she said if youre in favor of what president smith has done youll vote for him again and youll vote for me if youre not youll vote for taft its about that simple my friends forward with smith or back with taft she stepped down from the platform with applause ringing in her ears when shed started agitating for the socialists she hadnt had a platformnot a real one shed made her first few speeches standing on crates or beer barrels she was right around the corner from the croton brewery where shed spoken at the outbreak of the great war shed opposed war then she still did in her party hadnt gone along with her this year it did why arent i happier then she wondered in the confederate states hadnt been that different from the united states most of the oppressed proletariat in the csa had been black but capitalists had oppressed workers almost as savagely in the usa now things were different now a middleaged man in a homburg limped up to her leaning on a stick good speech he said a soldiers circle pin showing a sword through his conscription year in a silver circle sparkled on his lapel thank you david flora said with a sigh that her own brother could belong to a reactionary organization like the soldiers circleand not only belong but wear the pin that showed he was proud to belonghad always dismayed her the soldiers circle wasnt the freedom party but some of its higherups wished it were good speech david hamburger repeated but im still going to vote for taft i hadnt expected anything different she said david had gone into the great war a socialist like the rest of the family hed come out a conservative democrat hed also come out with one leg gone above the knee flora had no doubt the two were related she asked and will you vote for chaim cohen too cohen was the latest democrat to try to unseat her her brother turned red no he said i dont like all of your ideasi dont like most of your ideasbut i know youre honest and youre family i dont let family down being family isnt reason enough to vote for me she said i think it is david laughed and you may not like my politics but at least i care about things did you see your sisters or your other brother or mother and father at your speech now flora was the one who had to say no sophie and esther and isaac had their own lives and lived them they were proud when she won reelection but they didnt even come to socialist party headquarters any more as for her parents mother and father dont get out as much as they did i know theyre getting old david shook his head theyve got old bis hindert und tzvantzik yuhr omayn flora said automatically though she know her mother and father wouldnt live to years people didnt however much you wished they would a stab of loss and longing for hosea pierced her she was grateful her parents had lived to grow old so many people didnt even in the modern world have you got plans for tonight or can you go to dinner with your reactionary tailor of a little brother david asked i can go flora said and its on me i know i make more money than you do she knew she made a lot more money than he did but she didnt want to say so out loud with his usual touchy pride david said im doing all right hed never asked her or anybody else for a dime so she supposed he was with a wry grin though he went on ill let you buy dont think i wont how does that go from each according to her abilities to each according to his needs something like that anyhow i never heard anybody quotei mean misquotemarx to figure out whos getting dinner before flora said and she couldnt help laughing since im buying how does kornblatts sound lets go her brother said so the delicatessen must have sounded good when they got there he ordered brisket and a schooner of beer flora chose stuffed cabbage which just wasnt the same in philadelphia what she got at kornblatts wasnt the same as what shed helped her mother make when she lived on the lower east side all the time but it came closer david attacked the brisket as if he hadnt eaten in weeks hed devoured almost all of it before he looked up and said you really think we ought to give back what we won in the war give it back to those freedomyelling mamzrim if the people who live there dont want to be part of the country how can we keep them flora asked they were pretty quiet till featherston started stirring them up david said which was true or at least close to true he speared his last bite of meat chewed it swallowed and went on if were not doing the same thing with the shvartzers in the csa were missing a hell of a chance i dont know anything about that flora said somebody ought to her brother said and somebody probably did if the united states werent trying to use negroes in the confederate states to make life difficult for the government there then the war department was indeed falling down on the job flora disliked a lot of the people and policies in the war department but she did not think the men at the top there were fools over almost a quarter of a century of public life shed learned the difference between someone who couldnt do his job and someone who simply disagreed with her about what the job should be say what you want she told david but wed just have endless trouble if we tried to keep those states david didnt reply with words not right away instead he rapped his artificial leg with his knuckles by the sound that came from it he might almost have been knocking on a door it was made of wood and canvas and leather and metal you know how many men like me there are in the usamen without legs men without arms men without eyes men without faces if we dont keep what we won why did we get shot and blown up and gassed answer me that one and then ill say goodbye to kentucky and houston and sequoyah there is no answer flora said sometimes something looks like a good idea when you do it but turns out not to be later on or havent you ever had that happen oh yes ive seen that who hasnt but this one is kind of large to treat that way and what do we do if giving back those states turns out to be that same kind of mistake taking them again would get expensive i dont know flora said well thats honest anyhow i said you were her brother replied does al smith know does anybody in the whole wide world know how can anybody know flora asked as reasonably as she could well just have to see how things turn out thats all david paused to light a cigarette he blew smoke up toward the ceiling then said seems to me thats a better reason for not doing something than for doing it but im no politician so what do i know its going to happen flora knew she sounded uncomfortable she couldnt help it she went on if it makes you that unhappy the thing to do is to vote for taft i think it will work out all right i hope it does i hope it does too but i dont think so the confederates on the banks of the ohio again david hamburger shook his head we had to worry about that for years and then we didnt and now we will again when they were on the ohio they didnt cross it in the last war flora said they didnt have barrels then they didnt have bombers then either her brother said even if they do get it back theyve promised to leave it demilitarized afterwards flora said oh yes theyve promised david nodded so tell mehow far do you trust jake featherstons promises flora wished he hadnt asked that shed deplored featherston in the us congress long before he was elected she liked him no better trusted him no further now that he was president of the csa as she had on the stump she said hes there we have to deal with him her brother let the words fall flat which left them sounding much worse than if hed tried to answer them chester martin faced election day with all the enthusiasm of a man going to a doctor to have a painful boil lanced his efforts to build a construction workers union in antilabor los angeles had got strong backing from the socialist party how could he forget that he couldnt but he couldnt make himself like the upcoming plebiscite either his wife had no doubts i dont want another war rita said i lost my first husband in the last one she hardly ever spoke of him but now she went on why should anybody else have to go through what i did if we dont have to fight thats good news to me but chester answered who says we wont al smith does thats who rita sent him an exasperated stare or are you going to vote for a democrat for president again look how well that turned out the last time i dont know im thinking about it chester said rita looked even more exasperated shed always been a socialist hed been a democrat through the great war but the only time hed voted for a democratic presidential candidate was in when hed chosen calvin coolidge over hosea blackford blackford had had three and a half years to end the business collapse and hadnt done it coolidge of course dropped dead three weeks before taking office and herbert hoover his running mate hadnt done it either for that matter neither had smith chester went on giving back so much of what we fought for sticks in my craw giving the country back to the democrats sticks in my craw rita said do you think taft cares about what youre trying to do here if you do youre nuts his father didnt stand with the producers and neither does he that had an unpleasant ring of truth plenty of people would think local issues were the most important ones in the election half the time chester did but the other half of the time he didnt he said if the confederates want houston and kentucky back and then theyre done thats one thing they say thats all rita reminded him he nodded i know what they say but jake featherston says all sorts of things if he gets them back and starts putting soldiers into them thats a different story if he does that weve got trouble on our hands even if he does we can beat the confederates again if we have to rita said if we tell them to pull back theyd have to back down wouldnt they who knows the point is we shouldnt have to find out chester muttered unhappily to himself he wanted a party with a strong foreign policy and he also wanted a party with a strong domestic policy trouble was the democrats offered the one and the socialists the other he couldnt have both maybe i ought to vote for the republicans then id have the worst of both worlds funny funny like a crutch his wife said well i cant tell you what to do but i know what im going to chester didnt he went through october and into november unsure and unhappy autumn in los angeles was nothing like what it had been in toledo it was the one season of the year where he might have preferred his old home town trees didnt blaze with color here most of them didnt even lose their leaves the air didnt turn crisp and clean either it rained once toward the end of october that was the only real way to tell summer was gone for good the sunday before the election it was back up to eightyone that wouldnt have happened in toledo but there was nothing wrong with sixtyone either fortyone and twentyone were different to say nothing of one los angeles might see fortyone as a low twentyone one never picketing was a lot easier when you werent freezing while you carried a sign chester and his fellow construction workers kept on getting help from the local socialist party he did grumble about the plebiscite with party men but never very loudly like most people he was shy about biting the hand that fed him the socialists probably wouldnt have dropped support for his young struggling union if they knew he might vote for taft but why take chances houses and apartment buildings and factories and shops went up all over los angeles and the surrounding suburbs but not many went up without pickets around the construction sites the los angeles times kept screaming that the pickets were nothing but a bunch of dirty reds who ought to be burned alive because hanging was too good for them but the times screamed that about everything it didnt like and it didnt like much strikers and cops began to learn to get along if not to love one another even the insults and cries of scab as men crossed the picket line came to have a certain ritualistic quality to them november dawned bright and clear though the day plainly wouldnt reach the eighties what are you going to do rita asked at breakfast vote martin reached for the pepper shaker and spread pungent black flakes over his fried eggs rita made an irritated noise how oh about like this he mimed picking up a stamp and making an x on a ballot with it thank you so much somehow no sarcasm flayed like a spouses his wife asked a question he couldnt evade who are you going to vote for to tell you the truth honey i wont know till i get inside the voting booth chester answered if you dont vote for al smith youll end up sorry rita said you were when you didnt vote for blackford eight years ago i know i was i think coolidge might have been better than hoover but well never know about that will we he spread butter and grape jam on a piece of toast then started to throw out the empty jam jar dont do that rita said ill wash it out and use it for a glass jelly glasses are better for carlthey dont hold as much as real ones and theyre thick so they dont break as easy if he drops them all right martin said with his mouth full he put the jam jar back on the table when he finished the toast he gave rita a quick greasy kiss stuck a cloth cap on his head and hurried out the door rita took a deep breath as if to call something after him but she didnt she must have realized it wouldnt change his mind the polling place was in the auditorium of an elementary school three or four blocks from the apartment chester got there as it opened as always the childsized chairs made him smile once upon a time hed fit into seats like those no more no more he gave his name and address to the whitemustached man in charge of the list the man matched it against the entry then handed him a ballot take any empty voting booth he droned how many times had he said that and in how many elections how many more would he say it today there it was the big question right at the top of the ballot smith or taft taft or smith chester ignored the republicans candidate not many people outside of his native indiana cared about the businessman theyd nominated which meant they werent about to win with willkie besides how could a wendell hope to prevail against the brute simplicity of al and bob smith or taft taft or smith chester stamped the x by tafts name hoping he was doing the right thing had he voted for smith he would have had the same hope and would have been just as unsure of himself its done anyhow he thought and went down the rest of the ballot in a hurry most of the candidates he voted for were socialists that salved his conscience at least a little he carried the finished ballot back to the table where hed got it another old man took it folded it and thrust it through the slot in the ballot box mr martin has voted he intoned the words as formal and unchanging as any this side of the mass having voted chester martin hurried to the trolley stop he rode across town to westwood not far from the pacific and even closer to the southern campus of the university of california orange groves were going down houses were going up and union labor as usual in los angeles was being ignored hey chester another organizer called as he came up you vote yet sure did before i came here martin answered westwood wasnt bright and sunny fog lingered here and probably wouldnt burn off till midmorning how about you ralph ill take care of it on the way home ralph answered whod you vote for he winked and laughed uproariously he was sure he already knew which meant chester didnt have to tell him under the circumstances that came as something of a relief the strikers carried their picket signs around and around the construction site they stayed on the sidewalk once at a different site a man had stumbled and gone onto what would be a lawn the cops nabbed him for trespassing not here not today scabs the picketers shoutedalong with other things even less complimentarywhen workers crossed the picket line and went into the construction site they had to watch what they said too the police had been known to run strikers in for public obscenity still endearments like you stinking sack of manure got the message across most of the strikebreakers went in with their heads down watching them cross the picket line was one thing that made chester glad hed chosen this side he had yet to see a scab who didnt act as if his conscience bothered him a man might go and decide he had to eat any way he could but he seldom seemed happy about it one of the scabs here a big man on whom the picketers had showered a lot of abuse finally got fed up and shouted back wait till the pinkertons get into town you bastards theyll kick your asses but good not one but two foremen ran up to the strikebreaker they both started cussing him up one side and down the other the cops didnt jug them for the language they used any more than theyd arrested the scab chester didnt stop marching or yelling but he sure as hell did prick up his ears if the bosses were bringing in pinkerton men they were going to try breaking the union the more notice he had about that the better he could fight back because the pinkertons notorious unionbusters fought dirty really dirty if hed been one of those foremen he would have cussed out that scab too for tipping the other sides hand at lunch ralph came up to him and said pinkertons is it well therell be a hot time in the old town tonight you bet there will chester said we can lick em though theyre bastards sure as hell but we can lick em and if we do what have the bosses got left to throw at us soldiers whose side would they be on pinkertons ralph made a disgusted face i fought those fuckers years ago in pittsburgh never thought id see their ugly mugs again martin nodded same with me in toledo theyre goons all right you think were going to back down though i sure as hell dont ive got brass knucks and i can always get a if it looks like i need one the other union man looked worried you gotta be careful with that though you pull it the cops have the perfect excuse to blow you to kingdom come i know i know like i said i did this before chester said but i know something else tooif they get us on the run were in trouble i dont aim to let that happen cincinnatus driver refused to buy a paper as he steered his truck toward the railroad yard he was too disgusted to want to hear anything more about al smiths reelection than he had the night before on the wireless hed stayed up till the west coast returns came in and poured down three cups of coffee to try to make up for not enough sleep taft behind in the race had needed to sweep the coast to win enough electoral votes to overtake the president hed won in california but lost oregon and washingtonand the election theyre gonna hold the plebiscite cincinnatus thought dolefully theyre gonna hold it and the confederate states are gonna win that meant he had to get his mother and father out of kentucky before it left the usa and returned to the csa he knew what being a negro in the confederate states was likeand it was bound to be even worse now under jake featherston and the freedom party than it had been before the great war he wished his mother were in better shape than she was he could have sent his father and her train fare and they would have ended up in des moines not long afterwards as things were with her sinking ever deeper into her second childhood he knew he would have to go down to covington to help his father bring her out elizabeth wouldnt like ithe didnt like it himselfbut he saw no way around it he pulled into the railroad yard at a quarter to seven yawning despite all the coffee when he jumped out of his trunk and hurried over to see what cargoes he could pick up first one railroad dick and then another waved to him he was accepted here he belonged he never remembered inlonging in covingtoncertainly not in any part of it where he bumped up against white men the first conductor whose train he approached greeted him with hey cincinnatus how you doing not bad jack he answered he never would have called a white man in covington by his first name what you got but jack felt like gabbing four more years of smith he said im happy my son got conscripted not long ago and i dont want him getting shot at i saw too goddamn much of that myself twentyfive years ago that gave cincinnatus a new slant on things hed been shot at during the great war too if only as a truck driver behind the lines but he didnt have to worry about achilles getting conscripted the usa didnt conscript negroes any more than the csa did if war came achilles would be as safe as anybody even so cincinnatus said you wont find anybody colored who wants to go back to livin in the confederate states by the way jack blinked hed no more thought about that than cincinnatus had worried about conscription the white man said i dont suppose theres enough colored folks to change the vote though cincinnatus grimaced that was painfully true not wanting to dwell on the likely fate of kentucky and houston and perhaps sequoyah but kentucky mattered most to him he asked again what you got here furniture jack said and cincinnatus eyes lit up he and jack haggled for a while but not too long he loaded the truck as full as he could then roared off for the shops taking delivery if he got rid of everything in a hurry he thought he could be back for another equally profitable load by lunchtime he was too plenty of things held back a colored man fewer in the usa than in the csa but still plenty adding laziness on top of everything else would only have made matters worse cincinnatus was a lot of different things whatever he was though hed never been afraid of hard work his back ached when he pulled up to the apartment building that night but the money in the pocket of his overalls made the ache seem worthwhile he opened the mailbox in the lobby crumpled up the advertising circulars and winced when he saw a letter with a covington postmark and the sprawling handwriting of his fathers neighbor news from covington was unlikely to be good because he wished he didnt have to find out what the letter said he carried it upstairs without opening it when he walked in amanda was doing homework he smiled at her gonna have me two highschool graduates soon he thought proudly that aint bad for a kentucky nigger who never went to school at all from the kitchen came the crackle and the mouthwatering smell of frying chicken cincinnatus went in to say hello to elizabeth who was turning pieces with longhandled tongs after a quick kiss she asked what you got there letter from covington oh she understood his hesitation but asked the next question anyhow whats it say dont know yet aint opened it he said the look his wife sent him was sympathetic and impatient at the same time he tore off the end of the envelope took out the letter unfolded it and read by the time he got to the end his face was as long as the train from which hed taken off furniture what is it elizabeth asked i got to git down there got to do it quick cincinnatus said heavily neighbor says my mama she start wanderin off every chance she get pa turn his back on her half a minute she out the door an lookin for the house where she growed up cant have that she liable to git lost for good or git run over on account of she go out in the street and dont look where she goin stress and the thought of covington made his accent thicken elizabeth sighed then hot fat spattered and she yipped and jerked back her hand she said i reckon maybe you do but lord i wish you didnt so do i on account of ma and on account of i dont want to go back to kentucky neither cincinnatus said but it aint always what you want to do sometimes its what you got to do he waited elizabeth sighed again then reluctantly nodded he bought a roundtrip train ticket knowing he would have to get oneway fares for his parents in covington he sent the neighbor down there a wire to let him know when hed be getting into town then he stuffed a few days clothes and sundries into a beatup suitcase and went to the railroad station to catch the eastbound train it pulled into covington at eleven that night the neighbor menander pershing stood on the platform with his father cincinnatus father looked older and smaller and wearier than cincinnatus had dreamt he would after embracing him cincinnatus looked nervously across the brightly lit platform aint none o them kentucky state police this time seneca driver said hed been born a slave and still talked like it after so long hearing the accents of the white midwest cincinnatus found his fathers way of speaking strange and ignorantsounding even though hed sounded like that himself when he was a boy his father hadnt even had a surname and neither had he till theyd all taken the same one after kentucky returned to the usa in the great war cincinnatus couldnt help looking around some more as far as he could tell nobody was paying any attention to him little by little he began to relax freedom party dont give you no trouble he asked dont want trouble from nobody his father said i minds my business an i dont git none aint too bad menander pershing added he was about cincinnatus age lean with a few threads of gray in his closecropped hair he fixed autos for a living and wore a mechanics greasy overalls they reckon they win come january so they bein quiet till then he jerked a thumb toward the exit come on i got my motorcar out in the lot us soldiers were searching some passengers bags as they left the station the men in greengray waved seneca and his companions through without bothering it might have been the first time in his life when being colored made things easier for him the soldiers didnt think negroes would back the freedom party no matter what they were likely to be right too menander pershings auto was an elderly oldsmobile but its motor purred when he started it getting in cincinnatus asked hows ma well she sleepin now thats how i come away his father answered you see in the mornin thats all he wouldnt say anything more even by moonlight the house where cincinnatus parents lived was smaller and shabbier than he remembered he lay down on the rickety sofa in the front room and got what sleep he could in the morning heartbreak began his father had to introduce him to his mother she didnt recognize him on her own after she came out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee in her hand she looked at him and said who are you im cincinnatus ma he said quietly and felt the sting of tears as long as they stayed in the room together she seemed to know who he was when she left to go to the outhouse though she came back and looked at him as if shed never seen him before in her life as far as she knew she hadnt fighting the stab at his heart he introduced himself again she like that cincinnatus father said sadly she still know me all the time she better after all these years but she dont know nobody else not so it stick cincinnatus pounded a fist into his thigh damn dont you talk like that young man i switch you if you cuss in the house for two sentences his mother sounded just the way she had when he was thirteen hearing that damn might have flipped a switch in her head old things seemed more familiar to her than new ones but then her eyes went vague again she forgot her own annoyance seeing her forget might have been harder to bear than anything or so cincinnatus thought till he too went out back to use the outhouse a fixture he hadnt had to worry about for many yearsand returned to find his father rushing out to get him she run off seneca cried i go back in the kitchen for a minute and she run off do jesus cincinnatus exclaimed we got to find her he and his father hurried out to the front yard cincinnatus looked left and right no sign of her you go this way he told his father ill go that way she aint gone real far off he went quick as he could when he got to a corner he hesitated up or down either way might prove a dreadful mistakeand he had the chance for another one at every corner he came to swearing under his breath he dogtrotted along the street each time he came to a corner his curses got louder but luck was with him he rounded one last corner and there she was on the far side of the street strolling along as if she knew just where she was going ma cincinnatus yelled ma she paid no attention to him maybe she didnt hear maybe shed forgotten a grown man could call her his mother cincinnatus ran out into the street after herand his luck abruptly changed he remembered a squeal of brakes a shout and an impact and then nothing when he woke he wanted that nothing back one leg was on fire someone was taking a sledgehammer to his head he opened his eyes a crack everything was white for a moment he thought it was heaven then blearily he realized it had to be a hospital he made a noise a nurse appeared as if by magic he tried to talk at last after some effort he succeeded wha happen fractured tibia and fibula she said briskly fractured skull too when they brought you in a week ago they didnt think youd make it you must have a hard head you had to be nuts running out there like that the guy in the auto never had a chance to stop and how are you going to pay your bills that was the least of his worries his wits didnt want to work the injury drugs whatever it was he tried to fight it ma he asked the nurse only shrugged got to get out of here he said she shook her head not till youre better and you arent going anywhere for quite a while believe you me youre not plebiscite he said in dismay the nurse shrugged again cincinnatus drifted back into unconsciousness if he whimpered it might have been pain and not fear pain was what the nurse took it for anyhow she gave him another shot of morphine winter in covington kentucky was of positively yankee fury anne colleton didnt care for it a bit but she didnt complain either shed pulled every wire she could reach to get to be a confederate election inspector now that she was here she intended to make the most of it disapproval stuck out like spines from the fat brigadier general who commanded the local us garrison he knew what was going to happen when the votes were cast on tuesday he knew but he couldnt do one damned thing about it anne disliked the idea of negroes voting in the plebiscite as much as brigadier general rowling she thought that was his name but wasnt quite surehe wasnt worth remembering anyhow disliked the idea of the plebiscite itself she had grumbled about that brigadier generalrowlingwouldnt listen he said your president agreed to it so youre stuck with it she had no answer for that what jake featherston said went let them enjoy it while they can then she said because they sure wont be doing any voting after kentucky comes back where it belongs the us officer scowled shed hoped he would he said maybe youd like to go into the colored district yourself on tuesday so you can see everything is on the up and up im not afraid if thats what you mean she said bully for you said the fat man from the united states anne couldnt remember the last time shed heard anyone say bully even sardonically january dawned clear and cold anne colleton got up to see the sun rise to make sure she missed none of the plebiscite polls opened at seven polling places were officially marked by the stars and stripes and the stars and bars flying in front of themand unofficially by the armed us soldiers who stood outside each one to make sure there was no trouble jake featherston had offered to send confederate soldiers into kentucky and houston and sequoyah to help with that but president smith had told him no and he hadnt pushed it for the moment they remained us territory for the moment anne thought with a ferocious smile both the usa and the csa had poll watchers at every polling place they checked the men and women who came in to vote against the lists of those who were eligible every now and then they would argue both sides kept lists of contested voters if the plebiscite turned out to be close those lists would turn into weapons in kentucky and houston at least anne didnt think the vote would be close she did go into the colored part of covington her motorcar flew the stars and bars from the wireless aerial in most of covington people had cheered when they saw it in the colored district anne wished shed thought to take down the flag some of the us poll watchers in the colored part of town were negroes young men whod grown up and got an education while kentucky belonged to the usa because the voting rolls for negroes were new and imperfect they bickered constantly with their cs counterparts and argued with them as if they believed they were just as good as whites in the confederate states that would have been a death sentence one of the confederate poll watchers said as much when this here state goes back where it belongs you better recollect what happens to uppity niggers lucullus the negroluculluslooked steadily back at him you better recollect what happens when you push folks too far he answered you push em so far they dont care if they lives or dies why should they care if you lives or dies talk is cheap the white man fleered lucullus said not a word anne feared hed won the exchange when she came out of the polling placea little storefront churchshe discovered her auto had a smashed windscreen though they said windshield in the usa her driver was out of the motorcar hopping mad and yelling at a us soldier why the hell didnt you stop that goddamn nigger he flung a brick right in front of your nose and you just stood there im sorry sir the greengrayclad soldier sounded anything but sorry by his accent he was from nowhere near kentucky i didnt see a thing what is your name anne demanded im going to report you to your commanding officer jenkins maam rudy jenkins the soldier answered and you can report as much as you please but i wont lose any sleep over it she thought about telling him where to go and how to get there in the sort of language he would use himselfthought about it and decided it would do no good oh she intended to give his name to that stuffed pork chop in a brigadier generals uniform but she was sure that would do her no good either jenkins might get a public slap on the wrist but he was bound to get some private congratulations along with it she turned to the driver just take us on to the next stop this fellow can laugh as much as he pleases but hell be leaving soon and were going to stay the driver fumed but rudy jenkins fumed even more anne nodded to herself shed done that right before she left the colored district the auto picked up a couple of more dents the driver plainly wanted to curse some more her presence in the motorcar inhibited him to hell with these goddamn bastards she said her voice crisp from now on no one will give a shit what they think right uh yes maam he sounded scandalized she smiled shed heard a lot of men sound that way on they went to a new polling place in the white part of town there freedom party stalwarts waving party flags paraded just outside the hundredfoot electioneering limit the us soldiers by the polling place looked as if they wanted to shoot the men in white shirts and butternut trousers the stalwarts were careful not to give them an excuse anne went from one polling place to another till the polls closed at eight oclock then the driver took her to the covington city hall where the votes would be counted as at the polling places both the usa and the csa had observers present to make sure the count went straight watching it progress anne found more people in covington voting to stay in the united states than she would have liked certainly more than the negro voteand what a mad notion that wasaccounted for some of the whites whod grown up in the usa must have been too lazy to want a change even so returning to the confederacy took an early lead in covington and never lost it wireless sets blared in the whitepainted windowless smokefilled room where the ballots were tallied they let the counters and the observers keep track of what was going on in the rest of kentucky and in the other states where there were plebiscites return to the csa held the same sort of lead in kentucky as a whole as it did in covingtonless than anne would have liked but plenty to win houston was going for the csa in a rout better than three to one sequoyah sequoyah gave the damnyankees something to smile about because the people there seemed to be choosing to stay in the united states the tally in covington finished about half past one by then annes driver had fallen asleep in a folding chair she eyed him in some admiration she didnt think she could have done that in a quiet room let alone in the noisy chaos at city hall he jerked and almost fell out of the chair when she shook him awake again she was sorry about that but not sorry enough to keep from doing it noisy chaos roiled through the rest of covington too as she saw on the short trip back to her hotel freedom party stalwarts and others who backed the csa danced in the streets waving party flags the stars and bars and the confederate battle flag a lot of them were drunk they cheered the confederate flag on the aerial of annes battered auto somehow the cheers turned into a rousing chorus of dixie anne wondered if the celebrants would go into the colored district and take their revenge on covingtons negroes for voting to stay in the usaor for having the nerve to vote at all maybe the us soldiers who still patrolled the town would keep them from doing that but any negroes who stayed in covington after kentucky changed hands wouldnt have a happy time of it anne supposed a lot of them would go while the going was good the united states are welcome to them she thought she snatched a few hours sleep when she came downstairs for breakfast she got a copy of the covington chronicle the banner headline summed things up untied states a smaller subhead below gave the details kentucky houston return to csa sequoyah stays under stars and stripes after bacon and eggs and lots of coffee anne paid a call on the us commandant in covington the people have spoken brigadier general she saidand if she was gloating she thought she had good reason to a cup of coffee steamed on the fat officers desk he looked to have had even less sleep than she had the people are a bunch of damned fools he said they elected featherston didnt they i dont talk about your president that way she said why not i do the commandant swigged from the coffee cup he got down to business under the agreement we have thirty days to withdraw our men yours are not to follow kentucky will stay demilitarized us citizens wishing to leave the state may do so until it passes under confederate sovereignty a lot of them i expect will already have made plans to do so collaborators and niggers anne said scornfully you can have em theyll do all right for themselves in the united states the us general predicted and ill give youand your presidentsome free advice too free advice anne didnt laugh in his face but she came close im sure its worth every penny you charge for it she hoped that would make him angry if it did he didnt show it he just nodded setting his chins in motion and said oh no doubt well ill give it to you anyway mostly cause i know you wont listen to it anne could simply have turned her back and walked out the door instead with illconcealed impatience she said go ahead then get it over with thanks a lot the us officer wasnt bad at sarcasm either even if he was built like a zeppelin if you people are smart you wont land on this state too hard you won the plebiscite yes but you didnt win it by as much as you thought you would and you cant tell me any different if you come down on kentucky with both feet youll have about as much fun holding it down as we have since the last war that made more sense than anne wished it didenough that she decided to mention it in her report to president featherston she wouldnt suggest that he follow the fat mans advice she knew better but noting it as an item of intelligence wouldnt hurt she also decided she would note the wayrowling she had to check thathad spoken of the last war unless she altogether misread his tone he was already thinking about the next one as had been his habit since the days of the mexican civil war jefferson pinkard prowled the barracks in the prison camp he ran in louisiana camp dependable wouldnt boil over while his back was turned it might boil over anyway he knew that the black prisoners in the camp had little to lose theyd been captured in arms against the confederate states nothing good was going to happen to them they only thing that kept them in line was the certain knowledge that they would die if they rose up against the guards jeffs endless prowling was designed not least to make sure they stayed certain of that whenever he stepped into a barracks he had a pistol in his hand and half a squad of guards with submachine guns at his back the negro captives jumped down from their bunks and sprang to attention as soon as he came in they were certain of what would happen if they didnt show him that courtesy too you boy pinkard pointed to one of them a big muscular buck give me your name and number and where you were captured is plutarch suh the negro replied he rattled off the camp number finishing i was cotched up in franklin parish suh some damn nigger sell me out i ever find out who dat one dead coon a lot of prisoners here had similar complaints some negroes didnt want guerrilla war in their back yards the ones who didnt had to be careful with what they did and said though a lot of them had ended up gruesomely dead when the men they were trying to betray took vengeance any complaints pinkard asked plutarch nodded i aint got enough to eat i aint got enough to wear an is here side from that everything fine funny nigger growled one of the guards behind pinkard youll laugh outa the other side of your face pretty damn quick funny nigger several of the other blacks in the barracks had smiled and nodded at what plutarch had to say none had been rash enough to laugh out loud now even the men whod smiled tried to pretend they hadnt pinkard said you get the same rations and same clothes as everybody else and if you didnt want to be here you never should have picked up a gun huh plutarch said white folks rise up against what they dont like theys heroes black folks do the same wes goddamn niggers bet your ass you are boy that guard said theres a difference pinkard said plutarch nodded sure enough is yall won we lost aint no bigger differencen dat that wasnt the difference jeff had had in mind which didnt mean the prisoner was wrong pinkard poked through the barracks he knew how things were supposed to be and carefully checked out everything that didnt match the pattern nothing looked like the start of an escape attempt but you couldnt be sure without a thorough inspection on to the next barracks as before prisoners tumbled out of their bunks and stood at stiff attention there was one difference here though willy knight dwelt in barracks six the tall blond former vice president stood out from the black men all around him like a snowball in a coal field he was not the man he had been when freedom party guards brought him to camp dependable he was scrawnier camp rations werent enough to let anybody keep the weight hed come in with he was dirtier toowater for washing was in short supply and in an odd way he was tougher than he had been that hed been tough enough to stay alive surprised jeff pinkard who wouldnt have given him the chance of a snowball a snowball in hell hell this might well have been but none of the negro inhabitants here had taken advantage of the chance to get rid of a freedom party big shot that surprised pinkard tooit did but then again it didnt the blacks might have suspected knight was in here as much as bait as for any other reason anybody who harmed him was liable to pay the price they might not have been wrong either for the moment jeffs orders were to look the other way if anything happened to willy knight but one telegram could change that and could change it days or weeks or months after something nasty happened to the exvice president almost as if knight were any other prisoner pinkard pointed at him and snapped you give me your name and number he couldnt make himself call another white boy knight repeated his name and camp number then added i was captured in richmond virginia trying to save the country i want something from you ill ask for it jeff said the guard whod growled at plutarch growled at willy knight too you really want to catch hell just go on runnin your mouth knight shut up the first time someone had said something like that to him hed asked what could be worse than coming to the camp to begin with the guards had spent the next couple of weeks showing him what could be worse another way he was different now was that he didnt have any front teeth hed learned something but not everything about keeping quiet pinkard didnt ask him if he had any complaints even if knight did nobody was going to do anything about them that being so why waste time and breath the warden did inspect barracks six with care unusual even for him if some of the colored prisoners escaped that would be a misfortune hed get called on the carpet if willy knight escaped that would be a catastrophe somebodys head would have to roll and he knew whose he might end up in one of these hard narrow bunks himselfor they might simply shoot him and get it over with nobody but nobody was going to escape from barracks six everything seemed shipshape pinkard didnt trust the way things seemed he had no reason not to he just didnt he took out a little book and scribbled a note to himself half the men in here would get cleared out before the day was done to be replaced by prisoners from other barracks if plots were stirring that would slow them down people would have to figure out who could be trusted and who couldnt i better stick a new informer or two in here too jeff thought the less that went on without his knowing it the better the camp ran he was heading for the next barracks when a guard came up to him with a yellow envelope this here wire just came in boss the man said and thrust it at him what the hell pinkard took the envelope opened it and extracted the telegram inside what the hell he said again this time in tones of deep dismay whats the matter the guard asked whats the matter jeff would echo anybody not just himself ill tell you whats the matter were going to get a new shipment of prisoners thats whata big new shipment of prisoners nice of em to let us know wasnt it theyre supposed to start comin in this afternoon a new shipment of prisoners the guard proved he could repeat what hed just heard too then he exploded much as jeff wanted to do jesus h christ where the hell we gonna put em we already got niggers swingin from the rafters shit we got niggers comin out our assholes is what we got you know that wes and i know that and anybody who knows one goddamn thing about this here camp knows it too pinkard said but you know what else the folks in richmond dont know it either that or they just dont give a fuck he looked around more than a little frantically where am i gonna put all them nigger bastards how am i gonna stop em from runnin away christ how are we gonna feed em this here dont say word one about extra rations wes frowned then he shrugged split up what you get with as many mouths as we got inside what the hell else can you do damfino jefferson pinkard shook his head in deep discontent prisoners we got are already hungry as can be on what were feeding em nothin left to scrounge off the countryside if they got to make do with threequarters as muchor maybe only half as much how can i guesstheyre gonna start starving to death in jigtime you dont need to get your bowels in an uproar about it boss wes said theyre only niggers for chrissake aint like you was starvin uncle henry and aunt daisy oh hell i know that pinkard said but this is all just a bunch of crap his sense of order of propriety was offended if they send us extra men they oughta send us the extra rations to go with em aint fair if they dont its like in the bible where old whatshisnamepharaohmade the jews make bricks without straw he wanted things to work the way they were supposed to reckon the sheenies had it coming to em same as the coons do now wes said but pinkard shook his head no you give somebody something to do you got to give him the chance to do it too and richmond aint send em a wire back the guard suggested maybe i will but jeff doubted he would if the big boys got the idea he couldnt handle whatever they threw at him theyd toss him out on his ear and put in somebody who wouldnt say shit if he had a mouthful as promisedthreatenedthe new shipment of colored prisoners did come in that afternoon pinkard had his clerks as ready as they could be they got swamped anyway it would have been worse if they hadnt been braced that was the most jeff could say for it the shipment was even larger than hed expected for a little while he feared he wouldnt be able to shoehorn everybody inside the barbedwire perimeter he did manage that though he had prisoners curled up on bare ground between barracks without a blanket to call their own the cooks served out the supper ration share and share alike the new prisoners ate like starving wolves pinkard wondered how long theyd gone with even less or with nothing by their gaunt faces and hollow cheeks some of them had gone quite a while the men already inside camp dependable grumbled at what they got they didnt grumble too loud though if they had they would have offended people whod been through worse about midnight a thunderstorm loosed an artillery barrage of rain on the prison camp the new prisoners struggled to get into the barracks it was either that or sink into what rapidly became a bottomless gumbo of mud not all of them could the buildings simply would not hold so many men well see pneumonia in a few days jeff thought lying in bed while lightning raved theyll die like flies especially if nobody ups the ration he shrugged his initial panic had receded what could he do about this nothing he could see except ride herd on things the best way he knew how it wasnt as if the prisoners hadnt done plenty of things that made them deserve to be here anybody who came here deserved to be here by the very nature of things jake featherston had got kentucky and houston back for the confederate states if that didnt prove he knew what was what nothing could nodding to himselffigured that one outpinkard rolled over and went back to sleep hipolito rodriguez had always been better at saving money than most of his neighbors that magdalena had the same sort of thrifty temperament certainly helped some of the people around baroyeca thought of him as a damned judio he didnt lose any sleep about those peoples opinions in general he didnt think much of them either he did believe that working hard and hanging on to as much cash as he could paid off sooner or later sooner or later often simply meant later he wasnt rich he wasnt about to get rich any time soon but he didnt mind living more comfortably when the chance came along and it was coming he could see it coming in the most literal sense of the words a row of poles stretching nut along the road from baroyeca that ran alongside his farm every day the freedom youth corps planted more of them as if they were some crop that would grow electricity had come to the town a few years earlier that it should come to the farms outside of town rodriguez hadnt been sure he would live to see the day but here it was and he was going to take advantage of it hed had the money to pay an electrician to wire the house before the poles reached it hed had enough to buy electric lamps and the bulbs that went with them too and hed had enough for a surprise for magdalena the surprise waited in the barn he also dreamt of buying an automobile and a tractor to take the place of the mule he knew that was and would stay a dream but savored it anyhow the day came when the poles reached and marched past his house that turned out to be something of an anticlimax for the wires that made the poles anything more than dead trees hadnt yet come so far still looking out at the long shadows the poles cast in the low january sun he nodded to himself those poles were the visible harbingers of a new way of life three days later the electrical wires arrived freedom youth corps boys strung them from pole to pole under the supervision of a foulmouthed electrician from hermosillo even rodriguez whod done his time in the army heard some things hed never run into before for the boys from the freedom youth corps this had to be part of their training that they hadnt expected baroyecas electrician was a moonfaced man named cйsar calderon he never swore the day after the wires passed the farmhouse he came out on a mule that made the one rodriguez owned seem like a thoroughbred by comparison he ran a wire from the closest power pole to the fuse box hed installed on the side of the house he tested the circuits with a device that glowed when the current was flowing seeing it light up made rodriguez swell with pride їtodo estб bien he asked calderon nodded oh yes everything is fine exactly how it should be if you like you can plug in a lamp and turn it on fingers trembling rodriguez did he pushed the little knob below the light bulb the motion felt strange unnatural unpracticed the knob clicked into the new position the light came on it was even brighter than rodriguez had expected magdalena crossed herself madre de dios she whispered its like having the sun in the house rodriguez solemnly shook hands with the electrician muchas gracias de nada calderon replied but it wasnt nothing and they both knew it calderon packed up his tools climbed onto the mule and rode away rodriguez turned off the lamp and turned it on again yes the electricity stayed even after the electrician went away rodriguez had thought it would but he hadnt been quite sure when he lit a kerosene lamp he understood what was going on the flame from the match made the wick and the kerosene that soaked up through it burn but what really happened when he pushed that little knob the light came on how why he couldnt have said but even if he didnt know how it worked he knew that it worked and knowing that it worked was plenty he turned out the lamp againthey didnt really need it right this minuteand headed out to the barn telling magdalena ill be back over his shoulder the crate was large heavy and unwieldy hed brought it to the farm from baroyeca in the wagon now it rested on a sledge hed been warned to keep it upright bad things would happen he was told if it went over on its side he didnt want bad things to happen not after the money hed spent he dragged the crate out of the barn and toward the farmhouse magdalena came outside what have you got there she asked hipolito rodriguez smiled hed made a point of coming back from town after sundown so she wouldnt see what was in the wagon itsa box he said muchas gracias magdalena replied with icy sarcasm and what is in the box why another box of course he replied which won him a glare from his wife by then hed hauled the crate to the base of the steps he went back to the barn for a hammer which he used to pull up the nails holding the crate closed you dont believe me here ill show you show me what magdalena demanded but then she gave a little gasp for just as rodriguez had planned the front panel of the crate fell away she stared at him is that he nodded sн sweetheart its a refrigerator she crossed herself again she did that several times a day it was nothing out of the ordinary then she started to cry that made him hurry up the stairs and take her in his arms because she hardly ever did it she sobbed on his shoulder for a few seconds at last pulling away she said i never thought we would have electricity even when we got electricity i never thought we would have one of these and i wanted one i wanted one so much she suddenly looked anxious but can we afford it it wasnt as much as i thought it would be he answered and it isnt supposed to use that much electricity look he wrestled off the rest of the crate that done he opened the refrigerator door in the freezer compartment it even makes its own ice in little trays what will they think of next magdalena whispered a few years ago i dont think there was any ice in all of baroyeca who in the whole town had ever seen ice anyone whod gone north to fight los estados unidos rodriguez shivered at the memory and hed only been in texas the men whod fought in kentucky and tennessee had had it worse i have seen ice por dios and i wish i hadnt youd seen god make ice magdalena said with a snort had you ever seen people making ice even the people had it up there he said theyre richer than we are but were gaining i know we are i didnt used to think so not before the freedom party won now im sure of it electricity his wife said as if the one word proved everything that needed proving as far as rodriguez was concerned it did he went back and closed the refrigerators door then grunting with effort he picked up the machine and carried it up the stairs it wasnt any taller than his navel but it was plenty heavy hed found that out getting the crate into the wagon in the first place when he set it down on the porch the boards groaned under the weight open the door for me please he said and magdalena did the kitchen wasnt far a good thing too rodriguez thought he set the refrigerator against the wall near an outlet and plugged it in it started to hum not loudly but noticeably he hadnt known it would do that he cocked his head to one side listening and wondering how annoying it would be would he get used to it or would it start to drive him crazy he didnt know but he expected hed find out magdalena came in to stare at the new arrival in the kitchen is it cold yet i dont know rodriguez opened the door and stuck his hand inside it feels cooler anyhow i think he took out the icecube trays fill these with water well see how long they take to freeze all right magdalena did carefully she put the trays back into the freezer compartment closed its door and closed the refrigerator door the hum which had got louder with the door open quieted down again not too bad magdalena murmured and hipolito nodded hed been thinking the same thing she went on we have lamps we have this wonderful refrigerator she pronounced the unfamiliar word with care do you know what i would like next when we can afford it no what rodriguez hadnt begun to think about what might come after the refrigerator but magdalena had a wireless set she said at once that has to be the most wonderful invention in the whole world music and people talking here inside our own house whenever we want themwhat could be more marvelous i dont know rodriguez hadnt heard the wireless all that often himself it had brought returns from the last election to freedom party headquarters the cantina had a set too one that usually played love songs he shrugged if you want one i suppose we can do that one of these days they arent too expensive i do want one magdalena said emphatically if we have a wireless set we can hear everything that happens as soon as it happens we wouldnt be on a farm outside a little town in a state most of los estados confederados dont care about we would be in new orleans or richmond itself rodriguez laughed now i understand he said you want the wireless set so you can catch up on gossip all over the world his wife poked him in the ribs he squirmed he wasnt usually ticklish but shed found a sensitive spot she said and you never gossip at all when you visit la culebra verde thats different he declared magdalena didnt say anything which made him wonder how it was different he tried his best men talk about important things magdalena laughed in his face evidently his best wasnt good enough but she let him down easy asking is it ice yet lets find out he opened the refrigerator door the air that came out was definitely chilly now the water in the icecube trays was still water though he touched it with a fingertip its getting colder magdalena touched it too she nodded and closed the door they stood there in front of the refrigerator listening to the soft hum of the future xvii in the officers mess on the uss remembrance commander dan cressy nodded to sam carsten well lieutenant you called that one the exec said called which one sir sam asked the carrier was rolling but not too badly he had no trouble staying in his chair there are reports of confederate soldiers assembling near the borders of kentucky and houston cressy answered what do you want to bet theyll be marching in as soon as we finish pulling out just the way you said they would sir if you think im happy to be right youre wrong sam said what happens if they do go in commander cressy shrugged i dont know i hope president smith does hed better somebody had better anyhow if they go in wont it take a war to get them out that was lieutenant commander hiram pottinger carstens superior on the damagecontrol party nobody in the officers mess said anything for some little while after that they knew what war meant not many of them besides sam had served in the great war but theyd all been through the inconclusive pacific war against japan a lot will depend on what happens in europe commander cressy said france is starting to whoop and holler about alsace and lorraine sam said meditatively i saw an action franзaise riot before those boys came to power i dont think theyll take no for an answer theyre just as sure theyve got god on their side as jake featherston is and the russians are squawking about poland and theyre starting to squawk about the ukraine too cressy said and the limeys are growling at the micks and aint we got fun sam sighed he wished for a cigarette but the smoking lamp was out were going to hell in a handbasket all over again he said didnt anybody learn anything the last time around ill tell you one thing we didnt learn the remembrances exec said we didnt learn to make sure the sons of bitches who lost took so many lumps they couldnt get back up on their feet and have another try and im afraid were going to have to pay for it lieutenant commander pottinger said theyve learned something in south america anyhow argentina and the empire of brazil are cuddling up even if argentina and chile are yelling again sir thats good news for britain not for us carsten said if there is a war it means brazil will let argentina ship food through its territorial waters and then make the short hop across the atlantic to french west africa same as happened the last time how do you know so much about that commander cressy asked as if to say youre a mustang so youre not supposed to know much of anything sir i was there in the dakota sam answered cressy was a young hotshot he had more book learning and learned faster than anyone sam had ever seen if war did come he would likely have flag rank by the time it was done assuming he lived but he did sometimes forget that people could also learn by good oldfashioned experience the other side of the coin was sam had only been a petty officer then officers also had the unfortunate habit of believing that men who werent didnt know anything petty officers of course were just as sure that officers heads either had nothing in them or were full of rocks we can lick the confederates pottinger said we did it before and this time we wont have to take on canada too everyone in the mess nodded somebodysam didnt see whosaid goddamn japsll try and sucker punch us in the pacific when were busy close to home more nods sam said they did that in the last warthe last big war i mean i was there for that too something in his tone made commander cressys gaze sharpen the dakota was the ship that went on that wild circle through the battle of the three navies wasnt she yes sir carsten said one of the hits we took jammed our steering so all we could do was circleeither that or stand still and the japs or the limeys would have blown us out of the water if we had youve had an interesting career havent you the exec said sir ive been lucky sam answered closest i came to buying a plot was from the spanish influenza after the war that almost did me in otherwise hardly a scratch they tried taking the sandwich islands away from us in the pacific war hiram pottinger went on with the main argument odds are the bastards will try it again and if they do the pacific coast had better look out nobody argued with him after the wakeup call the japanese had given los angeles in nobody could theyd built their navy to fight far out into the pacific and so had the united states if the two countries ever went at each other with everything they had if we go at the japs full bore instead of doing a halfassed job of it the way we did the last time well lick em sam said commander cressy nodded if we could do that we would he said but if were at war with japan any time soon were also likely to be at war with the confederate states and if were at war with the csa we arent going to be able to hit the japs with everything weve got and theyve built up a tidy little empire for themselves since the last war that was true enough japan had owned chosen formosa and the philippines going into the great war since then shed gained a lot of influence in china and quietly acquired indochina from france and the oilrich east indies from holland in the aftermath of defeat britain hadnt been able to do anything but grumble and hope she could hold on to malaya and singapore if she ever got on japans bad side but since the limeys and the japs both worried about the usa they put up with each other if they hit us again those sons of bitches are going to put a rock in their fist somebody predicted gloomily well gentlemen thats why we wear the uniform commander cressy got to his feet he was always sharply turned out sam envied him the knifeedged creases in his trousers his own clothes were clean but they werent what youd call pressed neither were those of anybody else in the officers messexcept the execs cressy nodded to the other men and left ignoring the ships motion with the air of a man whod known worse sam stayed long enough to drink another cup of coffee then he left the mess too as often happened the officers bull session went aimless and foolish without cressys sharp wit to steer it along the exec also had the rank to make that wit felt sam thought he might have done some steering too but he was junior in grade too damn old and a mustang to boot nobody would take him seriously more than a little wistfully he went up to the flight deck he wished he had more to do with sending airplanes off into battle that was why hed wanted to serve on the remembrance in the first place hed done good work useful work in damage control since returning to the ship as an officer he knew that he was even proud of it but it still wasnt what he wanted to be doing mechanics in coveralls had the cowl off a fighters engine they were puttering with a fuel line puttering and muttering and now and then swearing like sailors funny how that works carsten thought smiling at the bad language that flavored the conversation the way pepper flavored scrambled eggs the fighter itself was a far cry from the wireandcanvas twodeckers that had flown off the remembrance when sam first came aboard her it was a sleek aluminumskinned onedecker with folding wings so the belowdecks hangar could hold more of its kind because of the strengthening it needed to cope with being sent forth with a kick from a catapult and landing with an arrester hook it was a little heavier and a little slower than a top landbased fightera little but not much carsten looked out to sea as always destroyers shepherded the remembrance on all sides the way things were these days you just couldnt tell if the confederates or the limeys wanted to use a submersible to get in a quick knee in the nuts those destroyers were the ones that would have to make sure they couldnt hed served aboard a ship not much different from them compared to the remembrance they were insanely crowded they were also much more vulnerable to weather and the sea but they did a job no other kind of vessel could do for that matter so did the remembrance herself with her aircraft she could project us power farther than any battleships big guns all by herself she could make the royal navy thoughtful about poking its nose into the western atlantic because of that sam was surprised when half an hour later the carrier suddenly picked up speedthe flight deck throbbed under his feet as the engines began working harderand swung toward the west like any good sheepdogs the destroyers stayed with her whats going on sir sam called to the officer of the deck beats me that worthy replied she kept on steaming west all the rest of that day and into the night by the time the sun came up astern of her the next morning rumor had already declared that she was bound for boston or providence or new york or philadelphia or baltimore to be scrapped or refitted or to have the captain courtmartialed or because she was running low on beans sam didnt believe the skipper had done anything to deserve a courtmartial past that he kept an open mind she turned out to be heading for the boston naval yard the powers that be admitted as much before shed been steaming west for a day they remained closemouthed about why shed been called in to port early in her cruise maybe she really was running low on beans sam couldnt have proved she wasnt sailors hoped for shore leave while she stayed in port when she came in a tugboat guided her into boston harbor by the way the tug dodged and zigged carsten suspected the minelayers had been busy that saddened him but didnt surprise him very much more tugs nudged the remembrance up against a quay it was snowing hard the temperature down close to zero that didnt keep a swarm of electricians mates and machinists mates led by several officers from coming aboard and going straight to work by all appearances the refit rumor had been true but what were the technicians fitting sam couldnt figure it out on his own and nobody seemed willing to talk whatever it was it involved some funnylooking revolving installations atop the island and a bunch of new gear inside the armored command center after a little while sam stopped asking questions whenever he did people looked at him as if he were a traitor he went on about his own business and watched from the corner of his eye sooner or later he figured hed find out lucien galtier stretched uncomfortably as he shooed another hen off the nest to see if shed laid she hadnt his fingers found no new egg the hen clucked at the indignity galtier went on to the next nest he grunted when he reached into it the grunt was part satisfaction for he found an egg there and part unhappiness for he still couldnt get rid of the tightness in his chest no help for it even if he had pulled something in there the work didnt go away he finished gathering eggs fed the animals and mucked out their stalls and did everything else in the barn that needed doing then he picked up the basket of eggs pulled his hat down on his forehead lowered the earflaps and tied them under his chin pulled the thick wool muffler nicole had knitted up to cover his mouth and nose and left the barn that first breath of outside air was as bad as hed known it would be he might have inhaled a lungful of daggers it was cold inside the barn with the animals body heat and an oil heater warming things up and with the wooden walls keeping out wind and snow outside in the space between the barn and the farmhouse it was a good deal worse than merely cold snow blew horizontally out of the northwest it had a good running start by the time it got to his farm it stung his eyes and tried to freeze them shut despite hat and muffler and heavy coat and sweater and stout dungarees and woolen itchy long johns the wind started sucking heat from his body the instant it touched him in the swirling white he could hardly see the house ahead hed known worse blizzards but not many if he missed the house hed freeze out here that happened to a luckless farmer or two every winter in quebec lucien didnt miss he staggered up the stairs opened the kitchen door lurched inside and slammed it shut behind him calisse he muttered he shook himself like a dog snow flew everywhere the stove was already hot but he built up the fire in it and stood in front of it gratefully soaking up the warmth only after hed done that did he worry about the clumps of melting snow on the floor he cleaned up as best he could then he went back to the stove and made himself a pot of coffee he gulped it down as hot as he could stand it he wanted to be warm inside and out outside the wind kept howling he watched the blowing swirling whiteness and sent it some thoughts that werent compliments there was supposed to be a dance tomorrow night if the blizzard went on roaring how would anybody get to it he turned on the wireless set in the front room the wireless was a splendid companion for a man who lived by himself it made interesting noise and he didnt have to respond unless he wanted to music poured out of the speaker right now though he didnt care for music he changed the station he wanted to find out whether they were going to get another foot and a half of snow before tomorrow night but the wireless stations blathered on about what they were interested in not about what he was interested in that was the drawback of the marvelous machine he didnt have to respond to it unless he wanted to but it didnt have to respond to him at all he went from station to station for the next twenty minutes until the top of the hour and not one of them seemed the least bit interested in the weather outside for all they cared it could have been summer out there with blue sky and warm sun it could have been but he knew it wasnt at the top of the hour every station gave forth with five minutes of news it was as if they suddenly remembered they were part of the wider world after all lucien listened impatiently to accounts of riots in the ukraine and austriahungary and celebrations on the border between the united states and the confederate states all he wanted was a simple weather report and nobody seemed willing to give him one finally at the very tail end of one of the newscasts an announcer grudgingly said our storm is expected to blow itself out by this afternoon snow will end before nightfall and tomorrow will be clear and a little warmer two sentences and then the music resumed in january in quebec a little warmer didnt mean warm lucien knew that all too well he also knew the weather forecasters lied in their teeth about one time in three even so he had reason to hope without hope what was a man nothing worth mentioning sure enough that afternoon the wind dropped and the snow stopped falling the sun came out and peeped around as if surprised at everything that had happened since the last time it showed its face it might have been embarrassed at what it saw for it set half an hour later the night was long and cold as january nights were lucien woke when it was still dark he threw on his clothes and went out to the outhouse the sky was brilliantly clear ribbons and curtains of aurora blazed in the north he yawned and nodded acknowledging that they were there then he trudged back to the farmhouse he was eating fried eggs when a snowplow grumbled by the main road would be clear then who could guess whether the little side roads to йloise granches house would be though and the ones from there to the dance well he said i will just have to find out before he could find out he had to do some shoveling to let his auto get to the main road that was hard work and would have been for a man half his age his heart was pounding before he finished but finish he did under all those layers of warm clothes sweat ran down his sides he went back in and heated water for a bath that helped soak out some of the kinks in his back though others refused to disappear when evening came he used a little more hot water this time for a shave he scraped his chin and cheeks with a straight razor hed been using since before the turn of the century none of these newfangled safety razors and blades for him he stropped the razor on a thick smooth piece of leather before it touched his face if his shave wasnt smooth he had only himself to blame not some factory down in the united states he dressed in clothes he might have worn to town dark trousers clean white shirt and his least disreputable hat the overcoat he put on had seen better days but overcoats always got a lot of use in quebec whistling a tune hed heard on the wireless he went out to the chevrolet i want no trouble from you he told the auto as if it were the horse with which hed had so many philosophical discussions over the years the chevrolet was old but it knew better than to argue with him it started right up despite the snowplow and the rock salt it had laid down the roads would still be icy galtier drove with care and made sure he kept plenty of room between himself and other motoristsnot that many others were out and about he didnt miss the traffic he knew he wouldnt be able to stop in a hurry he left the paved road and bumped along rutted dirt lanes till he came to the farm where йloise granche lived the dim buttery light of kerosene lamps poured out through her windows she still had no electricity he stopped the engine wagged a finger at the chevrolet to remind it to start up again and went up the steps and knocked on the door hello she said with a smile then she was in his arms and they kissed hungrily for a long time still holding her he said when we do that i want to forget all about the dance we can if you want to she answered would you rather just stay here regretfully galtier shook his head that would be a lot of staying for not much staying power im afraid if i were half my age i would say yes if you were half your age i wouldnt want anything to do with younot for that anyhow йloise said well go to the dance then and well come back and who knows what will happen after that who indeed lucien kissed her again then led her out to the motorcar that wagged finger did its job the auto started up again without any fuss the dance was at pierre turcots not far from the little town of st modиste a rowdy sprawl of motorcars and wagons and buggies surrounded turcots barn when the chevrolet pulled up lucien handed йloise out of the motorcar they went in side by side people waved and called their names and hurried up to greet them by now theyd been together long enough that all their neighbors took them for granted they might almost have been a married couple luciens son georges was already out on the floor dancing he waved to lucien and blew йloise a kiss georges can be very foolish йloise remarked she eyed galtier i wonder where he gets it i havent the faintest idea he answered with such dignity as he could muster the fiddlers and drummer and accordion player took a break pierre turcot wound up a phonograph and put a record on it the dancing went on the musicians on the record played and sang better than the homegrown talent lucien had noticed that before he wondered if the problem would kill off homegrown talent after a while but once he started whirling йloise around the floor he stopped worrying about it they danced they snacked and drank some of the potent punch pierre had set out and danced some more people talked about politics in the city of quebec and the price of potatoes and who was fooling around with whom lucien didnt think he and йloise were high on the gossip list these days why get excited about old news somewhere between ten and eleven йloise turned to him and said shall we go he smiled yes lets they went back to her house in companionable silence when they got there he got out first so he could open the door on her side such a gentleman she said would you like to come in for a little while why not they drank some applejack one of йloises neighbors had cooked it up it was a good batch almost as good as if it werent bootleg and then as they had a good many times before they went upstairs to her bedroom everything was dark in there but lucien knew where the bed was he sat down on one side of it and got out of his clothes when he was naked he reached out his hand found йloises bare warm flesh they kissed and caressed each other luciens heart pounded with excitement heart still pounding he rolled onto his back йloise straddled him she liked riding him and he found it easier than the other way round oh lucien she whispered he didnt answer as his delight mounted so did the thudding in his chest he could hardly breathe hed never felt anything like this not in all his years not with marie not with йloise not with anyone pleasure shot through him so did pain pain in his chest pain stabbing up his arm pain he groaned and clutched at йloise in an instant the darkness in the bedroom became darkness absolute lucien йloise exclaimed he never heard her scream or anything else ever again scipio might have known it would happen one of these days hell he had known it might happen one of these days the huntsmans lodge was the best restaurant in augusta no other place even compared if anne colleton ever came to town this was where shed have dinner and there she sat at a table against the far wall talking animatedly with several local big shots scipio hadnt seen her for twenty years or so but he had not the slightest doubt shed aged very well even if he wouldnt have called her beautiful any more and she still sounded as terrifyingly selfassured as she ever had maybe even more so as befit its status as a fancy place to eat the huntsmans lodge was dimly lit scipio didnt think she recognized him he was just another colored waiter not one serving her table he thanked heaven he hadnt let jerry dover talk him into taking the headwaiters post then he would have had to escort her party to the table and she would have been bound to notice him even now he wasnt sure she hadnt she always held her cards close to her chest he didnt want to go anywhere near that table he didnt want to speak for fear she would know his voice he spent as much time as he could in the kitchens the cooks gave him quizzical looks he didnt get paid for roasting prime rib or doing exotic things with lobster tails his boss knew it too what the hell you doing hiding in there xerxes jerry dover demanded indignantly get your ass out and wait tables is sorry suh scipio answered but i gots to tell you is feelin right poorly tonight dover didnt say anything for a little while his eyes raked scipio you know he remarked at last theres niggers id fire on the spot they tried to use that kind of line on me yes suh scipio said stolidly firing was the least of his worries right now you aint one of em though you never tried shirking on me before the restaurant manager said he astonished scipio by reaching out to put a palm on his forehead you dont have a fever at least it isnt the grippe you need to go home go on then if youve a mind to i thanks you kindly suh as he had years before with john oglethorpe scipio needed to remind himself that white men could be decent he found it especially remarkable now with the freedom party in the saddle for the past seven years things were set up to give whites every excuse to be bastards and a lot of them didnt need much excuse somehow or other i finds a way to pay you back he felt like the mouse talking to the lion in the fable but the mouse actually had found a way to do it how could he dover only shrugged he wasnt worrying about it get the hell out of here he said you got your reasons whatever they are ive known you for a while now you dont fuck around with me so get scipio got he wasnt used to being out on the street so early he made a beeline for the terry the sooner he got into his own part of town the safer hed feel then he heard a gunshot down an unlit alleyway a scream and the sound of running feet maybe he wasnt so safe in the terry after all whites preyed on blacks but blacks also preyed on one another he wondered why his own people had so little why not try to rob whites who enjoyed so much more unfortunately an answer occurred to him almost at once if a negro robbed a white the police moved heaven and earth to catch him if he robbed another negro they yawned and went about their business hey nigger a womans voice all rum and honey called from the darkness you in your fancy clothes i show you a good time like you aint never seen scipio didnt even turn to look he just kept walking cocksuckin faggot the woman yelled after him all the sweetness gone bathsheba stared when scipio came into the apartment so early what you doin here she demanded i jus put the chillun to bed hed been trying to figure out what to tell her ever since he left the huntsmans lodge once upon a time you asked me how i came to be able to speak like this he answered in soft precise educated white mans english bathshebas eyes went wide the only time hed ever spoken like that in her hearing was to save their lives in the rioting not long after the freedom party took over now he had to tell the truth or some of it in that same dialect he went on a long time ago i was in the upper ranks of one of the socialist republics we tried to set up someone came into the restaurant tonight who knew me in those days im not certain whether she recognized me but she might have shes very sharp seeing anne colleton forcibly reminded him how sharp she was you learn to talk like dat on account of you was a red bathsheba asked scipio shook his head no i was useful to the reds because i could already talk like this i i was a butler a rich persons butler in south carolina there now she knewknew enough anyhow he waited for her to shout at him for not telling his secret years before but she didnt if you was a big red no wonder you dont say nothin she told him what we do now dunno he fell back into the slurred speech of the congaree negro talking in that other voice took him off to a world that had died in fire and blood and hatebut also a world where hed grown to manhood the contrasts terrified him mebbe nuttin mebbe run fas as we kin how bathsheba asked and he didnt have a good answer for her passbooks were checked these days as theyd never been before the war any black without a good reason for being where he wasand without the papers to back up that reasonwas in trouble people talked about camps no one knew much about them though they were easy to get into much harder to leave even so he said better we takes de chance they catches me he didnt go on if they caught him and realized who he was he wouldnt last ten minutes no trial no procedure theyd just shoot him bathsheba was still staring at him his wife clucked sadly a sound of reproach selfreproach he realized when she said i shoulda pussected what you was he needed a heartbeat or two to figure out that she meant suspected she went on if you was a red you had to hide out and you was smart gettin out o the state where you was at i werent no red not down deep not for real an for true scipio said but dey suck me in i dont go long wid dey dey shoots me jus like de buckra shoots me that was the truth cassius and cherry and the rest of the reds on the marshlands plantation had been in deadly earnest confidence in their doctrine had sustained themtill rifles and what little else they got from the usa ran up against the whole panoply of modern war and till they discovered their oppressors wouldnt vanish simply because they were called reactionaries bathshebas mind went in a different direction suddenly she said i bet xerxes aint even your right name is now has been fo years what your mama call you scipio he said and wondered how long it had been since hed spoken his own name more than twenty years he was sure of that scipio bathsheba tasted it then slowly shook her head reckon i like xerxes better is used to it she sent him an anxious look you aint mad do jesus no he exclaimed you go an forget you ever hear de other one dat name get around de buckra after we fo sure dey still remembers me in south carolina was that pride in his voice after all these years after all that terror after being sure at the time that he was walking into a disaster and after proving righter than even hed imagined was that pride god help him it was his wife gave him a kiss good she was proud of him too proud of him for what had to be the stupidest thing hed ever done in his life madness it had to be madness there was no sensible explanation for it but no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than bathsheba said every once in a whilelord moren every once in a whilethem white folks deserves a whack in the chops they truly does and that did make sense when things were bad you tried your best to make them better how didnt matter much lets go to bed he said how you mean dat bathsheba asked now he kissed her however you wants sweetheart he went up to the huntsmans lodge the next day with a certain amount of apprehension he checked the autos parked near the restaurant with special care none of them looked as if it belonged to either the police or freedom party goons he had to go to work if he didnt he wouldnt eat and neither would his family in he went jerry dover met him just inside the door go home the manager said bluntly get the hell out of here youre still sick youll be sick another couple of days too scipio blinked what you say go home dover repeated damn freedom party woman asking all kinds of questions about you ice congealed in scipios belly he might have known anne colleton would spot him did she ever miss a trick what you say to she he asked already hearing hounds baying on his trail i told her you aint who she thinks you are i told her you been working here since jerry dover answered his eyes twinkled god bless you mistuh dover but when she catch you in de lie she aint gonna catch me dover grinned at him i showed her papers from back then to prove it how you do dat now scipio was all at sea still grinning the manager said cause a nigger named xerxes did work here then he was only here a couple months but those were the papers i showed her bastard stole like a son of a bitch thats why they canned his ass i heard one of the owners bitching about it not too long after we hired you the name stuck in my head and so i watched you close after that but old oglethorpe was rightyoure firstrate anyway this here gal like to shit ill tell you you dont ever want to tell that one shes wrong she aint got no wedding ring and i can see why that made a perfect thumbnail sketch of the anne colleton scipio had known she would have thought she had him at lastand then she would have seen her hope snatched away no she wouldnt be happy not even a little bit god bless you mistuh dover scipio said again go home jerry dover repeated once more she may come back and try to raise some more trouble for you i dont want that i need you here too bad and dont get your bowels in an uproar ill pay your wages home scipio went in a happy daze safereally safefrom anne colleton at last he was back in the terry before he realized this wonderful silver lining had a cloud maybe he was free of anne colleton but now jerry dover had a hold on him miss anne had been far away dover was right here in town if he ever decided to go to the police scipio shivered but he kept on walking im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth the president of the confederate states said into the microphone as soon as the engineer behind the glass wall gave him the high sign and the truth is folks that kentucky is ours again and texas is whole again and our country is a long way back towards being what its supposed to be again the people spoke and the yankees had to listen the people said they were sick and tired of being stuck in the usa they came back where they belonged the stars and bars are flying in lubbock and san antonio and frankfort and louisville we took back what was ours because that was how the people wanted it he didnt say anything about losing the plebiscite in sequoyah the papers and the wireless in the csa hadnt said much about it either people got the news he wanted them to have slanted the way he wanted it to go oh his coverage wasnt perfect by the nature of things it couldnt be too many people could also pick up wireless stations from across the us border but not a lot of them did confederates and yankees had disliked and distrusted one another for a long time now here and there along the border the yankees are still holding on to whats ours in sonora in arizona in arkansas and right here in virginia jake continued al smith tried to make me promise i wouldnt talk about those things if we had the elections last month but i dont call that an honest kind of promise no sir folks i dont call it honest at all not even a little bit he was saying ill give you back some of whats yours if you forget about the rest of whats yours now you tell me friendsis that fair is that right bang he slammed his fist down on the table a favorite trick of his i tell you its not fair i tell you its not right and i tell you that the confederate states of america deserve to be whole again the csa will be whole again this here that weve done now is only the beginning we dont want trouble with the united states we dont want trouble with anybody but we want whats ours and were going to get it he ended just as the light went red this wasnt one of his long speeches only a little one to remind people that hed got back two of the states the whigs had lost he stood up stretched and left the studio as always saul goldman waited for him outside in the hallway good speech mr president the director of communications said i dont think you can make a bad one thanks saul featherston answered we have a lot of things to take care of over the next few weeks youve got the incident simmering oh yes the little jew nodded well have something worked up if they dont take care of things for us theyre liable to you know jake nodded hell of course i know but well be able to get the story out the way we want it if its our incident to begin with bodyguards came up alongside of saul goldman goldman nodded to them in an absentminded way he didnt take security as seriously as he should have of course nobody was gunning for him either featherston didnt have the luxury of making that assumption he nodded to the men in the butternut uniforms they carried submachine guns at an identical angle their expressions were also identical tough and watchful jake was watchful too though he tried not to let it show party stalwarts had tried to bump him off once could he really trust party guards if he couldnt could he trust anybody in the whole wide world the guards led him out into the street they spread out before he got into his new armored limousine with virgil joyner shot dead his driver was new too he missed virgil he missed anybody whod known him in the old days and stuck with him through thick and thin harold stowe the new man was probably a better driver than joyner had been jake didnt care the man wasand acted likea servant not a drinking buddy back to the gray house harold featherston said harold he sighed to himself stowe didnt even go by hal or hank or anything interesting right mr president the driver said and put the limousine in gear jake sighed again a little louder this time virgil joyner had called him sarge hed had the right too not many people did not any more climbing shockoe hill was hard work for the heavy limousine thered been an ice storm the night before despite rock salt on the road the going was still slippery they crawled to the top in first gear when he strode back into the presidential residence his secretary met him just inside the door you know youre scheduled to meet with lieutenant general forrest in ten minutes dont you sir she said as if sure hed forgotten yes lulu i do know that he said let me go to the office and look at a couple of things and ill be ready for him an officer named nathan bedford forrest iii should have raised featherstons hackles hed campaigned against all the juniors and iiis and even vis who clung to power in the csa by virtue of what their ancestors had done and who hadnt done anything much on their own but for one thing the first nathan bedford forrest had been as much of a selfmade son of a bitch as jake was and hed been proud of it too and for another his greatgrandson wasnt a great war general staff relic hed been too young even to fight in the trenches from to he was a hell of a soldier now though with notions of how to use barrels as radical as his illustrious ancestors ideas about horses featherston liked the way he thought at the moment though forrest looked worried sir if the yankees decide to jump us for moving troops into kentucky and west texashe wouldnt call it houston refusing to recognize the validity of the nametheyll whip us they can do it if you dont see that youll land the country in a hell of a mess i never said they couldnt featherston answered but they wont nathan bedford forrest iii looked exasperated the first officer to bear the name had been a rawboned man who looked a bit like jake featherston his descendant had a rounder face though he kept his greatgrandfathers dangerous eyes they looked all the more dangerous when he glowered why wont they youve promised to keep those states demilitarized and youre going back on your solemn word what better excuse do they need if they attack me for moving my men into my states theyve got a war on their hands jake said calmly im telling you general they dont have the stomach for it and im telling you mr president youll take the country down in ruins if youre wrong the first nathan bedford forrest had had a reputation for speaking his mind his greatgrandson took after him to hell with the country featherston said nathan bedford forrest iii gasped jake went on ive got twenty dollars of my own money against twenty dollars of yours general the damnyankees wont move forrest frowned you sound mighty damn sure of yourself mr president i am mighty damn sure of myself jake featherston answered thats my job suppose you let me tend to it while you tend to yours i am tending to my job nathan bedford forrest iii said if i didnt point out to you that were liable to have a problem here i wouldnt be tending to it the damnyankees outweigh us theyre always going to outweigh us remember how much trouble the germans had against the tsars armies in the great war that wasnt because one russian was as good a soldier as one german it was because there were a hell of a lot of russians there are a hell of a lot of soldiers in the usa too jake featherston nodded theyll be able to outnumber us like you said that means well just have to outquick em you going to tell me we cant do that his voice developed a hard and ugly rasp if general forrest was going to tell him something along those lines hed be sorry no sir forrest didnt try weve got the airplanes and weve got the barrels and weve got the trucks too well run em ragged like jake like most of the confederates who were really involved with them he called barrels by the name they had in the usa some of the men whod done their service well away from the trenches still used the british name instead tanks featherston found that a useless affectation but the general wasnt through for he added if there is a war sir wed better win it pretty damn fast if we dont weve got troubles theyre bigger than we are like i say and they can take more punishment we dont want to get into a slugging match with them do you hear what im saying i hear you jake said coldly you make yourself very plain good thats good i want you to understand me nathan bedford forrest iii said if i have a choice id just as soon see us not have a war at all three years of the last one should have been enough to satisfy us for the rest of our days three years of war hadnt been enough to satisfy jake featherston hed fought with undiminished hatred from beginning to end some of that hatred had been aimed at the yankees the rest at his own side hed had plenty to go around he still did general i dont need to explain my policies to you i just need you to carry them out he said is that plain enough for you or shall i draw you a picture nathan bedford forrest iii looked back at him oh thats plain enough he answered but if youre being a damn fool sir dont you think somebody has the duty to come out and tell you so people told me that before i got kentucky and houston back jake said in a low furious voice was i right or were they people told me that when i brought dams and electricity into the tennessee valley was i right or were they people told me that when i made damn sure the farms in this country had the mechanical gear they needed so we wouldnt get stuck relying on niggers we cant trust was i right or were they damned if i know about that last one forrest said now weve got those niggers robbing houses in town instead featherston waited the general nodded all right sir i get your point but youd better be able to take my twenty dollars thats all ive got to say look here generali hope there wont be a war too featherston said but one way or the other the confederate states are going to get what we want we deserve it its our right to have it and were going to get it is that plain enough for you thanks to the whigs weve been waiting for almost twentyfive years thats too damn long we cant wait forever yes sir whatever you decide needs doing well try our best to give it to you forrest said doing that is our job figuring out what we needthats yours he got to his feet saluted and left jake looked after him as the door closed he said i know what needs doing though nathan bedford forrest iii could not hear him and by god i aim to do it mary pomeroy paused with a forkful of scrambled eggs halfway to her mouth its not fair she said the yanks let kentucky and houston vote on where they wanted to go and now theyre back in the csa it they let us vote the americans would be gone from here so fast it would make your head swim mort pomeroy chewed up a mouthful of baconcanadian bacon not the skinny strips that went by the name in the usabefore saying they let that sequoyah place vote too and it voted to stay in the united states red curls flew as mary tossed her head at least it had a choice the yanks dont give us any i cant do anything about that mort ate another chunk of bacon he might have been chewing on his words too after swallowing the bacon he spat out the words and neither can you she bridled the yanks had shot her brother for trying to do something about the occupation her father had fought a oneman war against the usa till his own bomb blew him up instead of general custer for whom it was intended mort braced himself regretting what hed said and getting ready for an argument before she could answer him alec spoke from his high chair more bacon he was wild for bacon and ham and sausageanything salty in fact sure sweetheart mary told him and gave him some while she cut it up for him she wondered what to say to her husband in the end all that came out was maybe youre right maybe i cant mort blinked plainly thinking hed got off easy he waited for her to come out with something else when she didnt he decided to count his blessings he finished his bacon and eggs his toast and jam and his tea then he got into his overcoat hat and earmuffs for the trip across the street to the diner it was warmer today than it had been lately the high might get up into double digits on the other hand it might not too mary also finished her breakfast then she let alec chase little pieces of bacon around his plate with his fork as long as he ate one every so often when it stopped being breakfast and turned into playtime she extracted him from the high chair and carried him over to the sink so she could wash his greasy face he liked that no better than he ever did and he was getting big enough to put up a pretty good fight but she was still bigger and so whether he liked it or not the grease came off she read to him for a while he liked queen zixi of ix even if a yank had written it she didnt suppose l frank baum had particularly disliked canada the book gave no sign that hed ever heard of itor of the united states either hard to go wrong with a world so thoroughly imaginary when alec started to fidget in her lap she let him down to play she didnt have to watch him quite every second these days he was old enough not to stick everything into his mouth the instant he saw it that let mary go into the kitchen and play with something of her own alec wandered in to watch whatcha doing he asked fixing something mary answered is it busted he asked it dont look busted doesnt mary said it doesnt look busted if it doesnt look busted how come youre fixing it conversations with children could be surreal by now mary had got used to that or as used to the unpredictable as you could get she said im not fixing it like that im fixing it up are you making it fancylike she shook her head no im just taking care of what needs taking care of that didnt mean much to alec it didnt mean much to her either she didnt care it kept him from asking too many more questions which was what shed had in mind she worked on it for a while then put it away before too long it would be done can we go out and play alec asked no its too cold can we throw snowballs ill bop you in the nose with one no its even too cold to throw snowballs how can it be too cold to throw snowballs alec was disbelieving its not too cold to snow its too cold for people to go out there unless they have to daddy went out there he just went across the street to the diner and he didnt stop to throw snowballs at anybody mary still wondered how mort had come to be daddy to alec her own father had always been pa to her she hadnt looked for anything like that to change but change it had sometimes daddy throws snowballs alec said mary couldnt very well deny that theyd had a memorable snowball fight only a few weeks before but she said he doesnt do it on days like this on days like this he stays inside where its warm as much as he can alec went to a window and looked out theres people out there i know there are people out there sometimes you have to go to the general store or to the dentist sometimes you have to deliver letters and things the way the postman does the yanks called him the mailman mary refused to shed been calling him the postman since she learned to talk and she wasnt about to change now she still called the last letter of the alphabet zed too she wondered if alec would after he started going to school yanks said zee which struck her as insufferably american do you have to go to the general store mommy alec asked hopefully no ive got everything i need right here mary answered she wasnt ma either she wondered why not how had the language changed while she wasnt looking she couldnt have said but it had cleaning and dusting here took only a fraction of the time they would have back on the farm she didnt have any livestock to worry about either how many times had she gone out to the barn no matter what the weather was like to feed the animals and collect eggs and muck out she didnt have a number but she knew it would have been a large one animals needed tending rain or shine or blizzard back on the farm if she had a moment to relax it probably meant shed forgotten something that needed doing here she could sit down and smoke a cigarette and read a book or listen to the wireless without feeling guilty about leaving work undone except for electric lights the wireless was the best thing about electricity shed found and there were replacements of sorts for electric lights gas lamps or even the kerosene lanterns her mother still used out on the farm what could replace the wireless for immediacy or for entertainment nothing she could imagine no sooner had that thought crossed her mind though than she remembered a story the rosenfeld register had run not so long before people were starting to figure out how to send moving pictures the same way they sent wireless signals apparently theyd broadcast pictures of a football game in new york city but the sets cost more than a thousand dollars mary didnt suppose theyd ever come down to where an ordinary person could afford them during the middle of the afternoon she started boiling a beef tongue in a big iron pot tongue was one of her favorite foods alec liked it too so did mort but he preferred it with cloves stuck in it back on the farm theyd always done it simply with carrots and onions and potatoes and whatever other vegetables they happened to have today she made it the way her husband liked he sniffed when he got back from the diner i know what that is he exclaimed thats nice mary said with a smile thats very nice mort said we dont serve tongue at the diner we cant get enough of it and not enough people would order it if we did well here it is mary told him sit down make yourself at home and itll be ready in a minute the way things turned out making himself at home kept him from sitting down for a while because alec tried to tackle him any football referee would have thrown a penalty flag mort only laughed and mommy fixed something up in the kitchen alec said trying to tell mort about the day i know she did sport his father answered and now were going to have it for supper no something else something this morning alec insisted mary wondered if mort would ask more questions he didnt instead he got alec in a half nelson and tickled him with his free hand alec squealed and wiggled and kicked mary hoped he wouldnt have an accident that sort of treatment was asking for trouble but alec didnt he was growing up hed start school pretty soon part of mary reacted to that with surprise and horror and not just because school would teach what the yanks wanted taught where had the time gone but part of her looked forward to getting him out of the apartment during the day he really was starting to notice too much of what went on around him yum mort said when he dug into dinner mary liked it too although she would have preferred the tender meat without cloves to her they distracted from the flavor they didnt improve it and alec made supper exciting when he bit into one and yelled that it was burning his tongue off a swig of milk helped put out the fire the next morning the sun shone brilliantly the mercury shot all the way up into the twenties mary wrapped the box shed been working on in brown paper and binder twine come on she told alec lets get you dressed up nice and warm we have to take this to the post office what is it something for your cousins over in ontario getting to the post office took a while even if it was only three blocks away alec threw snowballs and made snow angels and generally had more fun than should have been legal he had snow all over his front when they went in it promptly started to melt because wilf rokeby always kept his potbellied stove well fed with coal the smell of his hair oil was part of the smell of the post office he wore his hair parted right down the middle the way he had when mary was a little girl it had been dark then it was white now what have we got here he asked when mary set the box on the counter present for my cousins she answered as she had with alec like any smalltown postmaster rokeby knew a lot about what went on in his customers lives you dont have a lot to do with em he remarked nor the rest of your family either been years since i sent anything from you folks to ontario i got a wire from them mary said laura had a baby his face softened a baby thats nice he put the package on the scale then looked at a chart well you owe me sixtyone cents for this she gave him three quarters got her change and took alec back out into the snow jonathan moss got up from the table he put on his overcoat and hat im going to head for the office he said laura nodded i thought you would she gave him a quick perfunctory kiss do you really have to go in on a saturday morning though ive got to be in court monday morning and im not ready moss answered if i dont want to get slaughtered id better know what im doing say good morning to dorothy for me when she finally gets up i will a faint smile crossed lauras face i wonder where she gets it their daughter loved to sleep late a habit neither of them had dont know wherever it comes from i wish i could catch it well im off out the door moss went as soon as he closed it behind him he dropped his right hand into the coat pocket where he carried his pistol he didnt do that where laura could see him it made her nervous but not doing it once he was out in the hallway made him nervous no one lay in wait there no one troubled jonathan on the stairs no one bothered him on the way to his ford which he didnt park right in front of the apartment building he examined the auto before getting in it looked all right nothing blew up when he started the engine maybe this is all so much moonshine he thought as he drove to the office but he couldnt afford to take the chance what had happened to occupation headquarters in berlin proved that he might have laughed off threatening letters nobody but an idiot laughed off a bomb as usual he chose a route to the office different from the one hed used the day before he didnt park right in front of the building where he worked either he used the guarded lot nearby all the same the ends of his daily trips to and from work made him nervous if anyone was gunning for him those were the places where danger was worst because he always had to be there so far hed had no trouble maybe all his precautions were snapping his fingers to keep the elephants away then again maybe they werent the only way to find out was to stop taking them and even that might not prove anything he preferred not to run the risk up the steps and into the building no assassin lurking in the lobby up the stairs to his office wary every time he turned no crazed canuck stalking the stairway he opened the door flipped on the light switch and peered inside everything was exactly as hed left it he closed and locked the door then he took care of the morning housekeeping he made a pot of coffee and put it on the hot plate even though hed had a cup with breakfast waiting for it to get ready was a lonely vigil meanwhile the case ahead somebodyunder occupation regulations the military prosecutor didnt have to say whoclaimed his client had played an active role in the canadian uprising in the mids why whoever this was hadnt come forward years earlier was a question moss intended to raise as loudly as the judge would let him hed been trying to find out who had a grudge against allen peterhoff somebody who stood to gain from peterhoffs troubles was the likeliest to cause those troubles so far moss had had no luck finding anyone like that as far as he could tell peterhoff was a pillar of the community as for what hed been doing in and nobody seemed to have a lot of hard evidence one way or the other of course in cases like this hard evidence didnt always matter hearsay counted for just as much and often for more got to be some bastard after his money moss muttered to himself he hadnt seen a case as blatant as this for a long time it really belonged to the harsh years right after the revolt not to but here it was and the occupying authorities were taking it very seriously indeed that worried moss why were they flabbling about peterhoff if they didnt have a case moss had just poured himself his second cup of coffee from the pot when the telephone rang his hand jerked but not enough to make him spill the coffee he set down the cup and picked up the telephone jonathan moss speaking hello mr moss that cigaretteroughened baritone could only belong to lou jamieson moss onetime client was not a pillar of the community except perhaps for certain disreputable parts of it he went on i think maybe i found what you were looking for did you by god that perked moss up better than coffee tell me about it mr jamieson if youd be so kind tell him about it jamieson did if the man with dubious connections was telling the truthalways an interesting proposition where he was concerned then a couple of peterhoffs business associates stood to make a bundle if he vanished from the scene for ten or twenty years it wasnt anything showy or obvious but it was there by god moss said again his pen raced across a yellow legal pad as he jotted down notes the more he heard the happier he got thank you from the bottom of my heart he exclaimed when jamieson finally finished youve just saved an innocent man a hell of a lot of trouble even a military court will have to sit up and take notice when i use this thats nice mr moss jamieson said affably you done me a good turn a while ago with the goddamn yanks figured this was the least i could do for you he couldnt have cared less whether allen peterhoff was guilty or innocent what mattered was that he owed moss a favor if he hadnt peterhoff would have been welcome to rot in jail as far as he was concerned his sometime clients amoral cynicism would have bothered moss much more if jamieson hadnt proved so valuable as things were moss threw the notes in his briefcase thanked jamieson again and got ready to go home early dorothy will be glad to see me he thought and i hope laura will too he made sure he turned off the hot plate he didnt want to burn down the building by accident then he went out to his auto his hand stayed in the overcoat pocket with the pistol but he wasnt very worried nobody could reasonably expect him to leave at this hour he might even be back before the mailman got to the apartment building where he lived as usual he parked around the corner from the building even though he didnt expect trouble it was one of those days where he would almost have welcomed it he felt as if he were troubles master he remembered that for a very long time the thought filled his mind as he turned the corner that was when the explosion knocked him off his feet holy jesus he said bright shards of glass glittered in the snow blown out of nearby windows he picked himself up and ran toward the sound of the blast if anyone needed help hed do what he could he hadnt gone more than a few steps before he realized his building was the one that had suffered the hole in the front wall gaped from his floor and no moss whispered but that was his apartment or rather that had been his apartment not much seemed left of it not a whole lot seemed left of the ones to either side either smoke started pouring out of the hole as broken gas lines or wires set things ablaze call the police someone shouted call the fire department somebody else yelled jonathan moss heard them as if from very far away he ran toward the front steps of the building where hed lived for so long try as he would though he couldnt go up them because all the people whod lived in the apartment building were flooding out some of them were bloodied and limping others just had panic on their faces laura moss shouted dorothy he didnt see them anywhere he hadnt really thought he would but hope died hard hope sometimes died harder than people people as he knew too well could be awfully easy to kill a man who lived on the same floor as he did pushed him away you dont want to try to go in mr moss he said the whole goddamn buildings liable to fall down my wife my little girl wasnt that your place where it happened his neighbor asked helplessly he nodded the other man said then theres nothing you can do for em now and thats the lords truth if they come out they come out if they dont he spread his hands more people pushed out of the building more bricks fell off it some landed in the snow one hit a man in the shoulder he howled like a wolf moss tried again to go into the building again he failed people took hold of him and dragged him back by main force sirens screamed in the distance rapidly drawing closer screams bubbled in moss throat why they didnt burst out he had no idea everything he cared about had been in that flat now the flat was gone and twentyfive years of his dreams and hopes with it he tried to think though his stunned wits made it next to impossible hed been getting threats for a long time he hadnt taken them too seriously till the bomb went off in the occupation center after that he realized disaster really could happen to him and now it had who he muttered who would have wanted to blow up a woman and a child for if this was a bomb as seemed horribly likely whoever had sent it must have addressed it to laura or dorothy had it had his name on it they would have left it alone he would have opened it and it would have blown up in his face fire engines howled to a stop the police came right behind them and soldiers in greengray helped clear people away from the building move it they shouted the whole thing may collapse get out of the way the firemen shouted they began playing streams of water on the spreading flames a lot of the water splashed down onto the people who had lived in the building that moved them away faster than the soldiers could have a major called whose place was it that went up mine moss said dully you werent inside there the officer stated the obvious youd be hamburger if you were hamburger my wife is hamburger my little girl is hamburger moss managed to shake his head no i was doing some work at the office i had just got out of my auto when when it happened laura dorothy he began to weep christ youre jonathan moss recognizing him the major suddenly put two and two together this wasnt a gas leak or anything like that this was a bomb or it probably was a bomb anyway now moss head moved up and down as mechanically as it had gone back and forth yes i think youre right somebody killed them he could say it it didnt sound as if it meant anything he was still deep in shock but part of him knew it would mean something before long the major seemed to sense it was too soon for questions he led moss down the street docile as a child moss went with him behind them the building fell in on itself xviii alec mary pomeroy called dont you dare pull the cats tail if he scratches you or bites you its your own fault mouser was on the whole a patient cat little boys though were liable to drive even patient cats past the limits of what theyd put up with mouser had bitten alec only a couple of times but he scratched whenever he thought he had to alec was still learning what would annoy him enough to bring out the claws sometimes his experiments seemed deliberately hairraising mary turned on the wireless just ahead of the hour to catch the news the lead story was a bomb that had blown up a police station in frankfort kentucky seventeen policemen were dead another two dozen wounded a group called the american patriotsa group the newscaster said sarcastically that no one had ever heard of till they committed this outragewas claiming responsibility and the president of the confederate states was all but foaming at the mouth jake featherston claimed the bombing proved kentucky was full of prous fanatics who refused to accept the results of the plebiscite the newscaster poured more scorn on that idea mary was willing to believe it simply because this smoothvoiced stooge for the yanks didnt in another bombing case the broadcaster went on investigators continue to probe the ruins of a berlin ontario apartment building seeking clues to the perpetrator of the atrocity a mother and child laura and dorothy moss are confirmed dead several other persons were injured in the blast and three remain missing a mother and a child that wasnt how mary had thought of them a traitor and her halfamerican brat was more what she had in mind that way she didnt have to remind herself that the woman whod been born laura secordborn with the name of a great canadian patriothad been a person as well as a political symbol she didnt want to think of the late laura moss as a person if she did she had to think about what shed done she couldnt remember the last time shed physically hurt anyone aside from spanking alec when he needed it maybe when she was little in a fight with her older sister but julia had several years on her so she might not have managed it even then well shed managed it now shed blown a woman and her little girl to kingdom come and shed hurt some other people with them not bad for a package shed mailed from wilf rokebys post office not bad or not good this is war she told herself look what the americans did to my family why should i care what happens to them or to the people who collaborate with them had the americans blown up women and children mary nodded defiantly of course they had with their bombs and their artillery she didnt feel guilty she paused too honest to go on with that the trouble was she did feel guilty unlike the yanksor so she insisted to herselfshe had a working conscience at the moment it was working overtime no one has claimed to be responsible for the murderous attack in berlin the newsman continued attention is however focusing on several known subversive groups when the truth is known severe punishment will be meted out mary laughed at that the yanks were liable to grab somebody say he was guilty and shoot him just to make themselves look good she remained certain that was what theyd done with her brother alexander alecs namesake her conscience twinged again did she want them to punish someone else someone who hadnt done anything for what shed done she wanted them to get out of canada past that she didntor tried not tocare ironically the victims husband and father barrister jonathan moss though a us aviation ace during the great war was well known in ontario for his work on behalf of canadians involved in disputes with the occupying authorities the man on the wireless said only desperate madmen who hate americans simply because they are americans would have click whyd you turn it off mommy alec asked because he was spouting a lot of drivel mary answered alec laughed thats a funny word what does it mean nonsense hooey rubbish drivel alec yelled alarming mouser hooey he liked that one too the cat didnt at least not yelled in its ears it fled alec ran after it screeching drivel hooey hooey drivel enough mary said he didnt listen to her enough she said again still no luck enough now she was yelling too short of clouting alec with a rock yelling at him was the only way to get his attention she didnt usually turn off the wireless in the middle of the news she found she missed it and turned it back on hoping it would be done talking about what had happened in berlin it was the newscaster said king charles xi of france has declared that the german empire is using kaiser wilhelms illness as an excuse for delay on consideration of returning alsacelorraine to france if strong measures prove necessary we are not afraid to take them he added prime minister churchill of great britain voiced his support for the french in a speech before parliament he said high time the germans go music blared from the speaker a chorus of women with squeaky voices praised laundry soap to the skies when mary first listened to the wireless she wanted to go out and buy everything she heard advertised on it she was vaccinated against that nonsense these days she did sometimes wonder why a singer with a voice good enough to make money would choose to sing about laundry soap because she couldnt make money with her voice any other way sometimes that didnt seem reason enough i killed two people one of them a little girl who never did anybody any harm the thought didnt want to go away even if she hadnt watched them die they were as dead as if shed taken them to a chopping block and whacked off their heads with a hatchet the way she had with so many chickens on her mothers farm laura secord betrayed her country mary had no doubt of that but who appointed you her executioner she asked herself her back stiffened she was damned if shed let herself feel guilty for long who appointed me her executioner the yanks did if they hadnt shot alexander her father never would have felt the need to go on the war path against them she was entitled to revenge for that she was entitled to it and shed taken it she nodded to herself nothing was going to make her feel sorry about ridding the world of laura secord every so often though she couldnt help feeling bad about dorothy moss she wished shed blown up the girls father instead yes the newsman went on and on about how he struggled for canadians rights but that overlooked several little details first and foremost no yank should have had any business saying what rights a canadian had or didnt have and jonathan moss had been one of the yanks whod beaten canada down during the great war and he was still a combat flier she remembered the newspaper stories about him yes better the bomb should have got him she was cutting up a chicken for stew in the kitchen when two trucks pulled to a stop in front of the diner they looked like the sort of trucks in which us army soldiers rode but they were painted a bluish gray not the greengray shed known and loathed since she was a little girl the men who piled out of the back of the trucks were in uniforms cut about the same as those us soldiers worebut again of bluish gray and not the familiar color mary wondered if the yanks had decided to change their uniforms after keeping them pretty much the same for so long why would they do that the soldiers all tramped into the diner that will make mort happy mary thought soldiers ate like starving wolves these days they also paid their bills the occupation was more orderly than it had been during the war and just afterwards that made it very little better not as far as mary was concerned fortyfive minutes later the soldiers came out and climbed into the trucks again the engines started up with twin roars away the trucks went beyond what mary could see from the window she reminded herself to ask mort about the men when he came back to the flat and hoped she wouldnt forget as things turned out she neednt have worried about that when her husband got home he was angrier than shed ever seen him whats the matter she asked he hardly ever lost his temper whats the matter he repeated did you see those trucks a couple of hours ago the trucks and the soldiers in them mary nodded i wanted to ask you he talked right through her do you know who those soldiers were do you no of course you dont he wasnt going to let her get a word in edgewise ill tell you who they were by god they were a pack of frenchies thats who frenchies from quebec the news made mary no happier than it had mort she was damned if she would call their home the republic of quebec though even if it had been torn away from canada for twentyfive years now thats right mort answered and do you know what else theyre going to be part of the garrison here at least the united states beat us in the war what did the frenchies do nothing not one single thing they dont even talk english most of em i swear to god honey id sooner have a pack of niggers watching over us than those people whats even worse is theyre canadians too mary said her husband gave her a look well they are even to herself she sounded defensive they used to be anyhow maybe mort said they sure dont act like canadians now though they sat there in the diner jabbering back and forth in french like a bunch of monkeys the only one who spoke enough english to order anything for them was a sergeant whod been in the canadian army once upon a time and he sounded like the devil too thats terrible mary said and mort nodded she asked him why are there frenchies here did you find out would they say oh yes they arent shy about talking even if they dont do it very well he answered reason theyre here is some of the us soldiers whove been on garrison duty are going back to the states that doesnt explain anything mary said why would the yanks want to do a thing like that after all these years the usa had occupied rosenfeld since she was a little girl no matter how much she hated that it was in a way part of the natural order of things by now i dont know for sure the frenchies didnt say anything about that mort replied but i know what my guess would bethat the yanks are starting to worry about that featherston fellow down in the confederate states you think theyre moving men to stop him mary asked her husband nodded again excitement blazed through her if youre right weve got a chance to be free and maybe this has been a war all along and i dont have to think im a murderer maybe please god cincinnatus driver watched a spectacle he had hoped he would never see a spectacle hed gone to kentucky to keep from seeing confederate troops marching into covington he was by then just starting to get up on crutches and move around he supposed he was lucky the auto that hit him could easily have killed him there were times when hed lain in the hospital and then back at his parents house that he wished it would have his mother took care of him as if he were a little boy she plainly thought he was all the years that had gone by since might as well not have happened she didnt even realize anything was wrong that to cincinnatus was the cruelest part of her long slow slide into senility and his father took care of both of them with as much dignity as he could muster and without much hope some of the neighbors helped as they found the chance his mother wandered off a couple of times but she didnt get far people watched her more closely than they had till cincinnatus got hit that was funny in a bitter way getting out of the house for a little while felt good to cincinnatus hed stared at the cracked waterstained plaster of the ceiling for too long he was weak as a kitten and he still got dreadful headaches that aspirin did nothing to knock down but he was alive and he was upright when a little more strength returned he would figure out how to get himself and his father and mother back to the usa meanwhile meanwhile he stumped along the neglected sidewalks of the colored district of covington toward the parade route the whole district seemed even more rundown than it had when he came back to covington it also seemed half deserted and so it was a lot of negroes had already fled to the united states he glanced over to his father who walked beside him ready to steady him if he stumbled you sure ma be all right while were gone i aint sure o nothin seneca driver answered but i reckon so he walked on for a few paces then said one thing i aint sure of is how come you wants to see these bastards comin back cincinnatus wasnt altogether sure of that himself after a little thought he said i got to remind myself why i want to git back to iowa so bad maybe maybe his father sounded deeply skeptical seneca had reason to sound that way too only a handful of blacks headed for the parade route most of the people who came out to see this underscoring of the return of confederate sovereignty were white men with freedom party pins in their lapelsor if they didnt wear lapels as many didnt on the front of denim jackets or wool sweaters cincinnatus hadnt been the target of looks like the ones they gave him for many years people in des moines thought negroes curious beasts not dangerous ones one of the blacks on the street was a familiar face lucullus wood hed visited cincinnatus at the hospital and several times at his parents house as far as a negro could be lucullus was a man to reckon with in covington a generation earlier his father had been too seeing cincinnatus and seneca lucullus came across the street to say hello aint this a fine day he said a freedom party man might have used the same words a freedom party man might even have used the same tone of voice but the words and the tone would have had a very different meaning in a freedom party mans mouth lucullus understood ironyblacks whod been born in the csa understood irony from the moment they could talk and no party stalwart ever would never thought id see it cincinnatus agreed none of the plump eager white men in earshot could have taken exception to his words or tone either in fact one of them turned to another and said you see even the niggers is glad to have the damnyankees gone they know they was well off before his friend replied cincinnatus didnt look at lucullus neither of them looked at seneca he didnt look at them none of them had any trouble knowing what the other two were thinking remarking on it would have been a waste of breath off to the south cincinnatus heard a peculiar noise partly musical partly a low mechanical rumble both pieces of the noise got louder as it came closer before too long cincinnatus recognized the music a marching band was blaring out dixie playing the tune for all it was worth that there song used to be against the law here lucullus said by the way he said it he thought it was too bad dixie had been illegal cincinnatus knew better a casual listenera white listenerwouldnt have wonder what ever happened to that luther bliss cincinnatus said reckon he aint never gonna show his face here no more dont miss him one damn bit since the former head of the kentucky state police had thrown him in jail most of him meant that the rest though couldnt help remembering how hard and how well bliss had fought confederate diehardsand anyone else he didnt care for reckon yous right lucullus answered cincinnatus sent him a sharp look a casual listener wouldnt have heard anything wrong with his words there either cincinnatus wondered if he knew more than he was letting on here came the band the freedom party menand the smaller number of women with themburst into applause a lot of them began to sing cincinnatus couldnt applaud not with his hands on the crutches his father and lucullus did he couldnt blame them better safe than sorry behind the band marched several companies of confederate soldiers their uniforms didnt look much different from the ones cs troops had worn during the great war but there were changes most of them had to do with comfort and protection the collars on these tunics were open at the neck the cut was looser less restrictive their helmets came down farther over the ears and the back of the neck than the great war models had they werent the steel pots us soldiers wore but they werent much different from them the rifles they carried funnylookin guns cincinnatus said to lucullus in a low voice gasoperated dont need to work the bolt to chamber a round after the first one in the clip lucullus spoke with authority theys new not everybodys got em they is very bad news though not even all the parading soldiers carried the new rifles some had submachine guns instead cincinnatus didnt see any with ordinary great warvintage tredegars the confederate states couldnt arm as many men as the united states they seemed to want to make sure the men they did have would put a lot of lead in the air the barrels that grumbled and clanked up the street were different from the ones cincinnatus remembered from the great war too they carried their cannon in a turret on top of the hull they also looked as if they could go a lot faster than the walking pace that had been their top speed a generation earlier trucks towed artillery pieces fighters and bombers with the cs battle flag on wings and tail roared low overhead more marching soldiers finished the parade wonder what they think o this on the other side of the ohio cincinnatus said the city that was nearly his namesake lay right across the river from covington if theys happy theys crazy lucullus said after looking around to make sure no white was paying undue attention jake featherston he promised there wouldnt be no confederate soldiers in kentucky for twentyfive years he jump the gun just a little bit i reckon cincinnatus father looked around too we done seen the parade he said what i reckon is we better git back to our own part o town he was bound to be right even negroes who werent doing anything to anybody were liable to be fair game in covington moving on his crutches made cincinnatus sweat with effort and pain in spite of the chilly day but he moved anyhow once back inside the colored district he said we got to get out of here aint easy no more now that this here is a confederate state but we got to best thing you kin do is jus walk right across the bridge to cincinnati lucullus said aint quite legal like it was but the us soldiers dont bother niggers much since neither cincinnatus nor his mother was up to much in the way of walking he and his parents took a taxi to the nearest bridge two days later his mother stared out the window as if shed never been in an auto in her life as far as she could remember she hadnt they didnt get across no one got across to protest the confederates military occupation of kentucky the usa had sealed the border between the two countries cincinnatus thought of getting a boat and crossing the ohio any way he could he thought of it but not for long he remembered too many stories about negroes trying to cross into the usa getting turned back at gunpoint or sometimes just shot he couldnt take the chance especially since his mother with her wits wandering was liable to give them away when us forces pulled out of kentucky a consulate had opened in covington hoping the official there might help cincinnatus visited the place that turned out to be another wasted trip a large sign on the window said closed indefinitely due to illegal confederate action frustrated and frightened cincinnatus went back to his parents house dammit im a citizen of the usa i live in iowa he raged how come i cant get home be thankful it aint worse his father said the philosophy of a man whod spent the early years of his life as a piece of property no matter how bad things were he could easily imagine them worse not so cincinnatus bein stuck here in covington is as bad as it gits he said but seneca was right a few days later the covington courier ran what it called a notification to the colored residents of the confederate state of kentucky it told them they had to be photographed for passbooks as is the accepted and required practice for negroes throughout the confederate states of america seneca took the order in stride had to do this afore the war i recollects he said that was so cincinnatus remembered his own passbook but he said i done without one o them things the last twentyfive years dont you recollect what its like to be free i recollects the trouble you finds if you dont got one his father answered i aint no confederate nigger i aint gonna be no confederate nigger neither cincinnatus said im a citizen of the united states what the hell i need a passbook for you dont want to get in trouble with them freedom party fellas you better have one his father answered that was all too likely to be true cincinnatus raged against it anyhow raging against it did him exactly no good for the time being he was stuck here in kentucky sooner or later he expected things to get back to normal and the border between the csa and the usa to open up again he also expected to get the cast off his leg and to learn to walk without crutches once more and he expected to take his father and mother back to des moines with him he always had been an optimist for a long time dr leonard odoull had been satisfiedno more than satisfied happyto live in a place like riviиreduloup the world forgetting by the world forgot he couldnt remember where hed seen that line of poetry but it suited the town very well and it had suited him too but however much he sometimes wanted to he couldnt quite forget that he was an american that he came from a wider world than the one in which he chose to live reading about the gathering storm far to the southeven reading about it in french which made it seem all the farther awaybrought that home to him in an odd way so did the passing of his fatherinlaw to leonard odoull lucien galtier had stood for everything he admired about quebec a curious mix of adaptability and a deeper stubbornness now that the older man was gone odoull felt as if hed lost an anchor that had been mooring him to la belle rйpublique his wife of course had other feelings about the way her father had died one part shock odoull judged to about three parts mortification did it have to be there she would say over and over again did he have to be doing that coronary thrombosis comes when it comes odoull would reply as patiently and sympathetically as he could the exertion the excitement they could without a doubt help bring it on patience and sympathy took him only so far about then nicole would usually explode but people will never let us live it down knowing how places like riviиreduloup and the surrounding farms worked odoull suspected she was right even so he said you worry too much many of the people ive talked to say theyre jealous of such an end men nicole snarled tabernac what do you know that was unfair to half the human race not that she cared then she went on and what of poor йloise granche is she jealous of such an end that unfortunately wasnt unfair and was very much to the point йloise wasnt jealous she was horrorstricken and who could blame her to have to watch someone die at such a moment how would she ever forget that how could she ever want to get close to another man as long as she lived odoull said your father didnt leave us unappreciated he needed to pause there to pick the right word after another moment he went on would you rather it had happened while he was mucking out the barn id rather it didnt happen at all nicole answered but that wasnt what hed asked and she knew it now she hesitated at last she said maybe i would it would have been more more dignified death is never dignified odoull spoke with a doctors certainty never dignity in death is something we invent afterwards to make the living feel better i would have felt better if it had happened while papa was in the barn nicole said whether he she broke off not soon enough and burst into tears osti do you see even im starting to make jokes about it and if i do whats everyone else doing the same thing probably odoull said people are like that its not right nicole said he wouldnt have wanted to be remembered this way she cried harder than ever although leonard held her and patted her and did his best to comfort her he was far from sure she was right hed known his fatherinlaw for a quarter of a century wouldnt lucien galtier have taken a certain wry pride in the reputation that grew out of his end lucien might even have taken a pride that wasnt so ordinary any number of ways to go to how many though was it given to go like a man which brought him back to the question nicole had asked what about йloise she was wounded no doubt about it and lucien wouldnt have wanted that hed cared for her even if he hadnt necessarily loved her but would things have been any easier for her if hed dropped dead while they were dancing not after theyd gone back to her farmhouse maybe a little maybe a little yes but not much one of these days odoull told himself yes one of these days ill have to pour a few drinks into georges and find out what he really thinks about this the time wasnt ripe yet he knew that but it would come a lot of things for which the time hadnt been ripe looked to be coming most of them were a lot less appetizing than lying down with a nice woman and being unlucky enough not to get up again that evening the newscaster on the wireless gave an account of a speech president smith had made at camp hill pennsylvania the president of the united states spoke with just anger regarding the confederate states violation of their pledge not to send soldiers into kentucky and the state formerly known as houston the frenchspeaker made heavy going of the place names he continued the president of the united states also reminded the president of the confederate states that he had pledged himself to ask for no more territorial changes on the continent of north america if he ignores this solemn undertaking president smith said he cannot seriously expect the united states to return to him the portions of virginia arkansas and sonora to which he has referred he had trouble pronouncing arkansas too and why not arkansas was a long long way from the republic of quebec al smith finally seemed to have decided he couldnt trust jake featherston as far as odoull could see the us president had taken longer than he might have to figure that out he had it down now though more than what hed said where hed made the speech spoke volumes almost eighty years ago now robert e lees army of northern virginia had crushed mcclellans army of the potomac at camp hill ensuring that the confederate states would triumph in the war of secession no president of the united states would have anything to do with the place these days unless he wanted to tell his own people were in trouble again nicole didnt understand any of that neither did little lucien who was anything but little these days odoull found himself envying his wife and son for being so thoroughly quebecois he also found himself reminded that no matter how long hed lived here he was at bottom an american hed sometimes wondered about that he didnt any more when he went to his office the next morning newsboys were hawking papers by shouting about president smiths speech papers in quebec always seemed to back the usa to the hilt more royalist than the king more catholic than the pope again why not the great war had touched lightly here which it hadnt anywhere else between alaska and the empire of mexico odoulls receptionist was already at the office when he got there she smiled at him and said bonjour monsieur зa va pas pire merci he answered which made her smile nobody who spoke parisian french would have said not bad thanks like that odoull had put down deep roots here and he knew it he went on when is the first appointment half an hour doctor she said good ill see what i can catch up on till then he went into his private office to skim through medical journals he wished he had time to do more than skim he had never knownhad never imaginedsuch an exciting age in medicine back when he was a boy immunization and sanitation had begun to cut into death rates which had kept on falling ever since now though some of the new drugs on the market were doing what quack nostrums had promised since the beginning of time they really were curing diseases that could easily have been fatal how many times had he watched someone die of infection after surgery that would have succeeded without it more than he cared to recall certainly now with luck heand his patientswouldnt have to go through that particular hell any more and here was an article about some new medicine that was said to beeven more effective than the sulfonamides which had been the last word for the past year or two drugs that killed germs without poisoning people were to him far more exciting than fighters that flew twenty miles an hour faster and five thousand feet higher than previous models not everybody thought so though which meant new models of fighters came out more often and got more fanfare than new drugs did they were liable to be used too which worried him madness he muttered and went back to reading about this fungus with what seemed a miraculous ability to murder microbes his first patient was a pregnant woman due in about six weeks hed always liked working with women who were going to have babies their condition was obvious and usually had a happy outcome he only wished the rest of what he did were as easy and rewarding then he saw a child with mumps he couldnt do anything about that despite the new drugs in the medical journal the little boy was very unhappy but he would get better in a few days a man with a bad back came in next im sorry monsieur papineau he said but aspirins and liniment and rest are the most i have to offer you tabernac papineau said cant you cure it if you could put me under the knife for it i would go in a minute i cant pick up my children or make love to my wife without feeling im breaking in two dr odoull considered papineau was younger than he was and might not be shocked at a suggestion on the other hand he might riviиreduloup was a straitlaced place in a lot of ways still worth a try since you mention it monsieur it could be that you might have less pain during intimacy if your wife were to assume the ah superior position there that sounded properly medical was it too medical for papineau to understand evidently not for he turned red what you mean her on top calisse i didnt mean to offend odoull said hastily i offered the suggestion only for reasons of health and comfort you were the one who mentioned the ah difficulty after all well so i did his patient looked thoughtful for reasons of health maybe i wonder what louise would say papineau left the office rubbing his chin odoull managed to hold in a snort of laughter till he was gone then it came out he was still smiling when his next patient a little old lady with arthritis came in whats funny doctor she asked suspiciously nothing to do with you madame villehardouin he assured her i was just remembering a joke i heard last night she gave him a fishy stare but couldnt prove he was lying he had only aspirins and liniment to offer her too as far as things had come in the past few years they still had at least as far to go a few days later he ran into papineau in a grocery as usual the man moved in a gingerly way but he greeted odoull with a smile that was a wonderful prescription you gave me doctor he said wonderful well im glad it did you some good odoull said papineau nodded enthusiastically odoull was pleased at helping him and his pleasure diminished only a little when he reflected that hippocrates could have given the same advice yes medicine still had a long way to go the ground unrolled beneath jonathan moss his fighter dove like a falcon dove in fact far faster than any falcon could dream of diving he was coming out of the sun the young hotshot calmly tooling along in the other fighter had no idea he was theretill he zoomed past had it been a dogfight his opponent never would have known what hit him his wireless set let out a burst of static and then a startled squawk son of a bitch how the hell did you do that uh over moss started to make a joke to say something like clean living but the smile and the words died unspoken he thumbed his own wireless and answered son i did that because i wanted it more than you he thought hed stopped but his mouth kept going i want it more than anybody does a long long pause followed before he remembered to add over wasnt all that the lords bitter truth he did want it more than anybody else and what hed known since the war was over ever since he got his law degree hed done everything he could to make things better make them more tolerable for canadians hed married a canadian patriot hed had himself a halfcanadian little girl and what thanks had he got some other canadian someone who no doubt thought of himself as a patriot had blown up everything in the world that mattered to him wherever that other canadian lived he was bound to be laughing and cheering these days hed settled his score with a yank all right he sure had i wasted twenty years of my life the only thing moss wanted more than sitting in this fighter was to be able to pilot the biggest bomber the united states had he wanted to fly it at random over some goodsized canadian town open the bombbay doors and pour out a couple of tons of death the way that canadian had sent laura and dorothy death through the mail he wanted that so badly he could all but taste it he could practically feel the bomber jump and get livelier as its heavy load of explosives fell away hallucination of course it seemed very real just the same maybe the bombs had been meant for him maybe but he didnt think so people in his family didnt open mail unless it was addressed to them had the bomb had his name on it his wife and daughter would have left it alone and they might still be alive and i wouldnt hed had that thought the day the bomb went off why would anyone want to kill a woman and a little girl that ate at moss could somebody have been angry enough at laura for marrying an american to want to see her dead moss knew some of the people who wanted canada free once more were a fanatical lot but that fanatical it seemed excessive even for them and most of them were willing to admit hed done a few useful things in his time there hed had some threats but theyd never amounted to anythingnot till now what hed done here didnt matter any more hed had his life rearranged for him the sooner he got out of canada now the happier hed be the wireless crackled again the other fighter pilot said im going back to the airstrip now major over ill follow you moss answered over and out hed put the uniform back on as soon as hed buried laura and dorothy he hadnt asked for the promotion from the rank hed held in the great war theyd seemed eager to give it to him though and acted afraid he wouldnt come back to flying the way things were looking along the border with the csa and out in the pacific they were anxious to grab all the warm bodies they could he wondered what he would have done had laura lived chucking his practice to fly for the usa might have meant chucking his marriage too well he didnt have to worry about that now there was the airstrip with the snow bulldozed off it some airplanes here landed on skis instead of wheels during the winter but his didnt have them he lowered his landing gear and bumped to a stop groundcrew men came up to take charge of the fighter wearily moss pushed back the canopy and got out the fur and leather of his flying gear kept him warm on the ground in wintertime he remembered the way that had worked from the days of the great war ever since hed lost laura and dorothy those days seemed more real more vivid more present in his mind than much of what had happened since a young lieutenant emerged from one of the buildings flanking the airstrip and struggled through the snow till he got to the cleared runway then he could hurry as young lieutenants were supposed to do saluting he told moss the base commandants compliments sir and hed like to see you in his office right away well then id better get over there hadnt i moss said ambiguity permeated his relations with captain oscar trotter hed got on fine with major finley trotters predecessor theyd both been great war veterans and understood each other the new commandant was a younger man hed never seen combat never drunk himself blind three or four nights in a row so he wouldnt have to think about friends going down in flames three or four dreadful days in a row never drunk himself blind so he wouldnt have to think about going down in flames himself and of course trotter was only a captain even though he was in charge of the field outside of london he had trouble giving moss orders now that moss had put the uniform back on and wore golden oak leaves on his shoulder straps moss saw no point in making things worse than they were already reporting as ordered he said when he walked into trotters office that let the commandant know he was willing to take his orders even if he didnt call him sir or salute first trotter nodded he didnt salute either have a seat major he said acknowledging moss rank that way so he also didnt have to say sir he waved the older man into the chair in front of his desk it creaked when moss sat down in it it always did whats up moss asked trotter lit a cigarette before he answered he shoved the pack of raleighs across the desk so moss could have one too as moss lit up the commandant pushed a sheet of paper across the desk after the raleighs your orders have come through was that relief in his voice moss wouldnt have been surprised base commandants didnt like ambiguity and with reason it weakened their authority if trotter got moss out of his hair he could go back to being senior officer here in every sense of the term the cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth moss reached for the paper it bore the embossed eagle in front of crossed swords that had symbolized the usa since the revival after the second mexican war he read through the orders then looked up at captain trotter you have an atlas of the united states here sir where the hell is mount vernon illinois i thought you were from illinois trotter answered pulling a book off a shelf behind his chair im from chicago moss replied with dignity downstate is all the back of beyond as far as im concerned he might have been talking about darkest africa captain trotter opened the atlas then pointed here it is he turned the book around so moss could see too right in the middle of the pointy end that goes down to where the ohio and the mississippi meet uhhuh moss said hell of a nice place to fly missions into kentucky from looks like to me or to defend if the confederates start flying missions out of kentucky trotter agreed i dont want to defend to hell with defending moss said savagely if those bastards think they can start a new war i want to go out and tear em a new asshole so theyll goddamn well think twice that made captain trotter grin no wonder youre still a good pilot youve got the killer instinct all right moss knew he should have smiled too try as he would he couldnt yes he had a killer instinct hed been thinking about that while he was up in the fighter but he hadnt thought about it in terms of the confederates then hed thought about canadians people hed been dealing withhell people hed liked people hed lovedfor more than twenty years trotter might have picked that out of his head maybe getting away from these parts will do you good he said will it i have my doubts moss answered it wont bring laura and dorothy back to life it wont make me stop wanting to blow canada to hell and gone the commandant shifted uneasily in his swivel chair he didnt seem to know what to make of that moss could hardly blame him he hadnt known what an explosive mixture grief and rage and hate could be till it overwhelmed him for a moment he wondered if the damned canuck whod sent laura the bomb had had that same hot furious blend blazing in him only for a moment then moss shoved the thought aside to hell with what the damned canuck had been thinking if i knew who it was regretfully moss shoved that thought aside too he didnt know from what us investigators said it wasnt likely he ever would well trotter said any which way you will be going back to the states your orders say as quickly as practicable how soon can you be on a train if moss hadnt had tragedy strike him he knew he wouldnt have got that much consideration the other officer would have said be on the train at seven tomorrow morning and off he would have gone here though even if he didnt think getting away would do much for him he was far from sorry to put canada behind him i dont have much left to do here he said ive been settling affairs ever since since it happened after my apartment got blown to hell its not like ive got much left to throw in a suitcase if it wasnt for your kindness i wouldnt have a suitcase to throw my stuff in either id say we owe you more than a suitcase major moss trotter told him ive taken the liberty of checking the train schedules he paused to see if that would annoy moss it didnt he knew the commandant was only doing his job when he nodded trotter continued next train from toronto to chicago gets into london at this afternoon thats what the schedule says anyway moss observed dryly if the train was within half an hour of that it would be doing all right trotter nodded yeah thats what it says and a train from chicago to mount vernon goes out at half past nine tomorrow night youll have to kill some time in chicago but if youre from there it shouldnt be too bad maybe moss said he didnt want to see his family hed had enough trouble with them at the funeral but captain trotter didnt need to know about his difficulties there his family had thought he was crazy to marry laura secord and theyd seemed offended when the union didnt fall apart in short order but he could find ways to spend time in chicago without having anything to do with them he could and he intended to good luck trotter said moss didnt laugh in his face for the life of him he couldnt figure out why if hed had anything remotely approaching good luck his wife and daughter would still be alive and he wouldnt be wearing us uniform again but he hadnt they werent and he was thanks captain he said very much as if he meant it when hipolito rodriguez walked into freedom party headquarters in baroyeca the first thing he saw was a new map on the wall it showed the confederate states as they were now with kentucky and what had been called houston back in the fold the lands the united states had seized in the great war and not yet returnedchunks of virginia arkansas and sonorahad a new label unredeemed territory that same label was applied to sequoyah even though the plebiscite there had gone against the csa part of rodriguezthe part that had hated los estados unidos ever since their soldiers tried to kill him during the great warrejoiced to see that label on sequoyah a lingering sense of fairness made him wonder about it though pointing to the map and to sequoyah in particular he asked robert quinn is that truly the way it should be sн seсor rodriguez absolutamente the local freedom party leader answered the election in sequoyah was a shame and a sham since the war los estados unidos sent so many settlers into that state that the result of the vote could not possibly be just since they had no business occupying the land in the first place they had no business settling it either is this what seсor featherston says rodriguez asked quinn nodded it certainly is and it is something more than that it is the truth a priest celebrating the mass could have sounded no more sure of himself rodriguez eyed the map again slowly he nodded but he could not help saying if seсor featherston tells this to the united states they will not be happy they thought the plebiscite settled everything are you going to lie awake at night flabbling about what the united states think quinn dropped the english slang into the middle of a spanish sentence which only strengthened its meaning but hipolito rodriguez gave back a shrug it could be that i am seсor he said please remember i have a son who is in the army i have two more sons who could easily be conscripted since he was only in his midforties himself he was not too old to put the butternut uniform on again but he said nothing about that he was not afraid for himself in the same way as he was afraid for his boys how long have you wanted revenge against the united states quinn asked softly a long time rodriguez admitted oh sн seсor a very long time indeed but now it occurs to me as it did not before that some things may be bought at too high a price and is it not possible that what is true for me may also be true for the whole country jake featherston wont let anything go wrong quinn spoke with utmost confidence hes been right before hell keep on being right well have our place in the sun and well get it without much trouble too you wait and see rodriguez let that certainty persuade him toocertainty after all was a big part of what hed been looking for when he joined the freedom party bueno he said i hope very much that you are right sure i am quinn said easily why dont you just sit down and relax and well go ahead with the meeting falling back into that weekly routine did help ease rodriguezs mind robert quinn went through the usual announcements there were more of those than there had been in the old days for the party had more members in baroyeca now rodriguez and the other veterans of the hard times couldnt help looking down their noses a little at the men who had joined because joining suddenly looked like the way to get ahead no denying though that some of the newcomers had proved useful once the announcements were done the party men sang patriotic songs mostly in spanish a few in english as they always did they finished with dixie then quinn said now there is something i want you men to think about when you go home tonight it is possiblenot likely mind you but possiblethat los estados unidos will give us a hard time about our rightful demands against them if that does happen we may have to take a very firm line with them if we do theyll be sorry you can bet your bottom dollar on that and you can bet los estados confederados wont back down again applause filled the crowded room rodriguez joined it even though that wasnt exactly what quinn had told him before the formal meeting started then hed sounded as if he didnt think the united states would fight of course he was a politician and politicians had a habit of telling people what they wanted to hear but rodriguez hadnt thought freedom party men did that sort of thing then quinn said ill tell you something else too friends during the last war the mallates stabbed us in the back we would have licked los estados unidos then if those black bastards hadnt betrayed us well that isnt going to happen this time por dios jake featherston will clamp down on them good and hard to make sure it doesnt he got another round of applause a louder one this time rodriguez pounded his callused palms together till they hurt he didnt care what happened to the confederacys negroes as long as it was nothing good hed got his baptism by fire against the black rebels in georgia in before his division went to fight the damnyankees in texas hed hardly seen a negro since he got out of the army if he never saw another one that wouldnt break his heart as long as we stand behind jake featherston a hundred percent nothing can go wrong quinn said he knows whats what this country will be great againgreat i tell you and every one of you every one of us will help more applause again hipolito rodriguez joined it why not seeing the confederate states back on their feet was another reason hed joined the freedom party one more was that robert quinn had never treated him like a damn greaser an english phrase he knew much too well the party had nothing against men from sonora and chihuahua it saved all its venom for the mallates why shouldnt it rodriguez thought they deserve it we never tried to hurt the country weve been loyal he scorned the men from the empire of mexico who sneaked into the csa trying to find work too if any people deserved to be called greasers they were the ones robert quinn held up a hand before we call it a night and go home ive got one more announcement to make ive been trying to push this through for a long time but i havent had any luck till now i heard from the state party chairman the other day now its certain the silver mine in the hills outside of town is going to open up again next month and even though this part isnt so sure it does look like the railroad will be coming back to baroyeca he grinned at the freedom party men remember you heard it here first this time he got something better than applause he got delighted silence followed by a low excited buzz the mine had been closed ever since the collapse and the railroad had stopped coming to baroyeca not much later rodriguez wondered what had made the authorities change their minds after so long two men sitting in the next row back answered the question for him one of them remarked need plenty of plata to fight a war sн sн the other agreed and where theres a little silver theres always a lot of lead need plenty of lead to fight a war too ahh rodriguez murmured to himself he liked seeing how things worked he always had maybe the authorities hadnt decided to reopen the mine from the goodness of their hearts alone maybe theyd seen that they would need silver and especially lead well what if they had it would still do the town a lot of good if the railroad came back prices at diazs general store would drop like a rock shipping goods in by truck on bad roads naturally made everything cost more after the train line shut down the storekeeper had been lucky to stay in business at all plenty of other places in town hadnt three cheers for seсor quinn somebody shouted the cheers rang out quinn stood there looking suitably modest as if the news hadnt been his doing at all maybe it really hadnt not altogether but he deserved some credit for it when the party meeting did end several men headed over to la culebra verde to celebrate rodriguez thought of what magdalena would say if he came home drunk sometimes after he had that thought he had another one i dont care then he would go off to the green snake and see how much cerveza or more rarely tequila he could pour down when he did that magdalena had some very pointed things to say the next morning things a headache often did not improve tonight he just started out into the countryside beyond baroyeca the new line of poles supporting the wires that carried electricity made sure he couldnt get lost even if he were drunk the sky was black velvet scattered with diamonds a lot of stars seemed to be out tonight one of them a bright red one startled him by moving then he heard the faint buzz of a motor overhead un avion he muttered in surprise he couldnt remember the last time hed seen an airplane above baroyeca it was flying south he wondered where it was going off to scout the border with the empire of mexico that seemed most likely but wouldnt it do better to scout the border with the usa maybe other airplanes were doing that rodriguez hoped so when he fought up in west texas the only airplanes hed seen had belonged to the united states the confederate states stretched too thin hadnt been able to deploy many on that distant less than vital front would things be any different in a new war yes los estados confederados had kentucky and houston back again so that texas was whole once more maybe theyd even get back the other territory they had lost in the great war but that map on the wall of freedom party headquarters still said los estados unidos were bigger and bigger still meant stronger in a long drawnout fight maybe jake featherston knew something he didnt he hoped so he couldnt see what it might be though with one son in the army with two more likely to be called up he also couldnt help worrying when he got back to the farmhouse he smiled at the fine white electric light shining out through the windows magdalena had left a lamp burning no not burning shed left a lamp onfor him shed waited up for him too he didnt say anything about the growing threat of war instead he talked about the silver mines reopening and the likely return of the railroad to baroyeca his wife smiled she nodded and then she said this is all very good but i still hope there will be peace with los estados unidos rodriguez realized he wasnt the only one worrying chester martin passed a newsboy on his way to the trolley stop the kid had a stack of the los angeles times in front of him as tall as the bottoms of his knickers he waved a paper at chester and shouted out the mornings headline smith says no usually chester walked right past newsboys that was enough to stop him though oh he does does he says no to what exactly the newsboy couldnt tell him theyd told the kid what to yell before they turned him loose and that was it he yelled it again louder this time smith says no for good measure he added read all about it give me one chester parted with a nickel the newsboy handed him a paper he carried it to the stop as soon as he got there he unfolded it and read the headline and the lead story al smith had said no to jake featherston the confederates werent going to get back the pieces of sonora and arkansas and virginia theyd lost in the waror sequoyah either smith was quoted as saying the president of the confederate states personally promised me that he would make no more territorial demands on the north american continent he has taken less than a year to break his solemn word no matter what he may feel about his promise however i am resolved to hold him to it these territories will remain under the administration and sovereignty of the united states about time martin said and turned the paper over to read more just then though the trolley came clanging up chester threw another nickel in the fare box and found a seat his was far from the only open copy of the times as the streetcar rattled away a man of about martins age sitting across the aisle from him folded his newspaper and put it in his lap with an air of finality theres going to be trouble he said gloomily the woman sitting behind him said thered be worse trouble if we gave that featherston soandso what he wants how soon would he be back trying to squeeze something else out of us lady i spent three stinking years in the trenches the man answered there isnt any trouble worse than that he looked over at chester for support arent i right were you there yeah i was there martin said i dont know what to tell you though looks to me like that guy is spoiling for a fight the longer we keep ducking the harder hes going to hit us when he finally does yikes the man jerked in surprise he sent martin a betrayed look who cares about those lousy little chunks of land well i dont not much chester admitted but suppose we give them back to him and then he jumps on us anyway wed look like a bunch of boobs and wed be that much worse off too why would he jump on us if hes got everything he wants the man demanded before chester could say anything the woman whod been arguing beat him to it because somebody like that never has everything he wants as soon as you give him something he wants something else when you see a little kid like that you spank him so he behaves himself from then on how do you spank somebody wholl shoot back if you try the man asked if we dont spank him hell shoot first chester said the woman in back of the other man nodded emphatically they all kept on wrangling about it till first the woman and then the other man got off at their stops chester kept on going down into the south bay the area was growing fast builders wanted to run up lots of new houses the construction workers union was doing its best to stop them till they met its terms this tract in torrance had been carved from an orange grove the trees had gone down the houses werent going up or not very fast anyway when martin walked into the union tent across from the construction site the organizer who kept an eye on things during the night a tough little guy named pete mazzini wore a worried expression whats up chester asked grabbing the coffee pot that perked lazily over the blue flame of canned heat i hear they really are gonna sic the goddamn pinkertons on us today mazzini said shit chester said and the other man nodded pinkertons are bad news mazzini nodded again martin hadnt seen pinkerton goons since the steelmill strikes in toledo after the great war in a way fighting them was even worse than fighting cops a fair number of cops were fundamentally decent guys anybody whod sign up to use a club or a blackjack or a pistol for the pinkertons had to be a son of a bitch at least i found out mazzini jerked a thumb toward the building site dumb night watchmen over there dont think about how voices carry once everything quiets down good martin had never got more than three stripes on his sleeve during the war but hed commanded a company for a while now he had to think not like a captain but like a general weve got to let the pickets know as soon as they start showing up theyll be ready because weve had word the builders might pull this weve got to bring in as many weapons as we can not just sticks for the signs either well need knives guns too if we can get em in a hurry we start shooting that gives the cops all the excuse they need to land on us with both feet mazzini said he wasnt wrong all the same chester answered if we let the goons break us were screwed too if they break us we might as well pack it in you want that hell no mazzini said i just wanted to make sure you were thinking about it oh i am bet your ass i am martin scratched his chin im going to call somebody from the daily breeze torrance papers arent down on unions the way the goddamn times is we ought to have an honest witness here i think ill talk to the torrance cops too the builders dont have them in their pocket like in la if they know the pinkertons are going to raise hell ahead of time maybe they can step on em pete mazzini looked as if he would have laughed in anybody elses face good luck he said his shrug declared that he washed his hands of dealing with all police anywhere i dont suppose it can make things any worse yawning he agreed to hang around and warn the incoming pickets of the trouble ahead while chester went to talk with the man from the daily breeze and the police and make other arrangements when chester got back he said thanks pete you can go home and get your forty winks now mazzini gave him a look hell no if theres gonna be a brawl i want in on it those bastards arent going to lick us as easy as they think they are he yawned again and fixed himself what had to be his millionth cup of coffee the reporter from the daily breeze showed up an hour or so later he had a photographer with him which gladdened chesters heart meanwhile union backers came up to the men on the picket line slipped them this or that and then went on their way martin and mazzini exchanged knowing glances neither said a word at twenty past eleven half a dozen autos with torrance cops in them pulled up by the building site martin wondered if theyd known what would go on before he told them when a reporter from the times showed up five minutes later he stopped wondering they had at twenty to twelve two buses that had seen a lot of better years pulled up around the corner here we go chester said softly it had been a long long timehalf a lifetimesince hed shot at anybody but he knew he could nobody whod been through the great war was likely to forget what gunplay was all about here came the pinkerton men they looked like goons drunks and toughs and guys down on their luck whod take anybodys money and do anything because they hadnt had any real work for such a long time they carried a motley assortment of iron bars and wooden clubs one guy even had what martin belatedly recognized as a baseball bat something far far from its new england home others grim purpose on their faces kept one hand out of sight knife men and shooters martin thought and made sure he could get at his own pistol in a hurry we dont want any trouble now said a torrance policeman with the map of ireland on his face he and his pals formed a thin line between the advancing goons and the picketers who were shaping a line of their own a skirmish line chester warily watched the scabs on the site if they took his men from behind while the pinkertons hit them from the front he grimaced that wouldnt be good at all as if reading his mind mazzini said i told a couple of our guys to start shooting at the scabs if they even take a step towards us some bullets go past their heads i dont think theyve got the balls to keep coming chester laid a hand on his shoulder for a moment good thanks a short scrawny ferretfaced man in a loud snappy suit seemed to be the pinkertons commander time to teach these damn reds a lesson he said in a voice that carried low growls rose from his men as if from a pack of angry dogs he pointed go get em instead of growling the goons roared and charged some of the torrance cops swung their billy clubs most of them let the pinkertons go by the union men roared too they were outnumbered but not too badly some of them ran forward to meet the goons head on a few others hung back watching the scabs here we go chester said an odd note of exultation in his voice he snatched up a club and waded into the brawl he didnt want to start shooting first but he had nothing at all against breaking a few heads he almost got his broken as soon as he started fighting a goon carrying an iron bar with a chunk of concrete on the end swung it for all he was worth it hummed past chesters ear he clobbered the pinkerton before the fellow could take another swing at him that scrawny guy in the sharp suit didnt mix it up along with the strikebreakers hed brought he stayed out of the fight and yelled orders martin pointed at the man with his club get him he yelled to one of the torrance cops whod managed to whack his way clear and was standing on the sidewalk as if it were the sideline of a football game the cop paid him no attention but when the union men started getting the better of the strikebreakers their boss was the one who first pulled a pistol out of his pocket chester tried to shift his club to his left hand so he could grab his own gun but a goon had hold of his left arm in desperation he threw the club instead he got lucky it caught the fellow in the sharp suit right in the bridge of the nose he let out a howl that pierced the shouts and curses of the brawling men in front of him dropped the pistol and clapped both hands to his face when he took them away a moment later he had a mustache made of blood he bent for the pistol but the daily breeze photographer not content to stay neutral dashed up and grabbed it screaming you fucker the pinkertons boss jumped on him they had their own private brawl till the reporter from the local paper weighed in on the photographers side then the little guy with the gaudy clothes took his lumps so did his goons thanks to martin and that photographer nobody started shooting chester knew how lucky that was the union men drove the toughs back to their buses in headlong retreat a rock smashed the windshield on one of the buses both drivers got out of there a lot faster than theyd come the next morning the times called it a savage labor riot the daily breeze knew better so did chester he also knew the union had won a round they wouldnt see the pinkertons for a whilebut when they did the other side would be loaded for bear xix the sweet sue jounced west across the rough waters of the atlantic back toward boston harbor george enos jr stood near the bow of the fishing boat thinking about things that had changed and things that hadnt he turned to carlo lombardi who was smoking a cigarette beside him back in george said my old man was coming home from a fishing run he didnt have a wireless set on his ship when he got back into port he found out that goddamn serb had blown up the austrian archduke and his wife and everything was going to hell lombardi paused to take another drag before he answered were lucky we can find out everythings going to hell before we get into port aint life grand nowadays yeah grand george tried to look every which way at once of course its liable not to be the wireless that tells us how do you mean the other fisherman asked scratching his head if a war starts youve got to bet the confederatesll have their submarines up here ahead of time only stands to reason right george said if they do first thing well know about it iswham fuck lombardi said and pitched his cigarette into the green water he eyed george sourly you bastard now youre going to have me looking around for a periscope or a goddamn torpedo all the way till we tie up at t wharf yeah well ive been doing that ever since we started back from the grand bank george said that sneaky confederate son of a bitch torpedoed my father after the last war was done itd be just like one of those bastards to nail me before this one even starts fuck lombardi said again and gave george an even more jaundiced onceover you better not be a goddamn jonah thats all ive got to say my old man was the one with the bad luck george said the other man thought that over then slowly nodded if he didnt believe it he kept it to himself george went on maybe there wont be a war this time around maybe i keep on hoping there wont anyway i hope for free pussy too when i go to a whorehouse lombardi said lighting another cigarette i hope for it but that aint how things work he sucked in smoke better not be another war if there is the tobaccoll all be shitty my pa used to bitch about that all the goddamn time how lousy the smokes were cause we couldnt get no confederate tobacco george didnt remember whether his father had complained about bad tobacco hed been too little when george enos senior got killed and his father had been away at sea too much while alive to leave behind a lot of memories george did recall one night when his father kept asking if he and mary jane were ready to go to bed yet he hadnt been ready and his indignation still rankled across a quarter of a century all of a sudden out of a clear blue sky he started laughing like hell whats so goddamn funny lombardi asked nothing not really george answered the other fisherman gave him a particularly fishy stare he didnt care it wasnt the sort of joke he could explain just the same he suddenly understood why his father had kept wanting him to go to bed which he hadnt when he was a little boy he was liable to use that same impatient tone of voice to find out if his own boys were ready to go to sleep so he could be alone with connie as a matter of fact he knew damn well hed used that tone of voice with them before and if a new war does start and if your boat goes to the bottom is that what you want them to remember you for he wondered had the same question ever occurred to his father probably not but then his father hadnt known anything about a big war before he found himself in the middle of the biggest one of all time people living in the usa nowadays didnt have that excuse neither did people living in the csa the great war had hurt them even worse they or at least jake featherston seemed readyhell seemed eager for another round george wondered why he found an answer too the same way as hed found an answer when he thought about his old man the confederates lost that means they want revenge the usa had lost two wars in a row to the csa that had made people here twice as serious about getting their own back now after a win people here thought everything was square south of the border they didnt will there ever be an end will both sides ever be satisfied at the same time he thought that one over too unlike the other questions it didnt have an answer that leaped into sight no confederate submersible or commerce raider challenged the sweet sue no dive bomber dropped explosives on her from the sky she sailed back into boston harbor as if pulling fish from the sea were the hardest most dangerous thing to do men had ever invented in peacetime it came close peacetime though felt like summertime even as you enjoyed it you knew it wouldnt last when the sweet sue tied up at t wharf the first officer made the best deal he could with the buyers normally george would have stuck around to find out how good the deal was his own share of the pie depended on how big a pie he was looking at today though he drew fifty dollars against whatever the total would be and headed for the apartment where he spent rather less time than he did at sea he had to get past all the harborside attractions that tried to separate fishermen from their money and make them forget about their wives football games and raucous music blared from wireless sets in saloons a drunk reeled out of a tavern he almost ran into george easy pal george said and dodged music with more of a thump and pound to it music played by real live musicians poured out of strip joints hearing that kind of music made you think about the girls whod dance to it and about what they wouldor wouldntbe wearing you could get drinks in those joints too but theyd cost twice as much if you didnt want to drink if you didnt want to watch if you wanted to get down to business a swarthy tiredlooking woman about georges age leaned out of a secondstory window and beckoned to him she wasnt wearing anything from the waist up her breasts drooped they seemed tired too she tried to sound alluring when she called how about it big boy george kept walking the whore swore at him even her curses sounded tired his block of flats stood only a couple of streets farther on he hurried to it unlike the one where hed lived with his mother it had an elevator most of the time he took that as proof hed come up in the world when he stepped into the lobby now though the cage was empty the car was on some upper floor he didnt have the patience to wait for it he went up four flights of stairs taking them two at a time till his knees got tired the key to his apartment was brass a good thing too with all the time he spent out on the ocean an iron key would have rusted on the chain he put the key in the lock and turned it connies startled voice came from the kitchen whos there and then realizing only one person besides her had a key she went on is that you george well its not the tooth fairy and its not the easter bunny and its not santa claus he answered she came rocketing out of the kitchen and into his arms he squeezed her till she squeaked she felt wonderful he didnt stop to think that hed been at sea so long the wicked witch of the north would have felt good to him he kissed her things might haveno things would havegone straight on from there if bill and pat hadnt charged him and tried tackling him in ways that would have got flags thrown on any gridiron in the country fortunately they werent big enough to do any serious damage daddy daddy daddy they squealed if they went on after that it was in voices only dogs could hear he let go of connie and hugged the boys they were also good to come home to in a different way his wife asked how long will you be here this time dont know didnt hang around to find out he said i just drew part of my pay and headed on over here when they want me again theyll come after me well at least they wont have to scour the saloons to find you connie said some of those people george didnt say anything to that he just tried to look virtuous he didnt know how good a job he did for one thing he intended to take a drink or three while he had the chance for another connies father had seen the inside of a tavern and the bottom of a glass more than a few times in his day but george didnt want to think about that right this minute either he asked how are things here pretty good connie answered theyve been good boys they havent tried to pull the ears off the cat or flush the sears roebuck catalogue down the toilet they had committed the felony with the catalogue one crumpled page and then more than one crumpled page at a time till a flood and two spankings resulted they hadnt messed with the cats ears at least not where their parents could catch them but then whiskers unlike the hapless catalogue could take care of himself the cat strolled up to see what the commotion was about he gave george a leisurely glance then yawned showing needle teeth oh its you he might have said he remembered george between trips just well enough to tolerate being petted and of course george smelled of fish which made him interesting how was the run connie did her best not to sound anxious her best could have been better if the run wasnt good things got tight she had to make ends meet on whatever george brought home pretty good we brought back a lot of tuna he answered only question now is how much itll bring news hasnt been good connie said and he nodded she went on that might drive prices up maybe i can hope he sniffed what smells good i was stewing a chicken she told him we were going to have it for two nights maybe three but who cares ive got to show you im a better cook than the cookie dont i youre a lot cuter than davey anyhow he said which made her squawk he went on i just hope bill and pat get sleepy pretty soon both boys let out indignant howls if hed listened to them he would have believed they would never fall asleep again fortunately he knew better connie turned red my father used to say things like that when he came home from a fishing run so did mine george said i never understood why till not very long ago i dont remember much about my pa but that sticks in my mind how come daddy bill asked i dont know it just does george answered its the sort of thing a fisherman would say thats for sure bill asked why again george didnt say not in words he kissed connie again instead as far as he was concerned that was the best answer he could give jefferson pinkard looked around at his kingdom and found it not so good he turned to mercer scott the guard chief at camp dependable for chrissake mercer he said what the hell are we gonna do when those goddamn sons of bitches in richmond send us another shipment of niggers this campll go boom on account of there just aint no room for any more spooks in here do they care do they give a shit dont make me laugh scott shifted a chaw of red man from his left cheek to his right he spat a stream of tobacco juice onto the ground you sure as hell aint wrong he said we got us coons hangin from their heels like they was bats dunno where else we can put em on the roofs maybe he laughed to show that was a joke jeff laughed too though it was anything but funny if he could have put bunks on the roofs of the prisoner barracks he would have done it he didnt know where else to put them that was for sure bastards dont send us enough in the way of rations neither we got pellagra we got hookworm we got plain oldfashioned starvation wouldnt take a whole lot more food to make all that stuff a hell of a lot better damned if i can see why youre gettin your ass in an uproar about that scott said theyre only niggers no they aint only niggers theyre a bunch of goddamn reds too so who gives a shit if they die aint nobody gonna miss em its not pinkard frowned looking for the word that summed up how he felt about it its not orderly dammit if they give me so many prisoners theyre supposed to give me enough food for that many too thats just the way things work as a matter of fact that wasnt the way things worked theyd worked that way in the prisoner camps down in the empire of mexico not least because jeff had made sure they did and theyd worked that way in the birmingham jail because it was longstanding policy that they work so there was no longstanding policy for camps housing political prisoners and negroes taken in rebellion every day that passed saw such policy made scott seemed to understand instinctively the root of that policy it was who gives a shit if they die pinkard could see that for himself a hell of a lot of prisoners left camp dependable feet first he didnt like it he scavenged across the countryside for more rations than he was officially issued no doubt that did some good against the kind of overcrowding he was facing it didnt do much a guard trotted up to him heavy belly bouncing above his belt telephone call for you boss the man said he hadnt missed any meals none of the guards had neither had pinkard himself thanks eddie he said though he didnt know why he was thanking the guard telephone calls werent likely to be good news he tramped back to the office and picked up the phone pinkard speaking hello pinkard the clicks and pops on the line said it was a longdistance call this is ferdinand koenig calling from richmond yes sir the attorney general was jake featherstons righthand man freedom freedom ive heard you arent happy because you havent been getting enough advance notice of prisoner shipments koenig said as if hed just finished listening to jeff bitching to mercer scott uh yes sir thats true jeff said meanwhile he was thinking goddammit some son of a bitch here is telling stories about me back in richmond have to find out who the bastard is he didnt suppose he should have been surprised that koenigas attorney general or as freedom party big wig had spies in camp dependable all the same he wanted to be rid of them the attorney general didnt sound too angry as he said dont suppose i can blame you for that heres your news then youve got about fifteen hundred niggersmaybe two thousandheading your way they ought to be there in three four days jesus christ it wasnt a scream but it came close pinkard went on sir no way in hell this camp will hold that many more people were overflowing already thats why im telling you now koenig spoke with what sounded like exaggerated patience you have the time to get ready for those black bastards i dont suppose well get the rations we need to feed em jeff said only silence answered him he hadnt really expected anything else reproachfully he continued sir you know im a good party man i dont mean any disrespect or anything like that but what the hell am i supposed to do to get my camp ready for a shipment that big whatever you have to do ferdinand koenig paused pinkard didnt think he would say anything more but he did repeating whatever you have to do is that plain enough or do i have to draw you a picture id better not have to draw you a picture i heard you were a pretty smart fellow maybe he had just drawn a picture jesus christ jeff said again not much liking what he thought he saw you mean koenig cut him off whatever you have to do he said for the third time you can take care of it or ill find somebody else who will your choice pinkard which would you rather jeff thought it over it didnt take long he was a good party man the party mattered more to him than anything else the ruins of his marriage proved that and where emily had screwed around the party had always been faithful without it god only knew what he would have done when he lost his job at the sloss works didnt loyalty demand loyalty in return ill take care of it mr attorney general dont you worry about a thing i wasnt worried koenig said like i told you if you didnt somebody else would but im glad its you i know youve put in a lot of time for us and i know youll do a good job here too you wont screw it up and leave a bunch of loose ends or anything like that youd better not was what he meant hell no jeff said quickly when i do somethin i do it right and proper good koenig said and the line went dead pinkard stared at the telephone for close to half a minute fuck he muttered and finally hung it up he trudged out of the office whats up mercer scott called to him are you the spy i wouldnt be surprised ive run my mouth around you well no more goddammit but scott had to know about this jeff said in three or four days were getting another fifteen hundred two thousand niggers scott stared holy shit he said they cant do that this place wont hold em oh yes it will pinkard said how scott demanded you were just now telling me it wouldnt hold the niggers weve got and you were right you know damn well you were right ill tell you how and pinkard did holy shit scott said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice you sure you know what youre talking about you sure you know what youre doing under other circumstances the questions would have infuriated jeff not now he nodded uneasily i know all right get the guards we needyoull know the ones we can count on then pull out the niggers all at once scott asked after a moment jeff shook his head no thatd be asking for trouble take out a couple hundred less chance of anything going wrong yeah the guard chief eyed him how come im the lucky one what are you gonna be doing sittin in your office pouring down a cold beer had things been different that would have infuriated jeff too the way things were mercer scott had the right to ask pinkard shook his head you stay here and get the next bunch ready im going out with the first ones and i wont come back till the jobs done all right scott nodded thats fair i cant tell you it aint he stuck out his hand pinkard shook it he was grateful for any sort of reassurance he could get along with fifteen guards he led two hundred negroes away from camp dependable the black men came willingly enough as far as they knew it was just another work detail when theyd gone two or three miles from the camp he ordered them to dig a long deep trench this here aint nothing but a waste o time one of them said but he was only complaining the way people did when they had to do work they didnt care for pinkard didnt argue with him when the ditch was dug he ordered the negroes to lie down in it that drew more complaints you gots to put us on top of each other a man said we aint no goddamn fairies the guards stepped up onto a parapet made from the dirt the negroes had dug out even when they aimed their submachine guns at the men in the trench the blacks didnt seem to believe what was happening this is my camp jeff thought miserably im responsible for what goes on here he nodded to the guards the order was his to give and he gave it fire they did as soon as they started shooting it was as if the ground convulsed the submachine guns roared and stuttered and spat flame the guards slapped in magazine after magazine pinkard was appalled at how much ammunition his men needed to kill the prisoners the stenches of blood and shit filled the humid air at last the screaming stopped only the groans of the dying were left more than one guard vomited into the trench jeff felt like heaving up his guts too but sternly refrained scrape dirt over em he told the guards weve got more work to do the guards grumbled but not too much they seemed too stunned to do a whole lot in the way of grumbling and it got harder after that the negroes at the camp had to have understood what was going on when the guards came back and the men theyd been guarding didnt but mercer scott was no fool the first gang of blacks had gone off willingly enough yes he made sure the next bunch were shackled that way nobody tried to run off into the woods and swamp over the course of the next three days pinkard reduced the population of camp dependable by two thousand men that was how he referred to it in his reports that was how he tried to think about it too if he thought about reducing population he didnt have to dwell on shooting helpless prisoners a few of the guards were exhilarated after the job was done they were the ones who thought negroes had it coming to them most of the men were very subdued though they didnt mind jailing blacks or starving them shooting them in cold blood seemed to be something else again one shot rang out in the middle of the night a guard blowing his brains out he got buried too with almost as little fuss as if he were one of the blacks so casually disposed of when the promisedthe threatenednew shipment of negro prisoners arrived camp dependable was able to take them pinkard wondered if he would get a congratulatory call from ferd koenig he didnt maybe that made sense too after all hed only done what the attorney general needed him to do scipio wished to god he could get out of augusta but it wasnt so easy as it would have been a few years before things had tightened up everywhere a black man went it was show me your passbook boy if he started working in say atlanta he would have to produce the document that proved he was himselfor proved he was xerxes which amounted to the same thing and if he did that he would be vulnerable to either anne colleton or jerry dover he didnt think his boss at the huntsmans lodge had anything in particular against him he knew damned well his former boss at the former marshlands plantation did but he didnt like the idea of being vulnerable to dover much better than he liked being vulnerable to miss anne being vulnerable to anybody white terrified him at the restaurant the rich white men who ate there talked more and more of war so did the newspapers jake featherston was thumping his chest and foaming at the mouth because al smith wouldnt give him what hed promised not to ask for the year before scipio remembered too well what a catastrophe the last war had been for the confederate states under other circumstances the prospect of a new one would have appalled him under other circumstances as things were he more than half hoped the csa did start fighting the usa gain all eyes all thoughts would turn toward the front they would turn away from a town in the middle of nowhere like augusta and he had heard some of the things bombing airplanes could do nowadays that made him all the gladder augusta was a long long way from the border what made life harder was that whites werent all he had to worry about in augusta the terry was full of sharecroppers displaced from the land by the tractors and harvesters and combines that had revolutionized farming in the csa since the freedom party came to power the terry in fact held far more people than it held jobs a man who wasnt careful could easily get knocked over the head for half a dollarespecially a man who wasnt young and who had to wear a penguin suit to and from work so he looked as if he had money scipio made a point of being careful coming home was worse than going up to the huntsmans lodge going to work he had to face harassment from whites who fancied themselves wits most of them overestimated by a factor of two he had to give soft answers hed been doing that all his life he managed he came home in the middle of the night darkness gave predators cover and the augusta police rarely wasted their time looking into crimes blacks committed against each other every street corner on the way to his apartment building was an adventure most of the time of course the corners were adventures only in his own imagination he couldand didimagine horrors whether they were there or not every once in a while they were he walked as quietly as he could he always paused in the blackest shadows he could find before exposing himself by crossing a street nobody had worried about street lights in the terry even before the rise of the freedom party these days the idea of anyone worrying about anything that had to do with blacks was a painful joke voices from a side street made scipio decide he would do better to stay where he was for a little while one black man said aint seen nero for a while you wont neither another answered goddamn ofays cotched him with a pistol in his pocket do jesus the first man exclaimed nero always the unluckiest son of a bitch you ever seen what they do with him ship him out west one o them camps his friend said do jesus the first man said again you go into one o them places you dont come out no more oh mebbe you do the other man said mebbe you dobut it dont help you none huh the first man saida noise half grunt half the most cynical laugh scipio had ever heard you got dat right they throws you in a hole in the ground or else they throws you in the river fo the gators and the snappers to finish off i hear the same thing his friend agreed gator sausage mighty tasty i aint gonna eat it no mo never can tell who dat gator knowed he laughed too the black men walked on they had no idea scipio had been listening he waited till their footsteps faded before he went on to his apartment the huntsmans lodge served a fair amount of wild game venison raccoon bear every once in a while and alligator scipio had been fond of garlicky alligator sausage himself he didnt think he would ever touch it again three days later he was walking to work when police and freedom party stalwarts with submachine guns swept into the terry they werent trying to solve any specific crime instead they were checking passbooks anybody whose papers didnt measure up or who didnt have papers they seized let me have a look at that there passbook boy a cop growled at scipio yes suh scipio was old enough to be the policemans father but to most whites in the csa he would always be a boy he didnt argue he just handed over the document arguing with a badtempered man with a submachine gun was apt to be hazardous to your life expectancy the cop took a brief look at his papers then gave them back hell i know who you are he said you been paradin around in them fancy duds for years go on get your black ass outa here yes suh thank you kindly suh scipio had taken a lot of abuse from whites for going to work in a tuxedo here for once it looked to have paid off he got out of there in a hurry that was unheroic he knew it it gnawed at him but what could he do against dozens of triggerhappy whites not one damned thing and he knew that too hed gone only a few blocks when gunfire rang out behind him first a single shot then a regular fusillade he didnt know what had happened and he wasnt crazy or suicidal enough to go back and find out but he thought he could make a pretty good guess somebody must have figured his chances shooting it out were better than they would have been if hed gone wherever the cops and the stalwarts were taking people they grabbed the fellow whod started shooting was probablyalmost certainlydead now even so who could say for sure he was wrong hed died quickly and hadnt suffered much scipio thought of alligators and wished he hadnt one of the waiters a skinny young man named nestor didnt show up at the huntsmans lodge jerry dover muttered and fumed scipio told him about the dragnet in the terry the manager eyed him you reckon they picked up nestor for something or other dunno mistuh dover scipio said reckon mebbe they couldve though what do you suppose he did dover asked hes never given anybody any trouble here dunno scipio said again dunno if he done anything them police i dont reckon they was fussy they were standing right outside the kitchen in a nice warm corridor he wanted to shiver even so nestor would have been wearing a tuxedo too fat lot of good it had done him jerry dover rubbed his chin hes a pretty fair worker let me make a call or two see what i can find out what would he have done if nestor were a lazy goodfornothing washed his hands like pilate scipio wouldnt have been surprised he didnt dwell on it with the crew shorthanded because nestor wasnt there he stayed hopping and nestor didnt show up either dover wore a tightlipped expression one that discouraged questions scipio and the rest of the crew got through the evening when he went back the next day the missing waiter still wasnt there that nerved him to go up to the manager and ask nestor he come back doubt it dover sounded as if he had to pay for every word that passed his lips time for a new hire he wont know his ass from richmond either nestor what he do scipio persisted you find out he got himself arrested thats what jerry dover sounded angry at scipioor possibly angry at the world he picked the wrong goddamn time to do it too what you mean scipio asked aint no right time to git arrested dover nodded well thats so theres no right time but theres sure as hell a wrong time what the cops told me yesterday was the city jails full so those niggers they caught in the terryyou know about that oh yes suh scipio said softly i tol you remember they almost rests me too thats right you did well im damn glad they didnt because id be down two waiters if they had if the restaurant manager was glad for any other reason that they hadnt arrested scipio he didnt show it he went on jails full up like i said so they went and shipped these here niggers off to one of those camps theyve started lord hep nestor then scipio said somebody go into one of them places i hear tell he dont come out no mo not breathin anyways hed heard it as gossip between two men hed never seen but that didnt mean he didnt believe it it had the horrid feel of truth jerry dover shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot what had he heard back in the days when scipio worked at marshlands hed been convinced the colletons couldnt keep a secret for more than a few minutes before the blacks on the plantation also knew it here at the huntsmans lodge the colored cooks and waiters and cleaners quickly found out whatever their white bosses knew or did they just as blacks kept secrets from whites out of necessity so whites might also find it wise to keep certain things from blacks but if dover had that kind of knowledge it didnt show on his face scipio thought it would dover did what he had to do to get along in the world in which he found himself who didnt except crazy people and saints but the manager was pretty honest pretty decent he was no freedomyelling stalwart without two brain cells to rub against each other he said you want to watch yourself on the street then dont you you know ive got some pull but it doesnt look like i can do anything about one of those places i watches myself real good suh scipio answered you say de city jail full up jerry dover nodded scipio asked him they rest white folks now de white folks go to dese camps too his boss looked at him as if hed asked whether the stork brought mothers their babies dont be stupid dover said that was good advice too it always was what worried scipio was it might not be enough hed escaped the last dragnet as much by luck as by anything else you could tell a man not to be stupid and maybeif he wasnt stupid to begin withhed listen but how the devil could you tell a man not to be unlucky fivethirty in the morning reveille blared armstrong grimes groaned he had time for that one involuntary protest before he rolled out of his cot and his feet hit the floor of the barracks hall at fort custer outside of columbus ohio then he started functioning at least well enough he threw on his greengray uniform made up the cot and dashed outside to his place in the roll callall in the space of five minutes what happened to men who were late had long since convinced him being late was a bad idea back home his mother had made the bed for him most of the time hed been sloppy at it when he first got here now a dime bounced off his blanket and bounced high the drill sergeant didnt have cause to complain about him or even notice himthe two often being synonymous he stood there trying not to shiver in the chilly dawn when the time came he sang out to announce his presence other than that he kept quiet everybody else did the same for once the drill sergeants seemed in a merciful mood they let the assembled soldiers march off to breakfast after only a minimum of growling and cursing everybody marched everywhere at fort custer armstrong had begun to think thou shalt march was in the bible somewhere right below thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vaintwo commandments he was learning more about violating every day he took a tray and a plate and a mug and silverware then advanced on the food a cooks helper loaded the plate with scrambled eggs and hash browns and greasy overdone bacon another one poured the mug full of coffee almost strong enough to eat through the bottom armstrong grabbed a seat at a long long table he put enough cream and sugar in the coffee to tame it a little threw salt on the eggs and potatoes and pepper on the eggs and then started shoveling in chow nobody talked much at breakfast nobody had time the drill here was simple feed your face as fast as you could armstrong had never much cared for manners he didnt have to worry about them here compared to the way some of the guys ate he might have come from the upper crust every once in a while he thought that was pretty funny more often than not he didnt have time to worry about it one way or the other as soon as he finished he shoved his tray and dirty dishes at the poor slobs whod drawn kp duty then he hustled out to the exercise yard he wasnt the first one there but he was a long way from the last bad things happened to the guys who brought up the rear of course bad things happened to everybody right after breakfast violent calisthenics and a threemile run werent the way armstrong would have used to settle his stomach the drill sergeants didnt care about his opinion they had their own goals his conscription class like any other had had some fat guys some weak guys he remembered who theyd been but the fat guys werent fat any more and the weak guys werent weak any more oh a few had washed out simply unable to stand the strain people said one fellow had died trying but armstrong didnt know if he believed that most of the recruits no matter what kind of shape theyd been in to start with had toughened up since after the run the conscripts relaxed with closeorder drill left left left right left the drill sergeant bawled to the rear haarch he screamed at somebody who couldnt keep the rhythm if his life depended on it armstrongs company had a couple of those unfortunates who drew more than their fair share of abuse hed never figured out why the army still needed closeorder drill doing it where the enemy could see you was a recipe for getting massacred but he didnt have any trouble telling one foot from the other or turning right and not left when he heard to the right flank haarch lunch that day was creamed chipped beef on toast otherwise creamed chipped beast or more often shit on a shingle armstrong didnt care what people called it he didnt care what he got either as long as there was plenty of it he would have eaten a horse and chased the driverand considering how fast he could pound out the three miles he probably would have caught him after lunch came dirty fighting and rifle practice like any reasonably tough kid who got out of high school armstrong had thought he knew something about dirty fighting the drill sergeant whod mercilessly thumped him in the first days lesson taught him otherwise hed been amazed to discover what all you could do with elbows knees feet and bent fingers if you happened to have a knife any civilian who fucks with me better have his funeral paid for he said the drill sergeant shook his head he may have been through the mill too or he may have a gun you cant kick a gun in the nuts remember that or youll end up dead that struck armstrong as good advice a lot of what the drill sergeants said struck him as good advice whether he would take it was another question he was no more interested than any other male his age in getting answers from someone else he thought he had everything figured out for himself after the fighting drill he and his company marched off to the rifle range that did help reinforce what the sergeant had said if you had a springfield in your hand you could put a hole in a manor a manshaped targetfrom a hell of a lot farther away than a man could put a boot in your belly and armstrong was a good shot a lot of you guys think youre hot stuff another drill sergeant said this one had a fine collection of sharpshooter and expert medals jingling on his chest listen to me though theres one big difference between doing it on the range here and doing it in the field in the field the other son of a bitch shoots back and if you think that doesnt matter youre dreaming armstrong only grunted he was sure it didnt matter he could do it here as far as he was concerned that meant he could do it period the drill sergeant said some of you think im kidding some of you think im talking with my head up my ass well youll find out its different in the field a hell of a lot of guys get out there and they dont shoot at all theres plenty of others who dont aim first they just point their piece somewherein the air probablyand start banging away what a bunch of fools armstrong whispered to the recruit next to him he wanted to laugh out loud but he didnt that would have drawn the drill sergeants eye to him which he didnt want at all as things were the sergeant sent a scowl in his general direction but it didnt light on him personally the veteran noncom went on theres just one thing youre lucky about the other side will have as many fuckups as we do that may keep some of you alive longer than you deserve on the other hand it may not too a machine gun isnt awful goddamn choosy about who it picks out his face clouded i ought to know he wore the ribbon for a purple heart too question sergeant somebody called yeah go ahead is it true the confederates are giving their soldiers lots and lots of submachine guns the youngster asked yeah thats supposed to be true the sergeant said i dont think all that much of the idea myself submachine gun only fires a pistol round it doesnt have a lot of stopping power and the effective range is pretty short he stopped and rubbed his chin it was blue with stubble though hed surely scraped it smooth that morning of course submachine guns do put a hell of a lot of lead in the air and the goddamn confederates can hold their breath till they turn blue but theyre never gonna have as many men as we do i expect thats why theyre trying it another recruit piped up why hasnt somebody made an automatic rifle if a submachine gun isnt good enough the confederates are supposed to be trying that too but there are problems the sergeant said recoil wear on the mechanism overheating having the weapon pull up when you fire it on full automatic keeping it clean in the fieldthose are some of the things youve got to worry about i wouldnt fall over dead with surprise if we start using something like that too one of these days but dont hold your breath either and the springfield is a goddamn good weapon we won a war with it we can win another one if we have to he waited sure enough that drew another question are we going to fight another war with the confederate states beats me the drill sergeant answered ive done my share of fighting and i am plumb satisfied but if that featherston son of a bitch isnt you need two for peace but one can start a war if he does start it its up to us itll be up to youto finish it armstrong grimes had no complaints if he had to be in the army he wanted to be there while it was in action what point to it otherwise he didnt think about getting hurt he especially didnt think about getting killed that kind of stuff happened to other people it couldnt possibly happen to him he was going to live forever the sergeant said and if he does start another war you will finish it right youll kick the csas mangy ass around the block right yes sergeant the young men shouted they were all as convinced of their own immortality as armstrong grimes i cant hear you the sergeant cupped a hand behind one ear yes sergeant the recruits might have been at a football game armstrong yelled as loud as anybody else thats better the drill sergeant allowed not good but better hardly anything anybody did in basic training was good you might be perfect but you still werent good enough they wanted you to try till you keeled over people did too supper was fried chicken and canned corn and spinach with apple pie a la mode for dessert it wasnt great fried chicken but you could eat as much as you wanted which made up for a lot armstrong used food to pay his body back for the sleep it wasnt getting after supper he had a couple of hours to himselfthe only time during the day when he wasnt either unconscious or being run ragged he could write homewhich he didnt do often enough to suit his motheror read a book or get into a poker game or shoot the breeze with other recruits winding down from an exhausting day or do what he usually did lie on his cot smoking cigarette after cigarette people said they were bad for your wind he didnt care he got through his three miles without any trouble and the smokes helped him relax you think theres going to be a war somebody asked the question had been coming up more and more often lately if there is the goddamn confederatesll be sorry somebody else answered damn right armstrong said in the midst of a general rumble of agreement we can lick em someone said and then added what might have been the young mans creed if our fathers did it hell we can do it easy damn right armstrong said again two hours after he sacked out they had a simulated night attack he bounced out of bed to repel imaginary enemies he didnt miss the sleep why would he he was already too far behind for a little more to matter colonel clarence potter imagined a man he had never seen he didnt know if the man lived in dallas or mobile or nashville or charleston or richmond wherever he lived he fit right in he sounded like the people around him he looked like them too and acted like them when the time came to shout freedom he yelled as loud as anybody when he had a few beers in a saloon he grumbled about what the damnyankee innovation of the forward pass had done to the great game of football and when he was by himself this man potter had never seen would write innocentlooking letters or send innocentsounding wires up to the united states he would be doing business with or for some firm or other based north of the masondixon line and some of his messages really would be innocent and some of them would go straight to the us war department in philadelphia the man potter had never metwould never meetwas the mirror image of the spies he ran in the usa hed had the idea he had to assume his opposite number up in the united states had had it too he didnt like that but he had to believe it he kept wondering how much damage that imaginary us spy could do trouble was the bastard almost certainly wasnt imaginary a german had trouble sounding like a frenchman and vice versa but a yankee and a confederate were too close to begin with differences in accent were small things if you came from the usa you had to remember to say things like note or banknote instead of bill people would follow you if you used your own word but theyd know you were a foreigner but if you were careful you could get by something else worried clarence potter he ran spies the probable counterpart of one of the fellows he ran would also be a spy if you had people in place as spies though wouldnt you also have them in place as provocateurs as saboteurs he didnt know whether the confederates had provocateurs and saboteurs lurking in the usa he didnt know because it was none of his business what he didnt know he couldnt tell in philosophy up at yale though hed learned about what plato called true opinions he was pretty damn sure he had one of those about this question he also had some strong opinions about where hed put provocateurs and saboteurs he sat down in front of his typewriter to bang out a memorandum in it he said not a word about spies provocateurs and saboteurs in the united states he did mention the possibility that their us equivalents were operating in the confederate states it would be unfortunate he wrote if the usa were able to take advantage of similarities between the two countries in language custom and dress and it is to be hoped that steps to prevent such dangerous developments are currently being taken when he reread the sentence the corners of his mouth turned down in distaste he didnt like writing that way it set his teeth on edge he would rather have come straight to the point but he knew the officers who would see the memorandum they wrote gobbledygook they expected to read it too active verbs would only scare them they were none too active themselves as soon as he fired the memorandum up the chain of command he stopped worrying about it he judged he probably wouldnt get an answer if the army or the freedom party or somebody was watching out for suspicious characters he wouldnt nobody would bother patting a busybody colonel on the hand and saying there there no need to worry dear a few days later he was writing a note when the telephone on his desk rang his hand jerked a littlejust enough to spoil a word he scratched it out before picking up the handset clarence potter he didnt say he was in intelligence anyone who didnt already know had the wrong number hello potter you are a sneaky son of a bitch arent you hello mr president potter answered cautiously is that a compliment or not in my line of work im supposed to be hell yes its a compliment jake featherston answered its also a judgment on us weve been thinking a lot about what we can do to the damnyankees we aint worried near enough about what them bastards can do to us when his grammar slipped that far he was genuinely irate hed also told potter what the call was about youve read the memorandum then damn right ive read it those two whistleass peckerheads above you kicked it up to me they were going what do you want to do about this here clarence potter had a hard time swallowing a snort featherston might be president of the csa but he still talked like a foulmouthed sergeant especially when he took aim at officers potter asked what do you want to do about it mr president you asked the questions i want somebody to get me some answers i sure as shit dont have enough of em right now how would you like to do it ill make you a brigadier general on the spot only two promotions really mattered the one up from buck private and the one to generals rank all the same potter said sir if i have a choice id rather work on our assets there than their assets here i want to hit those people when the time comes even if it costs you the promotion featherston could only mean how serious are you even if it does potter said firmly i didnt expect to come back into the army anyway i didnt do it for a wreath around my stars i did it for the country and to keep from giving you an excuse for getting rid of me he didnt say that why remind featherston all right then youve got itand the promotion the president said thats your baby now general potter it did feel good it felt damn good as a matter of fact and it felt all the better because potter hadnt expected he would ever get it when he said thank you mr president he sounded much more sincere than hed thought he would while talking to jake featherston i reckon youve earned it featherston answered i reckon youll do a good job with it too you wait half an hour and then you go right on into brigadier general mcgillivrays office and get to work from here on out its yours yes sir potter said but he was talking to a dead line he wondered briefly why the president wanted him to wait but only briefly hed known jake featherston more than twentyfive years he could guess what jake would be doing with that half hour and his guess proved good when he walked into his superiorsno his former superiorsoffice brigadier general stanley mcgillivray was white and trembling i gather you are to replace me he choked out when he saw potter i gather i am potter had ripped into a good many incompetent officers in his time but he didnt have the heart to say anything snide to mcgillivray the other intelligence officer was a broken man if ever hed seen one he was so terribly broken in fact that potter for once was moved more to sympathy than to sarcasm i hope the president wasnt too hard on you that colonel potterexcuse me general potteris what they call a forlorn hope mcgillivray answered bitterly i think you will find everything in order here i think you will find it in better condition than i have been given credit for good day good luck by the way he stumbled out of the office he might almost have been a blind man poor bastard potter muttered anyone who ran into the cutting torch of jake featherstons fury was going to get charred hed seen that for himself more often than he cared to remember and then he put stanley mcgillivray out of his mind he was familiar with only about a third of the work that this desk did he had to learn the rest of it and he had the strong feeling he had to learn it in a tearing hurry featherston sure as hell wouldnt wait for him featherston had never been in the habit of waiting for anybody potter went through the manila folders on the desk one by one some of them held things hed expected to find a few held surprises hed hoped they would if hed been able to figure out everything mcgillivray was doing wouldnt the damnyankees have done the same thing some of the surprises were surprises indeed the confederates had been running people in philadelphia since before the great war theyd recruited young men who needed this or thatand some who needed to make sure this or that never became public not all those young men had lasted some had died in the war some hadnt had the careers theyd hoped they would and so proved useless as sources but a handful of them by now were in position to know some very interesting things and to pass them on the assets farther west were interesting too most of potters notions of where they were proved right again he got some surprises about who they were that didnt matter so much as long as he could use them he also checked the procedures brigadier general mcgillivray had in place for staying in touch with his people in the usa in case normal communications channels broke downin plain english in case there was a war they werent bad he hoped he could find a way to make them better the real problem he saw was how slow they were he understood why that was so but he didnt like it theres got to be a better way he muttered not sure if he was right late that afternoon the telephone in the new office rang when he picked it up anne colleton was on the other end of the line congratulations general potter she purred in his ear jesus christ potter sat bolt upright in his new swivel chair it was a different make from the one hed used before he wasnt used to it yet its squeak sounded funny too how did you know that i had to talk with the president about something she answered he told me hed promoted you oh potters alarm evaporated if shed heard it from jake featherston it was hardly a security breach all right he told me some of why he promoted you too anne said do you really think the damnyankees are going to raise hell here if we go to war well i cant know not for sure but i would if i were in their shoes i do know they gave our niggers guns during the last war if theres another one theyd be fools not to do it again theyre bastards they arent fools we thought they were in weve been paying for it ever since can we track down the people theyve got here anne asked of course we can potter answered thinking no way in hell more truthfully he went on the harder we go after them the more careful theyll have to be too uhhuh anne said in thoughtful tones she was dammit plenty smart enough to see the contradictions between the two things hed said he changed the subject what were you talking about with the president the timing of a propaganda campaign here in south carolina she said potter wondered just what that meant he didnt want to go into details with her god only knew how secure this line was but the likeliest explanation he could come up with on his own was we were talking about when the war will start abner dowling raised field glasses to his eyes and looked across the ohio river into kentucky the mere act of observing kentucky from afar made him so angry he wanted to swell up like a bullfrog as far as he was concerned he shouldnt have been looking into a foreign country when he eyed kentucky he should have been in the state getting ready to defend it against the confederates if they wanted to take it away from him they would have been welcome to try he could have promised them a warm reception now now he had to figure out how to defend ohio instead the general staff had generously sent him some plans prepared before the great war they would have been just what he needed except that they ignored airplanes and barrels and barely acknowledged the existence of trucks things had changed since dowling knew that he hoped to god the general staff did too some of what the old plans suggested was still sound all the bridges across the ohio had demolition charges in place artillery covered the bridges and other possible crossing points antiaircraft guns poked their noses up among the camouflaged cannons if the confederates were going to try to bomb his guns to silence they wouldnt have an easy time of it he kept his main force farther back in ohio than the old plans recommended again the airplane was the main reason why he also wanted to get some notion of what the confederates were doing before he committed his men custer would have charged right at them wherever they first showed themselves he thought the way he rolled his eyes showed his opinion of that custer would have charged sure as the devil maybe he would have smashed everything in his way maybe he would have blundered straight into an ambush but he could no more keep from charging than a bull could when a matador waved his cape sword what sword custer would have thought bullishly for better or worsefor better and worsedowling was more cautious if the confederate army crossed into the usa he wanted to slow it down the way he looked at things if the confederates didnt win quick victories theyd be in trouble in a long drawnout grapple the usa had the edge dowling didnt think that had changed since the great war he raised the field glasses again kentucky seemed to leap toward him jake featherston had lied about keeping soldiers out of the state hed lied about not asking for more land how was anybody in the united states supposed to trust him now you couldnt it was as simple as that even al smith had seen the light the president of the usa had said he would fight back if the csa tried to take land by force dowling was all for that but so much more could have been done it could have but it hadnt everybodyd known the confederates were rearming if the usa had been serious about showing featherston who was boss the country could have done it quickly and easily in nothing would be quick or easy now and the united states werent so ready as they should have been dowling thought about all the time wasted in the s the confederates had been on the ropes then either on the ropes or smiling and saying how friendly they were why build better barrels when youd never have to use them as happened too often in politics never turned out not to be so very long after all sir said an aide at dowlings elbow sir dowling had been lost in his own gloom he wondered how long the younger man had been trying to draw his notice however long it was hed finally succeeded yes major chandler what is it sir captain litvinoff from the special weapons section in philadelphia has come down from columbus to confer with you chandler answered has he dowling was damned if he wanted to confer with anybody from what was euphemistically called the special weapons section regardless of what he wanted he had little choice all right lets get it over with he might have been talking about a trip to the dentist max litvinoff sir the captain said saluting dowling returned the salute pleased to meet you he lied litvinoff looked even more like a brain than hed expected the captain with the cobalt blue and golden yellow armofservice piping on his collar couldnt have been more than thirty he was about five feet four skinny and homely with thick steelrimmed glasses and a thin dark mustache that looked as if hed drawn it on with a burnt match for an amateur theatrical however he looked he was all business this will be good terrain for the application of our special agents he said briskly he might have been talking about spies he might have been but he wasnt dowling knew too well what he was talking about dowling also had a pretty good idea why litvinoff didnt come right out and say what he meant people who ended up in the special weapons section often didnt it was magic of a sort if they didnt say the real name they didnt have to think about what they were doing youre talking about poison gas dowling had no such inhibitions max litvinoff coughed his sallow cheeks turned red well yes sir he mumbled he was only a captain he couldnt reprove a man with a star on each shoulder every line of his body though shouted out that he wanted to too bad dowling thought hed been up at the front with general custer the first time the usa turned chlorine loose on the confederates in gas is a filthy business he said and captain litvinoffs cheeks got redder yet we use it the confederates use it some soldiers on both sides end up dead and nobodys much better off whats the point the point sir is very simple litvinoff answered stiffly if the enemy uses the special agenthe still wouldnt say gasand we dont then our men end up dead and his dont therefore what dowling wanted to do was yell fuck you and kick the captain in the ass unfortunately he couldnt litvinoff was right handing the csa an edge like that would be stupid maybe suicidal go on dowling growled yes sir you will be familiar with the agents utilized in the last war captain litvinoff sounded as if he didnt believe it when dowling nodded litvinoff shrugged he went on you may perhaps be less familiar with those developed at the close of hostilities and subsequently so i am dowling thought and thank god for small favors but he couldnt say that to litvinoff he was heaven help him going to have to work with the man what he did say was im all ears good captain litvinoff looked pleased he liked talking about his toys showing them off explainingin bloodlessseeming termswhat they could do if that wasnt a measure of his damnation dowling couldnt imagine what would be litvinoff continued first theres nitrogen mustard we did use some of this in its a vesicant a what dowling asked the special weapons section man might have his vocabulary of euphemisms but that didnt even sound like a proper english word reluctantly litvinoff translated a blistering agent mucus membranes and skin it does not have to be inhaled to be effective thought it will produce more and more severe casualties if the lungs are involved and it is a persistent agent in the absence of strong direct sunlight or rain it can remain in place and active for months an excellent way to deny access to an area to the enemy and to us dowling said captain litvinoff looked wounded by no means sir troops with proper protective gear and an awareness the agent is in the area can function quite well all right dowling said though it was anything but what other little toys have you got walk with me sir if youd be so kind litvinoff said and led him away from the officers and men in his entourage when the young captain was sure they were out of earshot he went on we also have what we are terming nerve agents they are a step up in lethality from other agents we have been utilizing dowling needed a second or two to figure out what lethality meant when he did he wished he hadnt nerve agents he echoed queasily thats right litvinoff nodded again these are effective both by inhalation and through cutaneous contact they prevent nerve impulses from initiating muscular activity that didnt sound like anything much but his next sentence told what it meant lethality occurs through cardiopulmonary failure onset is quite rapid and the amount of agent required to induce it is astonishingly small how nice dowling said captain litvinoff beamed dowling muttered i wonder why we bother with bullets any more so do i sir so do i litvinoff was dead seriousunder the circumstances the exact right phrase but then as grudging as a spinster talking about the facts of life he admitted these nerve agents do have an antidote but it must be administered by injection and if it is administered in error it is in itself toxic this is all wonderful news dowling saidanother thumping lie he had been looking forward to lunch he usually did now though his appetite had vanished and a new and important question occurred to him good to know we have these things available but tell me captain what are the confederates likely to throw at us if the war starts max litvinoff blinked behind his spectacles i am more familiar with our own program dammit captain im not just going to shoot these things at the enemy ill be on the receiving end too what am i going to receive what can i do about it respirators are current issue protective clothing is rather less widely available and does tend to restrict mobility in warm humid climates litvinoff said dowling tried to imagine running around in a rubberized suit in ohio or kentucky in july the thought did not bring reassurance with it the special weapons section officer went on the confederate states are likely to be familiar with nitrogen mustard whether they know of nerve agents and of which sorts i am less prepared to state does somebody in the war department have any idea can you tell me who would dowling asked it might be important you know well yes i can see how it might litvinoff said unfortunately however defenses against these agents are not my area of expertise yes i gathered that im trying to find out from you whose area of expertise they are knowing that does not fall within my area of expertise either dowling looked at him captain why the hell did you come out here in the first place why to give you information sir he meant it dowling could see as much seeing as much didnt make him very happyor give him much information either xx flora blackford had been to a lot of remembrance day parades in new york and in philadelphia this years parade in new york city took her back to the days before the great war when the holiday had truly been a day of national mourning people had commemorated the loss of the war of secession and of the second mexican war and had pledged not to fail again flags had flown upside down on remembrance day symbolizing the countrys distress since the great war remembrance day had faded some in the nations consciousness people had a triumph to remember now not just a pair of scalding defeats the custom of flying flags upside down had fallen into disuse teddy roosevelt had been the first to abandon it in the philadelphia parade in the year after the war ended this year the custom was back anyone who cared to look could see war clouds looming up from the south bigger and blacker with each passing day if that wasnt cause for distress flora didnt know what would be in the limousine just ahead of hers rode hjalmar horace greeley schacht the ambassador from the german empire and his austrohungarian opposite number whose name flora never could recall schacht was a much more memorable character he spoke fluent english as well he might given his two middle names he was a financial wizard even in hard times nobody knew how much money he had or exactly how hed got it in riots had marred the remembrance day parade here even now no one knew if socialists or mormons had started the fighting then flora had been in the crowd lining fifth avenue she remembered the then ambassadors from germany and austriahungary going past shed never imagined that she might be taking part in the parade herself one day socialists wouldnt protest or disrupt the parade this year not with al smith in powel house what heckling there was came from democrats flora heard shouts like we should have cleaned house a long time ago and now you red bastards say youre patriots that infuriated her and stung at the same time for she knew it held a little truth in politics as in life the best slams often held a little truth there might have been more rude shouts than she heard her open car rolled along in front of a marching band that blared out martial music the conductor wasnt john philip sousa whom shed seen in but he thought he was behind the band rolled another limousine this one carried two ancient veterans of the war of secession more limousines carried survivors from the second mexican war a handful of veterans from that war were still spry enough to march down the street on their own too after them came what seemed like an endless stream of great war veterans organized by the year of their conscription class they were the solid middleaged men who shaped opinion and ran the country these days the way they marched said they knew it too more limousines followed them they carried great war veterans who wanted to parade but had been too badly wounded to march her brother rode in one of them david hamburger hadnt asked flora to keep him out of the army hed come out of the war with only one leg hed never asked flora to pull strings for him since till this remembrance day parade shed done it and gladly if he was a stubborn democratso what the democrats turned out to have been closer to right about jake featherston than the socialists had flora didnt admit that in public but she knew it was true few cheers came from the crowds that lined the streets remembrance day wasnt a holiday for cheers but the crowds were thicker than on any remembrance day that flora remembered since the euphoric one after the end of the great war the parade rolled along fifth avenue limousines marching bands veterans clanking military hardware and all more people filled central park where it ended spring made the air taste sweet and green wherever people werent standing robins and starlings hopped on the grass digging up worms strangely the cheery birds made flora sad there are liable to be plenty of fat worms soon she thought because the bodies of our young men will feed them a temporary speakers platform stood in the middle of a meadow now packed with people policemenone tough irish mug after anotherkept a lane clear for the limousines they pulled up behind the platform dignitaries got out and ascended flora took her place with the rest the other women on the platform were there because they were wives flora had her place because of what she did and she was proud of it governor laguardia a peppery little socialist in an outsized fedora called the german ambassador to the microphone hjalmar horace greeley schacht spoke better more elegant english than the governor we have been rivals your country and mine because we are both strong he said the strong notice each other they also draw the jealousy of the weak like you we have neighbors who would like to bite our ankles that patrician scorn drew a laugh schacht went on so long as we stand together though nothing can overcome us both he got another big hand and sat down the austrohungarian envoyhis name was schussnigg governor laguardia saiddelivered a thickly accented speech that sounded ferocious but didnt make much sense when he stepped away from the microphone the applause he got seemed more relieved than anything else laguardia himself made a speech that called down fire and brimstone on the democratic party and the confederate states in equal measure then he introduced the mayor of new york city who was just as italian as he was and who ripped the socialists and the confederate states up one side and down the other the two men glared at each other flora couldnt help laughing more speeches followed some very partisan others less so then governor laguardia said and now the former first lady of the united states new york citys favorite daughter congresswoman flora blackford flora stood up and strode to the microphone a few cries of blackfordburghs floated out of the crowd but only a few she hadnt expected not to hear them if anything she got less heckling than shed looked for i dont want to talk about political parties today she said and enough applause erupted to drown out the jeers i want to talk about whats facing the united states it will be trouble i dont see how it can be anything but trouble the government now ruling the confederate states does not respect the rights of its own people that being so how can we hope it will respect the rights of its neighbors that got a big hand she went on many of you came to the united states or had parents who came to the united states to escape pogroms in europe and now we see pogroms in north america is a man any less a man because he has a dark skin jake featherston thinks so is he right this time the applause was sparser less comfortable again flora had thought it would be shed seen again and again that the plight of negroes in the confederate states did not get people in the united states hot and bothered when people in the usa thought about negroes it was generally with relief that the vast majority of them were the csas worry that wasnt right flora drove the point home a lot of you have ancestors who came here because someone was persecuting them in europe someone is persecuting the negroes in the confederate states right now and we wont let them in we turn them back we shoot them if we have to but we keep them out and dont you see thats wrong now she got almost no applause she would have been more disappointed if she were more surprised a lot of you dont care she said you think theyre only niggers and you go on about your business and do you know what that sound you hear from richmond is jake featherston laughing if you dont care about a wrong to people in his country he thinks you wont care about a wrong to people in your country either is that so no she got the answer she wanted but from perhaps a third of the throats that should have shouted it im going to say one more thing and then im through she told the crowd if you say that oppression of anybody anywhere is all right you say that oppression of everybody everywhere is all right i dont think thats what the united states are all about do you no this time the shout was louder a lot of people clapped and cheered as she went back to her seat governor laguardia introduced another member of congress the man a democrat harangued the crowd about how good they were and how wicked the confederates were he said not a word about the negroes in the confederate states to him the confederates were wicked for no other reason than that they presumed to challenge the people of the united states of america he told the people in central park what they wanted to hear they ate it up the park rang with cheers flora had done her best to tell the people the truth they hadnt liked that nearly so well the dignitary sitting next to her leaned over and said i see why they call you the conscience of the congress thank you she whispered someone at least had understood then he went on but really to get excited about a bunch of niggers those black bastardspardon my french maamarent worth it wed all be better off if they were back in africa swinging through the trees he was she remembered with something approaching horror a judge what do you do if one of them comes into your court she asked oh i try to be fair he answered you have to but theyre usually guilty thats just how things go he didnt see anything wrong with what he said the only way flora could have let sense into his head would have been to bash it open with a rock she knew that shed met the type before if she did it here at a remembrance day rally people would talk even telling him off was useless hed just get offended she could talk till doomsday without persuading him sitting there quietly felt as much like a compromise with evil to her as letting the confederates do what they wanted to the negroes in their country she made herself remember there were degrees of wickedness as there were with anything else if you couldnt tell the difference between one and another how were you supposed to make choices you couldnt she knew that however distasteful she found it the confederates were worse than the judge that still doesnt mean hes good she thought defiantly at the microphone the democratic congressman kept on laying into the csa the crowd ate up every word when jake featherston told the people who protected him that he was going to make a speech in louisville they started having conniptions they screamed about black men with guns they screamed about white men with guns who didnt want to live in the csa they screamed about damnyankees with mortars on the other side of the ohio river for the usa to try to bump him off would be an act of war but it wouldnt be a war he got to run if they went ahead and did it that last comment worried him because he didnt think anyone else in the confederacy had the driving will and energy to do what needed doing when the war started but he stuck out his chin and told the freedom party guards im going goddammit you keep the people in louisville from shooting me thats your job ill worry about the rest thats mine even ferdinand koenig flabbled about the trip youre the one man we cant replace jake he said these days he was almost the one man who could call jake by his christian name featherston looked across his desk at the attorney general its worth the risk he said the party guardsll keep me safe from niggers and niggerloving bastards who wish they were yankees and al smith is too nice a fellow to turn his artillery loose while were at peace al smith was a damned fool as far as jake was concerned had the usa had a dangerous leadersay another teddy rooseveltjake would have done everything he could to get rid of the man people like that were worth an army corps of soldiers likely more but ferd koenig had another worry quietly he asked and whos going to keep you safe from the guards featherston glared at him hed already lived through two assassination triesthree if you counted clarence potter who hadnt come to richmond to play checkers the stalwarts whod backed willy knight against him still shook him to the core but he said if i cant trust the party guards i cant trust anybody and i might as well cash in my chips and if i cant trust them they can try and do me in right here in richmond as easy as they can in louisville by the look on koenigs heavyfeatured jowly face he might have just bitten down on a lemon youre bound and determined to do this arent you you bet i am jake answered you take over a place you need to let the people there get a look at you hed been reading the prince he couldnt pronounce machiavellis name to save his life and if he wrote it down he wouldnt have spelled it the same way twice running all the same he knew good sense when he ran into it and that was one hell of a sly dago he went to louisville hed decided he would and his deciding was what made things so and when he went he went in style he didnt just fly in make a speech and fly out again he took a train up from nashville and at every whistle stop all the way north across kentucky he stood on a platform at the back of his pullman and made a speech the pullman had armor plating and bulletproof glass nothing short of a direct hit by an artillery shell would make it say uncle the lectern on the platform was armored too but from the chest up and from the sides he was vulnerable the freedom party guards told him so over and over he went right on ignoring them nobody shot him nobody shot at him people swarmed to the train stations to hear him they waved confederate and freedom party flags they shouted freedom and featherstonsometimes both at once women screamed men held up little boys so theyd see him and remember for the rest of their lives the party had organized some of the crowds but a lot of the response was genuine and unplanned that made it all the more gratifying he didnt see any black faces in the crowds he would have been surprised and alarmed if he had if he never saw any black faces anywhere in the csa that wouldnt have broken his heart you folks helped us take back whats ours he told the crowds at the whistle stops we got part of the job done but the damnyankees wont make the rest of it right theyre nothing but a pack of thieves and how are you supposed to live with a thief next door people cheered people howled people shook their fists toward the north as if al smith could see them theyd been back in the confederate states not even a handful of months but they were ready to fight for them jake tasted their jubilation it was different from the cold lust for revenge he felt in the rest of the csa people here had spent a generation under yankee rule theyd had their men conscripted into the us army they knew what theyd abandoned and they were glad to be back where they belonged or most of them were enough to have voted kentucky back into the csa even with negroes given the franchise to try to queer the deal but there were white menwhite menwho looked north with longing not with hate if they knew what was good for them theyd be lying low right now if they didnt know what was good for them confederate officials and party stalwarts would give them lessons on the subject he got into louisville a little before six in the evening people waving flags lined the route from the train station to the galt house the hotel where he would spend the night he didnt stop there for long nowjust enough time to grab a bite to eat and run a comb through his hair then it was on to the memorial auditorium a few blocks away for his speech the auditorium was a postwar building of reinforced concrete that could have gone into a fortress most of louisville was new the city had been destroyed twice in the past sixty years the usa had tried to take it in the second mexican wartried and got a bloody nose in the great war general pershings second army had driven the confederates out but not till the defenders fighting from house to house made the yankees wreck the city to be rid of them before the second mexican war and to a degree after it louisville had been an unconfederate sort of place because it did so much business with the united states it had looked north as well as south but once it got taken into the usa it wasnt a booming border town any more even before the collapse of business was slow here that made people all the more glad to return to the confederacy a rhythmic cry of featherston featherston featherston greeted jake as he strode up to the lectern the bright lights glaring into his face kept him from getting a good look at the blocks of stalwarts who kept the chant strong but he knew they were there they werent the only ones shouting though far from it when he held up his hands for quiet they fell silent at once the rest of the crowd less disciplined took longer when he had enough quiet to suit him he said i am jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth that brought him a fresh eruption of cheers they knew his catch phrase and had known it for years wireless stations from northern tennessee had beamed his speeches up into kentucky long before it returned to the confederate states he went on heres what the truth is the truth is the yankees dont want peace in north america oh al smith says he does but hes lying through his teeth boos and hisses rose when he named the president of the united states one loudmouthed fellow yelled we didnt vote for him that drew a laugh jake scowled nobody was supposed to get laughs at his speeches but him he said its been almost twentyfive years since the united states stole our land from us they coughed up a couple of pieces and now they think they ought to get a pat on the head and a dish of ice cream on account of it well folks theyre wrong no two ways about it they are wrong and they think that might makes right they arent so wrong about that but they think it gives em the right to hold on to things they may think it does but im here to tell you it isnt so weve got the right to take back whats ours and well do it if we have to i want peace anybody whos seen a war and wants another one has to have a screw loose somewhere jake got a hand when he said that hed known he would which was why he put it in the speech he didnt believe it though hed never felt more alive than when he was blasting yankees to hell and gone in the first richmond howitzers by contrast peacetime was boring he went on but if you back away from a war now a lot of the time that just means youll have to fight it later when it costs you more if the people in the united states reckon were afraid to fight theyd better think twice he got another hand for that a bigger one hed hoped it would it meant people were ready they might not be eager but they were ready and ready was all that really counted shaking his fist toward the country across the ohio he rolled on and if the damnyankees reckon they can get our own niggers to stab us in the back again theyd better think twice about that too a great roar of applause went up then louisville had been in us hands when the negroes in the csa rebelled in but the white folks here were just as leery of blacks as if theyd never left the confederacy negroes had never got the right to vote in kentucky not till the plebiscite earlier this year there wouldnt be a next time for them either jake went on weve got our niggers under control now by god oh theres still some trouble from emi wont try to tell you any differentbut were teaching em whos boss more thunderous applause jake hoped that if he killed enough rebellious blacks the rest of them would learn who held the whip hand as an overseers son he took that literally and if the negroes didnt care to learn from their lessons he shrugged hed go on teaching sooner or later they would get it he knew damn well the united states were helping blacks resist the confederate government his people had already seized more than one arms shipment right here in kentucky his mouth opened in a predatory grin two could play at that game heres the last thing ive got to say to you folks he cried kentucky is confederate again as god is my witness kentucky will always be confederate from here on out and i promise you i wont take off this uniform till weve got everything back that belongs to us we dont retreat we go forward he slammed his fist down on the podium the memorial auditorium went wild he couldnt make out individual cheers amid the din he might have been in the middle of artillery barrages louder than this but he wasnt sure after a while it all got to be more than the ears could handle he looked north toward the united states again he was ready were they he didnt think so theyd started rearming a lot more slowly than he had theyre soft theyre rotten theyre just waiting for somebody to kick the door in featherston featherston featherston little by little the chant emerged from chaos jake waved to the crowd the cheers redoubled the yanks are waiting for somebody to kick the door in and im the man to do it anne colleton muttered a mild obscenity when someone knocked on the door to her st matthews apartment she hadnt been home for long and shed head out on the road again soon she wanted to enjoy what time she had here and her idea of enjoyment didnt include gabbing with the neighbors she took a pistol to the door as she usually did when someone unexpected knocked the congaree socialist republic was dead but negro unrest in these parts had never quite subsided if a black man wanted to try to do her in she aimed to shoot first but it wasnt a homicidal red it was a middleaged white man in a lieutenantcolonels uniform two stars on each collar tab that was all she saw at first then she did a double take tom she exclaimed hello sis her younger brother said i came to say goodbye ive been called up and im on my way out to report to my unit my god anne said but youre married youve got a family what will bertha do with the kids the best she can tom colleton answered which didnt leave much room for argument youre righti didnt have to go but i couldnt have looked at myself in a mirror if i hadnt the yankees have got more men than we do if we dont use everybody we can get our hands on were in a hell of a lot of trouble she knew perfectly well that he was right the usa had always outweighed the csa two to one if the united states could bring their full strength to bear the confederate states would face the same squeeze as they had a generation earlier the usa hadnt managed that in the war of secession and had failed spectacularly in the second mexican war in the great war theyd succeeded and theyd won keeping them from succeeding again would be essential if the confederacy was to have a chance all of which passed through annes mind in a space of a second and a half and then blew away for gods sake come in and have a drink she said youve got time for that dont you the day i dont have time for a drink is the day they bury me tom colleton answered with a trace of the boyish good nature hed largely submerged over the past few years anne was all for revenge she was all for teaching the united states a lesson when it came to putting her only living brothers life on the line she was much less enthusiastic she poured him an enormous whiskey and one just as potent for herself heres to you she said half of hers sizzled down her throat tom drank too he stared at the glass or maybe at the butternut cuff of his sleeve christ i did a lot of drinking in this uniform he said he might have been talking about somebody else in a way he was hed been in his early twenties not fifty hed been sure the bullet that could hurt him hadnt been made men were at that age which went a long way toward making war possible by the time you reached middle ageif you didyou knew better ask not for whom the bell tolls hows bertha doing anne asked shed always thought her brother had married below his station but she couldnt deny that he and his wife loved each other he shook his head now shes not very happy i dont reckon i can blame her for that but i have to go he finished the whiskey and held out the glass pour me another one then ive got to head for the station and catch the northbound train all right anne poured herself another drink too even though the first one was already making her head swim it loosened her tongue too without it she never would have asked what do you think our chances are tom only shrugged damned if i can tell you last time i went off to war i was sure wed lick the yankees in six weeks and be home in time for the cotton harvest one whole hell of a lot i knew about that wasnt it this time ive got no idea well find out maybe there wont be a war anne knew she was trying to talk herself into believing what she suddenly wanted with all her heart to believe but she went on maybe the damnyankees will back down and give us what were asking for not a chance tom said i thought they were a pack of cowards last time i know better now theyre as tough as we are and even if they did how much difference would it make what do you mean you know what i mean if the damnyankees back down tomorrow whatll jake featherston do the day after ask em for something else thats what and hell keep right on doing it till they say no and have to fight because whether you want a war or i want a war featherston damn well does and hes got the only vote that counts you going to tell me im wrong part of annemost of annewanted to but she knew she couldnt she shook her head no youre not wrong but the time is ripe too and you know it things are going to blow up in europe any day the old kaiser cant possibly last much longer and his sons going to spit in frances eye whatll happen then boom tom said solemnly im surprised the french have waited as long as they have but action franзaise doesnt seem to have one clear voice at the top the way the freedom party does no they dont anne agreed but if they and the british and the russians can put germany in her place and give us even a little help against the usa well do all right if you dont think so why are you wearing the uniform again its not for the freedom party you can tell that to jake featherstons face next time you see him i dont care tom said its for the country id fight for my country no matter who was in charge anne had no intention of telling the president any such thing regardless of what tom said it wouldnt do her brother any good and might do him a lot of harm tom didnt seem to understand how thoroughly politics had twined themselves around everything else in the csa these days if you said uncomplimentary things about the freedom party youd probably be thought disloyal to the confederate states too anne wondered if she ought to warn him the only thing that held her back was the near certainty he wouldnt listen to her maybe hed learn better when he got back on active duty or maybe he wouldnt and hed run his mouth once too often and get cashiered and sent home he was her kid brother having him safe back here in south carolina wouldnt break her heart oh no not at all be careful was all she did tell him he nodded you know what they say old soldiers and bold soldiers but no old bold soldiers im going out there to do a job anne im not going out there looking to get shot ive got too much to come home to all right tom was it anne wondered she never liked it when somebody whose life shed run for a long time slipped away from her control shed made more allowances for tom than she did for most because they were flesh and blood and now here he was leaving not only her control but his wifes as well heading off into the brutal masculine world of war clarence potter was going the same way he actively despised the regime he was ready to put his life on the line for it just the same and for the same reason it was in charge of the country and the country mattered to him be careful she said again and reminded herself to say the same thing to clarence as soon as she could you too tom said then me she laughed i wont be up at the front and you probably will that probably was her hope against hope she knew damn well he would she took another sip of whiskey however much she drank though the most she could do was blur that knowledge she couldnt make it leave but her brother was serious even if hed taken on enough in the way of whiskey to speak with owlish intensity how much difference do you think being at the front will make bombers have a long reach these days in this war everybodys going to catch hell not just the poor bastards in uniform that had an unpleasant feel of truth to it anne said bite your tongue he took her literally he stuck it out and clamped his teeth down on it so she could see she laughed shed had enough that things like that were funny but she couldnt help asking you think theyll bomb civilians then look what they did to richmond last time he said and its not like our hands are clean they had more airplanes thats all anne had been in richmond for one of the us air raids she still remembered the helpless terror it had roused in her well wed better have more this time thats all she said let them find out what they did to us i hope so tom said i expect so as a matter of fact but god help us if it turns out they give us another dose he got to his feet anne stood up too they hugged you be careful she said for a third time i promise he answered she didnt believe him for a minute he would do what he would do the only reason he hadnt got killed in the last war was dumb luck she wished him more of that it might serve where promises didnt tom went out the door and off to the train station anne watched him from the window he wobbled as he walked shed poured a lot of whiskey into him that was all right hed sober up before he got to wherever he needed to go she realized he hadnt said where that was military security had fallen between them like a blanket she muttered a curse against military security she muttered another curse against war that second one was halfhearted and she knew it she wanted all the horrors of war to come down on the damnyankees heads she just didnt want anything to happen to tom or to clarence or to the people of the confederate states that wasnt fair of course she couldnt have cared less tom turned a corner and was gone no anne shook her head he wasnt gone she just couldnt see him any more there was a difference of course theres a difference she said aloud as if someone had told her there wasnt another drink didnt seem likely to let her know what the difference was she fixed one for herself anyway shed thought tom would have the sense to stay home with his wife and children shed thought so but shed been wrong she hated being wrong and she even saw how shed been wrong jake featherston had spent years building up the passion for war in the confederate states hed needed to to get the revenge on the united states he wanted anne also wanted that revenge and so shed helped him what could be more natural then than that the passion took someone who otherwise would have stayed home what indeed anne gulped the new drink in a hurry somehow seeing where shed been wrong didnt help a bit even in late spring the north atlantic pitched and tossed the uss remembrance was a big ship but the waves flung her about even so sam carsten thanked heaven for his strong stomach and for the cloudy skies that kept his fair fair skin from burning other than that he had little for which to be thankful to put it mildly things did not look good the remembrance and the cruisers and destroyers surrounding her were on full war alert everyone seemed sure it was coming the only questions left were about when and where and how maybe the clouds in the sky didnt matter so much sam spent almost all of his time belowdecks either at his battle station in damage control or in the officers mess or sacked out in his tiny cabin on his schedule a vampire would have had trouble getting a sunburn he might as well have been married to lieutenant commander hiram pottinger he saw his superior nearly every waking moment the two of them prowled through the bowels of the ship looking for trouble they could eliminate before it got the chance to eliminate them every once in a while they would find something and turn their sailors loose on it then they would pause and nod and sometimes shake hands that was what they were supposed to do and by now they were both damn good at the job sam still remembered that he wanted to get in on the aviation side of things he remembered but nostalgically as if thinking of a longlost love years of doing the duty he was in had shaped him and scraped him till he wasnt a square peg in a round hole any more by now he fit the slot in which the navy had put him that was how things worked he kept right on going up to the wireless shack whenever he found the chance maybe that proved he was a mustang he still had a ratings insatiable appetite for scuttlebutt the yeomen who kept the remembrance in touch with the wider world grinned whenever he poked his head in they teased him about it as much as they could tease a superior officer going to tell the limeys everything you know sir one of them asked hell no sam shook his head im going to save it till we get over to the pacific then ill tell it to the japs they all laughed the only thing sam wanted to tell the japanese was where to head in he would gladly have helped guide them on the way too theyd shelled a ship he was on once and torpedoed him twice if they hadnt sunk him it sure as hell wasnt for lack of effort before any of the yeomen could say something else slyly rude loud mournful music started coming out of the wireless set somethings up sam said what station is that german imperial wireless sir answered the man whod been teasing him the yeomen and carsten looked at one another wilhelm ii had been failing for a long time now if hed finally gone and failed a torrent of german poured from the speaker you picking that up gunther another yeoman asked i will if you dont jog my elbow gunther answered he was a big blond kid not so fair as sam but fair enough another midwestern farm boy whod decided to go to sea instead of spending the rest of his life walking behind a couple of horses asses these days hed probably ride a tractor that still wasnt sams idea of fun is it the kaiser sam asked yeah uh yes sir gunther corrected himself its him all right blood clot on the lung the wireless says went into a coma last night died this morning more music replaced the announcers voice this time sam recognized the tune deutschland ьber alles when the german anthem ended the announcer came back on the air hes hailing the accession of friedrich wilhelmking friedrich wilhelm v of prussia and kaiser friedrich i of germany gunther reported kaiser bill had a hell of a run better than fifty years sam said his son and heir wouldnt match that friedrich wilhelm whod lived so long in his fathers shadow was already close to sixty more german came out of the wireless this was a different voice gunther said uhoh this is the new kaisers mouthpiece he says friedrich wilhelms first act is to declare that he cant possibly give up anything his father won uhoh is right sam said that means trouble with france and england and probably russia too he whistled softly big trouble i think i wonder what the hell we do now well sir were already on battle alert gunther said practically yeah sam said not the ideal reply perhaps for an officer and a gentleman but one both accurate and concise gunther got on the telephone to the bridge sam ambled out of the wireless shack whistling tunelessly to himself for the next little while he would know something the skipper didnt of course knowing did him no good he couldnt bring the remembrance or even the damagecontrol parties to a higher state of alert than they were already in british airplane carriers he thought unhappily british battleships if they can get in close enough british and french submersibles french destroyers too i suppose what a joy would britain and france declare war on the usa too once they went to war with germany which they sure looked as if theyd do the frogs might not they were taking dead aim at their nextdoor neighbors the limeys carsten worried more about them they owed the usa a kick in the teeth the united states had booted them out of canada newfoundland bermuda and the bahamas sam couldnt see them mounting an invasion to take back toronto the islands out in the atlantic they were a different story and to get to the islands the british would have to get past the us navy with a spatter of static the remembrances intercom came to life sam blinked the squawkboxes didnt get used very often this is the captain speaking sam blinked again when the intercom did come on captain stein hardly ever spoke himself that was usually the execs job but the skipper continued men you need to know that the german empire has just announced that kaiser wilhelm ii has passed away his son crown prince friedrich wilhelm has just become the new german kaiser friedrich wilhelm has formally rejected the demands france has made for the return of territory lost in the great war the international situation will grow more dangerous as a result of this for the moment we are not at war with france or britain or anyone else that could only mean the csa sam shook his head no it could mean japan and even russia too captain stein went on however we must not let ourselves be caught off guard by a sneak attack be more alert than ever if in doubt about anything let a superior know you may save your ship that is all with another spatter of static the intercom went dead later after sam had gone back on duty lieutenant commander pottinger said the french and the english wont declare war on us will they carsten damned if i know sir sam answered he wondered why the devil pottinger was asking him the other officer had two grades on him and wore an annapolis ring to boot if anybody knew the answers pottinger should have been the man on the other hand though sam had twenty years on his superior officer maybe pottinger thought that counted for something well just have to lick em if they do pottinger said he hadnt been old enough to see action in the great war but hed seen his share in the pacific war against the japanese hed be all right even though the atlantic was rough airplanes roared off the remembrances flight deck having a combat air patrol up could save the ship if the british or french or confederates decided to declare war by attacking the way the japs had no doubt the cruisers in the squadron were launching their seaplanes too those would range farther afield with luck they would spot the enemy before he got close enough to launch an airborne strike force unlike pottinger carsten wasnt usually the sort who borrowed trouble even so he wished he hadnt decided to contemplate the meaning of the phrase with luck it reminded him too vividly of what could happen without luck day followed day an oiler came alongside to refuel the remembrance sam remembered an oiler refueling the uss dakota just before the usa attacked pearl harbor and took the sandwich islands away from britain back then most ships had been coalfired even the dakota had burned both oil and coal things had changed since he didnt think any frontline ships burned coal any more he was in the officers wardroom fueling up himselfon coffeewhen commander cressy came in looking thoroughly grim oh boy said one of the other officers in there oh boy is about the size of it the exec agreed france has declared war on germany and sent soldiers and barrels into alsace and lorraine britain has joined in the declaration her airplanes are bombing several cities in northern germany the tsar has recalled his ambassadors from berlin and vienna and constantinople it cant be more than a matter of days before russia joins in here we go again somebody said which summed up exactly what sam was thinking that wasnt all cressy said latest word is that jake featherstons declared war on germany several sharp exclamations rang out on germany sam said not on us not yet anyhow commander cressy replied declaring war on germany sounds good and doesnt cost him anything its almost like the ottoman empire declaring war on the csa even if they do it so what they cant reach each other were still formally allied to germany and weve got a bunch of the same enemies sam said if the confederates declared war on the kaiser does that mean we have to declare war on them you do ask interesting questions carsten the exec said i dont think we have to do anything there was that stretch in the twenties when it looked like we might square off against kaiser bill and the alliance pretty much lapsed but then the old snakes stuck their heads up again so we never duked it out with germany anyway though my guess is that al smith will sprout wings and fly before he goes and declares war on his own hook a lot of men with stripes on their sleeves nodded at that most officers were democrats that made sense they defended the status quo which was what the democratic party stood for sam supposed he was a democrat himself but whether he defended the status quo or not he feared it was going to get a hell of a kicking around colonel irving morrell saluted reporting as ordered sir he said and then smiling good to see you again sir too its been too long it has hasnt it brigadier general abner dowling replied the last time theyd been together morrell had outranked dowling he tried not to resent the fat officers promotions they werent dowlings fault how could anybody blame him for grabbing with both hands instead they and morrells own long long freeze in rankspoke volumes about the war departments peacetime opinion of barrels were going to be doing something different here dowling remarked the other sides got the ball and theyll try to run with it and we have to tackle them morrell said thats about the size of it dowling agreed morrell whistled tunelessly between his teeth were not going to be able to keep them from crossing the river he said oh good the fat brigadier general said morrell looked at him in some surprise dowling went on im glad somebody besides me can see that officially my orders are to throw them back into kentucky right away sir youd bust me down to second lieutenant if i told you what i thought of the war department morrell said abner dowling surprised him again this time by laughing till his jowls quivered like the gelatin on a cold ham colonel i spent more than ten years of my life listening to general george armstrong custer if you think you can shock me go ahead take your best shot and good luck that made morrell laugh too but not for long if we were fighting the confederate army of wed kick the crap out of it he said thats a lot of what the big brains in philadelphia have us ready to do the laughter drained out of dowlings face too custer would have been louder about it but i dont know if he could have been much ruder weve got plenty of men weve got plenty of artillery our air forces are about even i think our special weaponsgas i should say call a spade a spadewill match theirs atrocity for atrocity have you met captain litvinoff yes sir when morrell thought about captain litvinoff he didnt feel like laughing at all any more i get the feeling hes very good at what he does he could say that and mean it it was as much praise as he could give the skinny little officer with the hairline mustache it was june it was already warm and muggy it would only get worse he didnt like to think about being buttoned up in a barrel he especially didnt like to think about being buttoned up in a barrel while wearing a gas mask when he thought about litvinoff he couldnt help it thinking about being buttoned up in a barrel made him think about barrels in general something else he wasnt eager to do sir if we are going to play defense we dont just need gas we need more barrels than weve got i am aware of that thank you dowling replied philadelphia may be in the process of becoming aware of it on the other hand philadelphia may not too you never can tell with philadelphia but if were going to stop them morrell began his superior held up a hand if were going to stop them weve got to have some notion of what theyll try wed better anyhow whats your best estimate of that colonel have you got a map sir morrell asked always easier to talk with a map right here dowling took one from his breast pocket and unfolded it it was printed on silk which could be folded or crumpled any number of times without coming to pieces and which didnt turn to mush if it got wet morrell drew a line with his fingers dowlings eyebrows leaped you think theyll do that its what id do if i were jake featherston morrell answered can you think of a better way to cripple us the war department thinks theyll strike in the east the same as they did in the last war dowling said morrell said nothing dowling studied the line he had drawn that could be unpleasant yes sir morrell said i dont know that they have the men and the machines to bring it off but i dont know that they dont either dowling traced the same path with his finger it seemed to exert a horrid fascination that could be very unpleasant im going to get on the telephone to the war department about it if youre right they wont take you seriously morrell predicted theyll say all the way out there dont be silly he tried to sound like an effete almost effeminate general staff officer i have to make the effort dowling said otherwise its my fault not theirs morrell could see the logic in that he changed the subject asking have we got sabotage under control i hope so dowling said which wasnt what he wanted to hear the general went on sabotage and espionage are a nightmare anyway we arent like germans and russians we all speak the same language and downstate ohio and indiana were settled by people whose ancestors came up from what are the confederate states now most of emalmost all in factare loyal but they still have some of the accent that makes spies even harder to spot my one consolation is the confederates have the same worry happy day morrell said his superior laughed so did he not that it was really funny not being sure who was on your side made any war more difficult neither the csa nor the usa had done all they could with that truth in the great war morrell had the feeling both would make up for it if and when they met again abner dowling asked seemingly out of the blue did you ever serve in utah colonel no sir morrell answered cant say i ever had that pleasure i helped draw up the plan that involved outflanking the rebels there but i was never stationed there myself you know we still have colored friends down south of whats the border now dowling saidhe seemed to be all over the conversational map i dont know that for a fact or i didnt till now but it doesnt surprise me morrell said wed be damned fools if we didnt hasnt stopped us before dowling observed morrell blinked he hadnt thought the older man had that kind of cynicism in him of course hed known dowling when the latter served under cluster whose own personality tended to overwhelm those of the people around him custer had even managed to keep daniel macarthur in check which couldnt possibly have been easy while morrell contemplated the rampant ego of his recent co dowling went on i dont think the confederates are damned fools either i wish they were it would make our lives easier they were sniffing around in salt lake city when i commanded there the same way we are with niggers in the csa only edge weve got is that there are more niggers in the confederate states than mormons here thank god ah morrell nodded brigadier general dowling hadnt been talking at random then hed actually been going somewhere and now morrell could see where so you think the mormons are going to try and stick a knife in our backs colonel they hate our guts dowling said theyve hated our guts for sixty years now i wont deny weve given them some reason to hate us not like they havent given us reason to sit on them morrell said oh theres plenty of injustice to go around dowling agreed and if another war starts therell be more but i wish to high heaven president smith hadnt lifted military occupation dont you think hes got people watching the mormons morrell asked oh im sure he does dowling replied but its not the same if we see the mormons gathering arms say its not so easy to send troops back into utah to take away the rifles or whatever theyve got that might touch off the explosion were trying to stop the police morrell began dowlings laugh might have burst from the throat of the proverbial jolly fat manexcept he didnt look jolly the police are mormons too or most of them are theyll look the other way either that or theyll be the ones with the weapons in the first place quis custodiet ipsos custodes you are cheerful today sir morrell said who will watch the watchmen i suppose al smith will or his people he means well ive never said he doesnt hes doing the best he can i only wish he werent quite so trusting he kept us out of wartill after the election me id sooner have trusted a rattlesnake than jake featherston you mean theres a difference morrell asked dowling shook his head his chins danced but there was a difference and morrell knew it featherston was likely to prove more deadly than any rattler ever hatched an orderly poked his nose into dowlings office he brightened when he spotted morrell sir im supposed to tell you a new shipment of barrels just came in at the columbus train station morrell bounced to his feet the thigh where hed been wounded in the opening days of the great war twinged it would remind him the rest of his life of what had happened down there in sonora no help for it though so he ignored it the leg still worked what else mattered he saluted brigadier general dowling if youll excuse me sir of course dowling said the sooner the barrels get off their flatcars and into units the better off well be the orderly had a command car it was no different from the one morrell had used on the border between houston and texas he didnt mind sitting behind a machine gun at all if the confederates didnt have saboteurs and assassins in columbus he would have been amazed when he got to the station he discovered how eager the factory in pontiac had been to ship those barrels they were all bright metal they hadnt even been painted he hoped his own men would have the time to slap green and brown paint on them before the shooting started if they did fine if they didnt well if they didnt the barrels were still here and not back at the factory in michigan he would throw them into the fight he would lose more of them than if they were harder to see at a distance but they would take out a good many confederate barrels too how many barrels did the confederates have how many could they afford to lose those were both interesting questionsthe most interesting questions in the world for the us officer in charge of armored operations along the central ohio and morrell didnt have good answers the us might have had plenty of saboteurs on the other side of the border spies who could count and report back evidently not morrell looked south ill find out soon i think the us ambassador to the confederate states was a bright young californian named jerry voorhis he was of course a socialist like al smith as far as jake featherston was concerned that made him a custardhead right from the start he didnt look or sound like a custardhead at the moment though no he said he didnt bother sitting down in the presidential office he stood across the desk from featherston looking dapper and cool in a white linen suit despite the stifling blanket of june heat and humidity no what jake rasped no to all your demands voorhis answered president smith has made his position very clear he does not intend to change it the united states will not return any further territory ceded to us by the csa you agreed to abide by plebiscites and to make no more demands you have broken your agreement the president does not consider you trustworthy enough for more negotiations and he will yield no more land that is final oh it is is it jake said yes it is the us ambassador stuck out his chin and gave back a stony glare featherston only shrugged well hell be sorry for that as for you ambassador im going to give you your walking papers as of right now you are what they call persona non grata here you have twentyfour hours to get the hell out of my country or ill throw you out on your ear voorhis started to say something then checked himself after a moments pause for thought he resumed i was going to tell you you couldnt do me a bigger favor than sending me back to the united states but im afraid youre doing no favors to millions of young men in your country and mine who may be shooting at each other very soon thats not my fault jake said in a flat hard voice if president smith was ready to be reasonable about what i want my ass jerry voorhis said which was not the usual diplomatic language maybe he thought the rules changed for expelled ambassadors maybe he was right his bluntness made jake blink and he went on if the president gave you everything you say you want youd just say you wanted something else thats how you are he didnt bother hiding his bitterness and he was right featherston knew it perfectly well knowing it and admitting it were two different beasts he pointed toward the door get out my pleasure as voorhis turned to go he added you can start a war whenever you please if you think you can end one whenever you please youre making a big mistake jake thought about saying something like well see about that he didnt the damnyankee could have the last word here who got the last word once the balloon went upthat would be a different story an hour later the telephone rang in his office featherston he snapped mr president the ambassador to the usa is on the line his secretary said he sounds upset put him through lulu jake could guess what the ambassador was calling about the confederate ambassador to the united states was a georgian named russell jake never remembered his christian name all he remembered was that the man was reasonably smart and a solid freedom party backer when he heard featherstons voice on the line he blurted mr president the damnyankees are throwing me out of the country dont you worry about it jake answered dont you worry about it one little bit on account of i just heaved jerry voorhis out of richmond oh russell sounded relieved at least for one word but then he said holy jesus mr president is there gonna be another war not if we get what we want featherston said get whats ours by rights i ought to say as far as he was concerned there was no difference between the one and the other all right then mr president ill see you back there soon russell said i sure as hell hope everything goes the way you want it to it will jake never had any doubts why should i he thought everythings always gone good up till now it wont change he spent a few more minutes calming the ambassador down then hung up the phone on him no sooner had he done that than lulu poked her head into his office and said general potter is here to see you sir is he jake grinned well send him right on in good morning mr president clarence potter said saluting he carried a manila folder under his left arm tossing it onto featherstons desk he went on here are some of the latest photographs weve got outfuckingstanding jake said which produced an audible sniff from lulu in the outer office these are what i want to see all right if you have to youll walk me through some of them some of the pictures that potter brought him were aerial photos getting reconnaissance airplanes up over the usa wasnt that hard every so often featherston wondered how many flying spies the united states had above his own country too many probably the photographs potter brought him were neatly labeled each one showing exactly where and when it had been taken doesnt look like theres a whole lot of change jake remarked everything still seems out in the open yes sir potter answered something in his tone made jakes head come up he might have been a wolf taking a scent all right he said whats different in the stuff they dont want us to see he almost laughed at the way potter looked at him the intelligence officer didnt want to respect him but couldnt help it yeah sonny boy i run this country for a reason jake thought potter said if youll look at some of these ground shots mr president youll see the yankees are starting to move up into concealed forward positions they should have done it sooner but they are starting how did we get these ground photos back here so fast featherston asked some of em are from yesterday morning sir were still at peace with the usa potter replied if a drummer or a tourist crosses back into kentucky from illinois or indiana or ohio whos to say what kind of prints are on his brownie theyre only just now starting to wake up to the idea that we might really mean this he couldnt resist adding it might have been better if wed left them even more in the dark nobody criticized jake featherston to his face and got away with it listen potter he snapped the damnyankeesll get more surprises from me than a fellow does from his doctor after he lays a fiftycent whore the other man guffawed in surprise jake went on you dont know all my business so dont go making like you do he waited to see if potter would get angry or get sniffy the other man didnt instead he nodded all right that makes sense does anybody know all your secrets besides you i mean hell no jake answered automatically there are things i could brag aboutbut i wont if he hadnt checked himself he might have started boasting about what was going on down in louisiana for instance but the whole point of knowing things other people didnt was to be able to use what you knew against them and to keep them from using what they knew against you clarence potter he saw got that well potter was in intelligence if anybody could see the point of secrets he was the man and he nodded now when i first got to know you you would have run your mouth he said theres more to you than there used to be thats why im here i expect instead of still being a goddamn stubborn whig and wanting to blow my head off you mean featherston asked potter nodded he smiled a crooked smile yeah instead of that the smile got wider now he was waitingwaiting to find out if jake would send him off to a camp for admitting it and jake wanted to but potter damn him had made himself too useful to be jugged like a hare and from now on hed be too busy to worry about blowing the head off of anybody who wasnt wearing a greengray uniform jake jerked a thumb at the door all right get the hell out of here and take all your pictures of naked women with you yes sir chuckling potter scooped up the folder of reconnaissance photos and started out he paused with his hand on the doorknob good luck he said youve done everything you could to get us ready but well still need it ill put in a fresh requisition with the quartermaster corps jake said potter nodded and left jake shook his head in bemusement he might have made stupid jokes like that with ferd koenig and a couple of other oldtime party buddies but not with anybody else so why make them with potter but he didnt need long to find the answer hed known potter longer than hed known koenig or any of the other party men theyd both hung tough when the army of northern virginia was falling to pieces all around them if the president of the greatest country in north americano in the world couldnt joke around with the one man whod known him when he was just a sergeant with whom could he joke nobody nobody at all if the confederate states were going to become the greatest country in the world they had to go through the united states first bastards beat us once when the niggers stabbed us in the back jake thought this time ill sit on the niggers but good right from the start lets see those damnyankee fuckers do it again especially when were readywhen im readyand they arent quite the photos potter had shown him proved that lulu made most of his telephone calls he made this one himself on a special line that didnt pass through her desk it went straight from his office to the war department men checked twice a day to make sure the damnyankees didnt tap it it rang only once before the chief of the general staff picked it up forrest speaking featherston jake said and then blackbeard he hung up there it was done the die was cast whatever was going to happen would happen starting tomorrow morning early tomorrow morning summer had just come in jake worked through the rest of june he ate supper and then went right on working through the night lulu brought him cup after cup of coffee after a while yawning she went home to bed he worked on behind blackout curtains that kept light from leaking out of the gray house and showing where it was from the air june passed into june all that coffee made jakes heart thud and soured his stomach he gulped a bromoseltzer and went on at a quarter past three the drone of airplane engines and the thunder of distant artillerynot distant enough damn those yankee robbersmade him whoop for sheer glee hed waited so long now his day was here
