david morrell the shimmer one the beckoning from fifteen hundred feet off the ground the blue pickup truck looked like a matchbox toy normally it would have blended with traffic but on this clear tuesday afternoon in early june the pilot watched the truck race past other vehicles and veer back and forth between lanes as the driver searched for any open space he could find the aircraft a cessna had high wings and a single propeller its pilot was a fortyyearold police officer named dan page he knew that the driver of the pickup was male because he monitored a police radio through his headphones and was aware that ten minutes earlier the man had shot and killed another man in a feud between drug dealers at fort marcy park a police officer driving by saw the shooting when he sped into the park the assailant fired through the cruisers windshield and killed him park workers who saw the murders all identified the shooter as a thin twentyish anglo with a shaved head and a white tshirt the short sleeves of which revealed a large tattoo on his left arm this was pages day off a private pilot he enjoyed flying his cessna from santa fe s small airport and as he phrased it getting above it all but when his police radio transmitted news of the chase he headed over the fourmilewide city to where the truck had last been seen hoping to spot it among santa fe s low buildings and provide directions to his fellow officers in the pursuing police cars five minutes later he had it in sight the trucks frantic random route would have been difficult to follow on the ground but was obvious from the air hes going east on peralta page said into the microphone on his headset now hes turning right onto guadalupe heading downtown im five blocks in front of him another officers voice answered quickly i can cut him off wait now hes veering onto agua fria page stared down helplessly as an oncoming car swerved out of the trucks way lurched onto a sidewalk and hit an adobe wall earthen bricks cascading onto the hood he imagined the sound of the crash the violence somehow gaining in magnitude because of the distance hes back on saint francis drive page warned if hes headed toward the interstate weve got the ramps blocked an urgent voice replied again the truck abruptly changed direction hes turning right onto cerrillos road page yelled ill intercept him at cordova a different voice blurted peering down toward a crosswalk page noticed pedestrians scurrying to avoid the truck a car was forced off the road too late hes past cordova well set up a roadblock at saint michaels drive better make it rodeo road hes driving so fast you wont have time at saint michaels indeed the speed with which the truck covered distance was astounding the other vehicles on cerrillos road seemed to be standing still my god hes got to be doing over a hundred page thought other drivers must have seen the truck speeding toward them in their rearview mirrors or maybe the fugitive kept blowing his horn for whatever reason traffic veered out of the way weve got the intersection at cerrillos and rodeo road closed a voice shouted immediately the truck swerved onto another side street page finally understood the pattern i think hes got a police radio what he changes directions whenever you tell me youve got a street blocked he must be listening to us now hes turning into the lowes parking lot customers leaving the huge hardware store darted to the side as the truck sped toward the movie theater at the end of the lot it disappeared into a parking garage circling page watched for a man in a white tshirt to leave the garage and try to get away on foot but in june a lot of men wore tshirts and from this altitude it was almost impossible to distinguish colors on clothing moreover the color might be irrelevantthe driver could force someone in the garage to give him a differentcolored shirt so he could walk away without attracting attention page kept circling a car left the garage he watched the tiny figures of pedestrians proceeding toward the theaters entrance he looked for anyone whose pace was hurried an suv left the garage he can change vehicles as easily as he can put on another shirt page realized a sports car left the garage from above page kept track of all three vehicles and described them to the officers on the ground the first one reached a lane that took it to the left toward cerrillos road the suv reached the same lane and turned in the opposite direction toward a side street the sports car headed back toward the parking lot in front of the hardware store three different directions meanwhile the pursuing police cars converged on the area page saw their flashing roof lights and imagined the wail of their sirens no other vehicles came from the garage at the hardware store parking lot a police cruiser stopped the sports car page switched his view toward the first vehicle that had left the garage it was stopped at the entrance to cerrillos road unable to find a break in traffic in contrast the suv faced no obstacles as it drove leisurely in the opposite direction along the lane toward the side street page had a hunch and followed it he descended a hundred feet doing nothing drastic nothing the faa would object to but even so the downward motion made his engine grow louder the suv seemed to drive a little faster he descended another hundred feet making his engine sound even more insistent the suv increased speed hes below me in the suv page yelled into the microphone testing his theory by flying another hundred feet lower and trying to provoke a response he got one the vehicle surged forward and skidded onto the side street hes heading toward airport road the suv swung onto the multilane road and zigzagged through traffic its speed so reckless that cars swerved to get out of the way two of them crashed against each other each time the vehicle abruptly changed lanes it rocked a littlenot as stable as the truck had been page glanced farther along airport road gaping at a gasoline truck that emerged from a service station oh my god when the suv changed lanes again the abrupt motion caused it to lean instead of tipping it managed to jolt back onto all four wheels but as the driver tried to find an open space in another lane he must have yanked the steering wheel the vehicle tilted more severely balanced on two wheels fell all the way over and crashed onto its side throwing up a shower of sparks it slid along the road no the suv hit the tanker tore a gash underneath and burst into flames as the sparks ignited the gasoline cascading from the fuel trucks belly a fireball swelled upward banking from it page felt the shock wave it took several moments before he could make his voice work and radio for an emergency team dark smoke drifted past him the debriefing room consisted of metal chairs arranged in rows before a blackboard overhead fluorescent lights hummed and made everyone look pale as the police chief listened to their reports page glanced through a window and saw several television broadcast trucks in the police stations parking lot okay you told me what you did right now how about what you did wrong the chief demanded that press conference is in fifteen minutes i dont want any surprises we werent chasing him one of the officers angelo insisted we never endangered any civilians all we did was try to get ahead of him and cut him off right another man rafael added even though the bastard shot bobby we didnt overreact he was driving a hundred miles an hour an officer named vera said its a miracle the only other driver he killed was the poor guy behind the wheel of that gasoline tanker the chief looked in pages direction how about you page tried not to imagine the agony of the tankers driver with the state police helicopter in the hangar for maintenance the only aircraft available for police use was mine i warned the air port traffic controller to advise other planes not to fly over the city i stayed above the minimum required altitude no faa regulations were broken nobody was at risk the chief swept his gaze across the group anybody have anything to add any screwup i should know about the group was silent then im ready to talk to the reporters the officers looked relieved page hung back as they all rose and began to leave the room want to join us for a beer angelo asked as soon as i tell my wife im okay page answered he didnt need to ask where theyd meet they always went to the same placea sports bar on carrillos road once he was alone in the debriefing room he used his cell phone to call home it was the fourth time hed done so since landingand the fourth time hed heard his own voice saying please leave a message he tried toris cell phone and for the fourth time it was her voice saying please leave a message yet again he said into the phone hey its me call me when you get this he glanced at his watch the digital display of which showed where is she he wondered turning into the driveway of his singlestory home page pressed the garagedoor opener that was attached to his suvs sun visor as the door swung upward he saw that toris saturn wasnt there he drove in turned off the engine got out of his grand cherokee and closed the garage door entering the shadowy kitchen he noticed how quiet the house felt a note lay on the table gone to see my mother this made page frown because toris mother lived in san antonio texas eight hundred miles away and tori hadnt said a word about wanting to visit her mother what on earth could have caused her to make such a spurofthemoment trip he wondered the only explanation he could think of was some kind of emergency she got a phone call with terrible news from her motherno about her motherso she bought a lastminute plane ticket and hurried down to albuquerque the states only big airport was in albuquerque the drive down from santa fe took an hour and fifteen minutes normally page and tori used his plane when they visited her mother but because hed been flying and couldnt answer his cell phone tori hadnt been able to tell him what had happened sure that makes sense page thought nonetheless he couldnt help rubbing his forehead even if i wasnt able to answer my phone that wouldnt have pre vented her from leaving a message the kitchen phone hung on a wall next to the fridge page went over to it looked at a list taped to the side found the number he wanted and pressed the buttons he expected to get the answering machine but an elderly voice answered hello margaret is that you page didnt talk to toris mother often but she recognized his voice of course its me dan why do you sound so surprised i didnt think youd be answering i just assumed you were sick or something sick what would give you that idea i came home and found a note from tori saying shed gone to visit you its so spurofthemomenti mean when i left this morning she didnt say a word about goingi assumed something serious had happened that youd been in an accident or something like that are you sure youre okay well im tired from working in the garden all afternoon other wise i feel fine when tori called and said she was coming to see me i was as surprised as you page tightened his grip on the phone she called you when this morning around ten as soon as i left to go to the airport he thought tori was a real estate agent she often spent the morning at home writing offers or making phone calls page did some quick calculations there wasnt a direct flight between albuquerque and san antonio tori would have needed to catch a connecting flight in dallas door to door the whole trip usually took about seven hours depending on when her flight left she should be in san antonio by now he thought is she there id like to talk to her no i dont expect her for several more hours the elderly voice replied maybe not until tomorrow tomorrow confusion made pages head start to ache she must be on a really late flight shes not flying that didnt sound right not flying but then how are you telling me shes driving thats what she said it didnt make any sense to me either eight hundred milesbut thats what she told me she wanted to do you really didnt know about this nothing not a damned thing i asked her why she was driving she answered that she wanted to see the countryside and think but she didnt say what was on her mind dan i dont know another way to ask this is everything okay between tori and you his impulse was to blurt absolutely we get along fine things couldnt be better but the words stuck in his throat he forced out a different answer all she needed to do was tell me she wanted to visit you i might even have gone with her she didnt have to keep it a secret if she drives straight through and gets there tonight tell her to call me as soon as she arrives i dont care how late it is count on me ill ask her not just ask her margaret please make sure she does it put the phone in her hand and make sure she calls me after he hung up page studied the kitchen tori had put the breakfast dishes away the kitchen counters were bare and everything was in its place just as if the house were ready for a real estate showing he moved into the living room magazines that had been spread across the coffee table were neatly stacked cushions that had been in disarray from when he and tori had watched television the previous night were back in their proper places he remembered that she hadnt watched tv for long that shed gone to bed early saying she wanted to read he walked down the hallway and peered into toris office her lap top computer was gone apart from a lamp nothing was on her desk he entered their bedroom the bed was made everything perfectly arranged looking in the closet he discovered that two suit cases were missing he studied the empty hangers and concluded that tori had taken most of her casual clothes but none of her business outfits he checked her bureau drawers and discovered that all her socks and underwear were gone he glanced toward her side of the bed a compulsive reader she normally kept a dozen books stacked there all of those were also gone page didnt move for quite a while when he became aware of the gathering darkness outside he went into the living room and sat in shadows waking with a start on wednesday morning page turned toward the terrible emptiness on toris side of the bed he stared at it for several troubled moments then quickly got into some jeans went outside and grabbed the newspaper from the sidewalk hurrying back so he wouldnt fail to hear the telephone but it didnt ring the newspapers headline announced shooting leads to chase and tanker explosion a photograph showed bobby in his uniform another showed the truck driver a third showed the twisted metal of the suv and the gasoline tanker after the intense blaze had fused them together page turned the newspaper over hiding the photographs unable to wait any longer he picked up the phone and pressed numbers margaret its dan she responded without any of the ordinary pleasantries tori isnt here yet pages throat felt terribly dry after swallowing he managed to speak she must have gotten tired and spent the night in a motel even as he said it he didnt believe it then why didnt she call to tell me not to worry which is exactly what im doing the elderly voice quavered what if she had an accident i dont think thats likely or id have heard something page tried to sound convincing but ill see what i can find out three hours later en route to investigate a high school stabbing he received a call from the duty officer at the police station theres no record that tori was in a traffic accident either in new mexico or texas and nothing about her being admitted to any hospital along the route she was driving page breathed out in relief but he knew what the report meant and what he was forced to do nexthe didnt see another option put out a missingperson report early thursday morning the phone rang page set down his coffee cup and grabbed the receiver hello dan page a mans voice asked it had a southern accent and a raspy tone as if it belonged to a smoker speaking page realized how tightly he held the phone this is police chief roger costigan in rostov texas where pages mind swirled he reached for a pen rostov texas were southeast of el paso about fifty miles from the mexican border page felt a knot in his stomach you found my wife victoria page the voice said as if reading from a list caucasian five foot six one hundred and twenty pounds red hair green eyes driving a darkblue saturn outlook the voice gave the license number thats her pages brow felt cold one of my officers spotted her car at the side of a road early this morning he found her nearby page had the sensation of holding his breath is she shes fine you dont need to worry on that score she hasnt been hurt she wasnt in any danger no accident no sir she hasnt been injured thats correct mr page shes just fine thank god page thought but troubling questions immediately flooded through him if she wasnt injured then why was her car at the side of the road thats difficult to explain i dont understand is she there can you put her on the phone no sir she isnt with me then how can i talk to her i guess thats up to her the voice replied we told her youre looking for her but she didnt react youre not making sense is she alone as much as i can tell then what in gods name is she doing in page looked at the note hed made rostov texas its a little complicated youll understand better if i tell you in person the main thing is no laws been broken shes here of her own free will you say its better if you tell me in person maybe show you would be more accurate why are you being so damned cryptic chief im not trying to be believe me this is an unusual situation im afraid i cant explain it over the phone youll just have to see for yourself whatever the hell is going on you can expect to show me this afternoon mr page im afraid youll need a lot longer than that to get here youre in santa fe right thats correct well our nearest major airport is in el paso and were a couple of hundred miles from there theres no way you can get here by this afternoon do you have any airport at all theres a little one that the ranchers use but then ill see you at five oclock page phoned the police station and told the duty officer that he couldnt come to work that day and probably wouldnt be in until monday he packed a suitcase grabbed his flight bag and drove to santa fes small airport after carrying his luggage into a reception area he said hello to a young woman behind a counter she had the newspaper sitting on the counter in front of her but before she could mention the frontpage article he turned left into a computer lounge where he studied reports of the weather in new mexico and texas the forecasts indicated a chance for thunderstorms in a couple of days but no immediate problems the last thing he always did was look for announcements about prohibited areas these warned pilots about airspace they werent al lowed to enter often because of security issues a pilot who trespassed into a forbidden area was liable to find his or her plane flanked by fighter jets giving angry orders to land at the nearest airfield there werent any flight restrictions in new mexico but page was surprised to discover that the rostov area of texas did have one puzzled he clicked a button to get more information and learned that the prohibition involved an array of radio astronomy dishes twenty miles northwest of the town the concern wasnt related to national security rather the observatory was offlimits because planes flying over the dishes were liable to cause electrical interference that blocked at tempts to collect radio signals from astronomical phenomena such as solar flares and spiral galaxies fineill just stay away from it page thought he pulled charts from his flight bag and quickly plotted a course to rostov as chief costigan had told him the town was a couple of hundred miles southeast of el paso nowhere near san antonio his emotions in turmoil page stepped through a door onto the airports tiedown area there in warm sunlight numerous small aircraft were secured to the concrete by ropes attached to their wings and tails one of them was pages cessna feeling the pressure of time he warned himself to slow down as he inspected the planes exterior after each flight he always had the fuel tanks filled now he drained a small amount of fuel into a cup to assure himself that there werent any water bubbles or other contaminants stay focused he told himself after untying the plane he got inside attached his maps and flight plan to a clipboard strapped to his thigh and took a deep breath pay attention he thought no matter how much i want to reach tori what matters now is the plane pay attention to flying the plane he took another deep breath and went through his preflight checklist what in gods name is tori doing in rostov texas he used his radio to ask the ground controller for permission to taxi to the takeoff area five minutes laterless than two hours after hed received the phone call from chief costiganhe was in the air flying to texas the man with the m carbine stood in the shade of the small concreteblock building and savored the last of his cigarette the temperature was a pleasant dry degrees but habits from his two tours of duty in iraq stayed with him and he avoided direct sunlight as much as possible because it was midmorning and the sun was on the opposite side of the tiny building earl halloway wasnt able to enjoy the rugged majesty of the davis mountains to the north instead his view consisted of seemingly endless clumps of sparse brown grass tumbleweeds stuck to a chainlink fence fifty yards from him the fence was twelve feet high and topped by barbed wire signs along it declared scientific research area no admittance to halloways left nine huge radio observatory dishes were pointed in various directions toward the sky and another was tilted so that it pointed horizontally it had a truck next to it along with scaffolding and a small crane as if it were undergoing repairs the dishes could be seen from quite a distance a conspicuous intrusion on the landscape at the road ten miles away a similar warning sign was attached to a locked gate that prevented access to the lane people who stopped their cars to stare toward the faroff dishes usually lingered for only a short time until boredom prompted them to resume their journey the chainlink fence was one of three around the dishes it wasnt electrifiednobody at the installation wanted the nuisance of dealing with ranchers whose cattle happened to wander up to the fence and get barbecued even so there had never been a case of anyone being foolish enough to climb it the second fence was constructed entirely of razor wire and the third fence was electrified its numerous prominent signs warning danger high voltage halloway could have sat in an airconditioned security room and watched monitors that would show any intruders futile attempt to get over the third fence if such a thing ever happened he and the other guards would go out afterward to clean up the mess no smoking was permitted in the sterile facility so his cigarette break was the only reason he ever needed to step outside he justified his addiction by telling himself that cameras and monitors were no substitute for eyeballing the landscape in person to make sure everything was as peaceful as it seemed after all one of his fellow army rangers in iraq had been a sniper who could disguise himself so well that an enemy could walk across a field and not know the sniper was there un less the enemy stepped on him this line of thought made halloway uncomfortable all hed wanted was a peaceful smoke and now hed gotten himself brooding about snipers time to get back inside he decided after taking a final satisfying drag from his cigarette he dropped it to the ground crushed it with his boot and gave the bleak vista a final assessment twenty miles to the southeast was a town called rostov but hed never been to itno one from the facility had ever been there it was strictly offlimits we dont want them thinking about us hed been told emphatically when hed signed on for what was supposed to be easy duty but after three months of being confined here holloway couldnt wait for his replacement to arrivean event that was set to occur in just two weeks sure the food was better than what hed been given in iraq plus the installation had alcohol which he hadnt been able to get in iraq he couldnt complain about the internet downloads of the latest movies some of which werent yet available on dvd but what he really wanted was to get laid thinking again about snipers he tapped the securitycode buttons on a pad next to the entrance when he heard a buzz that indicated the lock had been freed he opened the metal door and stepped in side immediately the observatorys filtered cooled sterile air encircled him he shoved the heavy door back into place making sure the electronic lock engaged then he unlocked a secondary door stepped through secured that one as well and descended metal stairs that ended at a long corridor lit by a row of overhead lights the underground facility was large a subtle vibration filled it when halloway had arrived three months earlier hed thought nothing of the vibration but as the days had accumulated hed be come increasingly sensitive to the faint omnipresent hum that he suspected had something to do with the installations electrical generatoror else with the activity of the huge radio dishes no one else seemed aware of it but for him it had become distracting enough that even though hed taken to wearing earplugs when he went to bed he wasnt able to sleep soundly he passed two doors on the left and turned right into a large room filled with numerous closedcircuit television monitors that showed every approach to the installation the images were in color and displayed excellent definition at night they had a green tint as heat sensors registered the difference between the rapidly cooling grassland and the constant temperature of animals or human beings his counterpart on this shift a man with large strong hands sat in a metal chair and flipped through a sports magazine occasionally glancing at the screens it was poor discipline but after months of in activity halloway understood how hard it was to keep staring at those damned monitors smokings bad for your health the man said without looking up his name was taggard sos getting shot at i figured a bullet was more to worry about than a cigarette this isnt iraq thanks for the geography lesson putting on weight isnt good for you either but that hasnt stopped you from mainlining those candy bars you keep in your desk how many do you eat a day ten fifteen taggard chuckled with so little to do theyd taken to ribbing each other constantly yeah i really ought to be on the stairmaster instead of reading these magazines ill get on that first thing tomorrow im going to take a leak halloway said after that maybe you could sit here a while and let me wander around now it was halloways turn to chuckle he stepped back out into the corridor and went farther along on the left an open door was marked data analysis through the opening he heard static and peered in at a bored bald bespectacled researcher who studied a computer screen all kinds of electronic equipment occupied the numerous shelves that lined the walls around the room red indicator lights glowed and needles pulsed one device provided a visual depiction of the static which looked like chaotically shifting dots the sound was harsh and brittle and re minded halloway of a radio searching for a hardtofind station which is pretty much whats going on he concluded the subtle vibration intensified giving halloway the start of a headache it sounds a little different than yesterday he said causing the man with the glasses to look up hello earl the researcher answered yes theres more activity and its getting louder theres been a general increase all week what do you figure is going on probably nothing sometimes the static seems to be accumulating toward something then it backs off according to the computer thats been the rhythm ever since this observatory was built fifteen years ago the researcher turned toward a sequence of knobs ill realign the dish and see if the pattern gains any definition monitoring local ambient electrical discharge is a good way to see if the equipments functioning properly halloway was aware that the dish the scientist referred to was the one tilted toward the horizon as if undergoing repairs he had no doubt however that the dish was pointed exactly where it was sup posed to besoutheast toward an area near rostov in theory the dishes gathered radio pulses from deep space and coordinated them a lot of heavenly bodies generated them the researcher had explained and a lot were still echoing from the big bang a complex computer program translated the signals into images that looked like photographs depicting nebulae novas black holes and other astronomical wonders halloway hadnt known what any of that meant when hed arrived at the installation three months earlier but the sameness of each day had bored the researcher enough that he was happy to explain how a radio observatory worked despite the explanations halloway had no illusions about what was really going on a radio observatory didnt need razor wire and highvoltage fences the m with which he and the other guards were equipped was one of the best assault carbines on the planet complete with a grenade launcher and a laser sighting system that was a hell of a lot of security to protect a facility that studied black holes even before a helicopter had transported him to this remote area of west texas halloway had been convinced that this felt like a spook operation rather than a project for the national science foundation within days of his arrival hed seen enough to use his laptop to google information about how radio observatories could be employed by espionage agencies hed become convinced that the dishes above this huge bunker werent pointed at nebulae novas and black holes they were aimed at satellites that scooped radio signals from the atmosphere they were also aimed at the moon radio signals all over the world leaked into outer space his internet research had informed him the moon intercepted many of those signals however and a properly focused radio observatory could collect them as they bounced back to earth by sorting through the various frequencies and choosing those favored by major terrorist organizations or foreign governments hostile to the united states a facility like this could relay valuable information to intelligence analysts in places such as fort meade near washington dc halloway hadnt picked that location at random fort meade he knew was the headquarters of the national security agency yes this was a damned spook operation he was sure of it but if the technicianwhose name was gordonwanted to keep lying claiming it was a scientific project that mapped deep space halloway was fine with that the little game they played was about the only thing that interested him that and the mystery of why one dish was aimed horizontally toward rostov the technician could jabber all he wanted to about monitoring local ambient electrical discharge give me a fucking break halloway thought somethings going on near rostov and a lot of this billiondollar facility is being used to try to figure out what it is page landed midroute at the airport outside roswell new mexico the sunbaked area was where the american ufo craze had begun in when a rancher had discovered debris from a large fallen object that the military described first as a flying disc and then as a weather bal loon the different explanations may simply have been an example of flawed communication but conspiracy theorists had seized on those differences to claim a government coverup ever since then roswell had become the unofficial ufo capital of the world so much so that every fourth of july the town had a ufo festival where skeptics and socalled experts debated while actors from science fiction movies signed autographs and enthusiasts dressed up as little green men page and tori had flown to the festival a few years earlier and enjoyed the carnival atmosphere of the parades the costume contest and the concerts one of which had featured a band interpreting music from pink floyds album the dark side of the moon they rarely found opportunities to vacation togetherhis job was too demandingand he remembered how she had laughed as they watched a group of klingons earnestly performing a wedding ceremony the bittersweet memory made page feel even more anxious to reach tori he watched as a fuel truck filled his planes tanks he verified that the fuel had the correct colorbluefor the type he needed and that there werent any contaminants then he climbed back into the plane took off and continued southeast his carefully chosen route allowed him to follow a corridor that passed among large military areas to the north east south and west these were boldly marked on his aerial map and indicated where fighter jets practiced combat maneuvers farther west an even more serious military area was located over the white sands missile range formerly known as the alamogordo bombing and gunnery range where the first atomic bomb had been detonated in the rugged vista was breathtaking nonpilots often assumed that the appeal of flying involved appreciating the scenery but page had become a pilot because he enjoyed the sensation of moving in three dimensions the truth was that maintaining altitude and speed while staying on course monitoring radio transmissions and comparing a sectional map to actual features on the ground required so much concentration that a pilot had little time for sightseeing there was another element to flying though and it was a lot like the drinking that took place at aftershift decompression sessions with his fellow officers page enjoyed flying because it helped him not to think about the terrible pain people inflicted on one another hed seen too many lives destroyed by guns knives beer bottles screw drivers baseball bats and even a nail gun six months earlier hed been the first officer to arrive at the scene of a car accident in which a drunken driver had hit an oncoming vehicle and killed five children along with the woman who was taking them to a birthday party thered been so much blood that page still had nightmares about it his friends thought he was joking when he said the reward of flying was getting above it all but he was serious the various activities involved in controlling an aircraft shut out what he was determined not to remember that helped page now his confusion his urgency his need to have answerson the ground these emotions had thrown him off balance but once he was in the air the discipline of controlling the cessnaforced him to feel as level as the aircraft in the calm sky amid the monotonous muffled drone of the engine the plane created a floating sensation he welcomed it yet couldnt help dreading what he might discover on the ground when he entered texas the davis mountains extended to his left as far as he could see they were hardly typical of the rest of the state and in fact reminded him of the aspen and pinoncovered peaks he was accustomed to seeing in new mexico he monitored the radio frequency for the rostov airport he knew from his preflight research that there wasnt a control tower and that he needed to broadcast his intentions directly to any aircraft that might be in the vicinity to make certain no flight paths intersected during his long approach he heard from only one other pilot a woman with a deep texas accent who reported that she was heading in the opposite direction the aerial map made clear where the prohibited airspace of the observatory was located but even without a map page couldnt have missed the installation the large white dishes reflected the sun and were awesome to behold they resembled giant versions of the satellite dish on the roof of his santa fe home incongruous with the flat landscape in which they were situated they radiated a feeling of sheer power that made them appear huge even when seen from a distance he was puzzled that the observatory was located on comparatively low ground especially when compared to the distant mountains didnt observatories work best when placed at as high an altitude as possible but his musings came to an end when the practical concerns inherent to flying replaced his curiosity careful to stay clear of the dishes he continued along his course toward rostov small communities were usually hard to spot from the air and rostov was no exception blending with the seemingly boundless ranchland that stretched everywhere for a moment page felt an eerie sense that hed been here before that hed flown over this exact area on an earlier occasion and had seen these same cattle spread out grazing he was particularly struck by a picturesque windmill next to a pond at which cattle drank a view he was positive hed seen before but hed never before been in this area of texas this just happens to look like a place youve flown over in another part of the country he told himself pay attention to what youre doing his map revealed railway tracks and a road that went through rostov flying parallel to the roadwhich was easier to spothe soon noticed a faint cluster of low buildings ahead the map indicated that the airport was three miles northeast of the town but as it came into view and page prepared to angle in that direction he felt confused when a second airstrip appeared on the opposite side of town to the southeast it wasnt marked on the map flying lower by that time he was able to take a closer look and he saw that the runway was cracked and buckled a lot of it covered with dirt patches of weeds and cactus growing at random the crumbled ruins of hangars lay next to it lots of hangars he noticed curiously many years ago this had been a sizable facility what happened to it page wondered he noticed something else an unusual topographical feature that stretched beyond the decayed airstrip there contrasting with the rugged brown grassland was an extensive area of what looked like huge black cinders seemingly evidence of volcanic activity that eons ago had pushed subterranean debris to the surface the cinders had formed the rim of a volcanic crater that had eroded over time until only half of it remained visible barely rising above the surface of the surrounding land whenever the eruption had occurred the force of it had scattered chunks everywhere page had seen other areas like it while flying over arizona they were generally called badlands a fitting name for something so bleak and forbidding he couldnt help concluding that the place looked the way he felt increasingly eager to find tori he flew from the ruined uncharted airfield toward the airport that was marked on the map again the precision of what he needed to do was the only thing he could allow to occupy his mind after radioing his intention to land and checking where the windsock was pointed he reduced the engines power and glided downward when he came within a wingspan of the center line on the airstrip he leveled the plane felt it float sensed it begin to settle eased back on the yoke and touched down gently on the two main wheels letting the nose wheel ease down on its own protecting the strut that supported it he taxied to a tiedown area next to a building that looked like an old gas station except that there werent any pumps in front of it in stead the fuel was kept in a small tanker truck he quickly shut out the memory of the tanker that hed seen explode in santa fe just a few days earlier off to the side a hangar had its doors open revealing a helicopter and a lear jet their presence in this small community might have been puzzling if not for the fact that this was texas cattle country four propellerdriven aircraft were tied down all more powerful and expensive than pages cessna another indicator of wealth climbing out of the cockpit he secured the plane and pulled his bags from the rear seat but now that his obligation to the aircraft had ended he found that he couldnt walk his muscles seemed paralyzed as confusion escaped from the tight mental compartment into which hed temporarily been able to shut it away he was no longer above everything he didnt have a halfdozen things to accomplish in order to control the plane at once the pressure of the past two days flooded through him again why did tori leave without telling me whats she doing here what the hells going on despite the apprehension that seized him page managed to force his legs to work and carried his bags across the hot pavement the building that reminded him of an old gas station had adobe walls and a corrugated metal roof the rust on which suggested that the structure dated back many years opening a squeaky screen door he entered a small reception area that held a battered wooden table and a scuffed leather sofa a candy machine stood next to a water cooler and a phone that hung on the wall another doorway led to an office on the right from which a heavy grayhaired man of about sixty appeared he wore frayed mechanics coveralls and used a rag to wipe grease from his fingers page set down his bags and shook the mans hand ignoring the grease on it knowing that he gained a measure of respect by doing so i called you from santa fe this morning about renting a car you dan page thats me i dont know how long ill be staying but id like to start a creditcard tab so you can charge me for the tiedown fee also i need the tanks filled with ll most propellerdriven air craft used that type of fuel the ll stood for low lead one of the few leaded fuels still sold in the united states thatll be finethe cars behind this building the mechanic said ive got the paperwork ready for you to sign carefully hiding the disarray his emotions were in page handed over his drivers license and a credit card we dont have many strangers fly in here the mechanic added a polite texas way of asking why page had come to town page surprised himself with his reply ive got marriage problems to sort out the car was a red toyota celica a wall of heat swept out when page opened the drivers door he left it open while he set his bags in the trunk but when he got behind the steering wheel both it and the seat remained hot to the touch he started the engine and turned on the air conditioning as cool air streamed over him he took a deep breath and tried to steady himself then he drove from the airport to where a dirt road led in only one direction merging with the paved road into rostov a water tower loomed above the low buildings ahead to the right cattle pens stretched along the railroad tracks at rostovs outskirts the street expanded to double the width of the road presumably a vestige from frontier days when cattle had been herded through town he passed a feedandgrain store a saddleandboot shop and a ford dealership that seemed to specialize in pickup trucks he reached blocks of houses that were painted earth colors ranging from sand to tan to brown in contrast their front doors were green or blue or red colorful flower gardens accentuated the singlestory homes where the wide street intersected with another all of the buildings became businessesa restaurant a bank a hotel a real estate office page was reminded of tori and a clothing store here too the colors were eyecatching one building was red while another was purple another yellow and another green no hue repeating itself within any block but despite the fresh look of the buildings page had the sense that most of them dated back many years and that at one time theyd been close to collapsing he sensed something else that hed seen these buildings before not in their present colorful version but the way theyd once been just as he felt hed seen the panorama of the cattle grazing outside town even though it was his first visit to this area traffic was light a woman pushed a baby carriage a young man sat on a bench and played a harmonica barely audible through the tightly closed car windows at the end of the street to the right page saw an oldtime railroad station to the left he saw a playground and a church across from them a buildings domed tower made him suspect that it was a courthouse the floor was dark worn marble a door on the left had a frosted glass window with black letters that told him police department inside behind a counter an elderly woman wore a leather vest she looked up at him and smiled yes sir my names dan page chief costigans expecting me i said id meet him at five oclock and youre right on time a raspy voice said page recognized the voice he had heard that morning on the phone he turned toward an office doorway where a lanky man stood watching him the mans face was thin and creased with the dull gray skin that smokers tend to have he had a mustache and a small scar on his chin his saltandpepper hair was cut close to his head his uniform was tan although his equipment belt held a modern glock pistol page wasnt surprised to see that he wore cowboy boots what you said about the airport made me curious so i asked harry out there to watch for you he called to tell me when you arrived you have your own plane a cessna i get nervous in airplanes costigan gestured toward his office come in they shook hands as page stepped through the doorway i dont know any police officers who can afford a plane costigan sat behind a vintage wooden desk his swivel chair creaked loudly i inherited it from my father he was a mechanic in the air force listen i hope you dont mind if we skip the small talk i need to know about my wife you said one of your deputies found her car early this morning page did his best to keep his emotions steady yes sir at the side of a road to be precise out at the observation platform observation platform thats one of the things i figured youd understand better if i showed you rather than told you about it page waited for him to elaborate but costigan made no effort to do so look i dont understand any of this page told him sharply are you sure my wife isnt hurt absolutely sure and she isnt with anyone shes alone shes staying at a motel herethe trails end ill take you to her when were finished costigan leaned forward studying him how long have you been a police officer fifteen years costigan concentrated on the right side of pages belt where a chafed area indicated he often wore a holster i always feel off balance when im not wearing my weapon did you bring yours with you do you know any police officer who leaves his gun at home do you ever go anywhere without yours even when youre off duty costigan kept studying him its not my departments gun its my own page said i have a concealedcarry permit for it texas and new mexico have reciprocal arrangements i know the law mr page but you havent answered my question my guns in my suitcase which is safely locked in my rental car why do you ask under the circumstances i think it would be a good idea if you kept it there under the circumstances the words baffled page until he realized what costigan was getting at jesus surely you dont think im a threat to my wife domestic disputes and guns dont go together but this isnt a domestic dispute page tried not to raise his voice really then why did you ask if she was with anyone why did she tell her mother she was going to visit her in san antonio yet didnt bother to tell you before she left page didnt respond for a moment didnt know what to say then he spread his hands helplessly trying to keep his words steady okay the truth is i dont know how to explain this i have no idea why she left and why she didnt tell me and i sure as hell have no idea what shes doing here in rostov why shes hereyoull understand tonight as for whats going on between the two of you you promised to take me to her page stood were wasting time lets go were not finished talking sit down im going to tell you a story a story page stared down at the man behind the desk what kind of crazy yes a story humor meits about my father he used to be the police chief here in rostov whats that got to do with you still havent sat back down mr page the intensity in the police chiefs eyes made him hesitate and then ill take you to your wife page sat impatiently tell me your story one night my father got a phone call from a terrified boy who said his dad was beating his mom when the boy gave his last name my father didnt recognize it right away the family had moved here from fort worth a couple of months earlier the husband had been out of work and a relative of his who lived here had found him a job at the stock pens when he wasnt working the husband liked to go to a local bar get drunk and pick fights it was the hottest september anybody could remember yet the wife always wore high buttoned collars and long sleeves later it became obvious that she did that to hide bruises the boy was quiet in school always fidgeting as if he was afraid hed make a mistake and get punished that night when the boy phoned afraid that his dad was going to kill his mom my father got in his cruiser and hurried over there the house was near the stock pens a rundown adobe with patches of stucco missing on the walls the lights were on when my father heard shouting and sobbing he knocked on the door and identified himself as a police officer thats how i imagine it anyhow ive gone over it in my head more times than i care to think the shouting stopped my father knocked again and a shotgun blast from inside tore the door in half it pretty much tore my father in half also i doubt he lived long enough to feel himself hit the ground page leaned forward in his chair when my father didnt report back in a half hour a deputy drove over to the house where he found my dad spread out on the ground after the deputy threw up he managed to control himself long enough to radio for an ambulance at that time there werent any other local police officers the deputys only option was to contact the highway patrol but they said they couldnt get there for another half hour so the deputy sucked up his nerve drew his gun and went into the house the wife was on the living room floor with her head shot off blood was everywhere the deputy went into the kitchen no one was there he went into the master bedroom no one he went into a smaller bedroomthe boysand the window was open the father must have heard the boy leaping out what the searchers found the next morning made clear that the father chased his son across the road and into a field why did he act that way do you suppose page inhaled slowly a man like that blames his family for making him unhappy everythings their fault and they need to be punished youve been taking psychology courses increases my pay grade costigan looked beyond page as if remembering the night hed learned that his father had been shotgunned to death his eyes refocused what you say makes sense but heres another explanation some people are wired wrong its their nature to cause pain theyre so dark inside that maybe the only word to describe them is evil yes ive met people like that page said too many the next morning the searchers found the boys corpse in weeds a half mile from the house the father was lying next to him after hed killed his son hed put the shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger coyotes had gotten to them by the time the bodies were found page tasted a familiar sourness in his mouth he was reminded of the car that had been hit by the drunk driver of the five children and the woman inside killed instantly he thought of the drug dealer whod shot his friend bobby just two days earlier im sorry about your father not a day goes by that i dont remember him ill never be the man he was but he wasnt perfect and what happened that night proved it he shouldnt have let it happen whats the most dangerous situation any police officer faces family arguments exactly because theyre so emotional and unpredictable after my father knocked he should have stepped to the side away from the door and the windows or better yet he should have stayed by his car and used his bullhorn to order the husband to step outside if the guy had come out with a shotgun at least my father would have had a chance to defend himself it didnt need to happen the way it did but my father had a weak spot he couldnt stand bullies costigan looked directly at page especially when they picked on women okay page said i get the point but i told you my wife and i arent arguing this isnt a domestic dispute so you say but until im sure youre not a threat to her you wont see her without me standing next to you although the sun was descending toward the horizon its rays seemed unusually bright in the passenger seat of the police car page put on his sunglasses he pulled out his cell phone and called margaret to let her know that tori was okay and that he was on his way to see her he promised to have tori call but wasnt sure hed be able to keep that promise as they drove through rostov he glanced out the window at a muffler shop and a barbecue restaurant called the rib palace ahead at the edge of town a sign announced trails end motel a row of plain singlestory units formed a u with the office in the middle your wifes in number costigan told him as the car crunched across the gravel parking lot raising a cloud of dust but when they got to number the parking space was empty page felt hollow as he stepped from the cruiser the drapes were closed and he couldnt see past them to tell if there was luggage inside they walked across the gravel pushed open a screen door with a loud squeak and entered the office which had a softdrink machine and a small television in a corner on the screen a reporter was announcing sports scores jake the police chief said to a gangly young clerk behind the counter the lady in unit did she check out nope paid for the rest of the week i saw her car go past twenty minutes ago costigan nodded then gestured toward page better save a room for this gentleman no need page said annoyed ill stay with my wife as long as its her idea but in case it isnt jake save him a room the screen door squeaked again when costigan opened it out side turning from the sunset he debated for a moment shes got a long night ahead of her whatever that means page thought you said your deputy found her early in the morning what was she doing until then thats something you need to see for yourself chief im getting tired of this costigan didnt seem to hear him maybe she went to get some thing to eat lets try the rib palace they drove back to the restaurant but toris suv wasnt in the parking lot most of the clientele seemed to drive pickup trucks page noted at the chiefs insistence they went inside tori wasnt among the earlyevening crowd fred costigan said to an aproned man behind a counter did a redhaired woman come in here about twenty minutes ago and buy some takeout food sure did a turkeyandcheese sandwich plus iced tea dont get much call for turkey shes lucky we had some you might want to stock some more of it i have a hunch shell be back give us a couple of burgers and fries to go costigan looked at page youre not a vegetarian i hope page just stared at him burgers are fine he said im buying the stuffed paper bag had a grease stain on one side he carried it out to the police car they got in and drove east patchy brown grass stretched in every direction cattle grazed in the dimming sunset on the right they came to a barbedwire fence beyond which lay the rusted ruins of collapsed metal buildings signs hung at regular intervals along the fence property of us military danger hazardous chemicals unexploded ordnance that used to be a military training airfield costigan explained back in the s i saw it when i flew in i wondered what happened to it they shut it down in just left it its been falling apart ever since a short distance ahead past what looked like a historical marker of some sort page saw a low wooden structure it had a flat roof and resembled a roadside stand where vegetables might be sold but in this case the section that faced the road was closed and the open side was directed toward a fence and the grassland that lay beyond try as he might page couldnt figure out what it was for toris blue saturn was parked next to it yeah she got here early costigan said they pulled off the road and stopped behind the saturn the wooden structure had a sidewall that prevented page from seeing if tori was inside at the same time it prevented tori from seeing the police car i guess she figured waiting here was better than waiting in her motel room costigan said this is the observation platform you mentioned yeah where my deputy found her page reached to open the cruisers door wait costigan said it wont be long now the suns almost down as soon as it gets dark youll understand page stared at him why should i youve indulged me this far is ten minutes longer going to make a difference whats so damned important about the sun going down eat your burger before it gets cold i promise you thisll be a long night earl halloway sat in the airconditioned control room scanning the numerous monitors that showed closedcircuit images of the area around the observatory taggard sat next to him chewing on a candy bar the setting sun cast an orange tint over the array of dishes that towered aboveground in a while as darkness settled the images would become green indicating that the heatsensing capability of the cameras had become active animals or people would show clearly as a glow although at the moment not a single cow or even a rabbit was visible out there halloway picked up the sports magazine that taggard had been reading every minute or so he glanced up at the monitors nothing was happening outside nothing ever happened outside which of course was a good thing especially compared to the ambushes and roadside bombs hed dodged in iraq but god almighty this assignment was boring down the hall halloway heard a door close ill be right back he told his partner taggard nodded taking another bite halloway left the control room and walked along the hall to the door that hed heard being closed he knew which door it was be cause each night it was always the same door the one marked data analysis during the day gordon leaves the door open but at night he always closes it he thought why whats he hiding a renewed wave of boredom made halloway reach for the handle then open the door the room was filled with the subtle hum of all the electronic devices that occupied the wallsand the even subtler vibration that he sensed everywhere in the facility and that interfered with his sleep enough to make him always feel on the verge of a headache gordon wore a headset over his hairless scalp sitting at a desk that was turned away from the door he studied rows of numbers accumulating on a computer screen when halloway stepped closer gordon sensed the movement and looked in his direction surprised he took off the earphones and pushed his glasses higher on his nose didnt i lock the door i meant to lock the door just checking to see that everythings okay of course it is why wouldnt it be gordon asked defensively thats what they pay me to find out halloway heard a noise coming from the headphones that gordon had set on the table it was faint compared to when it had come through the speakers during the afternoon even so he could tell that it sounded quite different now no longer a persistent crackle but a series of wavering tones pitched at various levels some rising while others descended many of them occurring in high and low unison they had a subtle sensual quiver their languid arousing rhythm made him step forward sounds like music he said i dont mean to be rude but you need to get out of here gordon responded i have work to do halloway held up his hands sure sorry to disturb you gordon like i said i was just checking as he stepped back the noises from the earphones changed again sounding definitely like music but it was unlike any music he had ever heard as a teenager hed dreamed about becoming a rock star hed had a garage band and still played an electric guitar damned well he knew about major and minor keys and fourfour and threefour beat patterns but this music didnt have any key hed ever heard and it sure didnt have any beat pattern that he recognized faint as it was the music floated and dipped glided and sank the notes merged and separated in a rhythm that was almost like the way he breathed if he were on r r lying on a beach in mexico enjoying the salt smell of the air absorbing the warmth of the sun i dont know what that is but its the most beautiful thing i ever heard gordon took off his glasses and to halloways surprise he didnt protest again instead when he spoke it seemed as if he felt relieved to do so to share his discovery with someone it is beautiful he said why didnt we hear it this afternoon halloway asked i have no idea whatever this is it happens only after the sun goes down and you hear that every night no not like that until two nights ago it was always faint and fuzzy sort of hovering behind the static i needed to do a lot of electronic filtering to get a sense of what it sounded like what happened two nights ago your guess is as good as mine but all of a sudden thats what i started hearing i cant hear it very well halloway said why dont you turn on the speakers gordon hesitated evidently concerned that doing so would violate his orders but then he shrugged as if to say what the hell i cant keep this to myself any longer and flicked a switch instantly the floating gliding sailing music filled the room making halloway feel as if he were standing on a cushion of air the instrumentswhatever they werehad a synthesizer quality that made them impossible to identify perhaps it was only his imagination but the wavelike tones seemed to drift into his ears like the arousing whisper of a woman pressed against him my god thats beautiful he repeated whats causing it weve been trying to figure that out since this place was built gordon paused then added and apparently a lot longer than that those last words were cryptic but before halloway could ask about them taggard appeared in the doorway what kind of radio station is that ive never heard anything like it is it on the internet how do i download that music if you tried to record it somebody would have to shoot you gordon said taggard looked surprised thats not a joke gordon told him halloway barely paid attention to what they were saying he felt the music drifting around him and then inside him becoming part of him the cushion of air on which he seemed to float became even softer at the same time the headache hed been struggling with finally emerged from the hole where hed managed to suppress it like something that had festered until it couldnt be denied the pain was beautiful the us army intelligence and security command known as inscom is one of the few branches of the us military that is also a branch of a civilian organization specifically the national security agency the worlds largest electronic intelligencegathering service although inscom maintains several bases the one affiliated with the nsa is located at fort meade maryland where the nsa is headquartered from his office window col warren raleigh could see a mile away to the nsas headquarters a tall complex of buildings topped by a vast array of antennae and microwave dishes two massive black structures dominated the group during the day their shiny dark windows reflected the five thousand cars that sat in the sprawling parking lots that surrounded them raleigh thought that the reflection was appropriate while the nsas occupants could see out no one could see in and the clandestine nature of the agency was represented in another wayalthough the buildings were huge there were even more acres of space concealed underground his own office was located in a threestory building designed to look bland and unimposing a metal plaque next to the entrance read environmental wind and solar development facility suggesting that the work inside was devoted to finding cheap renewable sources of energy for the government and the military in actuality the plaque was one of raleighs jokes the idea that the government and the military would be interested in costcutting or ecological is sues was laughable to him the e w and s of environmental wind and solar actually stood for experimental weapons strategy many of the projects under development in the building were only tangentially related to the nsas task of gathering intelligence via electronic means but somesuch as the efforts to create lethal rays derived from the microwave beams that transmitted cellphone messageswere logical extensions of the nsas tools so were the experiments to develop communications satellites capable of firing laser beams toward enemy positions but when it came to hispersonal choice of weapons as far as raleigh was concerned nothing equaled the feel of a firearm the second of the buildings five underground levels featured an extensive gun range part of which was a socalled shooting house with a maze designed to look like corridors and rooms in an ordinary apartment complex or office building along each corridor and within each room potential threats lurked unseen as lifesized targets popped up unexpectedly the objective was to identify them correctly and eliminate armed opponents without injuring innocent bystanders and the goal was to do so in the shortest possible time usually no more than two minutes on this thursday in early june at in the evening raleigh was prepared to beat his own record with your permission colonel do your job sergeant lockhart yes sir lockhart a bull of a man shook raleigh violently then spun him you can do better than that sergeant yes sir the sergeant shook raleigh so hard that the colonels teeth knocked together then lockhart spun him so forcefully that the colonel had the sense of being in a centrifuge for a moment he wondered if the sergeant might be enjoying his work too much abruptly lockhart let go of him thrust an m into his hands and shoved him into the shooting house the sergeant had indeed done his job raleigh felt so disoriented that the floor seemed to ripple and the walls to tilt his heart rushed and his vision wavered each time raleigh tested himself in the shooting house lockhart reconfigured the partitions arranging the layout in a new and unprdictable design the one thing raleigh could be sure of was the familiarity of the weapon in his hands during his twentyfiveyear career hed used its forerunnerthe min numerous conflicts around the world he knew how to fieldstrip and reassemble an m in absolute darkness and with amazing speed hed learned to appreciate its contours and secret places as he would those of a lover he could shoot that venerable assault rifle with remarkable accuracy even when it was switched to full auto still the m had drawbacks particularly the length of its barrel in the close environments of urban warfare so the shorter lighter m carbine had been developed as an officer in the army raleigh had his differences with the marines but he definitely agreed with their wisdom in requiring all officers to replace their sidearms with ms at heart were all riflemen raleigh thought moving warily along a dim hallway he checked that the ms selector was set for threeshot bursts he willed his mind to stop swirling and his legs to become steady with longpracticed biofeedback techniques he worked to control his respiratory rate and sub due his pulse a target sped out of a doorway ahead raleigh aimed and held his fire the target was an old man holding up his hands in surrender raleigh peered into the room saw that it was empty and continued down the hallway but at once a noise behind him made him pivot another target sped from the room somehow it had been concealed from him it was a man with a rifle but before it stopped raleigh pulled the trigger sending three rounds into the opponents head he blew another three rounds into the old mans head on the assumption that he was in league with the assailant and that in an actual firefight the old bastard would probably pick up the dead mans gun the moment raleighs back was turned raleigh quickly scanned the rest of the corridor ready to shoot he moved forward through growing shadows the trick was to keep his weight balanced never placing one foot too far ahead of the other sliding his feet he progressed in an efficient shuffle always capable of adjusting to the ms recoil another target popped from a doorway raleigh almost fired be fore he saw that it was a woman holding a child but then he realized that the child was actually a doll and that the grip of a pistol projected from behind it he pulled the trigger and sent three bullets into the womans brain the smell of gun smoke was thick in the corridor now although raleigh wore protective earplugs his awareness was at such a level that he swore he could hear the clinking sound of his empty shells hitting the concrete floor how much time had gone by how long had he been there dont think about it just get the job done the corridor went to the right raleigh entered an area that had a receptionists desk and wooden chairs in front of it without warning a target surged up from behind the desk a man with a handgun as raleigh fired a figure rushed from an office doorwaya woman in a white medical coat she held up her hands as yet another target sped into view this one from another doorway a man about to throw a grenade raleigh shot him then shot a target that hurried from a farther doorway a woman with a rifle then shot two gunmen who rushed from the corridor on the opposite side of the reception area he pivoted scanning everything that lay before him on guard against more attacks his mouth was dry his hands sweated on the m the rush of his heart was so powerful that he felt pressure in the veins of his neck breathing deeply but not quickly he assessed the scene before him were all the threats eliminated no the woman in the white medical coat continued to stand before him weaponless her hands were raised is the sergeant setting me up raleigh wondered is that a weapon in the pocket of her medical coat he twisted the ms selector to full auto and emptied the remainder of the magazine into her the powerful burst blowing the ply wood figure apart through his earplugs he heard a sharp electronic whistle the signal that the exercise had ended he pulled out the earplugs and turned toward sergeant lockhart who approached along the corridor i finished before the ninetysecond time limit raleigh said beat my own record didnt i yes sir lockhart said but there was doubt in his voice he glanced behind him and raleigh knew he was thinking of the bullet holes in the target that portrayed the old man then lockhart peered ahead toward the disintegrated target of the woman in the white medical coat collaborators raleigh explained theyd have moved against me the first chance they had of course sir lockhart still sounded doubtful sergeant dont you like this assignment sir im very happy with it i could arrange to have you sent someplace that offers you more of a challenge perhaps a war zone id prefer you didnt sir combat builds character you know sir ive been in combat with all due respect i dont think i need any more character then ill spare you a repeat of the experience but since youve been in firefights theres one relevant thing id expect you to have learned yes sir and what is that the colonel gestured toward the disintegrated target of the woman in the white medical coat you dont stay alive long if you take the time to worry about innocent bystanders especially in a firefight sure maybe some pussy reporterll accuse you of a war crime and maybe the armyll cave in to the grumbling of a bunch of politicians and put you on trial but youll still be alive and ten years of hard labor is better than getting shot to death by a supposed innocent bystander who thinks youre a fool for not killing him or her there could easily have been a suicide bomb under her medical coat yes sir its going to be hard for anyone to outdo my new record yes sir the sergeant assured him emphatically raleighs cell phone buzzed he pulled it from his belt and spoke into it with authority raleigh here what he heard made his jaw tighten im on my way the strange sounds seeped past the closed door of the command center one level below the underground shooting house raleigh heard them the moment he hurried from the elevator he passed an armed sentry jabbed numbers on a security pad and pushed the door open the full volume of the sounds drifted over him a dozen civilian researchers studied various electronic displays assessing measuring calculating hed never seen his research team look so intense amid the multitude of glowing instruments and pulsing meters he hurriedly closed the door and tried to identify what he was hearing he was reminded of music but these werent like any notes hed ever heard granted they were processed through a computers synthesizer program which gave them an artificial tone but hed heard synthesizer music before and that wasnt what created the distinctive feeling these sounds inspired first the rhythm sank into him it drifted so hypnotic that it seemed to counteract his quickening heartbeat second the notes vibrated in a way that made the colors in the room appear to intensify third the melodywhich didnt have any pattern that he could detectmade his mouth feel as if hed just sipped youre tasting orange juice arent you colonel startled he looked up a researcher had noticed him draw his tongue along his lips thats right how did you know we all are do the colors seem stronger as well the mans eyes flashed with curiosity raleigh nodded squinting to subdue the sudden intense glow of the monitors you can almost feel the music as much as hear it the man continued yes a ripple of warmth along my skin its called synesthesia raleigh was blessed with an encyclopedic memory he quickly identified the word a process by which the stimulation of one sense somehow causes other senses to be stimulated as well exactly the researcher said in this case were not only hearing these sounds were also seeing them feeling them and tasting them raleigh glanced from one scientist to another he thought of the projects his team had been developing one of his favorites was a method of transmitting ultralow sound waves that affected the physical and psychological wellbeing of an enemy the enemy wouldnt be able to hear the sound and hence wouldnt be aware of the aural bombardment but the effects would be profound in the s an early version had been tested around the isolated community of taos in northern new mexico for months the valley had been saturated by a lowlevel frequency that in theory should have been beneath the range of what human and animal ears could register but in actuality turned out to be just barely detectable locals who were made nervous wrecks by it took to calling it the taos hum dogs and cats showed visible pain scratching at their ears until they were bloody that glitch had been corrected so that no person or animal could hear the low vibration and raleigh had enjoyed the power of being able to make people irritable enough to lose their temperseven at tack one anothersimply because he had flicked a switch but no project had ever offered so much baffling promise as this one it had been in development for decades since long before raleigh had maneuvered his career so that hed been put in charge of it in it dated back to before inscom had been established in and even before the national security agency itself had been created in this was the culmination of something that had obsessed him since he was a boy and it presented the chance for him to fulfill a lifelong ambition finally its my turn leaning over the console and staring at the flickering lights he addressed his next question to the entire team usually all we get is static why is this happening all of a sudden its not just rostov a woman scientist murmured as she shook her head as if to free herself from the strange music raleigh turned toward a large computer screen on which a world map showed four widely separated red dots each of the dots was pulsing rostov started first a man with thick spectacles said but then the others began doing the same thing the static dissolved and the man gestured in mystification and then we heard this the others continuing to taste orange juice raleigh moved closer to the map on the screen one of the flashing dots was situated in west texas that was the one hed automatically looked toward be cause that was the site on which the research had always been focused but now he peered at the other locations norway australia and thailandall sites known to display phenomena similar to those in west texas what youre hearing is the one in australia the woman continued but those areas are even more out of the way than rostov raleigh objected hell the one in thailands on a riverbank in a jungle the one in australias hundreds of miles into the outback and we dont have monitoring equipment anywhere near them let alone a radio observatory like the one in west texas in this case theres no need the man with thick glasses explained the signals are so powerful theyre leaking out into the atmosphere were capturing them off special frequencies on our satellites you said rostov started to do this first yes then the others became active raleigh pulled his cell phone from his belt and quickly tapped numbers sergeant assemble a team civilian identities concealed weapons were leaving for west texas at dawn its dark enough now costigan said his figure indistinct in the police car neither of them had spoken in so long that his voice seemed extra loud finally page told him its about time i got the answers you promised i didnt promise answers the police chief replied what i promised was that youd understand page shook his head in annoyance opened the passenger door and stepped onto the gravel parking area he stretched to ease the tight muscles in his legs and shoulders his companion walked to the back of the cruiser where he opened the trunk and pulled something out here costigan reached across with a windbreaker in a couple of hours youll want this it gets cold out here a couple of hours baffled page took the windbreaker but didnt put it on everything was shadowy in the dusk a faint light was mounted on the sidewall of the observation platform but its effects were minimal the last glow of sunset disappeared below the horizon as he walked past toris saturn approaching the observation plat form he heard a vehicle behind him and looked back toward the headlights of a volkswagen van that steered from the road and stopped a short distance from the police car puzzled he stopped to see who had arrived the vans headlights went off then interior lights came on as doors were opened page saw the silhouettes of a middleaged man and woman getting out they twisted their shoulders stretching the kinks out after what had evidently been a long drive this better be worth it the man said irritably were a hundred and fifty miles out of our way you said you wanted to retire early and see the country the woman replied the man surveyed the dark barren area around him and were sure as hell in the country that police cars probably here to keep people from getting robbed well come on lets get this over with the couple shut their doors extinguishing the vans interior lights their footsteps crunched on the gravel as they walked toward the observation platform following their example page continued in that direction costigan veered off to throw the crumpled paper bag with the remnants of their burgers and fries into a trash can then followed him across the lot before they made it another ten feet page heard a second vehicle approaching then a third both turned into the parking area their headlights sweeping across the structure but he didnt look back this time he came around the sidewall and found an area about thirty feet long and ten feet deep it had a wooden floor a roof and a builtin bench that went all the way along the back wall anyone sitting there would face the grassland that stretched beyond the fence a solitary figure was in the middle looking toward the dark horizon a woman she wore sneakers jeans and a sweater she seemed oblivious to the shadows of the middleaged man and woman who went over to the fence and stared past it toward the night page concentrated on her trying to understand i dont see a thing the man complained well we just got here you need to give it a chance a family came around and stepped in front of the platform parents with a young boy and girl tugging on their hands by the time we get to the motel itll be long past their bedtime the mother said hey as long as were driving by theres no harm in stopping its not as if its taking us out of our way the father replied but the temperatures going down the kidsll probably catch cold the woman on the bench seemed oblivious to the family as well and oblivious to page she just kept looking toward the night he smelled cigarette smoke and glanced over his shoulder toward where costigan leaned his tall thin body against a post that sup ported the platforms roof the police chief had put on a cowboy hat and raised a glowing cigarette to his mouth the woman didnt pay attention to that either confused page looked in the direction that held her gaze above the horizon he saw an amazing number of stars with more appearing all the time as the last of the sunlight retreated he studied the dark expanse of the grassland fortyfive degrees to the right he noticed the distant specks of headlights as a few vehicles approached rostov from the mexican border which lay fifty miles away so what the hell am i supposed to understand page wondered he was beginning to feel like the victim of a scam yet he couldnt imagine what it might be at the fence the middleaged man spoke again echoing his thoughts its just like i told you nothing just some kind of tourist trap im amazed theyre not trying to sell us something honestly the woman replied i dont know where youre in such a hurry to go just give it a chance meanwhile at another section of the fence the two children tugged harder at their parents hands daddy i dont see anything the little girl said here ill lift you up the father said me too the little boy insisted youll have to wait your turn i cant lift both of you at the same time ill do it the mother picked up the boy i still dont see anything the little girl said daddy the dark makes me scared mommy im hungry the little boy said okay the father told them sounding defeated i guess wed better go after all nothings out there anyhow tomorrow morning maybe we can see where they made that james deacon movie the sets supposed to be around here and i hear the big old ranch house is still standing as the parents carried the fidgeting children to the car two other vehicles pulled in one was a pickup truck and when it stopped three teenagers got out the other to pages annoyance was a bus labeled texas tours from which about thirty people emerged a clamor arose as they all felt the need to say whatever flitted through their minds who are all these people page wondered he had come here hoping to talk with his wife and to find out what had possessed her to leave with every new arrival a quiet reunion became more and more impossible to the woman on the bench however none of the other people seemed even to exist she just kept staring at the horizon never once moving her head toward the growing distractions page realized that he was hesitating that despite his effort to get here and his impatience with costigan for making him wait he was actually afraid of the answers he might get bracing his resolve he walked through the darkness toward his wife she had her head tilted back so that it was leaning against the shadowy wooden wall her gaze was straight ahead page stepped up to the side and watched her tori she didnt reply in the background the jabbering conversations of the people whod gotten off the bus filled the night maybe she didnt hear me page thought tori he repeated she just kept staring toward the horizon he stepped closer the reflected headlights from another car showed him that her eyes were wide open and she didnt even seem to be blinking it was as if she were spellbound by something out there again he turned in the direction she was looking but all he saw were the dark grassland the brilliant array of the stars and another set of headlights off to the right on the road from mexico tori what are you looking at no response stepping closer page came within five feet of her and noticed in his peripheral vision that costigan moved protectively closer then leaned against another post the smoke from his cigarette drifted in the air suddenly page heard her voice arent they beautiful tori asked they page turned toward the dark grassland and concentrated what do you see you cant see them no with the noise of the annoying conversations behind him page almost didnt hear what tori said next then you shouldnt have come baffled he sat beside her corrigan shifted again she still didnt look at him what did you expect me to do page asked working to keep his voice calm you left without telling me you disappeared for two days i was afraid something had happened to you when i found out you were here surely you didnt expect me to stay home a halfdozen people stepped onto the observation platform their feet thunking on the wood their voices echoing in the enclosure dont see a thing one of them said what a crock wait someone in the crowd at the fence shouted there where over there look four of them yes a woman exclaimed i dont see a friggin thing a teenager said there someone said with each exclamation the crowd shifted and turned the murmur died away as people focused all of their attention then rose again when somepage among themsaw nothing youve gotta be shitting me theres nothing out there another teenager complained the crowds comments went back and forth some people were rapt while others were frustrated a few became angry page heard toris voice next to him the interruptions go on for a couple of hours she said bewildered he studied her they sat silently for a while and as some of the onlookers began to leave the headlights of their cars showed how intense her eyes were as she gazed at the darkness her red hair was combed back behind her ears emphasizing the attractive lines of her face he wanted to touch her cheek then it gets peaceful she said and you can really appreciate them why dont i sit here and well wait for the rest of the crowd to leave then you can show me yes page felt an ache in his chest his mind raced with questions that had nowhere to go leaning against the nearby post costigan dropped his cigarette and crushed it with his boot all the while continuing to watch carefully when i was ten my parents took me with them on a car trip tori said staring toward the darkness her voice drifted off page didnt understand why shed told him that then she seemed to remember what shed started to say we lived in austin back then and we didnt reach this section of west texas until dark she tilted her head toward something in the distance my father wanted to visit a cousin of his whod just gotten a job on a ranch out here the cousin was only going to be in the area for a couple of months again tori paused then seemed to remember what shed started to say as you know all my fathers relatives were wanderers including him page thought but he was careful not to interrupt her father had deserted the family when tori had been sixteen anyway we drove through here tori said the exclamations of delight in the crowd contrasted with com plaints about the increasing chill and the impatience some felt when they didnt see what others claimed they did the noise made it difficult for page to hear what tori said but he didnt dare ask her to speak up for fear of having the opposite effect she continued i needed to go to the bathroom even back then the county had a couple of outdoor toilets here when i saw them in our headlights i yelled for him to stop but my father was in a hurry to see his cousin he wouldnt have stopped if my mother hadnt insisted i rushed into one of the toilets and after i came out my father was waiting impatiently by the car something made me look toward the grassland and i saw them saw what tori seemed not to have heard the question i couldnt help walking toward the fence and staring at them my mother always took me to church on sunday and i thought that when the preacher told us about heaven this is what he must have been talking about my father ordered me to get in the car but i couldnt make myself do it i couldnt bear to stop looking at what was out there he wanted to know what the hell i thought i was seeing i tried to explain but all he said was something about a damned fool kids imagination i remember trying to push him away when he picked me up and carried me to the car i shouted and pounded him he literally threw me into the back seat im sorry page said maybe it was a good thing that he eventually left when tori didnt continue page regretted his interruption but then he realized that shed stopped only because shed renewed her attention on the darkness there a woman at the fence shouted yes a man joined in another woman pointed five of them i dont see anything disgusted the teenagers got into the pickup truck and drove away a halfdozen people wandered toward the bus but a surprising number remained staring toward the darkness theres one on the left someone exclaimed what am i supposed to be looking at someone else asked page wondered the same thing again tori spoke still not looking at him id forgotten about this place until two days ago the day you started to drive to your mothers house page said the words he almost used were the day you left me id gone a little beyond el paso it was six in the evening i was at a truck stop studying a road map while i drank a cup of coffee i still had a long way to drive to get to san antonio and i wondered if i might need to stop somewhere for the night interstate goes south east along the mexican border until it gets to a town called esperanza where the highway cuts directly east to san antonio i figured esperanza might be a good place to stop she paused interesting name for a town esperanza page had lived in the southwest long enough to know that the word was spanish for hope tori smiled at something in the darkness page waited beginning to feel afraid a minute later she continued her voice was so calm that it was as if she were reading a bedtime story to a child i looked toward the bottom of the map to find the inchesto miles scale and figure out how much farther i needed to go but as my eyes drifted past the names of towns one of them caught my attention rostov it must have been tucked away in my memory all these years amazing suddenly that night came back to me as vividly as if it had happened yesterday i remembered that the roadside toilet had a sign on the door property of rostov county i remembered coming out of the toilet and seeing what was in the darkness past the fence i remembered how angry my father got when he didnt understand what i was talking about and threw me into the car i could feel the tears in my eyes and how i wiped them and stared through the back window to ward the darkness until i couldnt see anything out there anymore as we drove away we drove so long that eventually i fell asleep in the back seat even then i dreamed about them there someone at the fence exclaimed pointing so i finished my coffee and folded the map and got in the car tori said when i reached esperanza instead of stopping for the night i kept driving but i didnt turn east on interstate to go to san antonio instead i took a county road and kept following it southeast along the border the sun went down but i kept driving until i got here this observation platform didnt exist back thenthere were just the toilets i was afraid id discover that my memory had tricked me that what id seen that night had been only a damned fool kids imagination exactly as my father had insisted theres another one someone exclaimed tori smiled toward where a man pointed and she fell silent again in a while she continued it was late hardly anybody was around i cant describe the relief i felt when i stepped out of the car and looked past that fence and saw that what id rememberedand what i realize now ive been dreaming about all these yearswas real i came over and sat on this bench in the same spot where im sitting now and the same spot where i sat last night and i didnt want to do anything but stay here the rest of the night and look at what id seen when i was ten my life might have been so much different if my father had just allowed me to watch a little longer different page asked how tori didnt answer that sent a chill through him that had nothing to do with the night air watch as long as you want page said i will i didnt come here to stop you he tried to assure her i know besides you cant page looked over at costigan who continued to lean protectively against the nearby post he spread his hands as if to say are you starting to get the idea but page didnt get anything not anything at all he was mystified and afraid he worried that tori was having some kind of breakdown if so he realized looking around silently apparently a lot of other people were having the same breakdown tori she continued smiling wistfully toward the darkness i love you he said the words came out before he realized he couldnt remember the last time hed said them he didnt get a reaction tori tell me what youre seeing help me see it too i dont think you can she said but how do you know for the same reason i left the stark acknowledgment of what page had been dreading made him feel as if a fist had struck his stomach he remained silent for several long minutes trying to recover his equilibrium trying to think of something he could say that would make things better if you teach me i can learn he said whatever it is ive done wrong i can correct it you didnt do anything wrong theres no blame in being what you are or in my being who i am page turned toward the darkness desperate to understand what tori was talking about even though many of the people in the crowd pointed all he saw were the nightshrouded grassland the brilliant stars in the sky and the isolated headlights on the road to the right which of us is crazy he wondered he strained his eyes trying to adjust to the night and decipher the darkness he was reminded of something his father had shown him when he was fifteen because of his fathers skills as a master mechanic in the air force the family had been relocated to numerous bases over the years including some in germany south korea and the philip pines one of those had been macdill air force base in tampa florida on an august sunday pages father had made a rare effort to spend time with his family by taking page and his mother to the famed tampa aquarium they wandered from tank to tank peering through thick glass walls at various exhibits sharks manta rays moray eels his father enjoyed looking at anything dangerousand various schools of brilliantly colored exotic species but the space behind one glass wall appeared empty except for water sand rocks aquatic plants and part of a replica of a sunken ship i guess the aquariums getting ready to stock it with something page said quickly bored turning away no its already stocked his father replied with what nothings moving in there its empty oh theres plenty of life in there you mean the plants no i mean cuttlefish cuttlefish theyre not really fish theyre in the squid family cuttlefish page repeated with tentacles that project forward they can be as little as one of your fingers or as long as your arm sometimes bigger theres no fish in there as long as my arm he scoffed squid his father corrected him okay theres no squid in there as long as my arm actually there are probably a dozen of them youre kidding right his father gestured toward the glass take a look a real close look page had long before learned that his father prided himself on an amazing assortment of knowledge about all kinds of unusual subjects when his father spoke that authoritatively there was only one way the conversation could end so page concentrated on the water in the huge tank sometimes we see only what we expect to see his father explained sometimes we need to learn to see in a new way that made even less sense than the imaginary fish i dont know what you at once one of the rocks seemed to move a little hardly enough to be noticed barely a fraction of an inch but he was certain hed seen it move he stepped closer to the glass ah pages father said apparently detecting his sudden attention i think youre starting to catch on that rock it but its not a rock pages father emphasized the object moved another fraction of an inch and page realized that his father was rightit wasnt a rock page saw a head then and a tentacle and another not that the object moved any more noticeably than before but pages vision had changedor else it was his mind that had shifted focus his father said sometimes we see only what we expect to see he was beginning to understand if the only things that were apparent were sand rocks underwater plants and part of a replica of a sunken ship then the mind took those shapes for granted and didnt bother to recognize what the eyes were seeing amazingly another rock moved a patch of sand shifted slightly as well a section of the sunken ship turned to the side and one of the plants started walking across the bottom of the tank the green spikes on it were actually tentacles years later when page was being trained at the new mexico police academy he thought back to that afternoon when hed realized that there could be a huge difference between what the eyes saw and what was truly before them that the world was not always what it seemed unfortunately he later discovered ugliness too often was the truth of what was before him but not that afternoon excitedly he began counting the creatures he suddenly noticed they were everywhere it seemed one two three four five six his father said seven eight nine his mother joined in laughing that was the summer before she was diagnosed with the breast cancer that would kill her his father predicted that there were a dozen cuttlefish in the tank but in the end page counted eighteen weird uglylooking creatures with a strange name for a squid whod learned to conceal their ugliness and after a while began to seem beautiful within minutes he wasnt able to see the sand rocks underwater plants or replica of the sunken ship because so many cuttlefish were in the way how do they hide like that he asked his father grinning in astonishment nobody knows chameleon lizards are famous for being able to assume the colors of objects around them spiders can do it too but nothings as good at itand as quick at itas cuttlefish magic page said nature pages father corrected him page remembered that longago afternoon as he strained to look at the darkness beyond the fence while the crowd of strangers before him marveled at things he didnt see some complained that they didnt know what the others were getting so excited about and page understood their frustration was he witnessing a mass hallucination some kind of group delusion in which people convinced one another that they were seeing something that wasnt there but tori hadnt been with a group when shed first seen it and she hadnt been with a group when shed come here alone after so many years of remembering and dreaming if there was a delusion shed brought it on herself or maybe im the one whos deluded page thought hell all those years and i couldnt even get my wife to share something so important that it brought her back to the middle of nowhere but he had to stay calm remember the cuttlefish he told himself remember what your father told you sometimes we see only what we expect to see sometimes we need to learn to see in a new way lord knows i need to learn to see in a new way the reality page thought he knew had been turned inside out the marriage hed thought he had the life hed prizednothing was what it had seemed to be why page shouted inwardly how could i not have seen this coming he rose from the bench and stepped to the edge of the observation platform vaguely aware of costigan leaning against the post near him he stared over the heads of the people in the excited crowd and concentrated on the darkness again he noticed the specks of distant headlights approaching along the road from mexico but that couldnt be what the people in the crowd were thrilled about they were pointing in a different direction altogether he studied the brilliant array of stars surprisingly much brighter and more varied than he was accustomed to in santa fe which was renowned for the clearness of its night sky maybe they were why the government had built the radio telescopes nearby but the people in the crowd werent pointing toward the starstheir rapt attention was focused entirely on the horizon what do they think theyre seeing page wanted to know remember the cuttlefish he urged himself he focused on the darkness across the grassland and saw an almost imperceptible movement hardly enough to be noticed except that he was sure he had noticed it either his eyes had shifted focus or his mind had it wasnt only movementit was a change in the darkness without warning there were tiny lights some of what hed thought were stars werent in the skythey were hovering over the grassland at first he suspected they might be distant fireflies about a dozen of them but they were brighter than fireflies and as he began to notice them they increased in size they could have been miles away yet they seemed close as if he could reach out and touch them which he tried to do that was when he realized the people in the crowd werent just pointingthey too were reaching out as he gazed the distant lights acquired colorsred green blue yellow and moreall the tints hed seen on houses and stores in town pairs of them merged becoming larger and brighter they rose and fell at the same time they drifted back and forth across the horizon as if they floated in a gentle current they bobbed and pivoted hypnotically what am i seeing confused page turned toward costigan looking for confirmation that his eyes werent tricking him but all the police chief did was spread his hands again page turned back redirecting his attention to what he sawor thought he sawon the horizon some of the lights drifted apart while others continued to merge they shimmered gentle and soothing almost seeming to beckon ive never seen anything like them he thought what are they without warning doubt surged through him why didnt i see them a minute ago theyve got to be an optical illusion or maybe im so eager to see something out there that i strained my eyes until i saw spots before them or else i concentrated until i imagined them how do i know theyre what tori seesor thinks she does what do the others think theyre seeing not only seeing he realized there was something else associated with the lights something he couldnt quite identify it was just on the edge of his perceptions a sound that hovered at the limit of his ability to hear it as page stepped off the platform intending to approach and question a teenaged girl who pointed in delight at the grassland beyond the fence he became aware of a commotion somewhere in the crowd a single voice rose above the others dont you see how evil they are someone demanded page stopped and tried to determine the direction of the voice it was deep strong and angry it belonged to a man dont you realize what theyre doing to you to his right page saw sudden movement people being jostled aside a tall heavy man sweeping through them stop pushing someone complained get your hand off me someone else objected the voice just sounded angrier dont you understand that youre all going to hell a gun a woman wailed my god he has a gun as the word sent a wave of alarm through the crowd page responded instantly and crouched reaching for the pistol that he almost always carried he realized with dismay that hed let costigan talk him into leaving it in his suitcase back in the rental car which was parked outside the courthouse his palms became sweaty crouching lower feeling his pulse race he scanned the panicking crowd and flinched at the loud eartorturing crack of a rifle he saw the muzzle flash among fleeing men and women revealing what looked like the barrel of an assault weapon crack the man fired again aiming beyond the fence the muzzle flash projected toward the horizon toward whatever was out there toward whatever page had thought hed seen go back to hell where you came from the man shouted into the distance and he kept firing page saw enough of the rifles silhouette to identify a curved ammunition magazine projecting from the bottom the profile was that of an ak urgently he glanced behind him toward costigan seeing that the police chief had drawn his pistol and was crouching tensely just as page was the chaos of the crowd now shielded the man with the rifle and for a moment he was lost from sight crack another muzzle flash projected toward the darkness youre all damned but the gunman was no longer yelling toward whatever had entranced them instead he turned and began yelling at the crowd page had the sickening realization of what was about to happen no the man fired directly into the crowd people screamed and smashed against one another desperate to escape a man tripped a woman wailed then page realized that the man hadnt tripped a bullet had dropped him the gunman fired yet again page had seldom felt so helpless even if hed had his pistol the darkness and the commotion would have prevented him from get ting a shot at the man with the rifle crack a woman fell crack a teenaged boy toppled the crowds frightened shouts became so loud that page almost couldnt hear the rifle he saw the barrel swing in his direction tori he thought desperately pivoting he ran toward the observation platform costigan was no longer in sight but page didnt have time to figure out what the police chief was doing tori she was on her feet so overwhelmed that she didnt have the presence of mind to react page had taught her about firearms and had asked her to keep a handgun in her purse hed worried about her taking clients out to remote locations where shed be alone with them but tori never carried the gun hed given her the truth was although she was a police officers wife her attitudes were those of a civilian he put an arm around her and gripped her tightly rushing her off the platform behind him a bullet hit a board in the back wall when she cried out in alarm he pushed her head down making her stoop as he rushed her around the corner this was the side opposite from where costigan had parked the police car but page was relieved to see that vehicles were parked here as well and he tugged her behind a murky pickup truck are you okay he asked examining her as best he could in the starlight she was too disoriented to answer a shot echoed from beyond the observation platform tori answer me are you hurt his abrupt tone made her flinch bringing her to awareness i no im okay im not hit thank god stay here keep behind the engine bullets can go through the trucks doors but not through the engine if you think the shooters coming in this direction fall down and pretend youre dead in the shadows she stared at him tori tell me you understand beyond the observation deck two shots were followed by a scream she blinked repeatedly keep behind the engine she said swallowing if he comes this way im supposed to fall down and pretend im dead crack the gunman fired again i cant stay with you page said i need to help stop him why is he doing this i dont know why people do anything the next shot page heard was a loud pop rather than a crack a pistol costigan must be returning fire he decided he squeezed toris shoulder and ran from the cover of the pickup truck at once he heard another pistol shot then a rifle shot and a groan its raspy edge left no doubt that it came from costigan the turmoil of his heartbeat contrasted with the slowness he forced upon himself when he reached the corner of the wall his hands trembled he fought to control them the wooden planks of the wall couldnt protect him from an aks highpowered bullet but at least they concealed him as he crouched beneath the shooters eye level and peered around the corner the faint light from the opposite side of the observation platform showed him a nightmare bodies lay all around some twitched but most remained still the shooter stalked among them came from hell he fired down at a head his rifles muzzle flash casting him in a grotesque silhouette going back to hell wheres costigan page wondered frantically he inhaled sharply when he saw the police chiefs body sprawled on the ground halfway between the observation platform and the crowd costigans pistol lay near his outstretched right hand the gunman fired at a twitching body the muzzle flash revealing a spray of blood he dropped an empty magazine and inserted a fresh one so quickly that page didnt have the chance even to think about charging across the parking lot and tackling him the man aimed down about to shoot at another squirming body but suddenly stopped and lowered the rifle he turned as if something had caught his attention page followed the direction of his gaze what the shooter looked at was conspicuous even in the dark it was white so big that it couldnt be ignored inside it people whimpered and wailed the tour bus my god page realized before he started shooting some of the passengers went back to their seats the gunman walked toward it with his back to page he faced the dark windows of the bus he stood straighter as if energized and took long steps over bodies approaching his new target as he rounded the front disappearing toward the door page was tempted to hurry from the side of the observation platform wanting desperately to reach costigans pistol but the sound of his footsteps on the gravel would almost certainly attract attention there was little chance that he could reach the pistol before the gunman heard him coming and reappeared shooting a fist banged against the opposite side of the bus open the door the gunman demanded page backed along the sidewall of the observation platform and headed toward the dark road open the damned door page got to the road and hurried along it his sneakers hushed on the pavement shots clanged through metal the gunman was firing into the side of the bus the aks bullets were capable of penetrating the metal passing straight through and going out the other side a human body would barely slow them after the next shot into the side of the bus someone screamed page reduced speed as he came along the road and neared the back of the bus the next shot was followed by a cry of pain bullets shattered windows the sound of terrified wailing intensified page was troubled by another sound he began to hear that of liquid spilling onto the gravel came from hell the man screamed the smell of gasoline drifted into pages nostrils going back there pages training had taught him that only in the movies did a shot to a vehicles fuel tank cause a fire let alone an explosion this guy could shoot at the buss fuel tank all night but unless he had incendiary ammunition the only effect would be a lot of holes and more leaking fuel the gasoline fumes smelled stronger he moved warily hoping the darkness behind him would conceal his outline peering around the back of the bus he saw the gunman who was so intent on shooting at the gas tank that he didnt notice anything else he stepped back from a pool of gasoline that was spreading on the gravel oh godsurely he isnt the man set down his rifle and pulled a book of matches from a shirt pocket page charged the man tore a match from the book and struck it along the abrasive strip the match flared then he heard page coming and turned the light from the match cast shadows up his face exaggerating its harsh angles his eyes reflected the flame emphasizing their intensity he lit the entire book page ran faster yelling obscenities as fiercely as he could trying to startle the man to distract him from what he intended to do the shooter dropped the burning matches an instant before page crashed into him as they hit the gravel page could only pray that they would go out but instantly he heard a whoosh behind him flames dispelled the darkness heat rushed over his back outraged he slammed the mans head against the gravel hair and bone crunched against the stones but the man simply roared and swung his arm with such force that he cast page aside even given the mans height and muscular build his strength was amazing he had to be on some kind of psychosisinducing drug the flames roared upward enveloping the rear of the bus page squirmed backward to escape them snap snap snap the heat broke windows the wails of the people trapped inside became hysterical seeing the gunman reach for his rifle page came to his feet and charged again the impact of striking him was so great that it sent both of them farther from the bus they hit the gravel and skidded landing on top page tried to drive a fist into his opponents larynx but the man abruptly twisted and page connected only with the side of his neck the man swung his arm again and struck pages shoulder so hard that he knocked page off him the blow jolted page almost to the point of paralyzing him groaning he stuck out a foot and tripped the man as he ran to ward his rifle the man landed heavily grunting loudly the flames spread along the bus their heat radiating toward pages face open the door get off the bus he yelled to the people inside he grabbed the gunman from behind and clamped his left arm around the mans neck straining to choke him simultaneously he drove his right fist into the mans right kidney punching him again and again the man lurched backward ramming page against a car behind him as he groaned from the impact the man twisted away from the car and deliberately fell back page groaned again when he struck the gravel he felt crushed by the mans considerable weight landing on him he couldnt breathe his arm loosened around the mans neck in a rush the man came to his feet kicked page in the right side and lunged again for his rifle all the while the flames roared upward from the rear of the bus and spread toward the front page felt the heat through his shirt pumped by adrenaline he forced himself to his feet the man picked up the rifle page charged struck the man from behind and propelled him into the flames the fire was so thick that page couldnt see the rear of the bus but he heard a thump when the man struck it the mans clothes caught fire his hair blazed turning he seemed to smileor maybe it was the effect the flames had on his facial muscles the rifle fell from his burning hands he held out his arms and stepped forward page stumbled away from him ablaze the man kept lurching toward him his flaming arms out stretched his mouth spread in a grotesque smile page jolted back against a car he squirmed along it trying to get away from the fiery nightmare that kept stalking toward him the mans smile wasnt defined any longer as flesh shrank away from his teeth he was terribly close and the smell of his burning flesh was sickening about to give page a fiery embrace he abruptly twisted to the side the sound of a shot was almost absorbed by the roar of the flames a second shot made him stagger his face tilted skyward for the first time showing anguish a third and fourth shot dropped him to his knees a fifth shot blew a hole through his head the man dropped face down embracing the gravel his broiling flesh spreading across it page staggered away from him staring toward his left the shooter was tori she held costigans pistol with two hands her arms ex tended her wrists and elbows locked the way page had taught her her face was twisted with fury she squeezed the trigger again shooting into the flames that covered the man bastard she screamed bastard the door to the bus banged open a halfdozen people surged out from the smoke they sobbed and coughed running toward the cold darkness and away from the bus which was little more than a flaming coffin now page hurried around the car and approached tori from the back as heat swept over them she shot again toward the flames that consumed the man now youre the one whos going to hell she screamed tori page said he came up next to her reaching for the gun its okay now he cant hurt anybody anymore give me the pistol she fired again at the burning corpses back you son of a bitch hes dead page told her you dont need the gun anymore he put his right hand on the pistol and pressed it down encouraging her to lower her arms give it to me gradually the tension in her hands relaxed slowly she released the weapon pages cheeks felt raw from the heat he guided her in a wide arc around the front of the bus away from the fire as the air became darker it cooled his skin the people whod escaped from the bus slumped near the fence sobbing bodies lay everywhere he counted twenty but knew there were more a few squirmed in pain most had the stillness of death tori dont look he guided her to the saturn where he hoped shed feel sheltered but the car was locked and when he felt the front pockets of toris jeans he didnt find the keys they must be in her purse he thought he led her to the bench on the observation platform he looked around but couldnt find the purse in the darkness after sitting her down he promised ill be right back he ran to costigan the chiefs cowboy hat lay beside him the left side of his head was covered with blood page touched his wrist and felt a pulse hang on he told him he found the car keys in costigans pants and ran to the cruiser pressing the unlock button on the key fob inside he grabbed the radios microphone officer down officer down whos this a mans angry voice demanded howd you get on this radio officer down page had trouble keeping his voice steady enough to identify himself and describe what had happened i was with the chief hes been shot what at least twenty other people were hit at the observation platform outside town a bus is on fire and as he supplied more details the enormity of what had happened struck him the assailants dead but we need all the help you can bring if this is a joke look at the horizon east of town you ought to be able to see the glow of the fire just a the pause was suddenly broken holy ill get help as quick as i can page sat numbly in the cruiser and stared toward the devastation that lay beyond the windshield the light from the flames rippled over the bodies his side aching he got out of the car and stepped around pools of blood approaching the people whod escaped the burning bus helps on the way he promised them thank you a woman told him through her tears thank you for saving us i was sure i was going to die a man said trembling never been so scared why did he do it someone demanded why amid the roar of the flames page noticed that more survivors were warily emerging from their hiding places some had crawled under vehicles others had run across the road and concealed them selves in the darkness of a neighboring field an elderly man wavered among the corpses smoke drifted over him wheres beth wheres the old man stopped and groaned grief made him sink to his knees he cradled the head of one of the bodies heartsick page went back to the observation platform tori no longer stared toward the grassland instead she bent despairingly forward her face in her hands she shivered page noticed the windbreaker on the bench he got it and draped it over her shoulders he finally saw her purse on the floor where she must have dropped it when the shooting had started he placed it next to her numb he sat beside her put an arm around her and listened to the blare of the approaching sirens two the darkling plain brent loft gave his most amused sympathetic look to the camera saying near arroyo park a tearful tenyearold girl waved for a police car to stop and pointed to where her cat had climbed to the top of a highvoltage utility pole workers from el paso electric arrived with a crane and very carefully rescued the feline which as you can see was more afraid of being rescued than of staying on top of the pole the thick insulated gloves of the man on the crane protected him from more than just the electrical lines next to loft his coanchor sharon rivera chuckled and read the next paragraph on the teleprompter the girl and her pet were finally reunited but apparently this isnt the only time the cat has been rescued last month two city workers had to free it from a storm drain seven more lives to go brent said trying not to gag on the line he turned toward the man on his left frank whats the final weather recap tomorrowll be another hot sunny day with a chance of thunder storms during the night we can always use the rain sharon said sure can brent agreed well thats it for el pasos firstonthe scene news at be sure to watch our morning report from to well see you tomorrow night at and thanks for joining us with big smiles they listened to their programs pulsing theme music the red lights on the cameras stopped glowing the harsh overhead lights dimmed like the other newscasters brent took off his lapel microphone and removed the earbud radio receiver through which the shows producer could give him instructions to cut an item add a late breaking story or make a joke sharons earbud got caught in her voluminous hair i hate reports about rescued pets brent complained yeah but people like to go to sleep with a cozy feeling sports re porter tom montoya said as he stood from behind his desk tom wore a jacket and tie for the camera but what viewers at home couldnt see was thathidden by the deskthe rest of his ensemble consisted of shorts sweat socks and sneakers hed played basketball between the and newscasts barely returning to the station in time to refresh his makeup sharon wore an elegant navy blazer and a paleblue blouse the tightness of which accentuated her breasts when she stood from the news desk her mismatched jeans became visible because she had chronic sore feet she didnt wear shoes her socks were thick wool because her feet were sensitive to the cold that came off the studios concrete floor in contrast brent wore a full suit an expensive calfskin belt and de signer shoes that he always buffed before he went on the air the shoes were the most important featurehe felt that their shine radiated upward and added to the substance of his delivery from bottom to top everything counted he would no more go on the air with scuffed shoes than he would with hair that wasnt carefully blowdried but it had taken all his skill to sound sincere when hed read that item about the damned cat the next time the producer wanted a cute story brent promised himself hed make sharon read all of it want to go out for a drink he asked her brent how many times do i need to tell you im dating someone hey it never hurts to ask if youre serious about this guy why dont you bring him around sometime so we can see what he looks like he she looked at him strangely very funny brent said youve been working here three months and no one told you i was gay yeah right quit kidding around what makes you think im kidding okay okay i can take a joke at that moment the producer entered the studio rescuing him from sharons ridiculous act brent i need to talk to you brent didnt like his tone somethings going to hit the fan he predicted he had risen through the broadcast markets from a small television station in oklahoma to a modestsized one in kansas to this bigger one in el paso every newscasters goal was to work for the premium cable news channelslike cnn or foxor the network stations in los angeles chicago washington and new york better yet at the topto go national on the evening news at abc nbc or cbs brent had rocketed through the lowerlevel stations but he was forced to admit that he hadnt gained the momentum he needed to get out of el paso a year from now as hed planned for one thing he hadnt managed to bond with the rest of the news team perhaps they sensed his determination not to stay in the area any longer than necessary as a consequence he hadnt been given any careeradvancing stories also he had the sense that the news director regretted hiring him presumably hed decided that brent looked a little too white bread for this market shit hell probably come down on me for the way i read that piece about the damned cat sharon i need to see you also the producer said a somber expression on his face he looked down at his tennis shoes as if he wanted to avoid eye contact listen i can explain about the cat story brent said the producer peered up looking distracted what are you talking about sharon padded across the concrete floor on her thick socks has something happened theres been a mass shooting the producers somber expression was replaced with a look of grim resolve what outside a town called rostov thats about two hundred miles southeast of here our contact with the highway patrol says as many as twenty people were hit most of them fatally it happened at some kind of roadside tourist attraction they have down there brent stepped closer even in todays weird world a mass shooting with five or six victims was news but twenty who did it sharon asked the gunman hasnt been identified apparently a woman on the scene shot and killed him a woman the storys sounding better by the minute brent thought the details are still coming in but i dont want our viewers to get all their information about it from cnn or fox this is a west texas story we call ourselves firstonthescene and by god well prove it sharon go back on the air for breaking news our contact with the highway patrol agreed to an onair telephone interview brent the choppers waiting for you fly to rostov immediately find out whats happening hopefully youll be up to speed when sharon and the broadcast truck reach there in the morning as sharon hurried toward the news desk the producer called after her sharon at rostov youll give live updates throughout the day tomorrow evening youll anchor the show with a view of the place where the shootings occurred thisll be a special broadcast and well make a big deal about it squeeze in as much rest as you can i dont want you looking tired so sharon and i will be coanchoring there brent asked already imagining how impressive that would look on his resume no sharons the anchor youll contribute background if you do research all night and all day tomorrow by the time the broadcast starts tomorrow evening youll look like something the cat dragged in the producer seemed to emphasize the word cat but brent hoped it was just his imagination now hurry out to the chopper but i need to go home and get some fresh clothes brent said this suitll be a mess by tomorrow you dont have time i want you on the ground before those damned cnn reporters show up with that the producer turned to ward the three camera operators who wants some serious overtime i do a woman said the brakes on my car need replacing when she stepped from behind the equipment brent recognized the cute hispanic camerawoman whod recently joined the staff her name was anita something in her early twenties she was short and trim with shiny dark hair pulled back in a ponytail she wore hiking boots and pants that had twice the usual number of pockets her shirt had ample pockets as well grab a camera and take one of the vans the producer responded start for rostov right away this time of night you can probably reach there in two and a half hours less anita said confidently whateveri dont care how many speeding tickets you get just dont crash the van by the time brents done getting overhead shots of the crime scene and providing commentary youll need to be close to the area wait brent said you want me to operate the choppers camera too the producer ignored him and kept talking to anita theres a good possibility the bodies wont have been removed yet after the chopper sets brent down you and he will start interviewing the police and any witnesses you can find brent i told you to get moving if we cover this from enough angles maybe cnn wont bother sending their people maybe theyll pay to have sharon supply live updates our competition wont stand a chance in the ratings the eerie music drifted and dipped hovered and sailed coming from instruments halloway still couldnt identify the languid sensuous melody settled into a lower register he imagined that he was slow dancing with the most beautiful woman hed ever met he smelled cinnamon in her hair and tasted orange juice and vodka by now there were seven people in the room halloway and his partner taggard another pair of guards whod kept leaving the surveilance room to listen to the music and the researchergordon whod been joined by two others transported by the sounds no one spoke halloway imagined the woman he danced with pressing against him she breathed softly into his ear abruptly the music became silent the woman disappeared hey what happened halloway demanded static came from the speakers harsh crackly loud and aggravating gordon what did you do he exclaimed wheres the music but gordon looked as surprisedand annoyedas everyone else i didnt do anything he protested holding up his hands as if that would prove it then what happened why did the music stop a researcher pressed buttons and twisted knobs on several of the consoles maybe we have a phasing problem he offered the statics brittle echo rebounded off the walls phasing my ass halloway clamped his hands to his ears damn it that hurts do something another researcher flicked a switch disengaging the speakers the static all but disappeared coming only from headphones on a desk when gordon put them on halloway couldnt hear the static at all what he did hear though was the hum of the many electronic devices that were crammed into the roomand the deeper vibration almost undetectable that the facilitys electrical generator or the huge dishes aboveground sent through the walls the music had distracted him from his increasing headache but now the pain intensified through his skull where did it come from the researchers gave each other guarded looks as if hiding something bring it back we dont know how we received it in the first place gordon explained too quickly let alone how to find it again just bring it back halloway demanded youre not even supposed to be in here gordon realized now that the music no longer occupied his attention this areas strictly offlimits you belong in the surveillance room like hell my jobs to protect this place i can go anywhere i want well how about protecting it by checking the security monitors while youve been hanging around in here a terrorist assault team might have surrounded us buddy if you hear that music again and you dont let me know halloway silently vowed terrorists will be the least of your worries dozens of emergency lights flashed in the darkness their chaos of orange blue and white contrasted starkly with the shimmering colors page had thought hed seen earlier an engine rumbled as firefighters sprayed foam on what was left of the burning bus eight highway patrol cars were parked next to three police cars from rostov law enforcement officers and medical personnel seemed everywhere page heard the wail of a departing ambulance and the roar of a medevac helicopter as it rose from a nearby field its takeoff lights painfully intense from his vantage point a short distance down the road he watched a patrolman interviewing tori in her car next to the viewing platform page had already spoken to several officers and took for granted that theyd have more questions right now he was grateful for the chance to step back from the commotion and try to adjust to the trauma of what had happened he found himself next to a metal pole that had a large brass rectangle attached to the top words were embossed on the rectangle the harsh reflection from the emergency vehicles provided just enough illumination for him to be able to read welcome to the rostov lights many people have claimed to see them but no one has ever been able to explain them if youre lucky enough to experience them decide for yourself what they are footsteps approached page turned from the plaque and saw a silhoette of a man in a cowboy hat as the figure came nearer he recognized a highway patrol captain hed spoken with earlier the hispanic man had a broad face with prominent cheek and jaw bones the emergency lights revealed his blue tie and tan uniform his last name was medrano we finished interviewing your wife he announced you can take her back to where youre staying page didnt comment on the complexities that lay behind that statement youre done with me too for now all the survivors tell the same story the guy went crazy if not for you and your wife a lot more people would have been killed you still dont have any idea why he did it medrano looked as if he desperately wanted something that would explain what had happened only that he said the lights were evil the lights the way you talk about them you saw them too it took some effort but yeah at least i saw something the captain looked puzzled i live in harrington about a hundred miles down the road its a big town because of the oil refinery but theres not a lot to do whenever my wifes parents or my brother and his family came to visit we used to drive here to try to see the lights i bet i made that trip a dozen times never saw a thing neither did my wifes parents or my brother and his family even though strangers standing right next to us claimed they could we finally gave up and stopped coming whatd they look like they seemed miles away yet i thought they were so close i tried to reach out and touch them they bobbed and floated merged and separated and came together again they kept changing colors once i saw them i had trouble turning away from them medrano nodded thats usually the way theyre described the thing is im beginning to wonder if i just persuaded myself they were out there it was like mass hysteria and i might have just been caught up in it yeah thats one explanationthat people talk each other into seeing them one explanation what are the others phosphorescent gas that rises from seams in the earth another theory suggests that the underground rocks here have a lot of quartz crystals in them after the heat of the day the rapid cooling causes the rocks to contract and give off static electricity page looked past medrano toward the emergency lights the smoke rising from the shell of the busand the corpses all those people died because of static electricity he shook his head if so that makes it even more senseless your wife says the killer shouted to the crowd dont you realize what theyre doing to you he meant the lights then he started shooting at the horizon he yelled go back to hell where you came from then youre all damned i thought he meant the lights again but it turned out he meant that the crowd was damned because the next thing he opened fire on everyone around him some kind of religious lunatic medrano suggested he sure had a fixation on hell came from hell going back to hell he said that a couple of times while he was shooting people well the fire that burned him gave him a taste of where he was going medrano said that thought occurred to me too do you know who he was not yetany id he had on him was destroyed by process of elimination well figure out which car he used and track its registration number unless he came on the bus with an ak that nobody noticed he could have carried it in something like a guitar case page offered yeah thats possible you know you do think like a cop well if the shooter arrived on the bus any evidence was probably destroyed by the fire thatll make our job a lot more difficult page shivered perhaps because of the cool breeze or perhaps be cause he looked toward the corpses again you could use a windbreaker medrano said chief costigan told me the same thing any word about how hes doing an ambulance driver phoned me from the rostov hospital hes in surgery what about you how are you holding up page rubbed his right side where the gunman had kicked him im not looking forward to seeing the bruise thats not what i meant i know theres a lot to sort through for now im just glad to be alive ever been involved in a shooting before once but nobody died for certain my wife was never in a shooting before if it hadnt been for her the guy might have reached me she did an amazing thing we collected six spent pistol cartridges actually she fired eight times page said and yet she only remembers pulling the triggerfour times if you and your wife worked for me tomorrow morning youd be talking to a counselor but theres not much i can do to help outsiders i understand thanks for your concern medrano turned toward the western sky where the roar of a helicopter was rapidly approaching good another medevac chopper ill drive my wife back to the motel the emergency lights revealed toris silhouette in the front seat of her saturn as page headed in that direction he heard the helicopter getting louder its lights suddenly blazed but instead of landing in a nearby field it hovered over the crime scenenot close enough to the ground to kick up dust or blow objects around and interfere with the investigation but carefully maintaining a legal altitude what the hells going on medrano wondered but page had already figured it out managing to detect four huge letters on the choppers side medrano shook his fist at the sky thats a damned tv news chopper for a couple of seconds brent glimpsed the lights of a town below him then the helicopter roared over it and all he saw was darkness again at once a cluster of flashing lights appeared ahead a lot of flashing lights through headphones he heard the pilots voice there it is smoke rose from a burnedout shell of a bus firefighters police officers and medical personnel swarmed everywhere he looked do you see any bodies on the ground brent asked the pilot yes there body bags covered human shapes on a gravel parking lot brent counted twelve others were being placed in ambulances his news producer was waiting back at the station at the other end of a twoway radio brent flicked a switch and spoke into his microphone i made it here in time theyre just starting to remove the bodies any other news choppers none good you know what to do did you find the background material i asked for brent asked you didnt give me a chance to do any research i need to know about this town theres not much the producers voice said through the earphones not much is better than nothing wikipedia has a small item seems the towns main claim to fame is that it was the location for the james deacon movie birthright it was released on dvd last month i watched it brent said well i dont know how thats going to help you rostov what kind of name is that sounds foreign russian the producers voice answered the railroad that was built there in was owned by a husband and wife who stopped in the area when the place was only a waterrefilling station the wife happened to be reading a translation of tolstoys war and peace one of the characters is count rostov so thats the name she gave to the place if you want to put our viewers to sleep go ahead and mention that also theres an abandoned military basejust a ruin really where they used to train bomber pilots there are so many unexploded bombs that they had to fence off the area and post warning signs but there hasnt been an incident in years anything else nothing except what page asked i need anything youve got theres something about lights lights it calls them and i quote the mysterious rostov lights what the hell are those all it says is colored balls of light in a field along with the old movie set from birthright theyre the big local attraction any bets the good citizens of rostov go out in the field and wave colored flash lights around to attract gullible tourists but how youre going to use any of that is beyond me youll be surprised get ready the pilot had told brent how to work the camera that was mounted on the choppers nose now he maneuvered controls that allowed him to aim the exterior lens wherever he wanted and zoom in on any detail transmitting in five four three two one now he said a cockpit monitor showed the images he sent to the station the flashing lights the emergency vehicles the police the firefighters the medical team and the bodies if that jerkoff thinks im going to play nice and let sharon have most of the airtime hes out of his mind ill give him stuff thats so much better than she can do hell be forced to put me on camera more than her ive got a feeling this story is big enough to take me to atlanta he let the scene achieve its impact then gathered his thoughts around the meager information the producer had given him this is brent loft reporting from the firstonthescene news chopper the carnage below me might be mistaken for the aftermath of an attack in a war zone but this isnt afghanistan or iraq its peaceful west texas cattle country near the sleepy town of rostov that name comes from a character in tolstoys war and peacebut peace is exactly what rostov doesnt have tonight the senseless gun fire that broke out at this scenic vista two and a half hours ago left at least twenty people dead and prompts the question is any place truly safe anymore below a vehicle backed away from the police cars ambulances and a fire truck brent aimed the camera toward it hoping it was an emergency vehicle whose roof lights would suddenly come to life as it raced toward town but he quickly realized that the vehicle was a civilian suv so he redirected the camera toward the firefighters spraying foam on the smoking shell of the bus a half century ago not far from here james deacon starred in the classic film birthright about a lifelong bitter feud between a wildcat oil driller and a prominent texas cattle family its a gripping saga about how the old west became the new west but even in the lawlessness of the old west the unspeakable massacre that occurred here tonight would have been unimaginable the new west as it turns out is far more violent than the old early reports indicate that the asyetunidentified killer was shot by someone on the scene one of the innocent bystanders he was trying to slaughter if so his motive for this shocking outrage might remain as elusive and unexplained as the mysterious rostov lights that draw tourists to this area hearing the roar of the chopper above him page drove toris saturn away from the turmoil of the crime scene as he left the flashing emergency lights behind he peered over at his wife troubled by the way she stared straight ahead toward the darkness of the narrow road beyond the cars headlights her face was tight she looked dazed you didnt have a choice he told her he kept remembering her frenzied shouts as she repeatedly pulled the trigger even after the gunman had stopped moving you did the right thing never forget that tori might have nodded slightly but perhaps it was only the motion of the car imagine the alternative page said if hed grabbed me i might have been burned to death those people on the bus would have burned to death as well maybe i shot him once to save you tori murmured her lips barely moved as she continued staring ahead he had to concentrate to decipher what she told him and maybe i shot him a second time to save those other people she drew a breath her features more stark but i shot him the other times so many page waited because he made the lights go away he ruined the night the son of a bitch the interior of the car became tensely silent when they reached the motel a neon sign said no vacancy page stopped in front of unit and recognized one of the cars farther along the audi belonged to the mother and father whod brought their children to the observation area and then had become impatient wanting to move on or at least the mother and the children had wanted to move on page remembered how defeated the father had sounded your wife and kids saved your life he thought in the harshly lit parking lot he helped tori from the saturn took the motel key from her purse and unlocked the room the place smelled old and musty he switched on the overhead light and saw that the room had two beds just as well he thought when he secured the deadbolt on the door the noise made her turn to him page was afraid she was going to say i dont want you here but instead she told him numbly im going to take a shower she opened a suitcase removed boxer shorts and a tshirther usual pajamasand went into the bathroom she locked it feeling empty page studied each bed and noticed that one had books on the table next to it choosing the other he lay on a thin blanket and listened to the sound of the shower he smelled smoke on his denim shirt and felt a spreading pain where hed been kicked in the side the memory of the gunmans blazing arms reaching out to embrace him made him grimace when tori came out of the bathroom she wore the boxer shorts and loose tshirt her toweldried hair was combed back darker red than usual because it was damp she went to the door shut off the light and crawled beneath the covers on the other bed the scent of soap and shampoo drifted from the bathroom good night page said he lay in the darkness waiting for her to reply good night she finally told him her voice so muted he barely heard her when page had learned to fly his dreams had been filled with the sensation of floating as if he were in the air on a gentle current drifting over forests and fields the plane was as silent as a glider he hovered he turned he sailed along the smooth air now he had a version of that dream but he wasnt above forests and fields he was in blackness suspended in a void settling then rising drifting to the left pausing then floating to the right as if on invisible waves the way hed seen the lights moving when he wakened he felt groggy he gradually opened his eyes and waited for his troubling memories to anchor him daylight streamed past the corners of the cheap drapes he looked toward the other bed and saw that it was empty its covers piled to the side immediately he sat up realizing that he still wore his smokesmelling jeans and denim shirt from the night before he hadnt even taken off his sneakers his side ached worse tori the bathroom door was open he looked inside but she wasnt there he hurried to the main door and pulled it open relieved to see toris car the sun hurt his eyes a glance at his watch showed him that the time was almost a quarter after three he recalled checking his watch when hed driven tori back to the motel the time had been a little after one my god i slept more than twelve hours tori stiff from the pain in his side he ran through the afternoon heat to the motel office inside the same gangly young clerk was behind the desk did you see my wife go past she walked down the road toward the rib palace a half hour ago he gave page a vaguely accusing look like chief costigan told me i saved a room for you last night couldve used it when all that trouble happened lots of people coming to town ill pay for not using it give it to someone else now i already did after checkout time a reporters got it now reporter theres a ton of them the clerk pointed toward the television next to the softdrink ma chine in a corner of the lobby on the screen a handsome man in a rumpled suit held a microphone and looked intently at the camera his tie was loose and his top shirt button open his blond hair was in disarray he had whisker shadow and his face was drawn with fatigue a crowd was gathered behind him police officers motioned for people to stay behind barricades beyond a cluster of police cars the observation platform was visible keep back this is still a crime scene a policeman warned speaking loudly enough for his voice to carry to the microphone meanwhile the television reporter addressed his viewers as you see from the commotion in the background events are unfolding swiftly since firstonthescene news started broadcasting images of the massacres aftermath early this morning the eyes of the entire nation have been directed to this quiet texas town the gunmans motive appears to have been a religious fixation on the mysterious rostov lights that attracted the victims here last night you came from hell now go back to hell witnesses report him shouting before he turned his rifle on them the bizarre circumstances of his rampage prompted many people to start their weekend early and come here to satisfy their curiosity about the unexplained lights that ignited the killers frenzy those lights have been seen in this area for as long as anyone can re member tonight during our special live broadcast at ill do my best to show them to you and explain what they are before then sharon rivera and i will coanchor expanded editions of our and oclock broadcasts the bystander who shot the killer was a woman the police havent released her identity but ill do everything i can to find out who she is and be the first to talk to her this is brent loft ill see you at shit page said he looked out the window the previous evening the road in front of the motel had been almost deserted now a stream of vehicles went past heading to the right in the direction of the observation platform page realized that toris car keys were still in his jeans he rushed from the office got into the saturn and waited for a break in traffic that allowed him to go in the opposite direction into town that side of the road was deserted the previous evening the rib palaces parking lot had been only half full but now it was crammed with vehicles few of which were pickup trucks a lot of the cars had rentalcompany envelopes on the dashboards police cruisers were bunched together at one end page hurried inside where a wave of noisy conversation swept over him after scanning the animated people at tables and in booths he caught a glimpse of red hair on his left and noticed tori sitting at the counter drinking coffee an empty plate was in front of her all the seats were taken but she was at the counters end so he was able to go over and stand next to her she glanced in his direction but didnt say anything he couldnt tell if she looked troubled because of last night or because he stood next to her are you okay he kept his voice low you have my car keys last night i put them in my jeans by mistake sorry he gave them to her you were sleeping so hard i didnt want to wake you by searching through your pockets tori said it wouldve been okay i wouldnt have minded being wakened we need to talk yes tori reached in her purse and put money on a check that the waiter had left the smell of hamburgers and french fries filled the air reminding page that the last meal hed eaten had been the night before but food was the last thing he cared about as he followed her outside wheres my car she asked in the parking lot over there the second row more vehicles drove past heading in the direction of the observation platform when tori got behind the steering wheel page took the passenger seat assuming they would sit in the parking lot while he did his best to get her to explain why shed left him instead she started the car and steered toward the road she found a gap in traffic and joined the vehicles going toward the observation platform she didnt say a word please page said help me understand i have breast cancer tori replied page suddenly felt cold in shock he managed to ask how bad im having surgery this coming tuesday in san antonio san antonio my santa fe oncologist set it up the plan is to rest at my mothers house but i couldnt bring myself to tell her over the phone i wanted to do it in person pages balance tilted dizzily why didnt you tell me how long have you known the biopsy results came back a week ago you had a biopsy page asked i had no idea in my oncologists office i didnt need to go to the hospitalshe did it with a hypodermic after you left for the airport on tuesday she called to tell me when the surgery was scheduled so you just packed your bags and left page couldnt adjust to his bewilderment why didnt you talk to me about it you know ill give you all the support you need tori drove slowly held back by the line of cars after a few minutes she spoke again my doctor thinks we found the cancer in time she thinks surgery combined with radiation will get rid of it under the circumstances thats the best news you could have i didnt tell you about it because tori drew a breath because im tired of feeling alone alone page felt something in him plummet i dont understand we live in the same house but im not sure we live together when you come home from work i ask how your shift went and you recite a list of crimes that you investigated thats how my shifts usually go its the way you tell me cold and flat as if your shift happened to somebody else and youre disgusted with the world dealing with terrible things day after day has that effect as often as not after work you go to a bar and drink with other cops do you talk with them about the crimes you investigated its not like group therapy or anything we just drink a few beers and tell jokes or whatever lately you do it after every shift when you finally get home we eat something i made in the crockpot otherwise the food would burn or get cold because i never know when youll actually come through the door instead of talking we eat in front of the television while you keep watching television i go to bed and read but thats what you like to do he protested you enjoy reading im not trying to place blame tori said each of us is who we are on the days youre not working you go to the airport as you told me once nonpilots think flying a plane is all about feeling free and enjoying the scenery but you like to fly because theres so much involved in handling a plane you cant think about anything else you cant let the emotions of your job distract you while youre control ling the aircraft thats your defense against the world when i learned about my cancer i imagined the clampeddown look youd get when i told youthe look you always get when you have emotions you dont want to deal with i decided i couldnt go on that way if i had a disease that might kill me i didnt want to feel alone any longer going to the airport is your escape tuesday morning after my doctor called i decided to escape in a different way the car became silent needing to distract himself page looked toward the sky where clouds drifted in from the east he glanced to the right beyond a barbedwire fence he saw the collapsed rusted hangars from the military airstrip that had been shut down at the end of world war ii vehicles were parked along the fence ahead the procession continued but some of the cars turned into the opposite lane and parked along the other side of the road a glance toward the side mirror revealed cars stretched out behind the saturn some of which were pulling off and parking wherever they found gaps tori broke the silence thats why i grabbed at the memory of the lights when i sat in that coffee shop outside el paso and noticed rostov on the map the excitement of seeing those lights came back to me before i knew it i couldnt wait to get here and see them again its been a long time since i felt that kind of emotion i feel as if im being compared to the way your father behaved that night not at all youre a kind decent man my father was impatient and harsh youre nothing like that but i need someone who feels positive page thought of the five children and the female driver whod died in the headon collision he thought of the driver of the gasoline tanker whod burned to death he thought of his friend whod been shot to death by the man whod crashed into the gasoline tanker he couldnt free his memory of all the people whod been shot the previous night and now tori had cancer feel positive he shook his head im not sure i know how to do that but i saw the lights too thats got to count for something tori didnt respond well watch them together page said hoping ill learn from you he heard the distant rumble of helicopters ahead three of them hovered a safe distance apart the choppers all had large letters on the undersides identifying the television stations to which they belonged their nose cameras were aimed at the line of vehicles near the observation platform a crowd faced barricades and the police officers who guarded them someone sold food from a van marked best tacos in texas reporters stood in front of cameras next to news trucks with broadcast dishes on top page recognized the reporter hed seen on the television at the motel office the one with the rumpled suit tori dont stop he warned the tv people know a woman shot the killer sooner or later theyll find out it was you theyll never let you alone but she didnt seem to hear all she did was stare toward the field where shed seen the lights theyre ruining it she said as the sun began its descent the black hawk helicopter sped through the sky at miles per hour ignoring the muffled vibration of the engines col warren raleigh glanced to the left toward where the davis mountains stretched along the horizon a moment later he peered ahead toward clouds drifting in from the direction of the gulf of mexico below cattle grazed on sparse grassland that seemed to go on forever big country the pilots voice came through raleighs headset some ranchers down there own a halfmillion acres raleigh said into his microphone lots of privacy at that morning raleigh and his team had flown from glen burnie airport near the nsas headquarters in fort meade mary land their aircraft had been a falcon owned by inscom but registered to a fictitious civilian corporation it flew them twothirds of the way across the continent to the army airbase at fort bliss in el paso texas there theyd picked up equipment that raleigh had ordered to be ready for them theyd also added two members to their team one was humanan army dog handler the other was a german shepherd the helicopter theyd transferred to was unarmed in its cargo transport configuration without the dramaticlooking missile launchers and gatling guns it wouldnt attract any more attention than most other helicopters raleigh thought especially in an area where the majority of eyes that would see it belonged to cattle and coyotes he glanced at his watch we should be there just about now exactly on schedule sir the pilot gestured ahead toward a gleam of white the ten radio dishes grew rapidly larger it had been three years since raleigh had visited this facility hed personally supervised the installation of the new equipment and arranged for one of the dishes to be aimed toward an area near rostov now he was impatient to return through his headset he heard sergeant lockhart telling the men one minute to touchdown raleigh watched the dishes get closer each was so huge that it dwarfed the combat helicopter as an array though they were beyond huge the only word that occurred to raleigh was monumental not easily impressed he found their intense whiteness to be awesome when the helicopter descended past the three concentric rows of fences its whirling blades created a dust storm he felt the skids touchdown and the helicopters weight settle then the speed of the blades diminished their sound becoming a whistle and lockhart opened the rear hatch motioning the men to grab their packs and hurry out raleigh returned the pilots salute and jumped to the ground joining his team a safe distance from the swirling dust as the chopper lifted off and headed back toward fort bliss a second black hawk appeared on the horizon the eight men were in their midtwenties their hair was short but not to the extent that they seemed obviously military each wore sturdy shoes slightly oversized jeans a tshirt and a loose outdoor shirt that hung over his belt concealing a beretta millimeter pistol that handgun wasnt a match for raleighs beloved m but until somebody figured out a practical way to conceal a carbine the pistol would have to do besides there were several ms in the crates of equipment hed ordered apart from the magnificent observatory dishes the only above ground structure was a concreteblock shed from which two guards wearing khaki uniforms emerged into the sunlight they held their carbines in a deceptively casual way but raleigh noted that they could make the weapons operational in an instant one of the guards had strained features as if he were in pain i hear a voice you cannot hear the man said under other circumstances his seemingly deranged statement would have made raleigh frown but instead he immediately replied which says i must not stay the guard continued i see a hand you cannot see which beckons me away raleigh said with the code recognition completed the guard saluted welcome to the facility colonel your name is earl halloway sir raleigh remembered the name from documents hed read en route saw combat in iraq former army ranger correct yes sir then theres no need to salute me any longer its a good habit sir indeed it is in case youre curious those lines come from an eighteenthcentury english poet thomas tickell im afraid i never heard of him sir nobody has posterity wasnt kind to him but itll be kind to me raleigh thought you look uncomfortable earl is anything wrong just a headache sir its nothing i took some aspirin its going away but the tight expression on his face made raleigh think the head ache was doing anything but fading the second chopper interrupted them roaring over the fences and setting down where the first had been the moment the dust settled the trainer got out with the german shepherd staying clear of the dog the team hurried to unload wooden crates earl the colonel said yes sir when i radioed ahead i gave instructions for the two suburbans in the underground garage to be ready to go its been taken care of sir halloway responded theyre out back then all we need is for you to give us the keys halloway hesitated you might want to come inside first sir oh raleigh frowned why would i want to do that theres something you should know about he looked even more pained if im right sir youre here because of the music the music raleigh was astonished you actually know about the music how bad has security gotten out here he wondered i heard it last night sir you heard it and not long afterward you contacted us to say you were coming so i figured there was a connection the radio dish thats angled to ward rostov make your point halloway im guessing its aimed toward whatever caused the music raleigh was stunned one of the militarys most secret projects and this former army sergeant was talking about it as if it were common knowledge he tried not to reveal how disturbed he felt all right earl show me what you think i should see leaving the team outside to prepare the vehicles raleigh followed the guard into the small concreteblock building after passing through the two security doors they went down an echoing metal stairwell into the glowing lights and the filtered cool air of the underground facility as they entered a surveillance room raleigh heard a voice that he at first suspected belonged to another guard but then he scanned the numerous monitors that showed the area around the dishes and to his surprise one of the screens turned out to be a television set you watch tv in here he made no attempt to hide his displeasure the screen showed a crowd in front of police barricades in the foreground a reporter in a rumpled suit held a microphone and faced a camera what the hell is going on raleigh demanded they started broadcasting this on the earlymorning news you were probably in the air by then so you didnt hear about it twenty people were shot to death last night bad things happen all the time why should it concern me earl pointed toward the reporter on the television this guy was the first reporter on the scene he kept talking about the lights what ever they are the lights raleigh stepped closer to the television wait a minute youre telling me the shootings happened in rostov five miles away from it at what they call the observation plat form apparently the gunman went crazy because of the lights he started screaming youre all going to hell and opened fire on a bunch of tourists raleighs muscles tightened its happening again he thought that reporter made a big deal about the lights being the reason for the killings and all the other reporters followed his lead halloway went on now people are coming from every direction to try to see them the towns turned into a zoo if youre headed over there i thought youd want to know staring at the chaos on the television raleigh felt his pulse race as if he were headed into combat just like in my god its really happening again the rostov county hospital was a modestsized twostory building its stucco tinted the harsh orange of the lateafternoon sun heat radiated off the front steps even so tori hesitated on them page watched her with concern are you okay just thinking about next tuesday san antonio the hospital page kept remembering that his mother had died from breast cancer numbness spread through him ill be there with you i never doubted that but what happens if life gets back to normal and im alone again even when youre with me i can change hard to do for you ill do anything ill quit being a cop tori looked surprised the jobs what makes me shut down my feelings page said to make things better between us quittings an obvious start but what would you do what my father did be an airplane mechanic tori considered him a moment longer then drew a long breath and approached the hospitals front doors they opened automatically inside a lobby page walked past a row of plastic chairs and stopped before a spectacled woman at a desk were here to check on someone he was admitted last night with a gunshot wound chief costigan hes not receiving visitors well can you tell us how hes doing are you family no were edith its okay a voice said theyre not reporters page turned and saw captain medrano standing at an elevator its door closing behind him he held his stetson each of the upper sleeves on his tan uniform had a red highway patrol patch in fact theyre trying to avoid reporters medrano said he pushed the elevators up button and the doors immediately reopened come on ill take you to him in the elevator medrano looked apologetic i finally had to give the media your names believe me i held off as long as i could but i was starting to look as if i wasnt in control of the investigation if they find out were at that motel tori said the clerk promised to deny youre staying there i hope he keeps his word do you know who the shooter was page asked edward mullen one of the survivors remembered seeing him on the tour bus we contacted the company that owns the bus its based in austin the lights are only a brief part of the tourit also goes to the big ranch house that was built for that james deacon movie birthright page nodded last night at the viewing area someone mentioned that movie set mostly though its a nature tour that goes through the davis mountains the company gave us a list of everyone who signed up for that particular tour all the victims had id on them we com pared their names and those of the survivors to the names on the list edward mullen was the only person we couldnt account for you were rightaccording to one of the survivors from the bus he had a guitar case the guy remembered because mullen had a lot of trouble finding a place to put it that must be where he hid the rifle a lucky guess no i told you last night you have the instincts of a good cop page glanced at tori and found that she was looking at him the elevator doors opened as they stepped into a hospital corridor pages nostrils felt pinched by the smell of antiseptic this was the ninth time mullen had taken the same tour medrano continued page stopped walking and frowned at him the ninth the tour company gave us the creditcard number he used the creditcard company gave us his address the austin police went to his apartment surprise me and tell me he didnt live alone his wife died a year ago medrano said he didnt have any children now tell me the apartment wasnt crammed with religious statues and paintings and all kinds of literature about damnation itd take a truck to carry it all away medrano replied im tempted to go with the theory i had last night some kind of religious lunatic but theres a problem with that theory oh mullen has a brother according to him mullen was never religiousnever even went near a churchuntil his wifes funeral apparently her death hit him so hard that all he did was stay in bed all day the brother tried to get him interested in things and happened to see a newspaper ad for one of those tours before his wifes death mullen was a movie buff if a movie was filmed in texas he knew it shot by shot so when the brother read that the tour included the set for birthright one of mullens favorites he managed to convince mullenpractically twisted his arm is how he put itthat the two of them should go on the tour it also included some locations from movies that were made in the davis mountains before the group reached the movie locations though they arrived at that viewing platform as usual some people on the tour claimed to see the lights while others wondered what all the fuss was about did the brother see the lights page asked no but mullen claimed they were spectacular after he got back to austin he started filling his apartment with the religious statues and paintings a phone rang distracting medrano it came from a nurses station across from the elevators page glanced around and noticed open doors along the corridor nurses going into some of them people in civilian clothes coming out of others medrano pointed toward a clock in the nurses station almost im due at a press conference at the courthouse id better show you where chief costigan is as they walked along the corridor page looked again at tori who rubbed the back of her neck obviously bothered by the smell and feel of being in a hospital he stepped closer to her reached out and discreetly squeezed her hand but got no reaction medrano entered the secondtolast doorway on the left and stepped out of pages sight want more visitors he asked someone if theyre pretty a raspy voice said one is the other could use a shave medrano motioned for page and tori to enter the room costigan lay in a bed that was tilted up allowing him to see a news program on a television that was mounted on the opposite wall the reporter on the screen was the same man page had seen on the television at the motel office rumpled suit mussed blond hair beard stubble haggard but handsome features anythings better than watching that damned fool get everybody fired up costigan growled the chief pressed the remote control and shut off the tv bandages encircled his head pads making one side thicker than the other his face looked grayer and thinner even his mustache seemed gray recognize these folks medrano asked sure do an iv tube was taped to costigans left arm wires attached to heart and bloodpressure monitors led under the chest of his hospital gown glad to hear it medrano said thats part of the memory test i need to get to a press conference but i want this couple to tell a nurse if you start forgetting things like the fifty dollars i lent you last week i didnt borrow any fifty dollars youre right come to think of it i lent you a hundred dollars get out of here costigan said after medrano grinned and left the chief motioned for them to come closer we brought your windbreaker back page said thanks it came in handy keep it a while longer im hardly in a position to use it costigan studied them he called you this couple does that mean things are better between the two of you its complicated page answered isnt everything at least you came here together tori changed the subject how bad are you hurt apparently ive got a hard head the bullet creased my skull didnt fracture it but gave me a hell of a concussion costigan winced and an even worse headache if i start to drool tell the nurse despite the burden of his emotions page almost smiled your head was covered with so much blood tori said i thought you were dead scalp wounds are terrible bleeders mrs page i heard that you picked up my gun and made good use of it you saved the lives of a lot of people youre remarkable tori looked away sorry it wasnt my intention to upset you costigan changed the subject i dont suppose either of you has any cigarettes afraid not she said looking at him again just as well they wont let me smoke in here anyhow its a good time to quit tori said yeah this wound gives me motivation to stick around as long as i can costigan looked at page before the shooting started you seemed to see the lights page could tell that tori was waiting for his answer i did im impressed costigan said not everybody does your wife sure saw them yes tori sounded as if she spoke about a lover but im still not sure what it is i saw page added whats happening here chief what are they costigan pressed a button a motor under the bed made a whirring sound and raised his head a little more ive heard every kind of explanation you can imagine everything from ball lightning to pranksters if its pranksters theyre good at it when i came to town to be the chief after my father was killed the harsh memory made costigan pause he gradually refocused his thoughts well i spent a lot of nights out there looking for people with flashlights or lanterns or whatever thats a long way to go for a practical joke i never saw cars parked along the side roads and i never heard any noises i couldnt identify it would take at least a half dozen people to pull off a prank like that and i dont know how they could do it quietly whats more its hard to keep a secret after all these years someone in town would have hinted about what they were doing and how many pranksters have the determination to do it night after night after night what i saw wasnt flashlights or lanterns or pranksters tori said no but there still has to be some explanation im not sure youre going to like this mrs page please call me tori what am i not going to like i dont think theres anything magical about the lights on occasion researchers have come here some from as far away as japan theyve set up all kinds of scientific instruments machines that analyzed light and measured distance and i dont pretend to understand it the best explanation they could come up with is a temperature inversion a what i said you wouldnt like it a temperature inversion the way it was explained to me is were five thousand feet above sea level at this altitude when the sun sets after a hot day there can be as much as a fiftydegree difference between the daytime and nighttime temperatures that causes an inversion of hot air on top of cold under certain conditions distant lightsfrom a moving car or a traincan bounce back and forth through the layers the lights get magnified they shift up and down and right and left but why would they change colors the scientists didnt explain that do the lights appear in the winter tori persisted if so then there wouldnt be as big a difference between the day and night temperatures so how could there be a temperature inversion in cold weather the scientists didnt explain that either costigan gingerly touched his bandaged head this headache harriett ward excuse me the statement seemed to come out of nowhere page worried that costigan was having trouble keeping his thoughts straight harrietts the person to talk to about the lights shes the local ex pert she runs an antiques store a block south of the courthouse lives in a couple of rooms in the back given everything thats happening i doubt many locals will go out this evening even if it is friday night youll probably catch her at home the sign had oldfashioned lettering west texas antiques as tori parked in front page noticed a hutch a rocking chair and a wooden sink in the stores window the frame around the window was painted a pastel blue that contrasted with the yellow on the art gallery to the left and the green on the coffee shop to the right reminds me of the lights tori said they looked up the wide street toward the courthouse where numerous vehicles were parked including several television broadcast trucks page estimated that a couple of hundred people stood in front of the steps presumably listening to captain medrano conducting the press conference my rental cars still parked up there i cant get it until they leave page explained to tori the lowering sun cast the street in a crimson glow a pickup truck stopped a teenaged boy leaned from the passenger window supposed to be some weird lights around here we came all the way from lubbock to see them you know where theyre at were strangers page said just visiting a friend a boy in the middle told the driver ed lets go ask somebody else try that crowd up there as the truck drove away page knocked on the wooden doorframe and peered through the window toward the shadows in the store maybe the chiefs wrong and shes out for the evening he said but after he knocked again a door opened in the back of the store a figure approached passing old tables and cabinets the figure had white hair that was cut short like a mans then a light came on and the person stepped close enough for page to see a lean woman in her sixties she wore cowboy boots jeans a work shirt and a leather vest her skin was brown and wrinkled from exposure to the sun when she unlocked the door and peered out page noticed a wed ding band mrs ward my names dan page and your wifes name is tori the woman shook hands with them chief costigan phoned to say you were coming come in and please call me harriett won over by the friendliness page motioned for tori to go first then followed the two women toward the back of the store he noticed old rifles on a rack on the wall the wooden floor creaked everything smelled of the past i was about to have a drink but i hate to drink alone harriett said so i hope youll join me she closed the door after they entered a small living room that was sparsely furnished the rug had a sunburst pattern page didnt see any indication that a man lived there thinking of the wedding band harriett wore he concluded that she was a widow ive got vodka bourbon and tequila she said what are you having tori asked tequila on the rocks ill have the same page was surprised tori seldom drank hard alcohol tequila for you also harriett asked him just a little i havent eaten anything in a while harrietts boot heels thumped on the wooden floor as she went into a small kitchen he heard the clink of ice cubes being dropped into glasses and the splash of liquid being poured over the ice the chief tells me youre interested in hearing about the lights harriett said returning with two glasses according to him youre the local expert page replied i did a lot of research if thats what he means harriett went back for the third glass and also brought a bag of tortilla chips which she handed to page i dug into history and found hundreds of re ports a lot of them from the old days but nobodys really an expert when it comes to the lights nobody really understands them why hasnt word about them gotten around tori wondered there was a segment about them on that old tv show unsolved mysteries and a crew from the history channel did some interviews here about five years ago every once in a while theres an item in a magazine when that happens we get a wave of visitors thats why the county set up that viewing area and the portable toilets people made so much mess out there that it seemed better to adjust to the tourists than to ignore themturned out to be good for business too but eventually interest dies down for one thing the lights dont photograph well so camera crews get restless plus a lot of visitors dont see the lights which is why the county put up that plaque with its warning that people shouldnt feel disappointed if they dont see anything harriett clicked glasses with them and sat although page made a show of sipping the tequila he had no intention of finishing it he merely used it as a prop to encourage harriett to feel comfortable and keep talking chief costigan thinks theyre probably lights from a distance magnified by temperature inversions but i dont believe that tori said firmly youll hear all kinds of theories from ufos to ball lightning why do some people see them and others dont page asked as i said there are all kinds of theories a psychiatrist on unsolved mysteries claimed its a form of mass delusion that some people want their expectations to be fulfilled while others are determined not to be manipulated i dont believe that either tori insisted looking at page i had no expectations when i first saw the lights back when i was ten all i wanted was for my father to stop the car so i could run to a portapotty when i came out the lights were the last things i expected to see fred nolan sure didnt have any expectations when he first saw them back in harriett said fred nolan tori asked april nolan watched as the trains crew lowered the spigot from the water tower and filled the steam engines water compartment he scanned the few small buildings that provided shelter for the men who hauled wood from the davis mountains and stacked it for trains to use as fuel animals bellowed in the cattle cars slide the hatches open nolan told his men wooden planks rumbled as hooves descended into sunlight and open air keep em together nolan ordered the five hundred cattle were scrawny purchased cheaply in colorado after a hard winter had piled so much snow on grassland that the animals couldnt stomp through the drifts to get at it many had starved to death these that survived looked awful but they did survive nolan thought theyre strong theyll make good breeding stock hed met with railroad executives in denver arguing that this water stop in west texas was a perfect place for the railroad to build a town and sizable cattle pens sure the grass is spread out but theres more land for the cattle to graze on they thrive if theres an acre per animal an acre per animal a cigarsmoking executive scoffed in that case youd need an awful lot of land to justify the expense you want us to commit to well my ranch is small right now i admit all i have is a quarter million acres but im planning to expand a quartermillion acres the executive sat forward good god are you telling us you plan to be able to ship a quartermillion cattle through that water stop for starters if you build the pens and the town ill supply the cattle now nolan looked toward where the pens would be situated the troughs for water and hay the permanent ramps that would lead up to the cattle cars he imagined the towns wide streets through which the cattle would be herded to the pens the stores that would make it easy to get supplies for his ranch the homes for the people who would manage the stores perhaps a doctor and a church perhaps even a saloon carefully monitored for although nolan was a devout presbyterian whod never touched a drop of alcohol in his life he understood the needs of the men he employed and reasoned that allowing occasional carefully controlled recreation would make it easier for him to attract and keep ranch hands he admitted that his ambition was greater than his capabilities he had the quartermillion acres which his grandfather and father had fought against mexicans and indians to keep but what he needed now was the money to buy more cheaply priced scrawny but amazingly strong cattle so far he had a herd of fifty thousand but hed need a lot more to breed them into the quarter million hed promised well its a beginning nolan thought next week ill head for oklahoma their winter was the reverse of colorados so dry that the spring grass isnt coming up ranchersll be culling their herds willing to sell their worstlooking stock for pennies on the dollar theyll think im a fool but i know anything that lived through a winter drought has got to be strong move em out he told his men the angle of the sun warned him that darkness would fall in five hours and during that time his men had to drive the cattle eight miles to the stream they had dammed creating a pond where the cattle could stay in a group and drink more than a mile an hour after the long trip in the cattle cars there was a risk that some animals might collapse before they got to the water but after that theyd be able to rest to do nothing but eat and drink and grow theyre strong nolan thought theyve been through worse than this theyll get to the stream as it turned out two animals died and the others didnt reach the water until after dark when it was more difficult to control a moving herd and the yelping of coyotes could easily have spooked them but finally the cattle circled the dammedup part of the stream and nolan told his foreman keep half the men watching the herd tell the other half to set up camp in the light of the stars and a rising quarter moon nolan dismounted unsaddled his horse put a rope around the mares neck and led her to the water where he took care that she didnt drink too much his legs stiffening he guided the horse to a stretch of grass hobbled her and allowed her to graze the grass was sparse enough that she wouldnt glut herself and get sick after the water shed consumed on the way to the railroad nolans men had brought firewood from the ranch house and left it near the pond now in the darkness they arranged it in three piles to build campfires mr nolan what do you suppose that is his foreman asked sounding troubled where over there to the southeast nolan stepped away from the cattle and looked at the murky horizon i dont see anything what am i supposed to be looking for there mr nolan those lights lights nolan stared toward the darkness what lights i dont see wait a second at first nolan had thought he was looking at stars that glistened on the horizon but suddenly he realized that whatever he saw was below the horizon on the grassland twinkling at least a dozen lights tell the men not to build the fires he ordered with a muted urgent voice make sure they dont make any noise either as the foreman ran to obey nolan hurried to a man on horseback who was watching the herd get down stay low dont show your silhouette tell the other men to do the same trouble mr nolan just do what youre told feeling fire in his stomach nolan ran to another horseman and gave him the same orders stooping he rushed to his saddle and pulled his winchester from its scabbard he always kept a round in the firing chamber so there wasnt any need to work the lever all he had to do was pull back the hammer he crouched and studied the lights they seemed to be five or six miles away some floated while others shifted from side to side they were various colorsblue green yellow redmerging then drifting apart nolans men gathered nearby while the foreman stooped next to him and murmured you figure theyre campfires mr nolan i never heard of campfires that keep changing their location nolans voice was tense and low maybe whoevers out there has torches and theyre moving around doing something like what like a war dance the foreman said you think those are indians those lights are close enough that wed hear a war dance nolan murmured conscious of the weight of the winchester in his hands besides all the indians around here are mostly peaceful as you say mr nolan mostly sure they could be renegades but those lights are in the direction of mexico what im thinking is mexican raiders if they start shooting they could stampede the cattle toward mexico before theres daylight enough for us to chase them nolan couldnt take his eyes off the lights as much as he felt threatened by them he also felt hypnotized drawn spellbound inexplicably he tasted lemonade a shiver prickled his skin behind him the cattle made lowing sounds as they settled for the night we caused plenty of noise getting here nolan thought whoevers with those lights is bound to know where we are tell the men to get their rifles put them in groups of two so theyll keep each other awake anybody i catch sleeping will be out of a job in the morning somehow mr nolan i dont think losing their jobs is what theyre worried about right now then tell the men theyll get a bonus if they keep the herd together you bet mr nolan the foreman said staying low he rushed to give orders to the men meanwhile nolan stared harder toward the shimmering lights they sank and drifted they hovered and rippled their colors kept changing he remembered a couple of years earlier when hed been in el paso during a fourth of july celebration chinese vendors had sold firecrackers and skyrockets but theyd also sold quiet fireworks called sparklers thick wires that had been dipped in chemicals capable of being ignited with a match with a hiss that was virtually silent the wires had erupted in sparks of various colors at night nolan had seen children use the sparklers to write their names in the darkness is that what theyve got over there sparklers but if theyre raiders why would they let us know theyre nearby the answer wasnt hard to imagine to scare us well theyll find out i dont scare easily even so as the lights drifted and changed colors and beckoned during the longest night of his life nolan admitted that his fortitude was being tested troubled he heard faint music but its melody and instruments were unfamiliar under other circumstances he might have thought that it came from a town across the border the mexicans having some kind of celebration possibly a tune from a mariachi band had managed to drift this far but was distorted by the distance nolan didnt believe that as he concentrated on the hardtohear notes the lights seemed to brighten their colors strengthening the two were somehow connected the cattle became restive their hooves scraping the dirt their lowing sounds had a nervous edge praying that they wouldnt stampede nolan thought of the land that his grandfather and father had fought so hard to keep and of the land he was determined to add to it he thought of the quartermillion head of cattle hed promised if the railroad built the town and the cattle pens he lay on the hard ground with his rifle propped on his saddle he stared along it toward the lights and silently recited scripture from the gospel of st john and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not that was the first relevant quotation that popped into his mind but it didnt provide the affirmation he was looking for so he recalled another this one from isaiah the people that walketh in darkness have seen a great light they that dwelleth in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shone the shadow of death that quotation didnt provide the affirmation nolan was looking for either besides if raiders came for his cattle the shadow of death would be on them if the lights and the music were indeed made by raiders if the cattle didnt stampede nolan went on like that all through the long cold night trying to calm himself with the word of god his eyes aching he kept aiming at the lights until as dawn approached they faded and shrank with the sun finally rising he stood stiffly and lowered the hammer on his winchester his ears ached he told his foreman take the herd all the way to the house you bet mr nolan just as soon as the men cook something to eat no do it now the men can eat cold biscuits as they ride i want to make sure the cattle are safe youre the boss mr nolan the foreman looked troubled what do you figure those lights were if they werent mexican raiders give me three riders and ill find out nolan saddled his horse and rode southeast with the men during the night hed estimated that the lights were five or six miles away but when he traveled that distance he didnt find any sign of cooking fires or horse tracks or crushed vegetation that would indicate where a camp had been made he was sure that the lights had been in this direction but darkness could play tricks so he told his men spread out spacing them fifty yards apart he rode three miles farther but still didnt see any sign of campfires or horse tracks he was forced to ride around a section of black ugly twisted boulders that looked like huge dead cinders a minister with whom hed once traveled on a train through arizona had told him that sections like this were left over from the pyrotechnics of when god had created the universe but if this area was supposed to represent gods power nolan didnt understand why the mexicans called them malpais badlands he rode another five miles but still didnt see any horse tracks i was sure the lights were southeast of the herd he thought how could i have misjudged their direction mr nolan one of his men called behind him belatedly nolan realized that the rider had been shouting his name for some time he looked back sir if we keep going like this well end up in mexico nolan suddenly became aware of how high the sun was and how far theyd ridden feeling as if he came out of a trance he stared ahead toward the sparse grassland that seemed to stretch forever something wavered on the horizon maybe a dust devil maybe air rippling as the sun heated it i could follow that movement forever and never reach it nolan thought were heading back he yelled to the men pick a different section keep looking and shout if you find where somebody camped did nolan ever find an answer page asked a few indians worked on his ranch he figured it was safer to keep them close than have them fight him harriett said hed never been in that area after dark but it was a good bet the indians would know if any strange lights had ever been seen over there to his surprise they told him thered always been lights in that direction their fathers and grandfathers had talked about them the lights were the spirits of their ancestors they believed superstitions even less convincing than temperature inversions tori said anyway i dont want to have the lights explained i dont want somebody to take away how special they are by telling me theyre just ball lightning or ghosts thats the way most everyone here in town feels about them too harriett replied when my late husband and i first came here in we were hippies in an old station wagon that was basically our home we happened to hear about the lights so we drove out to where the viewing area is now we opened the back hatch sat on our sleeping bags smoked dope and ate dry cornflakes i still dont know if we actually saw the lights or if the dope made us believe we did but the next night we watched them without being stoned and the night after that too and well we never left rostov wasnt much back then but we managed to find jobs and we didnt need a lot of money to live basically being able to see the lights whenever we wanted seemed reward enough after a while we didnt even need to go out there somehow we managed to feel that the lights were out there without actually seeing them every couple of months though wed want to see them again the way people feel the need to go to church a lot of people in rostov are like my husband and me they intended to pass through but the lights kept them here or called them back tori said with a hushed tone most people dont see the lights at all of course let alone react the way i described harriett said but many of the people who live here were fortunate enough to have the same experience and we long ago stopped trying to explain it the only thing that matters is the lights make us feel i guess the word is blessed things werent so blessed last night page replied the press conference was finished by the time they left the antiques store and glanced up toward the courthouse the sun was lower casting the deserted street in a deeper orange page looked at tori i need to get my rental car from up there he said do you want to follow me back to the motel tori didnt answer right away sure but as page drove to the motel he glanced in his rearview mirror and there wasnt any sign of toris blue saturn among the traffic that was heading out of town toward the observation platform he parked in front of unit got out and waited glancing up he noticed that there were clouds gathering for the first time since hed been in rostov fifteen minutes passed and he still didnt see any sign of her so he finally took his suitcase from the trunk and moved toward the door the gangly motel clerk came from the office and hurried toward him page remembered his name something wrong jake thereve been reporters looking for you i hope you didnt tell them were staying here captain medrano said not to but somehow the reporters found out the woman at the shooting has red hair and your wife is the only redhead at the motel i thought id better warn you thanks it was weird lately everythings been weird page said did you have anything specific in mind the reporter whos most determined to find you is the television guy from el paso you saw him on the tv in the lobby the last time we talked page thought a moment moviestar jaw rumpled suit looks like he hasnt slept in a couple of days thats the guy he was the first reporter to come to town hes figured out a lot of angles on the storyso many that the other re porters have just been following his lead i was in the office watching him on tv then the door opened and i looked over and by god there he was walking toward me i guess some of what i figured is live must be on tape seeing him in two places at the same time felt unreal be careful of him you want your privacy but the look in his eyes told me hed do anything to put your wife in front of a camera and make her describe how she shot that guy that isnt going to happen page said before he could say anything more a phone rang in the office gotta get back to work the gangly clerk ran toward the door as it banged shut page took another look toward the road hoping their conversation might have given tori time to catch up but there was no sign of the saturn more clouds had gathered filling the sky his side ached when he carried his suitcase into the room if things had been different it would have felt good to shave and shower to get the smell of the smoke and the violence off him but all page thought was that he could bear anythingeven what had happened the previous nightif only tori had followed him to the motel as shed said she would if only she hadnt left him again if only she didnt have cancer the bruise where hed been kicked was larger than hed expected dark purple ringed with orange trying to ignore it he put on a fresh pair of jeans and another denim shirt kind of predictable pal he took the millimeter pistol out of his suitcase removed the magazine made sure it was full and checked to make sure there was a round in the firing chamber you examined it before you left the house yesterday he thought aware that people whose occupation involved carrying a gun tended to display obsessivecompulsive behavior or maybe he just needed to narrow his thoughts the gun was a sig sauer it held eight rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber not a lot of firepower compared to pistols with doublestacked magazines but the s virtue was its compact size he considered it an ideal concealedcarry pistol the company didnt make them any longer and this particular gun had belonged to his father he holstered it on his belt put on a windbreaker to conceal it grabbed a baseball cap from his suitcase and opened the door ready to go looking for tori although he knew where hed find her the viewing area about to get into his car he heard tires crunching on gravel and looked toward the road surprised to see the blue saturn coming through the parking lot toward him toris red hair was vivid through the windshield when she stopped in front of unit his knees felt weak i figured youd left me behind he said through the open window she showed him a paper bag i got this for you page almost frowned in confusion before he smelled the food you said you hadnt eaten since yesterday i hope a burger and fries work for you anything else would have taken too long theyre perfect emotion made his knees more unsteady thanks you need to keep up your energy thisll be another long night thanks really i mean it get in she said impatiently he did so and pulled off the baseball cap better put this on reporters are looking for a woman with red hair she nodded and took it as she drove page bit into the hamburger and recalled uneasily that this was what he and chief costigan had eaten the evening before how are you feeling he asked when i see the lights again everythingll be fine theyll make me forget what happened last night the trick is to distract your mind by paying attention to the small details but i wasnt thinking about last night how are you feeling tori hesitated i never realized anything was wrong with me until the doctor phoned to tell me the results of my mammogram now im so selfconscious that i swear i can feel the thing growing in me on tuesday itll be gone id like to just reach in and claw it out with my fingers i love you tori looked at him you said that last night too ahead three tv news helicopters were silhouetted against the dark cloudy sky vehicles were parked along both sides of the road taking his own advice page distracted himself by paying attention to small details and looked to the right toward the ruin of the world war ii airbase he saw someone unlocking a gate the man wore sturdy shoes loosefitting pants a tshirt and an overshirt that hung below his belt he was in his forties bald and sinewy with rigid shoulders and an air of authority when he motioned for two dark chevy surburbans to drive onto the property he had the manner of someone who was used to giving orders there was now a second sign on the gate tori i want to check something please stop for a second she looked at him reluctantly but applied the brakes as they came close to the gate page lowered his window and leaned out to get a better view in the dwindling sunset the older sign warned property of us military danger hazardous chemicals unexploded ordnance the new one announced soon to be an environmental protection agency reclamation site the authoritative man stepped through the gate locked it and noticed page parkings not allowed on this property he pointed toward the signs restricted area page waved to indicate he understood another man got out of one of the vans he had a german shepherd on a leash the authoritative man just stood there staring at the car until tori drove on what was that about she asked im not sure page looked back and watched as the two suburbans drove toward the collapsed weedchoked rusted airplane hangars finally he couldnt see them any longer so he directed his attention ahead toward the crowd as tori neared it page noticed that the county had brought a halfdozen more portable toilets but they werent going to be enough the crowd filled the entire parking lot all the way to the fence onlookers standing where corpses had lain the previous night people were on the road forcing tori to steer into the opposite lane medrano and other highway patrol officers struggled to keep order tori parked at the end of the line of cars costigans windbreaker was on the front seat and she snatched it up as she stepped from the saturn but as she stared toward the crowd a hundred yards up the road she faltered you okay page asked too many people i dont think i want to go any farther fine we dont need to do anything you dont want to maybe i can see the lights just as well from here tori said uneasily maybe the viewing areas only an arbitrary spot why dont we stay here and find out page suggested yes she shivered and put on the windbreaker after last night i dont want to go near a crowd raleigh waited at the fence until the blue saturn drove on there were several troubling things about the man whod leaned out the window to read the new sign that explained his teams presence here the mans features were guarded revealing nothing about what he thought his hair was shortnot military short but shorter and neater than was common among civilians and his eyes were attentive as if he analyzed everything he saw definitely not just a tourist raleigh thought he kept waiting until the saturn was obscured by the long line of cars that were parked along the side of the road then he turned to the dog trainer who had the german shepherd on a short leash put the fear of god into anybody who tries to come over that fence as the trainer turned on his flashlight raleigh walked ahead of the two dark suburbans their only illumination coming from parking lights he motioned for them to follow leading them along what had once been a heavily traveled dirt road its furrows now cluttered with weeds after a hundred yards the last rays of sunset showed a wide row of collapsed airplane hangars to the left their corrugated metal had long since rusted scrub brush grew among them dirt had drifted against them a lot of this was the work of nature but some of it had been deliberately arranged to make the ruin look more dilapidated than it actually was raleigh held up his hand signaling for the vehicles to stop he surveyed the old runway its concrete was visible only here and there most of it covered with dirt weeds grew where numerous cracks had been baked into the pavement by the sun his grandfather had once stood here it made raleigh feel tremendously proud that a circle was about to close that a mission his grand father had started so long ago was finally about to be accomplished in world war ii when the hangars and the runway were freshly constructed this would have been a scene of intense noise and activity enough to make ones heart pound hundreds of airmen had trained here every month practicing bombing runs and aerial dog fights in a place so remote that only the cattle coyotes and jack rabbits were inconvenienced by the commotion but training airmen had just been the cover story a breeze swept dust across the decay when the darkness was thick enough to conceal them from prying eyes raleigh pointed toward a hangar that seemed less collapsed than the others the suburbans followed and he tugged away a section of corrugated metal revealing a space large enough to allow a vehicle to enter the hangar once they were inside raleigh pulled out a flashlight and examined a thirtyfoothigh pile of debris that appeared to be the result of a cleanup effort long ago pushing aside some of the debris he un covered the edge of a camouflaged radio dish that was aimed toward a similar dish at the observatory after verifying that the dish hadnt been disturbed he edged behind some of the debris and pushed a button a portion of the concrete floor rumbled as it descended to form a ramp lights shone up from below activated by the same button his footsteps crunching on dirt raleigh walked down the ramp into a rush of cool underground air the suburbans followed him slowly and the moment they reached the bottom he stepped to a wall where he pushed another button the ramp ascended becoming part of the ceiling as the men clambered out of the vehicle raleigh said sergeant assemble the team seconds later they stood in a row before him gentlemen his voice reverberated off the concrete walls youre beneath hangar of an airfield that was a training facility for us military flight teams during world war ii the hangar and this area werent part of that effort however only personnel with topsecret clearance were allowed in the hangar and even fewer were allowed down here the explanation was that the prototype for a new bomber was being assembled in the hangar and readied for testing trainees cycled through the program so quickly that they never stayed long enough to wonder why the bomber wasnt completed and flown youre familiar with the race to develop the atomic bomb during the second world war the location for that projects main research facility los alamos was on a remote difficulttoreach mesa in new mexico this underground area enjoyed similar advantages and had a similar purpose if it seems out of the way now imagine how truly out of the way it was in when the project began the objective was to develop a weapon quite different from the atomic bomb in a way hangar and los alamos were racing against one another as well as the enemy of course los alamos won the race in fact the first atomic bomb was detonated at whats now called the white sands missile range just two hundred and fifty miles north of here and after two of those bombs ended the war in the pacific the urgency to develop a parallel weapon lost its force raleigh chose his next words with care in addition there were what might be called difficulties in conducting the research here difficulties indeed raleigh looked around the subterranean chamber even after all these years rustcolored smears were visible on the walls but they had nothing to do with rust with the end of the war there was no longer any need to train massive numbers of military flight teams and the cover story lost its effectiveness so for a number of reasons the airfield was shut down except for this underground facility the base was allowed to deteriorate this area wasnt exposed to the elements however and apart from minor water damage it adjusted extremely well to remaining in hibernation indeed from time to time it received maintenance checks in case its mission should ever be reactivated fifteen years ago i did exactly that i reactivated it anita are you sure this angle will work brent raised his voice so that he could be heard above the noisy crowd he and his camerawoman stood on top of a winnebago motor home that the ownera local car dealerhad agreed to let them use in exchange for free publicity like brent anita had gotten only a few hours of sleep since coming to rostov thered been too many people to interview too many locations to scout her eyes looked heavy under her baseball cap her outdoor clothes with their numerous pockets seemed even more baggy than when theyd started my suit looks worse brent thought a day earlier that would have depressed him but nowas he peered down at his scuffed dusty shoeshe almost smiled at the new image he was creating for himself youll be on the right side of the screen anita answered the horizonll be on your left she looked so tired he wondered how she had the strength to keep the heavy camera balanced on her shoulder its a clear shot if we tried this on the ground the crowd would get in the way but from high up like this they wont be in the shot at all unless you ask me to tilt down perfect stay focused on me unless i indicate otherwise tell jack and the guy in the chopper to keep their cameras panning across the crowd the entire time just in case something happens in case what happens just make sure theyre ready and i definitely want a shot of that guy brent pointed down toward a tall graybearded man who wore a biblical robe held a staff and looked like charlton heston playing moses in the ten commandments he frowned toward the east where the dark clouds were getting thicker that rain better wait until i finish the broadcast he thought okay time to prep a guest button your shirt straighten your tie anita advised no way brent rubbed his bristly whisker shadow i want cnn to see how hard im working how hard were all working right at dawn after a night of chasing interviews brent had experienced a moment of powerful inspiration when hed seen his reflection in a car window and cringed at how terrible he looked hed been reminded of an old blackandwhite movie about a reporter racing against the clock to prove the innocence of a prisoner about to be electrocuted on death row in the movie the reporter barely had time to eat let alone change clothes and shave at the end of the movie when he burst into the governors office with the proof he looked like hed suffered through hell to get the story at that moment the idea had hit him how can the viewers or the cnn brass know how hard im working if i make it look easy ive been doing this wrong what viewer gives a shit if im wearing a perfectly pressed suit most of them dont even own a sports coat for them wearing jeans is dressing up ive got to make them realize that im one of themthat im killing myself to get the story for them and with that epiphany he had done a complete aboutface in addition to exhaustion brent suffered from too much coffee and not enough real food doughnuts and tacos had been just about all hed eaten always on the go except for when he drove with anita he never had a chance to sit down and even then he wasnt resting he was making hurried notes or using his cell phonewhich wasnt easy since the reception here was for shit he couldnt let up he needed to make sure he got to anybody who might have even the slightest information to contribute and he had to get there before the other reporters he wanted everyone else feeling behind the curve certain that anything they did would look like an imitation of what hed already accomplished but there was a cost his stomach had a sharp burning sensation his hands had a slight tremor he felt lightheaded from exhaustion and lack of food legs stiff he climbed down the ladder to the crowd below the noise of so many impatient conversations gave him a headache the day light was gone now and the sky was black and starless but there were plenty of other sources of illumination headlights spotlights set up by the authorities and the television crews flashlights carried by the curious brightly lit figures cast stark shadows lending the scene a surreal quality his coanchor sharon waited for him at the bottom of the ladder her big hair sprayed perfectly into place anger made her more beautiful well ive got to give you credit she said crisply you finally got what you wantedyou really screwed me today was it as good for you as it was for me someone bumped against them shoving through the crowd keep going a woman urged her male companion we cant see anything from back here get close to the fence i was supposed to be the one giving the reports to cnn sharon complained i was supposed to anchor todays broadcasts all by myself well while you were nursing your sore feet i was out doing the interviews someone else bumped against them almost knocking them together if you ask me these lights are all a bunch of bullshit a man complained to his companion i dont know why i let you talk me into coming here it took six hours for christs sake if id known thered be this many people brent faced sharon again maybe you should try being a reporter for a change dig up more stories about rescued cats and the people who love them a man pushed a woman in a wheelchair nearly knocking brent off his feet and shouting out of the way let us through my wife needs to see the lights theyll heal her legs out of the way brent took advantage of the interruption and turned toward the broadcast truck which was parked near the winnebago mr hamilton he called to someone inside the truck were ready for your interview an uneasylooking man stepped out overweight in his midforties he wore cowboy boots and jeans with creases down the middle of the legs his bluechecked shirt had shiny metal snaps instead of buttons i was on the highway of death in the first gulf war but nothing ever made me nervous like this hamiltons puffy cheeks were flushed he grinned at his own candor going on television i thought car dealers were used to that be cause of their television commercials brent said as he adjusted the tiny microphone clipped to the mans shirt theres no station in rostov hell ive never seen the inside of one dont worry about it ill ask you some easy questions about what you told me this afternoon ive never heard anything more fascinating all you need to do is forget the camera and talk to me the way youd talk to a customer well i can sure do that hamilton looked up uncertainly but ive never tried to sell anybody anything from the top of a motor home and in the dark to boot brent leaned inside the broadcast truck harry brighten the lights up there will you there you go mr hamilton lead the way i think youll enjoy the view with that they walked over to the winnebago i hope youre not counting on too much hamilton said as he started climbing the ladder only a ticket to atlanta brent thought on top of the motor home he arranged hamilton so that he stood a few feet away with the crowd below them and the rangeland in the background i just need to talk to somebody for a moment then well do the interview brent adjusted his earbud so that it wouldnt be conspicuous through it he listened to the producer who sat below him in the broadcast van ready in ten the producers voice said next to anitas camera a face appeared on a monitor the craggy features of one of televisions most wellknown personalities hamilton pointed isnt that keeping his right hand at his side brent motioned for him to be quiet he was troubled that his hand had a tremor the producers voice finished counting down go on the monitor the cnn newscasters thin lips moved but there was no sound brent could hear him through the earbud though and for the next hour we have a special broadcast about a story that stunned the nation last night a crazed gunman shot twenty members of a tour group near the remote town of rostov in west texas the killers rage was evidently set off by mysterious lights that appear almost nightly in that area joining us live at the scene of the shooting is brent loft a reporter for el paso television station the famous personality whose power brent hoped to have one day read the stations call letters brent you look as if this story is taking a toll on you things are very emotional here brents words were picked up by a tiny mike clipped to his dusty lapel believe me theres a lot more information to track down i understand youre going to tell us more about the mystery of those lights and why they drove this gunman into a homicidal frenzy thats correct the lights are a local phenomenon that have been here as long as anybody can remember on most nights they appear on the rangeland behind mebut not to everyone some people see the lights while others dont and thats as much a mystery as what causes them in a while were going to aim our cameras in that direction and see if the nation gets lucky but first you need to understand what the eager crowd below me is looking for to provide some context i want to introduce you to luther hamilton a car dealer here in rostov who probably knows as much about the lights as anyone hes one of the few whove seen them up close and personal in fact his experience with them nearly cost him his life mr hamilton brent stepped toward his guest so that anita could put them in a twoshot the crowd milled impatiently below in the summer of you took part in a highly unusual event it sure wasnt ordinary ill tell you that luther agreed and it occurred in this area exactly in this area right where everybodys standing down below us there wasnt any observation platform in those days just a gravel parking lot at the side of the road on the fourth of july rostov had a fireworks celebration after it was over we drove out here how many people were involved almost as many as are here now at least four hundred and what did you plan to do did you have a name for it we called it the rostov ghost light hunt for the second time that day luther described what had happened that longago summer and now he understood that the nervousness hed spoken about hadnt much to do with worrying that hed forget what he was supposed to say on television it was nervousness about what hed started to remember that afternoon when hed told the reporter about the hunt hed recalled it through a haze of decades but now his memory was focusing remembering details with clarity and he dreaded returning to that time i wish to god id never agreed to this interview he thought hed hoped that the publicity would help him sell cars but all of a sudden he didnt care rostovs fourth of july fireworks had turned out to be the usual joke they were ignited on the high school football field less than ten minutes of skyrockets some of which had more of a pop than a bang a few never went off and the principal made a big show of pouring buckets of water on them the senior class clown jeb rutherford burned himself with a sparkler bits of burned paper drifted from the sky and cal baileys girlfriend got a speck in her eye cal had to drive her to the hospital the big finish was a rocket that burst into the shape of a huge american flag blazing above the crowd smoke and the smell of gunpowder drifted everywhere eleven years later luther would associate that odor with the smell of gunsmoke from artillery in the first gulf war and then the show was over rick chambers the president of the student council murmured to luther that the fireworks had lasted about as long as it took to have sex everybody headed toward their cars or trucks but a lot of them knew that the festivities were just beginning and it wasnt just schoolkids who drove out of town to the gravel parking lot a lot of parents went there also and families came from nearby towns johnny whitlockthe captain of the football teamwas the guy whod thought of it johnny was always coming up with crazy schemes like suggesting that the homecoming dance should have a hawaiian theme because nobody ever left rostov so how could there be a home coming maybe the dance should be called the wish i could leave home dance that idea got only one votejohnnys another time he sneaked over to the school in the middle of the night and managed to reach the flagpole without being spotted by the janitor or a policeman driving past the next morning when the students arrived they found a mickey mouse flag grinning over the school the principal was furious at a hastily convened assembly he ranted that somebody had insulted not only the school but also the american flag and he demanded to know whod done it only luther and a few other kids had known it was johnny and of course none of them said a wordat least not until after that fourth of july when it no longer mattered lets do something big this summer johnny told luther and a halfdozen other kids after their final class of the school year they were eating burgers at the rib palace and luther said yeah like what you know theres nothing to do around here johnny chewed thoughtfully and grinned all we got around heres the lights right and that old ranch house where they made that james deacon movie cal bailey suggested who cares about that old dump the damned things falling apart no the lights are the only action weve got how many times have any of you tried to figure out what they are everybody shrugged it was a rite of passage that on your twelfth birthday you sneaked out of the house after your parents went to sleep you bicycled out to the parking lot where other kids were waiting to see if you had the guts to climb the fence and hike into the field to try to find what caused the lights that was tougher than it sounded because the field stretched all the way to mexico and it was easy to get lost out there in the dark not many kids actually saw the lights to begin with so most didnt even know what they were looking for which was why the older kids tried to make things scarier by calling them ghost lights before the birthday boy arrived other kids hid in the field when he climbed the fence and started into the darkness they raised lanterns but as soon as he headed in their direction they covered the lights that made him look around in confusion the next thing he saw other lightsmore lanternsand went toward them then they disappeared the joke ended when the kids with the lanterns couldnt keep from laughing but sometimes the kids who were hiding saw other lights and it was obvious that those lights couldnt be lanterns because some of them floated high off the ground they moved this way and that and merged and changed colors and kept getting larger and coming closer that was another way the joke endedwhen it suddenly wasnt funny and the kids with the lanterns decided it was time to go home that rite of passage ended after the fourth of july no one wanted to go into the field after that and when chief costigan came to town to replace his father whod been shot to death the field remained offlimits because the chief kept driving out there at night to try to figure out what the lights were sure we kidded around about the lights johnny said that june lowering his hamburger but the truth is nobody knows what they are theyre nothing jasper conklin said i bet ive been out there a hundred times never seen em once people who claim to see em are putting you on well ive seen em johnny said so have i luther added and my mom and dad have too lets make a difference and do something the townll remember for a long time johnny said lets find out what causes them lets have a ghost light hunt that was a typical johnny idea but the name had a nice shivery sound to it and he suggested that they do it after the shitty fourth of july fireworks and make a real celebration why not jasper said weve got nothing better to do they mentioned it around town and then parents heard about it and some of themespecially the editor of the weekly newspaper thought it might be interesting so the newspaper printed an article and the next thing there was a meeting in the high school gymnasium a lot of people didnt want anything to do with the huntthey were happy with the way things were and felt that some things shouldnt be explained but most of the people were tired of not knowing what was out there and a few had their own reasons for wanting the hunt to take place hell before he died my grandfather told me he saw the lights way back during the first world war josh mckinney said he owned rostovs only movie theater at the time the town was afraid they were german spies sneaking across the mexican border the army came out and couldnt figure what was going on so to be on the safe side they built that training field out there then they reactivated it during the second world war when the lights made the military nervous again all these years people around here have been trying to figure out what they are and no ones ever succeeded personally i dont think youre going to find out this time either but im all for trying cause when you fail itll only make the lights more mysterious and well get more tourists and more customers for your theater eh josh somebody joked from the crowd well i wouldnt turn down the chance to sell more popcorn the way josh grinned got a laugh and everybody started talking at once but the mayor didnt bother calling for order because it was clear there was going to be a ghost light hunt those in favor would work out the details on their own so that fourth of july hundreds of people gathered at the gravel parking lot outside town all those headlights blazing were a show of their own luther thought and the overwhelming rumble of that many engines mostly from pickup trucks was awesome johnny arrived on his motorcycle luther had a militarystyle jeep hed bought from a junkyard outside el paso a natural mechanic hed re built it and painted it yellow several cowboys arrived on horseback everybody was talking so much that waylan craigwho owned the hardware storeneeded to use a bullhorn to get everybodys attention shut off those engines his amplified voice struggled to compete with the noise of the vehicles a few people complied and then others before long luther could hear everything waylan said and shut off those headlights i didnt think id need sunglasses at this hour a couple of people chuckled and soon there were only enough headlights to keep people from stumbling around in the dark luther looked up into the cloudless sky and saw the stars of the milky way stretching brightly across the sky i brought eight sets of walkietalkies from my store waylan announced as soon as you get organized into groups ill hand em out naturally i d like em back when were finishedunless of course some of you want to buy a pair that got more chuckles youre supposed to have your own flashlights waylan continued his words echoing into the dark grassland but in case you forgot i brought some of those from my store also and you want them back too unless we decide to buy them somebody yelled from the crowd this week theyre on special even more chuckles it wasnt that waylan was funny a lot of people in the crowd had come with a supply of beer and most of the men were sipping from cans a few kept going back to their trucks to drink from bottles in paper bags luther noticed that some of the teenagers had beer cans too holding them close to their sides trying not to be obvious a breeze carried the smell of alcohol through the crowd as a result it took more than an hour to get organized somebody brought wire cutters from his truck and opened a wide section of the barbedwire fence well want to be sure to repair it after were done waylan said got any tools to sell us to do that somebody yelled four pairs of spotters were placed at strategic areas along the fence about seventyfive yards apart each pair had a telescope a compass and a walkietalkie people went through the gap in the fence and spread out in a line about thirty yards wide mayor ackerman took charge of the bullhorn once we get started just keep walking straight ahead use your walkietalkies to tell us if you see the lights as soon as we get every thing coordinated on a map well send trucks in that direction theyll get there so fast whatevers causing the lights wont have a chance to slip away my motorcyclell get there faster johnny said luther almost added and my jeep my horse can get to places nobody else can a cowboy said everybodys help is welcome the mayor assured them through the bullhorn those of you in the line dont use your flashlights un less you absolutely need to theyll ruin your night vision be sides his tone indicated he was about to make a joke we dont want to scare whatevers making those lights heck we may look as mysterious to them as they do to us but it didnt get a laugh and luther decided that some people in the crowd believed that the mayor was right finally a half hour before midnight everybody started well not everybody some people got tired and cold and went home others had too much to drink and fell asleep in their trucks lucky for them but the majority spread out carefully and started walking into the darkness of the rangeland happy fourth of july someone shouted luther stayed behind with johnny ready to drive into the field if anybody spotted anything for a while the backs of the people in the line were illuminated by the few remaining headlights but despite the cloudless sky the darkness of the field was murky and when they disappeared into the darkness it was like a magic trick a breeze cooled luthers face as he strained to detect any movement out there i see one a spotter exclaimed where his partner wanted to know no im wrong sorry everybody it was just a flashlight some body turned on and off another light flickered and vanished luther could tell that it too was from a flashlight then several lights flickered the temptation to see what was ahead on the ground was evidently contagious the off andon flashlights looked like giant fireflies bobbing and weaving out there a spotter yelled into his walkietalkie telling the people in the field turn off those flashlights youre making it hard for us to see whats beyond you cut the flashlights another spotter shouted gradually they went off and finally all luther saw was darkness the sky was another matter when he happened to look up he saw the flashing lights of an airliner speeding toward its distant destination another moving lightthis one not flashingprobably came from a satellite shit johnny said hugging himself if id known itd be this boring i never wouldve suggested coming out here im freezing my ass off this is worse than the stupid fireworks luther was about to agree when he glanced toward the grassland and something in him came to attention as a patch of darkness seemed to brighten a little probably just another flashlight he decided but it appeared to be far beyond where the searchers were likely to be and it was different from the darkness around it johnny luther pointed do you i see something a spotter announced so do i somebody else exclaimed so did luther definitely a ball of yellow light out there in the distance then a ball of green joined it they bobbed as if floating in water then merged into a single large ball that was red a few seconds later they drifted apart and there were three of them blue orange and a different shade of green luther realized that hed raised a hand to his right ear an almost undetectable highpitched sound irritated his eardrum it reminded him of a vibration hed heard when hed watched a man repair an old piano that was always stored in a corner of the schools gymnasium the man had taken a shiny metal object from his toolbox it had a stem and a twopronged fork he tapped it against the side of the piano and the fork vibrated with a hum allowing the man to adjust a wire in the piano until the tuning fork and the piano wire hummed identically luther heard something similar now like a note from an unusual sounding piano except that the barely perceptible vibration was annoying making him imagine a hot needle piercing each of his eardrums i see another one a spotter yelled two hundred degrees his companion shouted checking his compass one hundred and eighty someone farther along the fence yelled the other spotters made their reports a hundred and seventy a hundred and sixtyfive in a rush the mayor and two members of the town council leaned over the hood of a pickup truck one of them pressing down a map while another aimed a flashlight and the mayor drew lines on the paper they intersect at one seventyfive the mayor shouted he used a ruler to measure the distance on the map and compared it to the scale at the bottom looks to be about eight miles out he shouted into his walkietalkie standing nearby luther heard a crackly response from the mayors walkietalkie eight miles in the dark thatll take all night just keep the line going head for the lights and make sure nothing gets around you well send the trucks out now theyll get there in no time luther heard the sudden roar of an engine and realized that it was johnny kickstarting his motorcycle two trucks started up but johnny was the first through the gap in the fence he had his head light dimmed and when the trucks quickly followed they used only their parking lights even so luther could see the dust they raised and the red of their taillights revealed two horsemen riding close be hind them from the sound of the receding engines luther could tell that no body was speeding but in the dark with minimal lights speeding was a relative term twentyfive miles an hour would be plenty at once it occurred to him that hed been left behind his jeep didnt have a top he leaped over the door landed in the drivers seat and twisted the ignition key as the engine rumbled and his parking lights revealed the fence he steered into the gap his jeep had a stiff suspension bumping across the rough grassland jerked his head back man i hope the other kids saw me make that jump luther was reminded of an old movie that he loved to watch whenever it was on television bullitt it had the greatest car chase and steve mcqueen was the coolest driver ever but not even mcqueen could have done that jump better luthers front wheels jolted over rocks a jackrabbit raced across his path a night breeze ruffled his long hair he pulled a luminous compass from his shirt pocket took a quick glance down at it and aimed toward degrees the darkness formed a wall on either side even at this reduced speed luther had the sense of hurtling through space his faint lights allowed him to see only a hundred feet or so ahead of him combined with the shudder of the jeep over holes and rocks they made it difficult for him to keep a clear steady gaze on the area he aimed to ward the ghost lights were sometimes hard to see even if he was standing breathlessly still in the gravel parking lot but now he realized that under these conditions he couldnt hope to notice them unless he got very close abruptly he saw movement ahead the people in the line he realized silhouettes materialized they were scattered to the side as if theyd scrambled to get away from johnnys motorcycle and the trucks and the horsemen two people writhed in pain on the ground while someone yelled into a walkietalkie then luther saw a horse thrashing on the ground one of its legs bent at a sickening angle a cowboy lay beside it he wasnt moving the next second there were only rocks and clumps of grass and the elusive darkness beyond his parking lights as he hurried on if im not careful im going to run into somebody he realized wary he put on his headlights and gasped at the black cinderlike boulders that suddenly appeared before him they stretched all the way to the right if hed been going any faster hed have flipped the jeep as he steered sharply to the left and tore up dust that swirled around his head blocking his vision keep turning keep turning the damned badlands as he swung clear of the boulders coughing from the dust he noticed a glow ahead of him i must be closer to the lights than i realized they increased until they hurt his eyes quickly becoming larger and brighter at first he thought it was because he was gaining on them but as they intensified he realized that they were moving too theyre coming toward me luther didnt know why that frightened him the whole point of the hunt was to get close to the lights and explain what caused them but as they magnified he felt his stomach contract two of the lights werent colored though close to the ground they sped nearer with a start luther had the sick understanding that they were the headlights of a pickup truck its going to hit me he swerved to the right and felt the truck speed past him so closely that wind from it hurled grit into his eyes he braked hard and skidded over rocks and grass the jolt knocked his teeth together frantic he pawed at his eyes trying to regain his sight dust filled his lungs making him cough again then his vision became clear enough for him to see a panicked horse galloping toward him it didnt have a rider terrified luther raised his arms across his face certain the frothing animal would collide with the jeep he imagined the agony of its weight flipping onto him crushing him but at once the hooves thundered past he spun to look behind him farther back distant shouts were ac companied by bobbing flashlights that suddenly seemed everywhere the people in the line had heard the truck and the horse rushing to ward them and were running in every direction to avoid getting hit a woman screamed the horse wailed or could that terrible animal outcry possibly have come from a human being luther felt paralyzed by the chaos then the roar of another engine made him stare ahead again he saw the colored orbs chasing the headlights of a truck that veered to avoid luthers car angling sharply to his right a single headlight raced next to the truckjohnnys motorcycle continuing to veer to the right the truck smashed through a barbedwire fence and detached a sign that flipped through the air the sign nearly hit johnnys motorcycle luther knew exactly what the sign said hed seen identical ones on the fences that enclosed the area over there property of us military danger toxic chemicals unexploded ordnance the speeding taillights dimmed pursued by the colors which diminished as well until all luther saw was the darkness of the grassland a faroff rumble sounded like thunder several flashes might have been lightning on the horizon or fireworks from a distant town but luther had no doubt what really caused the rumble and the flashes despite the distance he thought he heard johnny screaming so the sign didnt exaggerate brent asked as they stood atop the brightly lit motor home and the crowd milled impatiently in the shadowy parking lot below anita continued to direct her camera to ward him and hamilton during the second world war there was an active military airfield in that area hamilton sounded as if he were in pain this areas so remote it was a perfect place for flight crews to practice bombing runs usually what they dropped didnt have detonators or explosives but sometimes it was the real thingto get the crews used to the shock waves not all the bombs exploded when they hit the ground after so many years the detonators became very unstable and your frienddid he survive johnny hamilton grimaced as if the memory belonged to yesterday he and two men in the pickup truck were blown apart when they drove over a couple of the bombs im sorry to hear that brent of course had already known it hamilton had told him about it earlier in the day but brent needed to put on a grave look of sympathy nobody dared go looking for them in the dark hamilton continued a local pilot went up at dawn she flew over the area and saw the wreckage and gave details about the location but even then a recovery team couldnt just rush in for fear of setting off other bombs it took them until midafternoon to get there he shook his head and looked as if he might be sick by then the coyotes had gotten to what was left of the bodies and brent decided it was time to change the subject the program was close to being a tabloid as it was without describing animals eating corpses and the lights what happened to them they just disappeared the next night they didnt come back and the night after that it was a couple of months before they returned you said the lights chased your friends motorcycle and the truck and the other truck and the two cowboys thats the way it looked to me of course it might have been an optical illusion during the investigation a psychiatrist claimed that everybody just got carried away that we saw the lights because we wanted to see them and when one person panicked everyone panicked i dont know what to believe that night the lights sure seemed real and they sure seemed to have a will of their own they scared one of the horses so bad it broke its leg and another threw its rider and bolted away that was the horse i saw galloping toward me the cowboy broke an arm and his collarbone and what about you from what youve said the lights didnt bother you i sat in the darkness for a long time trying to figure out what id seen i tried to tell myself that my eyes had played tricks on me but if i was seeing some kind of hallucination johnny and the guys in the pickup truck must have seen exactly the same hallucination why else would they have been driving so fast to get away when i finally got the strength to turn the jeep around and go back to this parking lot i realized that my shirt collar was wet wet with blood what hamilton hadnt told him about this before there was a sound a sound high pitched almost impossible to hear it felt like a hot needle against my eardrums they broke broke my eardrums blood flowed out of my ears i couldnt hear any thing for three months my doctor was afraid id be permanently deaf its amazing how much of that night i shut out of my memory talking about this again hamilton actually looked as if he were going to cry time to wrap this up brent thought he pointed toward the darkness and now all these years later another tragedy has happened be cause of the lights were going to take a short break as soon as we come back well train our cameras on the area behind me and try to find some answers about i see one somebody in the crowd shouted where over there to the right i see it too brent felt the motor home shake as the crowd pressed in that direction look a half dozen of them brent sensed anita moving forward with the camera where someone shouted i still dont see them to the right someone else yelled brent stared in the direction a lot of people were pointing all he saw was darkness he hoped that the camera operators on the ground and in the chopper were following his instructions and focusing on the crowd the people were the story their reactions were becoming frenzied yes my god theyre beautiful a woman exclaimed at once brent saw something in the distance six lights appeared to float they converged in pairs then separated i see them brent said to the viewers at home this is extraordinary youre the first live audience ever to view the mysterious rostov lights anita was next to him now aiming the camera toward the lights the intense look on her face told brent that she was getting fabulous images perhaps this will help us understand what causes them he told his audience that isnt them hamilton interrupted brent continued perhaps well be able to im telling you those arent the rostov lights hamilton insisted but i can see them theyre obviously out there headlights what youre looking at the road from mexico those are the headlights of cars driving along the highway the road goes up and down over there thats why the headlights seem to float a lot of people have been fooled by that road but the lights dont look anything like that besides its the wrong direction thats southwest you need to look southeast over there a man yelled as one the crowd turned southeast and the winnebago shook again several pointed emphatically there brent turned to stare in this new direction and felt overwhelmed the first thing he noticed were the colors hed grown up in michigan one disturbing summer night when he was ten hed been out side after dark and had seen countless ribbons of colors rippling across the sky theyd radiated from the north and filled the heavens eerily lustrous swirling as if alive hed run into the house and warned his mother were going to die what the skys on fire its the end of the world his father had died from a heart attack six months earlier that was probably why death had been on brents mind when his mother had finally realized what was happening shed held his hand and made him go outside with her hed struggled with her no itll kill us theres no reason to be afraid what youre seeing is the aurora borealis the what the northern lights i heard an explanation for them once apparently theyre magnetic rays from the sun reflecting off the polar ice cap what brent saw nowoff in the distancemade him feel as if the northern lights had been squeezed into seven shimmering orbs their iridescent colors kept changing rippling from within giving the impression that something churned at their cores their shimmer was hypnotic as they drifted and floated sank and rose and hovered even though they were far away brent tried to reach out and touch them many in the crowd felt the same they reached toward the darkness get out of my way a man yelled youre blocking the view somebody complained move a woman insisted i need to get closer i need to be cured stop shoving no dont everyone surged toward the fence cant breathe people slammed against the motor home as it shook brent had trouble keeping his balance when even more people surged it trembled violently he reached out for something to hold him up but all he grasped was air the next time the winnebago shook his knees gave way suddenly he was in the air plummeting toward the crowd he fell between bodies struck the gravel and groaned from the mass of people charging over him earl halloway sat in the harshly lit surveillance room beneath the observatorys dishes hed just swallowed six aspirins for a total of a half bottle today but he still couldnt control his headache his stomach burned the hum from the facilitys generator or the dishes or whatever the hell caused it became louder making him grind his teeth to try to relieve the pressure behind his ears this wasnt halloways shift but there was no way he could contain himself enough to watch a movie on the computer in his room hed attempted to turn off the lights and lie in bed with a wet washcloth over his closed eyes but the headache was too excruciating for him to lie still so hed come to the security office in the hope that doing something useful would distract him from it the harsh lights only made the pressure in his head more intense are you okay one of the other guards asked why wouldnt i be you look like hell halloway had given up trying to make anybody else understand about the hum no one else seemed to hear it every days the same we keep looking at those monitors nothing ever happens thats the way i like it the second guard said youd rather have somebody attack us just for the excitement maybe you didnt get shot at enough over in iraq as if terrorists care about an observatory the first guard said i have no idea what were doing here but the pays good you got that right the pays good so earl just shut up and quit complaining the nightviewing function on the cameras outside had been activated several hours earlier on the monitors the dishes the fences the scrub grass the dirt the miles and miles of godforsaken nothingall of it was tinted green one of the screens showed three coyotes loping by their body heat made them glow brightly on a different screen a jackrabbit jerked its head up sensing the coyotes the rabbit bounded away in a panic it too glowed unnaturally moments later a third screen showed the coyotes chasing the rabbit through the green darkness who says nothing ever happens the first guard asked any bets on who wins my moneys on the rabbit the second guard answered how much oops too late just as well you didnt have time to make your bet halloway scowled at the screen man even blood looks green on those nightvision images he stood and walked toward the door way stumbling slightly get some sleep the second guard said if only halloway left the room and walked along the stark corridor his bootsteps echoed irritably the door to the data analysis area was closed wincing from his headache he put his left ear against it youre not supposed to be in here the researcher named gordon had told him after halloway had made an effort to be friends with him gordons eyes had looked stern behind his spectacles this areas off limits you belong in the surveillance room try to be nice to people and they treat you like shit halloway thought he pressed his ear harder against the cold metal door all he heard was the hum throughout the afternoon hed made yet another effort to find what caused it hed searched every room in the facility the latrines the sleeping quarters the kitchen the mess hall the generator room the exercise room the surveillance roomand yet again he hadnt found any answers i didnt get a chance to check the research area again he thought darkly that son of a bitch gordon decided i wasnt good enough to be allowed in there any longer the hum filled halloways head the only time he hadnt been in pain was last night when hed listened to the musicthe wonderful music that made him feel he was dancing with the most beautiful woman hed ever seen smelling her cinnamon hair tasting orange juice and vodka he gripped the doorknob and turned it nothing happened that bastard gordon had locked it halloway banged on the door but didnt get a response he hammered louder down the hall one of the guards leaned his head out from the surveillance room what are you doing whats it look like we were told to stay out of there i thought i heard somebody shouting for help halloway pounded so hard that his fist throbbed but the pain was nothing compared to his headache suddenly the door was yanked open standing in the harsh lights of the research area gordon glared from behind his tortoiseshell glasses his face was bright red whats the matter with you damn it follow orders halloway stared past him toward the other researchers amid banks of glowing electronic instruments they all wore earphones a headsetpresumably gordonswas lying on a table youre listening to the music arent you but you didnt let me know you have no idea what youre interfering with unless you want to lose your job leave us alone gordon started to close the door halloway pressed a hand against it and stopped him thats what youre doing right youre listening to the music gordon put more effort into closing the door halloway rammed it open knocking him back hey gordon shouted halloway stalked past him approaching the table the other researchers thought he was coming at them and stumbled away but all he cared about was the earphones faintly the music drifted from them the wonderful soothing music gordon you brought it back but you didnt tell me of course we didnt tell you youre just a damned guard i tried to be friends halloway said what friendship doesnt mean anything to you what are you talking about a guard appeared in the doorway he held an m is everything all right lock this man up until a helicopter comes to fly him out of here gordon said hes fired halloway picked up the earphones the guard came over you heard him earl they want you out of here halloway raised the earphones toward his head the guard gripped his left forearm the music isnt our business earl make this easy for everybody lets go halloway put down the earphones the guard looked relieved good well just let these people do their work halloway punched the guard in the throat uhhhh the guard dropped the m and raised both hands to his smashed larynx halloway picked up the rifle and fired a threeshot burst into gordons face the tortoiseshell glasses disintegrated hearing screams behind him he turned and saw the other scientists scrambling for cover aim away from the equipment he warned himself when the second guard rushed into the room halloway shot him in the chest the panicked scientists ran for the door relieved that their direction took them away from the equipment he shot all of them in the back he picked up the second guards m and checked to make sure that its magazine was full as he stepped into the corridor he saw taggard running toward him halloway blew his head off he searched the facility and shot two maintenance workers crouching behind boxes in a storage room he found a female scientist hiding beneath a bunk and shot her also throughout he was conscious of the terrible hum he returned to the research area satisfied himself that the first guard was finally dead and put on the earphones his headache vanished as the music drifted and floated beneath the airbase raleigh unlocked a metal door and stepped into a room that he hadnt visited for three years the smell of dankness and must hung in the air he saw tiny red and white lights that might have been the eyes of animals but when he flicked a switch on the wall overhead lamps revealed that they belonged to a vast array of electronic instruments stacked on floortoceiling shelves needles pulsed and dials glowed as he examined them closely he saw that they registered an unusually high level of activity perfect he thought when he had personally supervised the installation of this array the equipment had been stateoftheart since then major advances had made it necessary to supplement all the instruments with serious updates that his team had brought even so the existing equipment was doing its job amplifying energy from the source and transmit ting it through the dish concealed in the wreckage of the hangar above him that camouflaged dish was synchronized with the horizontal dish at the observatory tomorrow night the signal would be amplified even more and beamed through a vertical dish that pointed toward a satellite in previous experiments the links had failed sometimes with disastrous results but given the improved electronics that his team was installing and the unusually powerful energy the source was giving off raleigh believed that this time he would finally be able to complete a journey that hed begun as a boy inspired by his grandfather he pressed a button and activated a row of surveillance monitors in nightvision green they showed the ruined hangars as well as the area around the airbase the superior lenses on the hidden cameras allowed him to magnify images impressively he watched the dog handler and the german shepherd patrolling the fence he switched his attention to the viewing area down the road where the crowd was out of control charging toward the fence he hadnt counted on having human test subjects the fact that there were hundreds of them provided an even greater benefit but what really mattered he knew were the test subjects hed brought with him the reaction of the men on his team would deter mine whether or not the project could be reliably continued they didnt know that by setting up the experiment they were crucial parts of it a shoe struck brents forehead for a moment his vision turned gray keep the cameras rolling he shouted into his lapel mike as people trampled over him he worried that the director in the stations control room would stop the broadcast if he thought that brent was being seriously injured on camera so he did his best to sound in control from brents perspective on the gravel everything was a blur of pant legs and dresses the truth was he felt smothered another shoe struck him this time on the side of his neck he wheezed and rolled trying to get away from the mob the gravel tore at him his shoulder banged against the underside of the motor home desperate he squirmed beneath the vehicle as far as he could manage from this vantage point he saw shoes boots and pant legs rushing past the side of his neck throbbed any closer to my throat and i might have been killed he thought suddenly the crowd was gone and he crawled from under the truck im okay im okay he shouted into the microphone god i hope the helicopters getting a shot of this he thought the left sleeve of his suit coat was torn open blood trickled from his forehead hearing shouts and screams from the crowd he was about to climb to the top of the motor home and continue broadcasting but abruptly he saw anita and luther hamilton lying on the gravel the camera was on its side its red light still on he ran to anita and heard her groan are you okay can you stand he asked urgently i need to get you away from this crowd he put one of her arms around his neck and raised her she wavered come on ill take you where its safe the producer and his crew scrambled from the truck brent gave anita to them and hurried over to luther hamilton who coughed and struggled to crawl brent helped him stand and guided him to ward the back of the truck we need an ambulance thats for sure the producer pointed brent turned and gaped at a halfdozen people lying on the gravel at the back of the parking lot people charged against each other pushing toward the darkness beyond the fence i see them theyre beautiful out of my way cant breathe brent picked up anitas camera and gave it to the producer do you remember how to use one of these you bet i even keep paying my union dues then follow me to the top of the winnebago brent grabbed the toppled ladder and propped it against the truck the tremor in his right hand alarmed him feeling faint he struggled up at the top he noted that the stations helicopter had activated its landing lights illuminating the crowd hoarse from the blow to the side of his throat he spoke into his lapel mike describing what he saw the people at the back are forcing everyone ahead those in the middle are being crushed the ones in front are being squeezed against the barbedwire fence brent heard wood cracking i think the fence is about to several posts snapped the fence collapsed the people in front dropped with it screaming as they fell onto the barbed wire the rest of the crowd surged over their backs charging into the field in the distance the lights continued to shimmer i hear a sound brent said into his microphone luther hamilton mentioned that sometimes a sound accompanies the lights i wonder if thats happening now no im wrong the sound has nothing to do with the lights its standing next to a car at the side of the dark road page gaped toward the observation area where the crowd was out of control if hed been alone hed have run to help the police although he couldnt imagine how even ten times as many officers would be able to handle what he was witnessing right now tori was all he cared about you were right to stay away from the crowd he said he turned she wasnt next to him he frowned toward the shadowy road then stepped toward the space between the parked cars but he still didnt see her tori he hurried back to her saturn she wasnt inside he studied the darkness on the far side of the row of parked cars no sign of her tori page doubted that shed have gone toward the crowd which had become a single mass that was trampling over the barbedwire fence crushing people and disappearing into the night but if she hadnt gone in that direction there was only one other possibility thunder rumbled page swung toward the murky grassland and ran toward it tori had been right when shed guessed that the observation area was an arbitrary spot from which to try to see the lights they could be detected from other points along the road and tonight to his surprise hed had no trouble spotting them when tori had pointed excitedly toward the dark horizon hed seen them immediately i must have learned to see them he thought the way i learned to see the cuttlefish or am i just fooling myself in the distance the colors bobbed and drifted not only did page see them much more quickly than on the previous night but he also saw them more clearly it was as if a haze had been removed from his eyes radiant they swirled far away and yet close his skin seemed to ripple tori thunder rumbled louder the storm approaching rapidly page made his way toward the fence thanks to his pilot training he knew that the best way to see at night was to try to detect objects from the periphery of his vision staring straight ahead at something in the darkness achieved less results than if he worked to detect it from the corners of his eyes because the eye cells designed for night vision known as rods were located on the eyes perimeter he looked obliquely past the barbed wire to his right he heard shouts from the viewing area over there wraithlike shadows moved farther into the grassland attracted to the lights he also heard groans damn it i told you to stop shoving me someone yelled lightning flashed revealing silhouettes in a struggle a man punched another man in the stomach when the second man doubled over the first man knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the head other people grappled in similar frenzied fights so many that page knew he couldnt stop them then darkness swooped back seeming deeper than before because pages night vision was compromised unable to wait for his eyes to adjust he gripped a post and climbed it using the barbed wire as a ladder jumping to the ground on the other side his holstered hand gun dug into him tori a sudden wind hurled dust into his face he raised his left arm to shield his eyes and moved forward into the murky field scrub grass crunched under his sneakers a drop of rain struck his nose he almost tripped over a rock when he regained his balance he shifted ahead and tried to continue in a straight line toward the distant lights the dust made him shut his eyes for a moment more drops of rain pelted his forehead the next flash of lightning revealed silhouettes closer ahead once the crowd had reached the field everyone had separated desperate to avoid the crush of people that had propelled them over the toppled fence they looked confused as if they suddenly realized where they were thunder shook pages chest then he was sightless again over whelmed by darkness the next moment the storm unloaded the force of the downpour making him stoop shockingly cold it enveloped him obliterating the distant lights without them he had no bearings even the lights back at the observation platform were no longer visible tori gusts whipped his face his wet clothes clung to his skin the cold rain making him shiver the next flash of lightning struck nearby he saw its multiple forks and heard a crack the twosecond blaze of light revealed a figure stumbling ahead of him then darkness enveloped him again propelled by thunder he shifted toward where his memory told him hed seen the figure abruptly they collided he knew at once that the figure was tori ten years of marriage made it impossible for him not to be able to recognize the feel of her body in the dark thank god i found you he said come on we need to get back to the car no the rumble of thunder made him think he hadnt heard her correctly what leave me alone youre not safe out here page gripped toris hand but the rain slicked her skin and she was able to pull away rushing from him tori he yelled we need to get back to the car for a panicked moment page couldnt see her then lightning revealed her outline and he charged after her tori you could get killed out here page grabbed her shoulders standing behind her he tried to turn her in the direction from which hed come she rammed her elbow into his stomach knocking him away the unexpected blow made him struggle to breathe holding him self he realized that shed disappeared again the next time lightning flashed he saw that shed gone much farther than hed expected he ran to catch up to her again he grabbed her from behind but this time his arms pinned her elbows to her sides he linked his hands around her stomach and lifted her trying to carry her backward she kicked her heels against his knees when the pain in his legs made him drop her she spun you bastard dont take me away from the lights again again if youd let me stay if you hadnt grabbed me and shoved me into the car stunned page realized she thought he was someone else tori im not your father all i want to do is see the lights you son of a bitch youre always yelling at mom youre always trying to touch me page was shocked by this further revelation tori your father died a long time ago its me your husband i love you lightning showed her frenzied features as she drew back her fist drenched by the rain he waited for the blow her fist struck his mouth his head jerked back but as he tasted blood he kept his feet in place preparing himself for what he knew would be another blow she drew back her fist again then darkness made her disappear the next time lightning flashed page saw her staring at him in shock her shoulders heaved some of the drops streaming down her face werent rain he suspected but tears her mouth opened releasing a wail of anguish when she clutched him pressing herself against him she did so with the force of a blow her arms clung to him tightly with her head pressed against his chest she sobbed uncontrollably scared she moaned he could barely hear her in the roar of the wind and the rain im scared too but its going to be all right he promised tasting the blood from his swelling lip ill do anything for you please let me help i dont know whats happening to me i dont know whats happening to me either page said close to her cheek but believe me were going to find out with his arm around her he waited for the next crack of lightning it split the sky so close to them that he flinched but its blaze allowed him to orient himself behind him he briefly saw the shape of the observation area and began to recognize the faint illumination of headlights and flashing emergency lights tori must have seen them as well as thunder coincided with renewed darkness she plodded forward through the gusting rain page took her hand and moved next to her if the lightning didnt provide more visual bearings they risked going in circles in the field the ground became muddy their sneakers sinking into it cold tori murmured think of a hot bath page told her dry clothes steaming coffee warm covers in bed lost tori said then were lost together lightning fractured the sky tori pointed the fence their shoes were weighed down by mud they slipped in it holding each other up when they reached the fence page shouted to be heard above the wind ill pull the strands of wire apart try to squeeze through the gap as he used both hands to yank a middle strand up while pressing down on a lower one with his muddy sneaker he feared that lightning would strike the fence rush along the wires and fry both of them im through tori yelled page climbed the post and jumped to the ground where he skidded in the mud falling to his right knee lightning cracked close enough for him to smell it are you okay tori asked i will be in a minute page came to his feet down the road headlights glared revealing the row of cars and people hurrying for shelter gusts of rain buffeted them some wore ripped clothes and held themselves as if injured youre sure youre okay tori shouted better than the way they look page answered he and tori ran along the line of cars until they reached the saturn inside tori already had the keys from her pocket she turned on the engine and started the heater but the rush of air was cold and she quickly shut it off as rain lashed the windshield page shivered toris teeth clicked together her red hair was stuck to her head water dripped from her blouse her muddy clothes clinging to her behind them more headlights blazed as cars pulled out of the line retreating to rostov thunder shook the car tori wiped blood from his mouth im so sorry she told him page touched her hand it wasnt really you who hit me the past few days i feel like i stepped out of my life i dont understand myself any longer what the hell is happening whatever it is its happening to both of us page held her grateful that she let him he loved her so much that he could barely speak well find out together three eye of the beholder chilled by his drenched clothes brent stood at the back window of the broadcast truck and stared into the murky rain behind him anita and luther hamilton slumped against a wall sipping tepid coffee from plastic cups the news producer watched as a technician and a cameraman finished stowing the equipment time to head back to the motel lightning flashed showing brent the last of the crowd hurrying desperately through the rain toward their cars several limped or held themselves in pain i wish we could get a shot of that im not sending any camera operator out in that lightning the producer said the storms predicted to last several hours nothing else is going to happen here tonight its time to get some sleep who needs sleep when theres a story this big and who needs a reporter who passes out from exhaustion wheres sharon brent asked with suspicion back at the motel shes resting so she can anchor the morning broadcast from here no way ill coanchor with her not unless you get some rest i know you want to show viewers how hard youre working but youre starting to look scary when the truck started making the floor unsteady brent sat next to anita and fastened his seat belt are you hurt bruised you did good work today and last night anita emphasized something flashed in her dark eyes and last night brent acknowledged tomorrow morning are you ready to do more my car still needs repairs anitas face was pinched with fatigue she peered up from under her baseball cap toward the producer am i still getting overtime you bet cnn is underwriting our expenses the truck bumped as the driver steered onto the road but i dont know what else is left in the story the producer said after what happened tonight the police say theyre shutting down the viewing area nobodyll be allowed there tomorrow night maybe not for a long time to come the police can try but after what we transmitted just now therell be plenty more curiosity seekers here tomorrow brent said itll be saturday people will make a weekend of it they wont like coming a long way and not getting a chance to see the lights cops barricades an angry crowdall that makes for great television tomorrow night the producer agreed but what about in the meantime lots of angles i need to track down the woman who killed the shooter also somebody told me theres a radio observatory around here i bet i can tie that in somehowextraterrestrials or whatever and i want to find out more about that airbase from world war ii maybe we can get a shot of where that kid got himself blown up back in johnny hamilton murmured what his name was johnny right the producer said brent if you start wandering around that air field youre liable to get blown up too he looked thoughtful you know that would make a great story raleigh heard the faint rumble of thunder but apart from some water trickling down a wall the area beneath the abandoned airbase remained secure in the cold glare of the overhead lights he watched his men finish unpacking the last of the wooden crates sergeant lockhart reassemble the team yes sir within seconds they again stood before him in a line gentlemen through the door behind you youll find latrines and your sleeping quarters although you wont spend much time in the latter theres a kitchen but it isnt stocked for now youll need to make do with the field rations you unpacked when the next black hawk arrives at the observatory itll bring steaks part of the reason you were chosen for this assignment is that youre experts in electronics behind the door to your right youll find a monitoring station it was stateoftheart three years ago the equipment we brought will bring it up to speed but before you install it i want you to take the closedcircuit cameras you unpacked and mount them on overhead corners in every room and corridor i want every inch of this facilityincluding the latrinesto be visible on surveillance screens and every second of what happens down here to be recorded if were going to make history it needs to be documented each of you will wear your sidearm at all times youll also make sure that one of the ms you unpacked is close to you wherever you go in addition youll wear shooters earplugs raleigh noted the puzzled look lockhart gave him sergeant do you have a question sir are you expecting us to come under attack just taking precautions given the instability weve seen outside as far as the earplugs are concerned there are certain audio characteristics to this project that can have lets call them damaging effects a door opened behind raleigh he turned to see one of the team members bringing in the dog trainer and the german shepherd theyd come down via a stairwellits electronically controlled hatch was concealed among the hangars piles of wreckage all three were soaked any problems up there raleigh asked no sir the dog trainer responded nobody came near this area the crowd was too distracted by what was happening at the viewing area down the road things got crazy there then the storm started and everybody left through that door youll find dry clothes thank you sir as the trainer and the german shepherd left the area raleigh motioned for lockhart to come over raleigh kept his voice low if the dog acts strangely in any way no matter how slight yes sir shoot it the saturns windshield wipers flapped heavily in the strengthening downpour that pounded the roof and obscured the headlights shivering tori almost missed the motels entrance she turned drove through rainchurned puddles and stopped at unit after she and page ran to the door page unlocked it and held it open for her with out entering go ahead take a bath he said put on some warm clothes ill drive back to the rib palace and get some hot coffee for us but youre as cold as i am why should i go first that isnt fair the last thing you need is to get sick before your surgery how about hot soup you want some tori barely hesitated yes that would be great page hurried back through the drenching rain and got into the car turning up the heater fifteen minutes later he returned setting styrofoam containers of coffee and soup on the units small table the bathroom door was closed hearing the splash of water in the tub he quickly took off his dripping clothes the room didnt have a closet but it did have hangers on a rod he hung his clothes there and dried himself with a blanket he found on a shelf even with the blanket draped around him he couldnt stop shaking he hadnt packed a lot of clothes and was forced to put on the jeans and shirt hed worn the night before they still had the odor of smoke but at least they were dry when tori came out of the bathroom she found him huddled under the covers of his bed trying to keep his fingers steady while he used both hands to grip his container of coffee she wore her usual tshirt and boxer shorts her toweldried hair was combed back your turn somehow the idea of getting wet again doesnt appeal to me i think ill wait until im a little warmer i still feel shaky what kind of soup did you get in a place like the rib palace they had only one choicethey call it fiery beef sounds like exactly what i need she pulled a blanket off her bed wrapped it around her and sat at the table opening the container of soup watching her page sipped his coffee and felt the hot liquid against his bruised lip she didnt say anything all the while she ate spooning the soup quickly then she opened the coffee and while she drank it she remained silent finally she turned to him her features strained with confusion if it hadnt been for the storm id have walked forever to try to reach the lights no page said if it hadnt been for me i couldnt resist they seemed to be calling me he considered what shed said then gave her an extremely direct look lets pack and get out of here not tomorrow right now we can be at your mothers house by morning are you ready to do that tori lowered her head and didnt reply in effect giving him an answer he remembered what had happened in the field after what she had said and done to him he wasnt about to try to force her to leave he wasnt even certain he could force her to leave so he came to a decision in that case i need to be a cop a while longer this has gone way past the point where i can just let things keep controlling us im going to find out whats going on page jerked awake struck anew by the stark reality of what tori had told him about her cancer and by what had happened the night before so much to adjust to sunlight crept past the cheap drapes but he didnt feel at all rested even though a glance at the bedside clock showed him that the time was and that hed slept another twelve hours this time tori remained in her bed groggy he went into the bathroom softly closed the door and shaved running the water as little as possible trying not to make noise when he came out tori was putting on a pair of slacks sorry if i woke you he said it wasnt a good sleep the same with me he touched the shirt and jeans that hed put on a hangar still wet he glanced down at the clothes hed slept in wrinkled they continued to retain the odor of the fire two nights earlier looks like we need to do some shopping tori concluded when they stepped from the room and faced the harsh sunlight page was troubled by the number of vehicles streaming past the motelmany more than on the previous day it took even longer for tori to find a break in the traffic and steer the saturn onto the road in town the streets were filled with cars all the parking spaces were occupied tori let page out in front of a store called the out fitter where there were so many tourists that he had to wait fifteen minutes to pay for new clothes it took another fifteen minutes to get into a dressing room he put on a pair of pants a tshirt and a shirt to wear over itsomething that would conceal his handgun when he came out with his old clothes in a shopping bag he heard a customer talking to a female clerk do people really see lights around here yes the clerk answered but its been years since i went looking for them arent you curious what they are the customer asked when i was a kid but i got used to them as page walked toward the front of the store he heard another customer telling a different clerk my wife has diabetes we heard this place makes miracles happen like at lourdes if she sees the lights shell be cured page went out to the sidewalk where tori was waiting with two sandwiches and two bottles of water from a restaurant next door cured he thought wouldnt that be nice they ate while they walked three blocks to the hospital there tori again paused nervously on the hot steps outside the entrance another day closer to the start of the rest of your life page tried to reassure her she took a breath and forced herself to go in upstairs in the brightly lit hallway the sharp odor of disinfectant seemed stronger as they walked toward costigans room the chief s familiar raspy voice came from it telling someone god help us if the next riot spreads to town how many people were injured twentythree a different voice answered twelve got gashed pretty bad on the barbedwire fence and the others six were almost trampled to death the rest were hurt in fights page was uncomfortable eavesdropping he motioned for tori to follow him as he stepped into the doorway their footsteps made a man turn in their direction he was in his fifties stocky with a sunburned complexion his sport coat had a western cut and a zigzag design over the left and right breast he wore a large belt buckle and held a cowboy hat sorry to interrupt page said we just wanted to see how chief costigan was doing a lot better thanks propped up in bed costigan looked less gray his mustache now had some contrast with his skin and the heart and bloodpressure monitors were gone the iv tube had been removed from his arm although the thick bandage remained around his skull they say theyll let me go home tomorrow as long as i remember not to bang my head against anything this is hank wagner he runs the drugstore in town more to the point hes also our mayor which at the moment he wishes he wasnt page shook hands with wagner dan page this is my wife tori the chief told me about you youre the couple who saved those people on the bus thursday night youre the woman who seeing her discomfort the mayor said well were grateful for what you did without your help the situation could have been even worse he looked at his watch youll have to excuse me i need to get to an emergency town council meeting they watched him leave and then redirected their attention toward costigan do you really feel better tori asked the headaches not as bad and i dont have damned needles sticking into me the doctor finally took me off a diet of broth and jello costigan pointed toward pages bruised mouth looks like youre one of the people who got hurt last night things were a little crazy can i ask you a question you can ask costigans voice hung in the air suggesting but i might not answer the man who killed your father for a moment costigans pained eyes focused on the past what about him you said hed come to rostov only a couple of months earlier hed lost his job in fort worth when the factory he worked for moved to mexico he couldnt find anything else one of his relatives lived here and managed to get him a job at the stock pens you also said he was a drinker that he got in arguments in bars his wife buttoned her collars and wore long sleeves even on hot daysto hide her bruises thats right in your place given what happened to your father id have looked into every aspect of the case id have gone to fort worth and talked to people who knew the husband when the family lived there did you find out if his behavior changed after he came to rostov costigan considered him for a moment yeah youre a good police officer well you know as well as i do its all about asking the right questions costigan nodded i did some digging the husbands behavior definitely got worse after he came here hed always had a short tem per especially when he drank but here it became more extreme people who knew him in fort worth figured he got bitter about being forced to leave the big city and live in the middle of nowhere did you buy that theory i had a different one and thats the real reason you wanted me to keep my gun in my suitcase when i went to the observation area to find out what tori was doing there isnt that correct correct what am i missing tori asked costigan looked at her people either like it here right away or else they hate it you saw that on thursday night some got out of their cars and were open to seeing the lights while others couldnt wait to get back on the road a few were actually angry because they couldnt see what others claimed to see its like the way magnets can repel each other as much as attract did the man who shot your father ever go out there to look at the lights page asked he tried several times he finally decided that the people who told him about the lights were trying to make a fool of him and you were worried that if i didnt see the lights id get angry as angry as the man who shot your father yes why didnt you tell me you wouldnt have understood what i was talking about how could i possibly have explained it i told you on the phoneyou needed to see for yourself or not see page added costigan made a gesture of futility theres no way to predict wholl see the lights and who wont or how theyll react even those who dont see the lights the chief rubbed his bandaged forehead do you suppose its possible to feel the lights without actually seeing them yesterday you told us they were only a mirage caused by a temperature inversion tori reminded him that i did but now you seem to think theyre a lot more a temperature inversion sure thats the rational explanation but one thing ive learned in more than twenty years as a police officer is that human beings arent rational harriett wards antiques store was crammed with browsers after the glare of the afternoon sun page found the interior shadows soothing he noted that a man had taken down one of the antique rifles page had seen on the wall the evening before the man worked the vintage firearms lever and aimed the gun toward the ceiling just like the rifle james stewart used in that western he told his female companion winchester hard to imagine this was made just after the civil war what are they charging for it twentyeight hundred dollars my god thats a steal but i dont think we can afford it the woman said gas and food cost so much next week bobbys nursery school bill is due and hey you dont see bargains like this every day well put it on one of our credit cards page looked toward the opposite side of the store and saw an older woman with short white hair and a leather vest harriett ward as he and tori went over she was talking to a couple about a wooden cabinet that had large iron handles on the doors i found it in a village in mexico its made of mesquite which is about as hard as wood can get and not be like these metal handles she noticed page and tori and nodded five minutes later she made her way over to them ive never had so many people in the store at one time she said well at least theres an upside to whats been happening tori said everybody wants a twenty percent discount and free shipping someone tried to buy the antique light fixtures and got upset when i said i needed them someone else got upset when i told her i didnt have a public restroom she made a fuss when i wouldnt let her into my apartment so she could use my private bathroom im glad for the business but id forgotten how difficult people can be a woman approached them she had big blond hair and wore an ornate costume that made her look like a country singer janice thanks for coming in to help harriett said no problem the woman laughed and spread her sequined green skirt i figured id wear something the outofstate customers will re member theyll go home and say we all dress like were in one of those old westerns where everybody sang when they werent shooting bad guys do you think you and viv can handle the store for a while of course we know what to do just dont sell the light fixtures laughing at what she thought was a joke janice went to greet a customer harriett led page and tori through the door in back entered her sparsely furnished living room locked the door closed her eyes and inhaled deeply when she finally opened her eyes she said youre here to talk about what happened last night if youre too busy we can come back later tori said no come with mei want to show you something harrietts pickup truck headed along the now familiar route youre taking us back to the viewing area page asked he sat against the passenger door with tori next to him past it harriett answered ahead more cars were parked along both shoulders of the road flatbed trucks had concrete barriers on them a crane was lifting the barriers and placing them in a line along the entrance to the viewing area forming a high wall two men in suits supervised the work their hard hats contrasted with the cowboy hats of medrano and an other highway patrol officer looks like theyre shutting the place off harriett said if theyre smart theyll take down the shelter altogether along with the historical marker and load the portable toilets onto those trucks i never approved of what the county did here the lights shouldnt be a tourist stop i dont care about the business outsiders bring to town keep the lights a secret let people discover them if theyre meant to if theyre meant to tori asked do you think these people deserve to see the lights most cant the others arent capable of appreciating what theyre lucky enough to see there was a tone in her voice that page hadnt heard before people filled the road complaining about the tall barricade harriett was forced to stop the truck quit blocking traffic page heard medrano yell reluctantly the crowd parted harriett drove on passing the parked cars beyond barbedwire fences scrub grass stretched in both directions five miles later she steered toward a gate on the left page got out opened the gate waited for the truck to drive through then resecured the gate they drove along a dirt road the heat of the day had dried the puddles from the previous nights storm dust rose in small clouds to mark their passing the rugged grassland extended toward the distant mountains the vast area so flat and treeless that only the grazing cattle provided variation in the landscape wait page thought peering into the distance somethings out there he saw a speck at the end of the road leaning forward he tried to identify what it was as the truck drove nearer the speck became larger its a building tori said curious why do i feel like ive been here before page frowned recalling his sense of déjà vu when hed flown over the cattle and the windmill on his approach to rostov hed also felt it when hed first driven along the towns main street the building became more identifiableand more puzzling it was an impressive threestory ranch house a covered porch stretched along its wide front several chimneys projected from its roofline a square tower rose on the right corner ending in a cupola that made the house look like a castle but as majestic as the place appeared it had a brooding gothic quality ive seen this house before tori told page abruptly she made the connection birthright of course page said thats why everything looked familiar when i flew here this is the house captain medrano was talking about the one mullen took the tour to see page remembered when a restored version of birthright had been shown in theaters to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary he and tori had heard so much about the classic filmwhich had seldom appeared on televisionthat theyd made a point of seeing it we love that movie tori said yeah it really makes an impression harriett replied the house becoming more distinct as she drove toward it people here in texas sure admired it they couldnt stand the novel which they thought looked down on them but they felt that the movie showed their strength and determination not to mention the vastness of the countryside no fakelooking computer effects in those days when you saw a hundred thousand head of cattle every one of them was real the miles and miles of ranchland the endless sky i dont think a movie has ever looked so big as big as the state and the actors matched the bigness of the movie james deacon veronica pageant buck rivers legends page stared toward the looming house its dark weathered wood reinforced the feeling of gloom that the structure exuded soon the truck was close enough for him to see that some of the boards had fallen that there were gaps in the wall that the porch was in danger of collapsing doesnt anybody maintain it tori asked in surprise the movie people left it here and the family that owns the ranch took care of it for a while but then they got distracted harriett answered and anyway who would they have maintained it for its not as if they wanted tourists tromping over their land and leaving the gates open so their cattle would wander down the road and maybe get hit by a car by the time the parents died the children had pretty much forgotten about it when they finally remembered it was too late now the place is in such bad shape that it cant be repaired with out basically being rebuilt she stopped the truck at decaying steps that led up to collapsed boards on the porch the ornate front door looked as if it was about to topple from its rusted hinges page got out of the truck his sneakers crunching on pebbly dirt he helped tori down and watched harriett come around to join them she put on her cowboy hat the sun was intense enough that page wished hed thought to bring a baseball cap tori continued to wear hers concealing most of her red hair in the movie a lawn was here page said and a curved driveway bordered by flower beds tori added a cattle stampede tears it all up veronica pageant and buck rivers put it all back together then they do it again when theres a tornado then theres a terrible drought but somehow they keep building their empire texas determination harriett said and james deacons the white trash they humiliate until he strikes oil and uses his money and power to get even with them at one point he drives his battered old truck across the lawn hes covered with oil from his first well he jumps out and punches rivers page looked around but i dont see any oil wells forty miles from here harriett said thats where youll find them one reason the movie was made here is that this isnt oil country and there werent any wells to interfere with the illusion that this is what texas looked like a hundred years ago before the oil boom she paused i said there werent computer effects but that doesnt mean there wasnt any movie magic walk around the house and youll see what i mean curious page and tori did what harriett suggested stepping around the corner page gaped all he faced was more grassland there isnt any house tori said in astonishment the only part they built was the front page couldnt get over his surprise in the movie you feel like you can walk right into the place seeings believing harriett told them but what you see isnt al ways whats real like the cuttlefish page thought youre making a point about the lights eye of the beholder harriett answered sometimes we see what we want to see sometimes what we ought to see and sometimes what we shouldnt see i dont understand a lot of people in town were extras in the crowd scenes in birthright back when they were kids ask around and youll hear all kinds of stories about what it was like to have movie stars walking the streets of rostov what does that have to do with the lights tori asked for about three months the stars lived right here in town rostov was even smaller back then and everything the actors did was pretty much public knowledge not that any of it was terribly shocking there was so little to do that the film crewincluding the actors played baseball every sunday afternoon against a team the townsfolk put together people invited the actors to barbecues every evening the director put up an outdoor screen and showed everyone the foot age hed shot a couple of days before did you know that all three of the stars were only twentythree years old twentythree tori echoed but they look like theyre in their forties and fifties for half the film the director had two choices hire fortyyearold actors and use makeup so theyd look young in the early parts of the movie or else hire young actors and use makeup to age them the fame of deacon pageant and rivers made him decide to appeal to a younger audience the acting and the makeup were so brilliant they convinced you that what you saw on the screen was real more illusion page said okay i get it thats not the point i wanted to make though harriett continued deacon starred in only three movies first he played the younger brother in a family that runs a fishing boat in northern california the prodigal son tori said harriett nodded then he made the streetgang movie revolt on thirtysecond street and finally birthright he filmed all three back toback but he died in a car crash before any of them were released he never had a chance to find out how big a star he was i knew he died young but i had no idea it was before his movies came out page said the waste tori said something in her voice made page wonder if she was thinking about her own disease all the other great movies he might have made at the time his fans were convinced that he hadnt really died in the car crash harriett went on they believed he was disfigured that he hid from the public so he wouldnt shock people and ruin his legacy she paused bracing herself for what she wanted to say deacon was a troubled farm boy from oklahoma his mother ran away with the hired hand his father was as stern and joyless as the father in the prodigal son as a teenager he rebelled to the point that he was accused of stealing a car and almost went to reform school a teacher got him interested in acting in high school plays he loved it so much that he found several parttime jobs saved a hundred dollars and hitchhiked to new york city where he convinced lee strasberg to let him audition and was allowed to take classes at the actors studio what people tend to forget is that at the beginning of deacons career he played bit parts in a couple of movies but he never made an impression he had secondary roles in a lot of live television plays and no one paid attention to those eitherdeservedly even though he studied with strasberg he was terrible awkward dull lifeless if he hadnt been so goodlooking he probably would never have been hired finally he became so discouraged that he gave up and drove his motorcycle across the country that was in the summer of by the fall he was back in new york where he managed to persuade a casting director to give him a small part in a broadway play suddenly he was acting so brilliantly that a hollywood talent scout gave him a screen test for a small part in the prodigal son the test was so spectacular that the director asked for a second one and then gave deacon the starring role according to the dvd of the movie thats one of the great success stories in hollywood history what do you sup pose made the difference page shrugged i guess the motorcycle trip gave him a chance to get focused or maybe he had help harriett said help that summer deacon was on his way from el paso to big bend national park thats southeast of here he happened to drive into rostov tori stepped forward he saw the lights he spent most of august and all of september here every night he drove out to the observation area which wasnt even a parking lot back then and every night he stayed until dawn then he drove back into town and slept in a tent hed put up in the park late afternoons he went around town and made friends he was so goodlooking i dont imagine that was difficult then one day he was gone returning to new york and his big break page frowned youre saying the lights had something to do with it they were the only thing that was different in his life harriett replied i can imagine him staring at the lights for all those weeks night after night spellbound in deacons earlier roles his eyes are dull in his last three films they glow when he was hired to be one of the stars in birthright he told the films director about rostov and how the area around here would be perfect for location shooting he was so persuasive that the director came out to take a look and instantly decided to build the ranch houseright here she gestured at the ruined structure seems awfully coincidental that were ten miles from the section of road where deacon first saw the lights did the director see the lights too page asked no local people who worked on the movie remember that deacon went there every night and dragged pageant rivers and the director with him several times they had no idea what he was talking about the crew members didnt get it either and finally deacon was the only one who went out there harriett drew a breath he didnt need makeup to look older she finally said despite the heat page felt a cold ripple on his skin what do you mean the director shot the movie in sequence as deacon was supposed to look older he actually did look older the rumor on the set was that he was drinking and taking drugs every night instead of watching the lights as he claimed he began to look so wasted that the director begged him to stop abusing himself there was talk of shutting down the picture and sending deacon to a hospital to dry out but every evening when the town gathered to watch scenes from a few days earlier deacon looked so perfectly in character so real in the part that the director kept filming the makeup people needed to use all their talents to get pageant and rivers to look as believably older as deacon did standing in the shadow of the ranch houses ruin tori asked what made that happen all i can tell you is that when deacon finished his last scene and drove away on his motorcycle people say he looked sixty years old harriett answered five days later he was killed driving his sports car to a race in northern california near where hed filmed the prodigal son he was going a hundred miles an hour when a pickup truck pulled onto the road a witness saw sunlight glinting off the trucks windshield the theory was that the glint blinded deacon and kept him from being able to steer around the truck page stared at the splintered boards lying on the ground why hasnt any of this been talked about deacons death really traumatized everyone associated with the movie they didnt claim to understand him but they respected his brilliance and they didnt want to tarnish his legacy by claiming that he was wasted on booze and drugs they certainly werent going to make him sound like a nutcase by mentioning the lights which no body believed in anyhow harriett lapsed into silence in the hot sun the only sounds were cattle lowing in the distance and a breeze scraping blades of scrub grass so the lights inspired deacon and then he became so obsessed by them that he was destroyed tori asked it depends on what you mean by destroyed that final performance bordered on greatness harriett answered but the bottom line is he died tori emphasized it could be thats what deacon wanted maybe hed lived so in tensely during the previous year that he couldnt bear it any longer youre suggesting the glint on the windshield of the truck he hit maybe he was so burned out that he decided to drive into the light the breeze faded everything becoming still yesterday you told us how blessed the people in town feel because theyve seen the lights page said that was my experience but not everybodys experience page added is it possible to have too much of a good thing in town i heard a store clerk say that when she was young she used to go out to see the lights but now she never does yesterday you said you stopped going out to see them also harriett looked pointedly at tori when chief costigan phoned yesterday to say you were coming to see me he explained how fixated you are on the lights i brought you here to try to make you under stand that yes its possible to have too much of a good thing the crackle of static woke him as did his headache and the odor halloway lifted the side of his face from a table his cheek was numb from having been pressed so long against the wood the ear phones remained on his head he felt groggy as if hed drunk every one of the numerous glasses of vodka and orange juice that the alluring music had made him imagine the scent of cinnamon remained in his nostrils he sensed the lingering warmth of the voluptuous woman with whom he had slow danced in his fantasy and danced and danced until hed passed out halloway was slumped across a desk when he straightened he felt wetness in the front of his pants he raised his head toward the painfully bright overhead lights and took off the staticky earphones exposed to air after so long a time his ears tingled hed hoped that without the aggravating cracklehis headache would lessen but in fact the pain burrowed deeper into his skull because the crackle no longer kept him from hearing the hum that radiated from every surface of the underground facility if i can only find whats causing it but halloway s headache wasnt the only thing that had intensified the odor now almost made him gag he peered down at the bodies so many bodies the scientists the other guards their blood covered the floor the stench reminding him of a butchers shop through which he and his ranger unit had searched for insurgents in iraq the electricity to that part of fallujah had failed and the meat had been spoiling in the extreme heat here in the observatory the blood wasnt the worst of it foul smelling body fluids had leaked from several of the corpses the faces of some had begun to distend that shouldnt be happening so soon halloway thought he glanced at his watch and saw that the hands showed seven minutes to his outburst had occurred around his muddled thoughts somehow did the math less than seven hours at once a suspicion made him stand uneasy he stepped over the bodies doing his best to avoid the blood he entered the corridor and found another dead guard this one with features so mutilated by bullets that his face wasnt recognizable halloway turned right and walked along the corridor the loud echo of his bootsteps failing to shut out the hum he entered the surveillance room his mouth dropping open when he saw the images on the monitors none had the green tint of a nightvision camera the radio dishes the three rows of fences the miles and miles of scrub grass the distant mountainsall were bathed in the hot glare of sunshine not seven hours he thought in shock nineteen dear god ive never slept that long in my life the phone rang it was one of only four in the facility all of which were scramblerequipped he stared at it and on the second ring picked it up station zulu he said this is alpha control a mans voice said impatiently identify yourself earl halloway im one of the guards halloway the voice responded former ranger sergeant saw combat in iraq halloway recognized the steely authoritative tone it belonged to the man who led the team that had arrived via chopper yesterday afternoon colonel raleigh yes sir wellformer sergeant halloway raleighs voice exuded venom ive been trying to contact your station for the past six hours why in christs name isnt anybody answering the phone the heat of adrenaline cleared halloways groggy thoughts sir there was a thunderstorm last night he had a vague memory of hearing the periodic rumbles as he drank vodka and orange juice smelled cinnamon and danced i know all about the damned storm im only twenty miles away from you we were caught in it too well sir we got struck by lightning he was thinking faster now it interfered with our communications capabilities youre telling me that some of the best scientists working for the government dont have the combined skills needed to repair the dam age from an electrical storm that facility is grounded all the way to hell i find it hard to believe that a lightning strike would have any effect whatsoever sir with all due respect im not a communications specialist im just repeating what the technicians told me they took until now to repair the damage and meanwhile no data was received or transmitted to fort meade the colonels voice sounded even more infuriated im told thats correct sir damn it when this is over im going to find out who didnt do his job right now i want you to transfer this call to the control room halloway felt a moments panic sir im afraid i cant do that cant what are you talking about the phone im using the one in the surveillance room is the only one thats been put back into service the line became silent halloway imagined that he could feel the colonels growing fury he was glad to have a safe distance between them former sergeant halloway i want you to go to the control room and bring gordon to the phone sir are you there sir i cant hear you what do you mean you cant hear me sir damn it i can hear you perfectly fine raleigh replied his voice getting louder sir if youre still on the line youre not coming through the sys tem must be failing again bring gordon to the phone sergeant sir sir halloway set the phone back on its cradle breaking the connection he looked down at the floor and concentrated then he returned to the corridor and made his way back to the control room although he was combathardened from two tours of duty in the most violent parts of iraq the stench made him gag gotta clean this place up he thought cant appreciate the music if im sick to my stomach a further thought added to his resolve and i cant defend this place if im sick either when he checked his watch he saw with a chill that the time was now almost oclock somehow fifty minutes had sped by it was as if hed blacked out again time wasnt acting the way it should move he told himself halloway stooped toward gordons corpse grabbed its two stiff hands and dragged the body across the floor out in the corridor he kept moving backward past the surveillance room toward the stairs he tried tugging gordon up them but the dead mans belt caught on the edge of a metal step a few steps later it was gordons shoes that got snagged this is taking too long he pulled gordons stiff arms upward until the corpse seemed to be standing a few steps below him he put an arm around gordons back then reached behind his kneeswhich didnt bendand lifted him the weight made halloway wince how the hell is it possible he wondered that a hundred and eighty pounds of dead weight is heavier than a hundred and eighty pounds of live weight it ought to be the other way around cause somethings missing breathing hard he carried the body up the stairs his echoing footfalls were loud from the weight he carried at the top he wavered almost toppling back after managing to catch his balance he leaned gordon against the metal railing and opened the first security door i tried to be friends with you gordon but you wouldnt let me all you needed to do was be a buddy and share the music but noyou wanted it all to yourself see what happens when you act like a prick he pulled gordon toward the second security door the movement resembled dancing pressing the corpse against the wall he opened the second door and blinked at the harsh sunlight the breeze was sweet after the stench of so much death behind the radio dishes theres a stretch of ground nobody ever sees halloway thought he lowered gordon and started to drag him in that direction but then he cursed himself for being stupid use the damned truck the flatbed truck was always parked next to the dish that was tilted horizontally the ignition key was always in the truck protected by three fencesone of which was constructed of razor wire another of which was electrifiedthe truck was hardly in danger of being stolen he ran through the fierce sunlight toward the truck and felt his breathing become more difficult the array of observatory dishes loomed over him the metal beams that supported them resembling legs brilliantly white each dish was fifty feet tall they stretched in a line a half mile long and as halloway hurried past them they made him feel dwarfed insignificant threatened sweat soaked his shirt by the time he reached the truck he scram bled up into the cab and sure enough the ignition key was there he turned it but the engine chugged with effort the batterys almost dead he released the key and twisted it again the engine labored more slowly come on come on abruptly the engine roared to life with a muttered cry of victory he put it in gear and steered the truck in a half circle leaving a cloud of exhaust smoke he lumbered toward the concreteblock shed he jumped out lifted gordon and felt his heart pound from the effort of dumping the corpse onto the back of the truck now ive got a system the others shouldnt be this hard need to rush need to finish before the music starts a further consideration made him frown or before the colonel decides to make a surprise inspection halloway checked his watch again and gaped the time was now almost twenty to forty minutes had sped by when hed have sworn that only twenty minutes had passed he pressed the numbers on the security pad opened the heavy metal door and reached for the interior door need to collect the ms and all the ammunition i can find need to get grenades for the launchers this place is designed to withstand a major assault if the colonel shows up and tries to break in hell wish to god hed let me alone all i want is to listen to the music as he charged down the metal stairs again gagging from the stench he realized that hed need to bury the bodies instead of just dumping them otherwise the vultures might swarm toward the corpses and draw attention he needed to be extra certain that the colonel wouldnt have any suspicion of what had happened here the backhoe earl remembered they left it when they dug a trench to add new fencing ill use it to dig the hole perfect everythings going to work out sir if youre still on the line youre not coming through the sys tem must be failing again bring gordon to the phone sergeant sir sir the line went dead scowling raleigh set down the telephone during the call halloways voice had been so muffled that raleigh had taken the risk of removing the shooters earplug from his right ear then pressing the phone harder against it now he reinserted the plug in the monitoring station beneath the abandoned airbase he watched his team take their positions in front of the new equipment theyd installed banks of electronic instruments blinked and glowed old components connected to new on some of the computer screens he saw the chaotic visual equivalent of the static to which some of the audio receivers were tuned cameras hidden among the collapsed hangars aboveground relayed magnified images of the activity in the surrounding area where the observation platform stood he saw a crane setting the final concrete barrier in place as a frustrated crowd increased in size and highway patrol officers watched for trouble reminds me of parts of iraq where only the walls kept the sunnis and the shiites from killing each other raleigh thought on another television monitor he saw the dog trainer and the german shepherd patrolling the fence nearest the viewing area lest any of the crowd try to get around the barricade by climbing onto the airbase property and attempting to see the lights from there a few civilians did pass nearby but the dog looked so fierce that no one seemed inclined to take that course of action raleigh was reminded of the orders hed given to lockhart the previous night when the german shepherd and the trainer had come in from the thunderstorm if the dog acts strangely in any way no matter how slight shoot it the thunderstorm does halloway honestly expect me to believe that an electrical storm could have knocked out communications at the observatory this is the fucking nsa not the phone company sir are you there sir i cant hear you the system must be failing again bullshit raleigh thought in disgust apprehension grew in him maybe its starting there instead of here sergeant he said crisply yes sir lockharts voice was muffled by raleighs earplugs come with me they left the team in front of the monitoring equipment and stepped through a door into the subterranean chamber where the two suburbans were parked although the time was late afternoon the harsh overhead lights made the facility feel as if it were perpetually am raleigh glanced at the cameras that had been installed on an up per wall of each side of the chamber similar cameras were positioned in the monitoring room and everywhere else in the facility everything that happened here was now being recorded this time there wont be any unanswered questions raleigh thought lord knows there were plenty the last time sergeant put an m in a rucksack along with plenty of ammunition youre expecting trouble sir as i recall you enjoy motorcycles i do sir i used to race them when i was a kid when you arrived perhaps you noticed the harleydavidson in the far corner i did sir its kept here for emergency transportation in perfect working order on a storage rack so its tires dont rest on the concrete and disintegrate youll need to make sure theyre properly inflated and check the battery theres a fuel can behind it the crowd up there will notice if you drive one of the suburbans out of here but if you walk the harley to the gate and dont start it until youre on the road theres a good chance you can leave without attracting attention where do you want me to go sir raleigh told him lockhart frowned its probably nothing raleigh said but drive over to the observatory and find out for sure heres the key to the gate use this two way radio when you get to the observatory tell me everything youre doing step by step absolutely sir a black hawks scheduled to arrive soon with more equipment if theres trouble the men aboard the chopper can be called upon to help good to know sir lockhart saluted and headed past the suburbans toward the motorcycle as raleigh watched him he made a mental note to select someone else on the team to shoot the german shepherd if the dog acted strangely in even the slightest way his attention was drawn to the stain on the wall hed noticed earlier the faint red of which looked like longago faded rust but wasnt the crowd again parted reluctantly to let harrietts truck through page noticed that medrano was still there watching the crane set the final concrete barrier in place the wall was high enough that nothing could be seen beyond it harriett could you stop here for a second page asked he got out and walked over to medrano whose red highway patrol patches were vivid on the upper part of his tan shirtsleeves be careful that television reporter might be around here medrano warned well finish questioning you and tori as soon as things calm down the first part of the week you and your wife can be on your way good thatll work its important for my wife to be in san antonio by tuesday morning meanwhile i was wondering if you could give me some information medrano peered at him curiously about what the man who shot all those people thursday night you mentioned that the austin police had spoken with his brother thats how you found out that the shooters wife had died page couldnt help thinking of toris disease and the unendurable grief he would feel if he lost her thats correct medrano said i wonder if you have a phone number for the brother or maybe you could put me in touch with an austin police officer who could help me do that youre investigating on your own page couldnt tell whether or not medrano was displeased theres something id like to ask him i hope youre not telling anybody that youre a police officer with authority here in rostov yes medrano was definitely displeased i know the rules page said but as long as i make it clear im just an interested citizen i dont see the harm why on earth would he want to talk to you the husband of the woman who shot his brother to death he doesnt need to know that much but even if he did theres nothing wrong with expressing my condolences medrano still looked skeptical whats your question maybe the austin police can ask it for you or maybe you or chief costigan could do the asking medrano studied him and sighed why do i get the feeling thats what you had in mind all along mr mullen im captain medrano of the texas highway patrol the speakerphone sat on the table next to costigans hospital bed and im roger costigan the police chief here in rostov despite his injury his gravelly voice was strong enough to project to the phone thats the town near the area where i know where rostov is the male voice said wearily from the phone page and tori watched from the foot of the bed thanks for taking the time to talk to us medrano continued im very sorry to disturb you your medical examiner still hasnt released eds body the voice said irritably i dont even know when i can schedule the funeral thats not acceptable medrano said ill take care of that what ed did was so awful i still cant believe he did it but no matter what he was my brother mom and dad arent alive anymore its up to me to make sure he gets a proper burial i bet the relatives of the people he shot would say he doesnt deserve it but hes my brother i learned a long time ago not to judge people costigan said page knew the chief was lying most police officers expected the worst in people what did you want to talk about the tired voice asked i told the austin police everything i know there are just a few loose ends we need to tie up and well try to keep it brief after your brothers wife died cancer it was so damned unfair ann was always a saint always helping people she was one of the kindest most generous people ive ever met people always used to kid ed and tell him he didnt de serve her how come serial killers dont get cancer why does it al ways need to be someone whos good and decent at the mention of the word cancer page inwardly winced he hadnt been told before how mullens wife had died he glanced at tori the reference had made her pale you said that before his wife died your brother wasnt religious medrano continued never went near a church since my parents made us go with them when we were kids the voice replied but after your brother saw the lights which i still dont believe in if you want my opinion people are either playing a joke or hallucinating i didnt see them and believe me i tried but ed page hurriedly wrote something on a slip of paper medrano looked at it maybe your brothers grief is what made him think he saw the lights do you suppose thats possible it makes as much sense as anything of course i had no idea ed was going back so many times to thatwhat do they call it observation area once was enough for me i shouldve made him go to a psychiatrist instead of taking him on that damned tour and that was when he started collecting the religious paintings and statues costigan asked the voice sounded exasperated now ed wouldnt let me in his apartment we always met at my house or in a park or a restaurant or whatever i had no idea he had all that stuff until after the police contacted me did he ever talk about god all the time i assumed it was because he missed ann so much that he was determined to believe in heaven so he could convince himself ann was in a better place and that hed join her there one day he stank costigan sat higher in the hospital bed stank he wouldnt bathe he said the hot water felt so good that it made him feel guilty the only foods he ate were things he hatedturnips brussels sprouts pigs knuckles he slept on the floor he set an alarm clock to wake him every two hours he told me ann had suffered so much that he didnt have the right to enjoy anything he said if he did anything that felt good it would be like admitting hed never loved her as much as hed claimed as far as he was concerned the only way he could prove how much he loved her was by punishing himself lord i cant tell you how much i wish id made him go to a psychiatrist medrano looked at page as if asking whether he wanted to know anything else saddened by what hed just heard page shook his head well thank you for the help mr mullen medrano said were sorry if we disturbed you ill speak to the medical examiner about releasing your brothers remains anything to try to put this behind me but i dont understand how what i just told you is going to help we know my brother shot all those people its not as if theres a big mystery about who did it the thing is wed also like to know why he did it theres no mystery about that either what do you mean grief made him crazy i suppose youre right costigan said thanks again for your help he shut off the speakerphone no one spoke for several moments the only sounds came from outside the roomfootsteps hushed voices a cart being pushed so what did that tell you medrano finally asked page tori turned to him seeming to wonder the same thing dont you see how evil they are page asked all three of them frowned in surprise seeming to fear hed become unbalanced thats the first thing mullen shouted thursday night when they understood what he meant they looked relieved then he yelled to the crowd dont you realize what theyre doing to you dont you understand youre all going to hell when he shot at the lights he screamed go back to hell where you came from just be fore he started shooting at the crowd he shouted youre all damned the ravings of a man whod recently become a religious fanatic costigan said but the lights werent the reason mullen became a religious fanatic page countered you heard what his brother said mullen suddenly needed to believe in god and heaven so he could convince himself that his wife was in a better place and that one day hed join her there but the lights are another matter what they did to him made him furious tori looked as puzzled as costigan and medrano they tempted him page explained they were so alluring that for the first time since his wife died he felt good better than good they filled him with pleasure thats why he kept coming back because the lights were like a drug he fought what they did to him he bought more religious statues and paintings he tried to live like a monk and punish himself to prove that he loved his wife that he was worthy to join her but he couldnt stop thinking about the lights they were a pleasure he couldnt stop craving they made him furious because they showed him how weak he was well never know if he truly thought he could destroy the lights by shooting at them maybe he just needed a target for his rage and then he chose closer targets medrano said beginning to understand targets he could hit page nodded exactly he decided that the lights were evil and that anybody who enjoyed them had to be evil also well youve sure been getting your moneys worth from those psychology courses costigan said page felt his cheeks turn red with embarrassment i admit its only a theory one that cant be proved heres another theory page told them they waited tori looked at him as if she were seeing him for the first time assuming the lights are real a big assumption medrano said i told you ive never seen them and it isnt for lack of trying thats not surprising how so if im right page said the lights intensify the personalities of the people who try to see them as a police officer youre a professional skeptic that skepticism becomes emphasized out there youre too guarded to be able to see them page turned toward costigan the man who killed your father was a drunk and a bully you told me that after he came here he got more extreme one theory was that he felt humiliated by losing his job in fort worth and having to come to a small town where a relative man aged to find work for him his humiliation fueled his rage but i dont believe that the more im in rostov the more i talk to people and overhear what they say the more i think the lights mirror whats going on inside us they make whatever we are more extreme harriett ward says james deacon was obsessed with the lights when birthright was filmed here they reflected his need to be a great actor to the point that when he was supposed to age in the story he actually did look older but as you say that assumes the lights are real medrano pointed out if theyre not real the idea still works under the right circum stances people who need to see the lights will believe they see them theyll project their personalities onto what theyre imagining the result will be the same the man who killed my father never saw them costigan said and that made him furious page replied when tori and i were here earlier you wondered if people could be affected by the lights even though they didnt see them maybe its not the lights maybe its being out there in the dark surrounded by nothing people become more extreme versions of who they are i saw them costigan said from his hospital bed they looked at him in surprise the day of my fathers funeral after i left the cemetery i drove out to the observation area i needed to be alone and nobody was ever out there during the day i sat in my fathers cruiser and thought about what had happened to him i was on the dallas police force back then the rostov town council had asked me to take over for my father and become the new police chief but i wasnt sure i wanted to be in law enforcement any longer because people are so disappointing and many of them dont seem worth helping gradually i became aware that id sat there all afternoon that the sun was going down cars began to stop people got out waiting for it to be dark enough to try to see the lights i kept sitting there then the dark settled in and a few of the people pointed toward the horizon i glanced in that direction and by god there the lights were i couldnt believe it some nights when id visited my father id gone out there to try to see them but id never had any luck and now suddenly there they were dancing drifting glowing merging the colors were soothing i sat there smiling and i must have dozed off because the next thing i knew the cruisers radio woke me it was my fathers deputy there was a fight in a bar and he needed my help hed been leaving me alone because of the funeral now he apologized for needing backup i looked toward the dark horizon where id seen the lights but theyd disappeared i told the deputy i was on my way i dont know what seeing the lights did to me but that night i decided to become rostovs police chief i went out to the viewing area other times after that to see if i could find kids with lanterns trying to fool peoplesome way to explain the lightsbut i never found practical jokers and i never saw the lights again im still not sure they were real maybe as you say i needed to see them need page said some people need to help others some people need to hate some people need to fill their emptiness page managed not to look at tori when he said that another theory medrano said but how do you prove it tonight ill do my best how i want to get closer to the lights both costigan and medrano looked as if they didnt like what he was saying dont worryi wont do anything that adds to your problems we tori interrupted well do our best whatever you plan to do im going with you as they stepped from the hospital medrano told page i need to get back to the viewing area i hope you meant what you promised about not adding to my problems dont worry i wont go anywhere near you or the crowd and i wont make trouble by trespassing on anybodys land id love to know what youve got in mind youll get a full report tomorrow morning medrano gave him a penetrating look and went down the steps to ward his blackandwhite highway patrol car page and tori remained on the steps heat drifting off the concrete guess what she said im beginning to understand you page turned toward her conscious of how the scarlet of the lowering sun emphasized her red hair it took ten years of marriage she said i hope this isnt going to be a bad thing youre talking about no its good yesterday you said that the way you distract yourself from the pain you see is by concentrating on small details its true the idea is that the big picture can be overwhelming but small portions of it can be handledthey become manageable she said yeah thats right well if thats the case im learning from you yesterday and today i focused on the little things then after a while what i focused on wasnt so little it was you youre a really smart guy page tried to make a joke you didnt already know that youre using the lights to distract you from my cancer youre treating this like a criminal investigation which it is he admitted though theres more to it than that but it helps me get through the moment and prepare for tuesday its taking your mind off what we both dont want to think about im using your investigation in the same way as long as weve got this to do i think i can be steady she considered him the way you ask questions the way you assess people and make them do what you need yeah youre a really smart guy i have the feeling youre using my own tactic youre trying to find out something what are we going to do tonight how are we going to get closer to the lights at once tori smiledone of the few times hed seen her do that recently i get it you said we wont be near the crowd and we wont be trespassing were going to use your plane what i need is another riot or a shooting to get this story back on track brent said as anita drove why not an outbreak of bubonic plague she offered with muted sarcasm look i know everybody thinks im an asshole brent studied the barren landscape as they passed cattle were spread out eating the meager grass but you have to admit i got sensational overnight ratings for us its all about the tone the weird stuff about the lights needs to sound like its importantlike its actually news if cnn is going to keep paying us to run with this everything needs to sound believable even if its the weirdest shit i ever came across then why are we driving out to the observatory last night you said something about extraterrestrials i hope to god you were joking yeah it was a joke look im winging this okay ill know what i need when i see it besides i dont understand why youre complaining do you have anything better to do aside from earning as much extra money as i can nope and i dont know what gave you the idea i was complaining anita stopped the van at the side of the road dust swirled as brent studied the sign us government observatory restricted area trespassers will be prosecuted friendly he said lets get some shots of me standing next to it stepping out into the intense sunlight he walked through the blowing dust and positioned himself beside the sign determined to continue his rugged look he didnt bother trying to swat any of the dust from his suit with his tie open and his collar unbuttoned he raised the handheld microphone to his mouth the mike had a transmitter that sent audio directly to anitas camera but for the first time since coming to rostov he realized that he couldnt think of anything to say she held the heavy camera on her shoulder focusing on him it had a socalled shotgun microphone attached to the top projecting like a barrel the microphone could register nearby sounds but not as clearly as the one brent held after a long moment of silence she looked out from behind the camera cat got your tongue she asked sarcasm isnt welcome your fans are waiting hell with it then lets drive up to the observatory and see if any thing looks interesting i can come back later and do the intro at the end drive up i dont think so anita pointed toward a metal gate that stretched across the lane that led to the observatory the gate was locked i guess we head back to town she moved to load the camera back into the truck maybe not brent walked to the opposite side of the gate what are you doing ever been on a farm i went to a zoo once my grandfather owned a hundred acres in ohio i used to go there for two weeks every summer i remember the day when he drove his tractor out to a field but a gate got locked by accident and he didnt have the key to open it id never heard anybody swear for that long a time he smiled at the memory while he examined the gates hinges and nodded give me a hand would you she set down the camera and walked over your grandfather found a way to get through grab the gate on this end and help me lift anita shrugged and got a solid grip on one of the metal poles they pushed upward the hinges had metal circles that fitted over small metal posts it took only a little effort to raise the circles from the posts and push the gate inward within minutes they managed to make just enough room for the van to slip through i guess the government hired somebody local to install the gate but they forgot to tell the guy that the gate protected an observatory not a pasture maybe you didnt read that part of the sign where it says trespassers will be prosecuted anita said well just say we found the gate off its hinges and worried that another terrible thing had happened we decided it was our duty to investigate he paused and looked at her but dont let me force you to do anything youre not comfortable with do you want to stop no way anita told him ever heard of a cholla whats that a type of cactus that was my nickname in high school because if people messed with me they felt like a thorn got stuck in them and festered brent considered her five feet two inches tall maybe a hundred and five pounds but she hardly looked petite a long time of holding the twentyfivepound camera on her shoulder had made her sinewy and there was something about the strength in her dark eyes hey believe me im not trying to mess with you he said if you dont want to go in there you dont need to you can wait here for me walking toward the van anita replied over her shoulder of course i want to go in there her ponytail swinging at the back of her baseball cap she lifted the camera as if it weighed nothing and put it into the van then she got in and revved the engine brent waited for her to drive through the opening then he moved the fence back so the hinges seemed intact he got into the passenger seat and she drove down the lane dust rose behind them if theres a guard the dustll warn him were coming a long time before we get there anita observed no problemi just want to get a shot of the place maybe ill see something thatll help me connect it to the lights but now that were out here i cant imagine what it would be i hate to admit it but this story might have played itself out he thought for a moment un less theres another shooting tonight we can always hope for that he glanced at her left hand on the steering wheel youre not wearing a wedding ring so im guessing youre not married do you have a boyfriend hey i hope youre not hitting on me anita reached toward one of the many pockets on her khaki pants a metal clip was attached to the outside of one of them she pulled on it and revealed that the clip was attached to a black folding knife she thumbed it open revealing the blade remember what i said about my nickname she gestured with the knife honest to god im just making conversation i was trying to figure out how whats the word you used a cholla sounds like you used to be a biker chick you got it how a cholla became a cameraman camerawoman i had a boyfriend he flipped his motorcycle showing off got himself killed of course it didnt help that he wasnt wearing a helmet a couple of days earlier hed dumped me for somebody else thats when i realized biker chicks dont have a future when i saw an ad for the community college i went out there asked what courses they had and decided that learning how to handle a television camera might be cool and critics complain that television isnt a positive influence is it as cool as you hoped look at the wonderful people i get to work with brent laughed for a little while longer at any rate anita added until cnn hires you thats what youre hoping isnt it if that happens and they need a camerawoman be sure to put in a good word for me count on it never give your word unless you mean it im telling the truth if they hire me i will in fact put in a good word for you now you can set down the knife it was anitas turn to laugh look at those observatory dishes she pointed toward the huge white shapes that seemed to grow from the horizon as she drove closer they remind me of the giant robots in a terminator movie not a bad line brent said ill use it be my guest since were going to cnn together do you think they have good mexican food in atlanta chorizo lots of jalapeños in chicken enchiladas somehow i doubt it in that case maybe itll be just you going to atlanta yeah those dishes look like giant robots as they drove closer brent was struck by how tall they were theyve got to be four or five stories high he thought theyre stretched along the equivalent of two or three city blocks hell at least well get some impressive images a minute later he was close enough to be able to count them nine then he realized that he was wrong there was a tenth dish hidden behind the others it was tilted sideways and seemed to be undergoing repairs a chainlink fence came into view topped with barbed wire not one fence brent thought three and the two inside rows look like theyre made entirely from razor wire they really dont want visitors anita observed well i guess theyre afraid the cattle will wander close and bump against the dishes the road led to a tenfoothigh gate its links so thick that they looked capable of stopping a truck signs on the third fence warned danger high voltage i suppose the high voltage is designed to stop any cattle that climb the first and second fences anita said yeah there does seem to be a littlepardon the expression overkill in the design of this place brent agreed maybe kids from town used to vandalize the dishesspraypainted them or something in which case that highvoltage fence will teach those kids how seriously the government disapproves of graffiti an openbacked truck was parked next to a concreteblock shed lets get some shots of this place while we have the chance brent decided waitll i turn the van around so well be ready to make a getaway dont mock a cholla she warned as the dust settled they got out and squinted in the bright sun to ward the towering white dishes thisll look great anita pulled the camera from the side door of the van and attached a fresh battery pack stand by the gate ill angle up toward the dishes then pan down toward the high voltage signs on the interior fences and finally over to you sounds as if you should be a director not a cameraman camerawoman have you figured out what youre going to say this time the dish thats tilted sideways what about it it seems pointed in the general direction of rostov so maybe ill suggest that its aimed at the lights as if its receiving a signal from them you think cnns going to buy that but she glanced at the dish as if intrigued by the idea its the best i can come up with right now in that case im not the only one who wont be going to atlanta but anita hefted the camera to her shoulder trust me as we keep going ill think of something better just get some shots of the dish thats tilted toward rostov i can always dub a voiceover later if i need to abruptly brent heard a noise behind him he lowered the micro phone to his side turned and gazed through the three fences toward a door that opened in a concreteblock shed a man appeared emerging from the darkness inside he came out backward bending over tugging something that brent couldnt see his khaki uniform left no doubt that he was a guard the man glanced behind him to make sure of his footing and stopped when he noticed the van immediately he set down whatever he was dragging the darkness beyond the door still concealed it he turned and straightened his hair was extremely short his features were stern his chest was muscled his shoulders broad he stepped forward and halted at the front of the truck i guess you cant read excuse me brent asked he kept the microphone down concealed behind his right leg the sign at the road howd you get through the locked gate it was off its hinges brent replied with all the weird things happening we got suspicious and decided to make sure nothings wrong everythings fine ill arrange for the gate to be fixed why do you suppose it was off its hinges kids maybe kids of course my names brent loft im a television reporter brent used his left handthe one that wasnt concealing the microphoneto point toward the stations letters on the side of the van yeah i saw you on tv talking about the shootings thanks the guards sour expression suggested that his comment hadnt been a compliment even so brent pressed on as long as were here this place looks so fascinating is there someone i can talk to about doing a feature about it he hoped anita had the camera rolling he didnt know where this conversation was going but he had a suspicion hed be able to use footage from it the guard was too far away for brents microphone to pick up his voice but brent was speaking loudly enough that his own portion of the conversation would be recorded he expected the guard to say that the person to talk to was gone for the weekendsome sort of polite brushoff the guards curt no caught him by surprise no like the sign says this is government property if you want to get prosecuted just hang around while i call the cops but if you want to end this with no hard feelings get in that van and drive back to the road now brents gaze focused on the open door behind the man the object hed been dragging lay in the shadows inside the shed part of it was round resembling a soccer ball well maybe i could interview you brent offered how does it feel to work here is it exciting to be part of a project this big or like most jobs does it get boring after a while the guard squinted harshly brent kept trying does the observatory study only stars and comets and black holes or is it also part of the seti project the guards squint became more pronounced you know seti brent said the search for extraterrestrial intelligence now the guard scowled i know what seti means i didnt mean to suggest otherwise the joke i heard is we ought to be searching for intelligent life on earth brent focused again on the door that stood open behind the guard the soccer ball in the shadows beyond it seemed to have hair oh shit brent tried not to show a reaction do you live onsite brent managed to keep talking and prayed that anita did indeed have the camera rolling whats that like being out here away from everything the guards hands were at his side he bunched his fingers into fists opened them closed them opened them tell you what ill give you exactly a minute to get out of here if you dont want to be prosecuted just get in your truck and drive back to the road brent tried to be subtle when he switched his gaze toward the truck next to the guard several objects were piled in the back they came up only slightly higher than the sides making it difficult to tell what they were but one of them looked a lot like it might be part of a shirtstill on someones arm fine he said finding it hard to remain calm im sorry if we bothered you the sudden rapid pounding of his heart sickened him i just figured this place would make an interesting story but i can see i was wrong the guard was noticing things also he stared past brent toward anita presumably toward her camera then he appeared to realize that brent was hiding a microphone next to his leg we dont want any trouble brent said of course not youre right this place is really fascinating why dont you stay right where you are ill go find the guy you need to talk to about permission to do a story he motioned for them not to move then turned and went into the small building where he shifted the object hed been dragging so it couldnt be seen any longer then he disappeared into the darkness anita lets go brent said urgently he pivoted and saw that she held the camera at her side a seemingly innocent position but the cameras red light was conspicuous regardless of how frightened brent felt he was elated that she seemed to have recorded everything the van was pointed away from the observatory anita rushed to the vehicles side hatch and shoved the camera onto a seat there are bodies in that truck she said starkly yes and he was dragging another body from that shed what the hell happened here brent hurried toward the vans passenger door his lungs felt starved for air as if he was running a hundredyard dash anita rushed toward the front of the van desperate to reach the drivers door as quickly as she could blood spurted from her left arm she dropped brent gaped suddenly aware of shotsloud and rapid as if from a string of huge firecrackers something zipped past him metal clanged repeatedly he swung toward the observatory and saw that the guard was standing in the open door of the shed firing an assault rifle the three rows of fences acted like screens the chain links and wire deflecting a lot of the bullets chunks rose from disintegrating metal highvoltage sparks flew feeling the heat of a bullet nicking his ear brent rushed to anita and dragged her to the front of the van out of the guards sight a month earlier hed done a story about a gunfight between three bank robbers and a solitary policeman the policeman had survived be cause hed taken cover behind the front of his cruiser behind the engine whichbrent was toldcould stop just about any bullet anitaanita he was relieved to find that she was conscious but immediately he registered just how wide her eyes were and how rapidly she was blinking in pain her dark skin was pale when hed dragged her shed left a trail of blood on the dirt the jagged wound in her upper arm was wide and deep enough to show bone shell bleed to death brent almost threw up straining to remember what hed learned in a longago emergency firstaid class brent tugged off his necktie and twisted it around the top of anitas left arm above the wound one of the instructors had insisted improvise sweating he knotted the tie pulled a pen from his shirt pocket and shoved it under the tie he twisted the pen tightening the cloth enough to restrict the flow of blood thisll make your arm partly numb he remembered a doctor telling him that it might help with the pain too god i hope so anita bit her lip the shooting stopped amid a hot breeze brent smelled burned gunpowder struggling not to panic he peered around the front of the van at the open door to the shed the guard dropped a magazine from the bottom of the rifle and inserted a new one the mans face was twisted into a grimace that suggested he was in pain he finished reloading looked in brents direction and fired toward the vans rear tires again there were sparks and a spray of metallic fragments as the fences deflected many of the bullets but enough got through to shred the tires brent heard them exploding the rear of the van sank were going to die he thought no matter how quickly his chest heaved he couldnt seem to get enough air he imagined the guard throwing their bodies into the back of the truck with the others frantic he yanked his cell phone from his belt and hit the buttons but when he held the phone to his left ear he moaned all he heard was dead air the expression made him taste bile dead air i bet i can guess what youre doing the guard yelled youre trying to use your cell phone save yourself the trouble it wont work there isnt any civilian service this far out my boss knows we came here brent shouted back hell send people to look for us when they see the sign theyll have brains enough not to trespass on government property how long will your boss wait before he wonders where you are two hours three if people do come here looking for you by thenbelieve methey wont find you brent flinched as the guard fired another volley more of the bullets got past the metal in the three fences and shattered the vans rear windows dont you wish youd obeyed the sign the guard yelled i warned you didnt i i said youd be prosecuted hey mr big deal reporter ive got a question for you ask me anything brent hoped to stall for time did you go to announcers school or something like that what the hell brent had no choice except to humor the guy anything was better than being shot at yes i have a college degree in broadcasting thats what i figured you had to have learned it no one could be born that full of shit the guard shot more holes in the back of the van brent heard liquid splashing onto the ground his nostrils felt pinched by the odor of gasoline streaming from holes in the fuel tank at once he heard something elsethe drone of a distant engine somebodys coming well get help he stared down the lane that led to the road but he didnt see an approaching dust cloud the drone became closer and louder growing into a rumble in the air he turned in the direction of the lowering sun and saw the dark silhouette of a helicopter speeding toward the observatory thank god he thought the guard must have seen it too ill deal with you in a little while mr television reporter mouth dry from fear brent eased his head around the side of the van and saw the guard vanish into the darkness of the doorway the building was so small that brent concluded there had to be stairs leading underground the last time the guard had gone back inside hed returned with an assault rifle brent hated to imagine what he would bring next movement made him turn groaning anita managed to come to a sitting position and prop herself against the front of the van i cant drive with this arm she cradled it in pain the keys in my right pants pocket sweat trickled down her cheeks lets get out of here while hes distracted brent fumbled inside her pocket and pulled out the key he also took the knife shed returned to that pocket he had no idea what to do with it even so he shoved it into his pants anita struggled to get to her feet brent moved to help putting an arm around her guiding her to the side of the van his rapid breathing was hoarse as he shoved her up into the passenger seat he shut the door trying to minimize the noise and raced around to the drivers side fear made his legs unsteady when he climbed behind the steering wheel his trembling fingers had trouble inserting the ignition key come on finally it slipped in he twisted the key feeling a surge of triumph when the engine roared to life abruptly his sense of triumph turned to panic a glance in the rearview mirror showed the guard rushing from the doorway the rifle the man held had something thick mounted under the barrel brent stomped the accelerator and felt the flat rear tires try to gain traction the wheel rims dug into the ground spraying a dust cloud he couldnt see the guard maybe the dustll keep him from aiming the van lurched forward sluggishly ease off on the gas youre spinning the wheels anita found the strength to tell him brent obeyed the van responded gaining more distance from the observatory in the rearview mirror he saw the dust settling and caught a glimpse of the guard raising the rifle to his shoulder above the sound of the vans engine he heard the helicopter roaring closer coming in to land the van moved a little faster down the lane its flat rear wheels fighting the dirt frantic brent glanced at the rearview mirror again the guard suddenly changed the direction in which he aimed he turned west toward the rumble of the approaching helicopter in silhouette the object attached to the rifles barrel seemed thicker brent stared to his right past anita toward the massive shape of the chopper which was close enough that he could see the faint shape of the pilots face through the canopy he switched his gaze to ward the rearview mirror and saw the rifle buck as if it had been fired something flew from the object mounted under the barrel the front of the chopper exploded as the shock wave rocked the van the fireball of a second explosionperhaps from fuel tankstore the aircraft apart wreckage flew in all directions chunks of rotors sections of fuselage fragments of engines crashed onto the dirt smoke billowed grass started burning a flaming skeleton of the fuselage hit the ground and rolled crushing a section of fence madre de dios anita said in shock the speedometer showed fifteen miles an hour probably as fast as the van would go with shredded rear tires and wheel rims grinding into the dirt were going to make it she managed to say brent glanced toward the rearview mirror again and felt pressure in his chest seeing the guard turn toward the van to realign his aim anita brace yourself brent saw the rifle jerk upward something rushed from the launcher mounted under the rifles barrel another shock wave rocked the van in the rearview mirror brent saw an explosion tear up dirt were far enough away brent shouted yes were going to make it the words caught in his throat when he saw flames erupt behind the van the bullet holes in the fuel tank he realized were leaving a trail of gasoline his bladder let loose when the flames began to chase the van no the rear of the van heaved as the flames reached the fuel that streamed from the holes in the tank the impact wasnt like the grenade explosions it didnt produce a loud roar it didnt tear the back of the van apart it was violent nonetheless filling the rearview mirror with an image of erupting smoke and flames brent stomped the brakes as the flames spread forward he was relieved to see anita muster the strength to open the passenger door and drop to the ground he shoved the drivers door open jumped out and hurried around to where shed landed she was on one knee struggling to stand he grabbed her and lunged toward a furrow collapsing pushing her down the flames spread toward the middle of the van need the camera brent said dont take the chance youll be hit his heart pounded so violently that he was certain it would burst against his ribs he surged upright sprinted to the vans side door and shoved it open flames licked at him as he grabbed the camera something snapped past him a bullet coughing from the smoke he crouched and ran holding the cam era with both arms another bullet snapped past him he reached the furrow and protected the camera by falling onto his back youre a fool anita stared through wide eyes and looked paler my mother always thought so he pushed the record button and pointed the camera toward the burning van panning from the fiery back of it until he reached the front seats which burst into flames then he got a close shot of the shredded rear tire on his side of the van the fire beginning to melt it the smoke spread dramatically youve been shot anita said where your right ear brent reached up and touched the wound feeling the slippery blood and the gash on his earlobe bloods streaming down your neck and onto your shoulder she murmured good if i help you position the camera do you think you can get a shot of it you really are crazy you expect me to just wait here and do nothing while he tries to kill us the cameras the only weapon i have im going to record as much of whats happening as i can if we get out of this thisll be the story of a lifetime the word lifetime made him pause desperate to distract himself he added i can win an emmy for this we what we can win an emmy right brent aimed the camera at her emphasizing the blood that soaked her safaritype jacket he got a closeup of the tourniquet hed made for her arm the helicopter he realized need to get video of the helicopter while its still burning he squirmed along the furrow until he guessed he was far enough that the guard wouldnt look in that direction easing up he saw the smoke and flames rising from the choppers wreckage he aimed the cameras lens and zoomed it toward the part of the fuselage that had crushed a section of the fences yeah he thought ill get an emmy for this he corrected himself the two of us will get emmies if we live sergeant lockhart drove the motorcycle past the trespassers will be prosecuted sign and stopped at the gate to the observatory to the west he heard a faraway helicopter the lowering sun angled toward his eyes and made it difficult for him to distinguish the enlarging speck of the chopper presumably it was the black hawk that colonel raleigh had told him would be delivering more equipment so far no problem everything was on schedule plus lockhart had gotten the chance to enjoy a motorcycle ride the truth was any opportunity to get away from the colonel was enjoyable the guy had threatened to send him to a war zone and lockhart had begun to wonder if maybe that would be preferable to his current assignment just about any place would be better than that creepy facility under the abandoned airbase shoot the dog what the hell was that about the sergeant reached into a jeans pocket and pulled out the key the colonel had given him preparing to free the lock on the gate then he noticed that the barrier felt unsteady he glanced along it and saw that the opposite end wasnt resting on its hinges frowning he pushed the gate open as he guided the motorcycle toward the lane that led to the observatory a noise made him pause then crouch protectively hed heard the noise many times in iraq the rumble of a distant explosion it came from the direction of the observatory moments later a second explosion followed lockhart searched the sky but no longer saw or heard the helicopter what he saw in stead was smoke rising a third explosion brought more smoke he reached back toward a canvas sack mounted on the rear of the motorcycle the sack concealed his m along with two spare hundred round magazines and a halfdozen boxes of ammunitiona troubling amount that the colonel had insisted on the sack also contained a scramblerequipped twoway radio that lockhart hastily withdrew holding an earplug in one hand raleigh listened to the disturbing report that came through the twoway radio his mouth was uncharacteristically dry i cant send reinforcements until dark he said into the radio the suburbans are the only transportation we have theyre so conspicuous if i send men in the daytime the crowd down the road is bound to see we cant compromise our security reconnoiter as close to the observatory as you can keep reporting back raleigh ended the transmission when he reinserted his earplug shut ting out twothirds of the sound in the room he noted that some of the men in front of the monitoring equipment were glancing curiously in his direction even though it was after in the evening the cold overhead lights continued to make the time feel like oclock in the morning is everything adjusted his abrupt tone challenged one of the men suggesting that there were more pressing things to do than eavesdrop on his radio communications just about sir the man quickly answered were starting to amplify the signals raleigh stood behind the man a computer screen showed random dots that provided a visual correspondence to the static coming from audio monitors on a table near other glowing electronic equipment shelves were filled with receivers analyzers and decoders if all went as planned soon the static would resolve itself into the alluring music hed heard at fort meade and then the computer screen before him would show the equivalent of gliding floating hypnotic lights youre not wearing your earplugs soldier sorry sir ive been so busy that i forgot raleigh moved to the center of the room and raised his voice all of you listen up the eight men raised their heads from the electronics they were adjusting everybody wears earplugs raleigh pointed toward his own i warned you that the audio component of this project can damage your hearing i dont want somebodys mama crying to me because you didnt listen to orders and went deaf put in the earplugs now they hurriedly did so if necessary add the noisereducing headphones we brought when he was satisfied that everyone had obeyed he walked to ward a metal door that led to the facilitys innermost room in truth he wasnt worried about his men going deaf if this experiment went wrong going deaf would be the least of their problems what he hoped was that the earplugsand if necessary the noise reducing earphoneswould protect their hearing enough to keep them alive once inside the central chamber he watched a closedcircuit television monitor that showed a view of the abandoned airbase that sprawled above him beyond the collapsed rusted aircraft hangars he saw the german shepherd and its trainer patrolling the fence the crowd had spread far enough from the viewing area that some people were talking to the dogs trainer the animal snapped at them the people on the other side of the fence held up their hands in a we dont want a problem gesture and backed away raleigh wondered if the german shepherd was normally that aggressive well soon find out after dark ill bring the dog back inside well see how it behaves its ears are more sensitive than ours if theres trouble itll react before humans doand before we need to shoot it he studied the rooms thick metal door assuring himself that it could withstand a grenade blast he verified that his m and several loaded onehundredround magazines were in a corner he opened a filing cabinet and made sure that a trauma kit and emergency rationsincluding waterwere inside in case he was forced to barricade himself in this room for a considerable length of time what else do i need to plan for theres always something hed done his best to take everything into account nonetheless he paused to consider the history of this place and search his memory for anything he might have missed he knew by heart every event that had happened on this spot hed read all of the reports they stretched back long before the military had established a presence here one of the reports however had been passed down not from a historian or a tactician it had come from his greatgrandmother january the horse became restless it was normally so wellbehaved that its ridera twentynineyearold schoolteacher named dani marie brownglanced warily around assuming that coyotes were in the area she was riding on the dusty road that led from rostov to loden a town fifteen miles away where she taught grade school on thursdays fridays and saturdays after teaching on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays in rostov three days a week was the most that local cat tlemen in each place would allow their children to be away from their ranching chores dani sometimes was at school from dawn until dusk preparing classes or grading tests when the children werent at their desks it was a tiring schedule but shed been raised in rostov and she hadnt liked being away from home while shed earned her teachers certificate in noisy crowded el paso long quiet hours in this familiar re assuring area were preferable to the chaos of the unknown outside world during the winter the early sunset made it necessary for dani to bundle herself in a sheepskin coat and ride between the towns after dark this didnt trouble her the stars and the mooneven if only a portion of the latter was showingprovided sufficient light for her to see the road on cloudy nights she held a lantern to show her the way an experienced horsewoman she never worried about her ability to control the chestnutcolored quarter horse her parents had bought for her but now as the animal became more skittish she tugged back the reins and pressed her heels down in the stirrups while she studied the shadowy landscape with greater intensity in the heat of summer coyotes werent the only threat the horse might have sensedthere would have been the risk that a rattlesnake had crawled onto the road to absorb the last of the days warmth but that was out of the question tonight when the temperature was cold enough to put a layer of ice on a pail of water even so danis stomach fluttered until recently shed felt happily isolated in this quiet corner of texas but then her father had ordered a wireless radio from a catalog and now on this particular journey danis thoughts were disturbed by the escalation of the european war which had reached new heights of atrocity and threatened to draw the united states into the fight between germany and the allies just before beginning her ride toward loden shed paid a brief visit to her parents and listened to a radio report about attacks involving chlorine and phosgene gases the lung destroyers there were rumors about something even more horrendous being developed mustard gas a blisterer that dissolved skin both inside and outside the body the gas remained active long after it sank into the ground with the consequence that soldiers kicking up dust as they walked through a field could cause the equivalent of another attack and those werent the only new horrors dani could only imagine the pain and terror produced by such recently invented weapons as tanks and flamethrowers thus on this normally quiet ride her thoughts were in greater turmoil than she would have expected abruptly something on her right caught her attention she frowned toward some sort of illumination on the southern horizon lights bobbed and weaved her immediate suspicion was that they came from torches carried by horseback riders however the only direction from which those riders could be coming was mexico that thought filled her with dread because mexico too had become a dangerous place the recent revolution there had turned the country into warring factions to which germany sent soldiers weapons and money hoping the united states would be so distracted by the violence south of its border that it wouldnt enter the war in europe my god dani thought could those be germans the horse continued to resist her efforts to control it calm down she warned herself the horse senses my fear thats whats causing the problem no those werent germans invading from mexico she decided now that she paid closer attention the lights didnt look at all like riders with torches if they werent torches though what else could they be only gradually did dani wonder if these might be the lights shed heard so much about when she was growing up the stories had seemed fanciful and shed paid them no mind because although she knew many people in town who claimed to have seen them she had not now on the distant horizon the lights took the shape of luminous balls their colors were like segments of a rainbow sometimes they merged red and blue becoming purple or green and red becoming yellow they drifted sideways or rose and fell as if in a current they got larger and brighter dani became aware of a hum that gradually increased in pitch and before she knew it her ears were in pain suddenly the horse reared up she pressed down on its neck while tightening her legs against its flanks making panicked noises the animal skittered sideways again it attempted to rear up and suddenly regardless of her expert effortsit charged along the road the horses speed would normally have made it difficult for dani to see obstacles on the shadowy road but as she struggled to subdue it she realized that the road had become unnaturally bright with vibrant colors flashing toward it without warning the lights were rushing over her spinning around her trapping her in a whirlpool at once the horse bucked so violently that she flew off the saddle when she struck the road pain shot through her ribs her vision blurred dizzy she heard the horse neighing in alarm the pounding of its hooves began again and receded into the distance dani had no idea how long she lay unconscious when she wakened the lights were gone clouds had drifted in partially concealing the stars and the moon in the meager illumination she squirmed to her feet despite the cold the pain in her ribs made her sweat with a weak voice she called for the horse but the animal didnt return she called again gave up and struggled to find her bearings which way was rostov that was the closer town if she made a mistake in direction shed walk toward loden and she doubted she had the strength to go that far she scanned the heavens in search of the north star the pain was so great that she feared shed collapse the big dipper need to find the big dipper there when shed been a little girl her father had made sure that she knew how to navigate by the stars in case she ever got lost in the dark the two end stars on the big dipper pointed toward the little dipper and the star at the end of the handle part of the little dipper was the north star now dani could calculate which way was west the direction that would take her to rostov she wavered along the increasingly dark road and stumbled when she fell pain jolted her into consciousness she crawled and finally managed to stand again time lost all meaning she felt another jolt of intense pain and realized shed run into the side of a building only then did she understand that shed reached town delirious she took two wrong turns before she pounded on her fathers door when he opened it she collapsed in his arms the next morning word of her ordeal spread through rostov numerous friends came to satisfy their curiosity germans the veterinarian asked the closest that rostov had to a doctor he recommended that dani wear a corset to protect her ribs while they healed no she said through the pain i dont think so the corset put so much pressure on danis throbbing chest that she had trouble breathing but you told us you saw riders with torches danis father said if not germans were they mexicans no i only thought it could have been a scouting expedition rostovs mayor decided some of them got close enough to throw their torches at you carranzas people are in league with the germans everybody knows that maybe carranzas seeing how far he can sneak into texas before anybody makes a fuss or it might have been that bastard villa the towns blacksmith suggested hes desperate for money and supplies theres nothing between us and the border danis mother looked horrified they could murder us in our sleep no it wasnt people on horseback dani insisted tightly what was it you said the mayor asked whatever you saw seemed to be on the horizon and suddenly it was spinning around you wasnt that how you described it yes squeezed by the corset and her painswollen ribs dani could hardly speak an airplane can do that i saw one the last time i visited my sister in el paso but i didnt hear an engine you said you heard something a hum she replied i couldnt place it while blinding lights spun around you yes but the mayor stood and put on his coat ill contact fort bliss the army needs to be warned about this warned i think the germans are testing a new weapon a day later a speck emerged from the afternoon sun the drone of an engine made people look toward the west where the shape of an air plane gradually became visible its yellow vivid against the sky it had two sets of wings one above the other and two open seats one in front of the other the sole occupant was seated in the back he circled the town and the people whod gathered on the main street angling down the plane seemed to float as it eased toward the dirt road when it landed it bounced slightly then raised a dust cloud coming to rest on a section of parched grass the people crowded toward the field marveling as the pilot shut off the engine pushed himself up from the back seat and jumped to the ground he wore boots leather gloves a leather jacket a khaki uniform under it and a matching scarf around his neck a pistol was holstered to his wide canvas belt and someone identified it as one of the new colt semiautomatics when he took off his goggles the area around his eyes was white compared to the dust that coated the rest of his face including his mustache im capt john raleigh he said with a smooth voice that commanded attention you can get a little closer if you want with his boot he drew a line on the ground to here but dont touch the plane how does it fly a man asked in amazement the propeller pushes air past the wings theyre shaped so a high pressure area forms under them and a lowpressure area forms over them the difference between the high and low pressure lifts the plane several people frowned as if he spoke gibberish others nodded perhaps pretending they understood whats covering the wings another man asked strips of linen theyre sealed with a waterproofing agent thats like shellac doesnt sound very strong strong enough the plane brought me all the way from el paso with that he looked around then spoke again to the crowd wheres your mayor i came to talk with him thats me captain my names ted mckinney the mayor stepped from the crowd and shook hands with him thanks for coming so soon my office is just down the street thank you for contacting us captain raleigh responded id like to get started right away the army is very interested in your report the crowd parted as he and the mayor walked away mayor mckinney was the president of rostovs only bank he and raleigh remained inside the adobe building for an hour many people gathered on the street curious about what the two men discussed when raleigh and the mayor came out they crossed the street to the drygoods store that danis parents owned the couple lived in an apartment behind it where she was convalescing more people gathered on the street a half hour later the mayor left the store preceded by the sound of a rattling motor he returned shortly with his ford model t captain raleigh stepped from the store and held the door open for dani who clutched a coat around her and walked stiffly to the car the captain helped her onto the passenger seat and climbed into the back the townspeople watched with growing curiosity as mayor mckinney drove the car out of town following the road to loden the winter sun had descended low enough to touch the horizon and the scarlet glow deepened the brown of raleighs leather jacket the captain leaned forward from the back seat so that dani could hear him over the clatter of the model ts engine thank you for agreeing to do this miss brown not many women would be brave enough to return to the scene of where they were attacked im not sure its a matter of bravery captain raleigh dani haltingly explained i think perhaps its anger anger he looked curious and she couldnt help noticing that he was handsome standing or sitting he held his back straight and she thought he had the makings of a great horse rider dismissing such thoughts she continued someone found my horse the skeleton of it anyway after the coyotes had finished with it whatever attacked me is responsible for that im sorry to hear about your horse he sounded as if he truly meant it do you have a sense of where the incident occurred i set out after dark as the sunset weakened dani continued to be short of breath her words tightened with pain when the vehicle jolted over bumps there was light from the stars even so it was hard to know exactly where i was along the road what time did you leave for loden at thats very precise my father has a wireless radio i was with him when he listened to a report about the gas attacks in the european war the news began at dani forced herself to continue after ten minutes i was so up set that i said goodbye to my parents and went out to my horse i was on the road by the way you sit so rigidly straight youre obviously hurting he said with concern are you certain you can continue im prepared to do whats required she answered firmly its just the corset corset raleigh sounded embarrassed the veterinarian told me to wear a corset to bind my ribs and protect them you went to a veterinarian he asked in surprise this is cattle country captain raleigh its easier to find a vet than a doctor as soon as you return home please take the corset off at once it can kill you dani winced as the mayor drove over another bump kill me what are you talking about the armys been studying how wounds are being treated in the war its common for tape to be used on broken ribs but british doctors are discovering that pneumonia is a frequent result apparently the tape causes shallow breathing that allows fluid to collect in the lungs the next thing the patient is sick from something far worse than broken ribs after you remove the corset breathe as deeply as you can thatll hurt but its the only way to stop the fluid from collecting the mayor turned on the model ts lights speaking of the war captain will the us join the fight yes we will raleigh answered its only a question of when thats why the army sent me here if the germans are testing a new weapon we need to know about it miss brown can you estimate how long you were on this road before you saw the lights perhaps forty minutes at what gait were you riding a moderate trot the light from the moon and the stars was sufficient to allow for that speed which means that you traveled approximately five miles the mayor looked at him with even more respect i gather you used to be a cavalryman the eighth regiment you were in the philippines apparently miss brown isnt the only person keeping up with the news raleigh scanned the horizon yes i was in the philippines when i heard that the army was training pilots i decided it was better to fly over a jungle than ride through it he paused and peered into the dusk would you say weve traveled five miles yet thats what the milometer says then lets stop and enjoy the view mckinney eased back on the accelerator and pulled the handbrake even at an idle the vibrations of the engine made the car rattle miss brown you said the lights came from the south thats correct if you turn off the engine mr mckinney will you be able to restart it or will we be stuck out here i maintain the car in excellent condition the mayor said it will start then lets enjoy some peace and quiet the mayor shut off the engine the car wheezed and fell silent if i keep the headlights on the batteryll go dead mckinney told raleigh of course please turn them off at once darkness surrounded the vehicle silence gave the night power beautiful raleigh said as his eyes adjusted to the gloom in el paso the streetlights keep me from seeing the sky i seldom see the heavens so bright mckinney pointed with a childs enthusiasm look a shooting star it streaked across the sky like silent fireworks miss brown could that be what you saw raleigh asked per haps a cluster of shooting stars ive never heard of shooting stars coming across a field and spinning around someone she replied nor have i ever experienced any that hummed i havent either raleigh fixed his gaze on the murky area to the south somewhere over there coyotes yipped and howled theyre on the hunt he thought or perhaps theyre running from something i need to tell you dani said that i dont think the lights were torches held by german riders perhaps not germans perhaps it was carranzas men no i mean i dont think there were any riders but if there werent any riders what caused the lights i dont know people around here often see lights she said i my self have never seen them so i cant tell you what they look like and before the other night i hadnt thought they even existed now im not certain what i think im afraid i dont understand danis talking about the rostov lights mckinney interrupted indians and early settlers used to talk about them ive never seen them either but my wife claims she has that was after we lost a son to cholera she believed the lights were the soul of our boy if you ask me my emily was so depressed that she convinced herself she saw the lights well whatevers going on well soon find out raleigh replied confidently you really believe that absolutely he said im seeing the lights right now what mckinney glanced all around raleigh focused all his attention toward the southern horizon where glowing colors slowly began to appear they rose and fell they drifted and floated in a languorous captivating rhythm red merged into blue yellow blended with green mr mckinney do you see them raleigh rested his right hand on his pistol the mayor didnt answer for a moment god help me yes miss brown are they what you saw yes she said softly before they attacked me well theyre not riders carrying torches thats for certain does anyone smell flowers flowers orchids i wouldnt know what orchids smell like mckinney said in the philippines there were hundreds of types of orchids raleigh explained amazing colors just like what im seeing now in the night in the jungle as i tried to sleep in my tent the scent was thick orchids pollinated by bees had a perfume of cinnamon thats what im smelling now i smell rotting meat dani said mckinney raised a hand to his mouth so do i raleigh remembered that the orchids in the philippines didnt al ways smell like cinnamon if they were pollinated by flies sometimes they had the odor of a dead animal that the flies had sat on abruptly the stench hit him almost making him gag like corpses after a battle he thought dani coughed the reflexive reaction to the odor filled her chest with pain causing her to wince something out there is dead she said a new german weapon raleigh wondered how far do you suppose they are mckinneys voice was unsteady without a method to triangulate the distance its impossible to know raleigh answered in the dark our eyes play tricks on us the lights could be miles away or less than a hundred yards the latter would explain how they reached you so quickly miss brown the odor of death became stronger were not prepared raleigh thought mindful of his responsibility for danis safety he kept his voice level lets go back to town two days later a detachment of cavalry arrived their dust cloud visible from a distance at sunset raleigh rode with them to the part of the road from which hed seen the lights their plan was to use surveyors instruments to get two separate bearings on the lights plotting map coordinates that would allow them to determine how far away and where the lights were but the moment the lights appeared the horses went crazy whinnying loudly they kicked and bit one another a trooper on foot clinging to the reins of his mount was dragged along the ground a hoof fractured his skull the other panicked horses galloped into the gloom leaving the soldiers to make their cautious way back to town on foot all the while ready with their rifles a week later eight army biplanes flew to rostov from fort bliss the intervening time had given raleigh the chance to choose a location for an airstrip and start supervising its construction the rationale for the airstrip was that it provided an outoftheway place at which to secretly train pilots for americas entry into the war the actual purpose however was to establish a location from which the biplanes could conduct aerial surveillance beyond the mexican border looking for a weapon that the germans might be testing when he wasnt on duty raleigh found himself spending more and more time with dani marie brown part of the training for student pilots involved flying at night he used the night instruction as an opportunity to send his students to try to determine the origin of the lights but he was forced to discontinue those missions as the trainees flew toward the lights they diverted and attacked one anotherwith apparent deliberation two planes actually collided killing the instructor and student in each thereafter training occurred only during daylight fears about an invasion from mexico were validated on march when gunmen led by pancho villa staged a night attack on the new mexican town of columbus within two days congress voted to pursue villa black jack pershing led five thousand soldiers into mexico where they remained for most of the year although they engaged in numerous battles with mexican troops they never located villa but that didnt matter the mission was largely a training exercise allowing american soldiers to absorb battle experience in april america entered the war raleigh participated in the mexican campaign using his biplane to scout for enemy positions afterward he returned to rostov and married dani marie but within weeks of his marriage he was on a ship bound for france the lights and the possibility of a new german weapon being tested along the mexican border were forgotten by the army there were too many tangible weapons to worry about particularly mustard gas but on many nights as captain raleigh tried not to think about the next days combat he longed for his wife and the son shed given birth to after the war ended in november he returned home in time for christmas snow fellunusual but not impossible in that area of texas he had survived thirtynine dogfights with german aviators and thanked god that he was able to be with his wife and son but even though he was finally safe he had nightmares not about the war though instead his disturbing dreams made him experience the floating drifting sensation of the lights each evening he went out to stare at them in march he purchased a biplane that had been used in the war many of which had become available at cheap prices because the military no longer needed them a week after he took possession of the plane he took off at dusk from the now overgrown airstrip where hed trained pilots three years earlier as the darkness thickened he flew toward the lights the sound of his engine receded into the gloom neither he nor the plane was ever seen again in the dank complex beneath the abandoned airbase col warren raleigh remembered seeing photographs of a dashing young man in a uniform a stronglooking woman next to him a biplane in the background he remembered hearing about the rostov lights and his greatgrandfathers mysterious disappearance raleighs greatgrandmother had raised her son alone demonstrating the strength that had drawn her husband to her her only show of emotion came each night while her parents took care of the baby she went out to the area where her husband had disappeared she watched the lights waiting for him to return night after night winter and spring she stared at them inexplicably her face became red and swollen blisters developed one night when strands of her hair began to fall out she finally did something she would never have imagined doingshe took her son moved from the once reassuring area where shed grown up and rented an apartment in noisy disturbing el paso there she learned to be a seamstress sewing at home while looking after her son el paso led to denver chicago and finally boston as she tried to get farther and farther from the lights despite the passage of years she never remarried she died from skin cancer a voice interrupted raleighs thoughts sir fort is call you he peered up from his desk his earplugs muffled sounds say again lieutenant fort meade wants you on the phone scrambler code as raleigh reached for the phone on his desk the lieutenant continued and even though it isnt night yet were getting extremely powerful readings raleigh nodded this time he didnt take the risk of removing an earplug as he pressed a button on his phone and engaged the scrambler colonel raleigh here this is borden a womans voice said faintly she was the director of the weapons research team at raleighs headquarters near the fortresslike national security agency in maryland were receiving unusually strong readings from the observatory yes one of my people here just told me were getting strong readings also bordens voice continued i reviewed the data parameters for previous versions of this study as we know the patterns cyclical some times the signals are almost impossible to detect other times theyre pronounced but until now the highs and lows have been in the same range these are the highest readings weve ever seenand that includes what happened where you are back in the reason i contacted you isnt just to make a report im asking you to reconsider your strategy she paused colonel are you certain you want to stay at your location raleigh found the question touching one of his many secrets was that he and borden met each month at a baltimore hotel room where they allowed themselves to pretend they had emotions unrelated to their careers her question wasnt merely about protecting the pro gram it suggested that she was actually concerned about his safety colonel can you hear me bordens voice asked yes he finally said i hear you thank you for your input but ill be staying all these years this is where the program has been headed without a team onsite well never know the truth i cant leave this wasnt just where the program had been headed though it was where his life had been headed since hed first heard about the lights when he was a boy four transfiguration twenty seconds after the explosions pages cell phone rang he and tori were staring toward the sky in the direction from which the shock waves had come he pulled the phone from his belt and pressed the answer button did you hear them medranos voice asked urgently a small one a big one then another small one page replied from the northwest the only thing over there is the observatory thats what im thinking too where are you the airport big surprise i finally figured you were planning to use your plane tonight a private plane can go just about anywhere right just about the nearest highway patrol chopper is ninety minutes away i cant wait that long i want you to fly toward those explosions and find out what the hell happened the problem is page said one of the places a private plane cant go is prohibited airspace youre telling me the observatorys offlimits usually a prohibited area has something to do with national security i have no idea what that observatory has to do with any of that but at the very least i could lose my pilots license if i fly in there i cant go in there either medrano said thats federal property i dont have the jurisdiction to send in cruisers listen ill try to get permission from the fbi while im waiting can you at least fly along the boundary of that areamaybe get high enough to try to see what happened that i can do i have a police radio in my plane whats your frequency page wrote down the number pressed the disconnect button and returned his phone to his belt he looked at tori this could be dangerous you might want to think about not going up with me could you use an extra set of eyes always then youve got company a bullet tore up dirt near brents left cheek he flinched and ducked his head lower where he lay was a sandy trough that might have been a dry creek bed the parched land had absorbed the water from yesterdays storm except that there seemed to be a puddle under him soaking him then he realized that what he felt was the wet crotch of his pants where his bladder had let go the only thing that kept him from panicking was the television cam era im not going to lose this chance he angled it up toward the black smoke that billowed from the downed helicopter then he pivoted to the right and aimed the camera toward the smoking ruin of the news van now comes the hard partstaying alive to show this to somebody he thought anita was sprawled between him and the burning van her head lolled and she looked weaker he squirmed toward her stopping when he was halfway there the guard at the observatory had a large area to scan with his rifle from this new position brent hoped to be able to ease the camera over the edge of the trough and record what the gunman was up to need to do something im not just going to lie here he took a deep breath braced his trembling muscles and cautiously showed himself through the cameras viewfinder he saw the guard turning in his direction and raising the rifle brent managed to get down just before three bullets blasted dirt above him wouldnt pay attention to the sign the guard yelled from be yond the fences brent had lost his handheld microphone now he relied solely on the shotgun mike attached to the top of the camera although he had little hope that it would register the guards voice from so far away had to come barging in the guard continued all i wanted was to listen to the music music brent thought i told you to get out of here the guard shouted but you had to keep pushing you had to keep me from the music what in gods name is he talking about brent wondered trespassers will be prosecuted thats what the sign says more bullets sprayed dirt above brents head and as soon as i get these gates open ill prosecute you to hell brent crawled toward anita whose dark skin should never have looked so pale he untucked the pen that bound the tourniquet and loosened the cloth grimacing at the sight of the blood that flowed from her left arm need to free the circulation from time to time otherwise you might get gangrene too much information she said weakly sorry cold anita turned her head to the side and made vomiting noises but nothing came from her stomach hearts racing think im in shock brent retightened the tourniquet he strained to push a large rock toward her propping her sneakers on it this is supposed to help whered you learn all this i did a story about an emergency firstaid team and now youre an expert lord i wish i hadnt asked the cam era breathing rapidly anita noticed that brent had set it down so that it pointed toward them the red light was on youre recording us dont you want to be a star for a moment brent thought he heard an approaching engine his pulse raced with the hope that the police had heard the explosions and were coming but at once the faint drone stopped and he feared hed imagined it he picked up the camera and hoped that the smoke and flames would shield him as he hurried to the front of the burning van staying back from the heat he aimed the camera along the side and focused on the guard who stood before the inside gate he seemed to be studying it hes not sure if the fence still has any juice to it brent realized when the helicopter crashed onto the fence did it cut off the electricity or will he get fried if he touches the gate the guard evidently decided not to take the chance he swung to ward the shed ran past the truck piled with corpses and vanished through the doorway anita brent rushed over to her he went inside i think hes shutting off the electricity to the fence if im right hell soon come for us hurry we need to move she licked her dry lips and nodded help me up after he lifted her she hooked her unwounded right arm around his neck he linked his left arm around her waist holding the camera with his right hand he helped her waver along the dirt road the elevation of rostovs airport was five thousand feet page climbed three thousand five hundred feet higher than that and headed west along the county road that according to his aerial map formed one boundary of the observatorys prohibited airspace that altitude provided a good perspective on the flat sparse grassland off to the right tori adjusted the microphone on her headset two columns of smoke she pointed even at a distance the white observatory dishes were obvious including the one that was tilted sideways and aimed toward the south east one section of smoke was on the left side of the dishes very close to them the other was in front of the dishes rising from a dirt lane that led from the observatory to the county road the dark smoke reminded page uncomfortably of the gasoline tanker hed seen explode in santa fe just four days earlier as he guided the cessna along the boundary road he and tori came parallel to the fires on their right gaining a closer view she removed binoculars from pages flight bag and peered through them adjusting their focus wreckage near the dishes she sounded more troubled rotor blades looks like a helicopter crashed she aimed the binoculars to ward the lane the other fires coming from a vehicle a van its got a dish on it looks like a television news van page activated the police radio cessna four three alpha calling captain medrano immediately medranos voice crackled through pages headset go ahead were seeing what appears to be a downed helicopter next to the observatory it and a television news van are on fire what it isnt clear what happened i told you prohibited flight areas usually involve national security do you suppose theres some kind of special government project there the kind terrorists would want to attack the fbi must be worried about the same thing medranos voice said starkly they gave you permission to take a closer look they also gave me permission to send police cars in there understood i have clearance to enter he banked to the right toward the columns of smoke through the canopy the white dishes got bigger tori kept staring through the binoculars do you see any survivors page asked no wait yes but not at the helicopter at the van i see two people stumbling along the road theyre heading in our direction a man and a woman it looks like the womans hurt as page flew closer they came into his line of sight struggling along the dirt lane the man held the woman up with his left arm he was carrying something in his lowered right hand is that a television camera tori asked in amazement my god thats the tv reporter whos been looking for us the womans knees bent she slumped dragging the man down with her both of them toppling to the ground tori adjusted the binoculars the womans covered with blood medranos voice blurted through pages headset the fbi has rescinded your clearance turn around get out of there page frowned at tori whats going on he was about to press the police radios transmit button but medrano kept talking you must be rightthis has something to do with national security and somebody with influence must be involved a special team is being sent in page kept flying toward the observatory do you copy medranos voice demanded your clearance to enter the prohibited airspace is no longer valid turn around the police radios been acting up lately page told tori all i hear is static yeah i dont hear him either page gestured toward the man and woman whod toppled onto the lane the woman was sprawled on her back while the man knelt be side her doing something to her left arm how long do you think itll take for that special team to get organized page wondered the nearest place they can come from is el paso maybe farther away than that my guess is itll take at least two hours for help to arrive that woman might be dead by then do you understand medranos voice was loud enough to be distorted you do not have clearance to enter that airspace page shut off the radio it keeps overheating too beyond the burning van he saw that three high fences encircled the observatory dishes an openbacked truck was parked near a shed like building the dishes loomed at a thousand feet page flew over them made a turn and headed back toward the man and woman sprawled on the lane as the plane went over the observatory tori peered straight down that truck near the small building she said what about it i think i saw she stopped suddenly your voice sounds strange whats wrong corpses in the back corpses a bunch of them tori said page immediately banked to the left he flew in a circle and re turned over the dishes heading toward the truck this time he positioned the plane so he could look down from his side in the back of the truck bodies were dumped on top of one an other legs and arms splayed in every direction so that he couldnt count them some wore tan uniforms others white lab coats jesus he said as he neared the couple on the lane again the man looked up in desperation but what page concentrated on was the lane itself made of dirt it appeared to be flat but that didnt mean there werent rocks or potholes that could blow a tire or snap off wheels causing the plane to flip tory is your seat belt tight is there any other way for a seat belt to be he pulled back on the throttle causing the plane to lose altitude at the same time he eased back on the yoke tilting the nose slightly upward reducing speed to reduce speed further he lowered the maximum flaps the plane sank toward the ground at sixty knots page leveled the aircraft above the lane and felt it settle in most landings he protected the nose wheel by touching down on the two main wheels first for this kind of landing however the objective was to stop in the shortest distance possible which meant there wasnt time for the front wheel to settle gently onto the lane in stead page landed on all three wheels the moment he felt the jolt he pressed his feet on the brake pedals and pulled back on the yoke he came to a stop a mere two hundred feet from where hed touched down in a rush he shut off the aircrafts engine vaguely aware of the clinking sound of seat belts as he and tori unbuckled them he opened the door jumped to the ground grabbed a firstaid kit from under the back seat and ran toward the couple on the lane tori was next to him matching his urgent pace they reached the man and woman and yes the man was the television reporter looking more haggard than ever his ear bloody his suit and blond hair caked with dirt but page didnt have time for any more details as he crouched next to the woman and tried not to think about the quantity of blood that soaked her clothes keep your head down the reporter urged what happened to her she was shot keep your head down shot page unzipped the firstaid kit the guard might be back by now ashen the reporter looked over his shoulder toward the observatory a guard shot her tori asked in confusion page studied the necktie that served as a tourniquet did you do this he asked the reporter it was all i could think of you probably saved her life page stared at the huge ugly exit wound he thought he saw bone no time to clean it tori open these packets while she did he pulled a small roll of duct tape from the kit im sorry i dont have anything for the pain he told the woman she didnt reply her eyes were half open tori handed him the open packets he squeezed antiseptic cream into the wound and covered it with a wad of bloodabsorbent material scissors he said fumbling through the kit need scissors use this knife the reporter pulled one from his pants a black folding knife with a thumb button on the side of the blade its hers page sliced off a section of duct tape he wrapped it around the womans arm then cut off another section of tape and applied it too ill cut while you wrap tori said taking the knife and the tape as he applied more tape creating a pressure bandage a red light caught his attention it was on the television camera which the re porter angled in his direction evidently recording the scene page couldnt allow himself to be distracted he finished the pres sure bandage and undid the tourniquet waiting to see if blood would flow past the tape dirt suddenly pelted him accompanied by a distant cracking sound what the more dirt struck his face amid further distant cracking sounds he saw puffs of dust rising from the road somebodys shooting at us oh shit the guard got the gates open hes coming the reporter moaned why is he shooting at us tori asked why are there corpses in that truck page stared past the burning van toward the huge dishes the gates to all three fences were now open a man stood outside the third gate and aimed a rifle which bucked from the recoil dirt exploded on the lane the crack from the shot echoed were just out of range page said the man stepped forward and fired again after a moment a bullet tore up dirt a little closer we need to reach the cessna page said hurry before he gets closer he put his arms around the injured womans legs and shoulders lifting her the smell of her blood was strong as he charged along the lane even though she was thin she felt heavy her hips sinking her feet and arms flopping the reporter ran ahead of him carrying the television camera tori reached the cessnas passenger door and yanked it open tilting the seat forward page stooped beneath the high wing and eased the wounded woman into the back seat get in there he told the reporter buckle her seat belt buckle your own as he hurried around the back of the plane he heard tori helping the reporter climb inside a frantic glance down the lane showed him that the guard was running in their direction the guard stopped and fired dirt flew near the cessnas tail somewhere in that dirt a bullets ricocheting page thought he drew his pistol and aimed extremely high if he fired straight ahead his bullets would drop to the ground before they had a chance to come anywhere close to the distant target by aiming high however he gave the bullets an arc that increased their range much of their force would be lost when they landed but page hoped they would strike near enough to the gunman to make him pause in rapid order page pulled the trigger six times six clouds of dust burst from the lane in front of the gunman making him stumble back immediately page ran along the left side of the plane and yanked open the door scrambling inside tori was in the passenger seat fastening her belt page jabbed the master switch turned the ignition key and worked the throttle abruptly the propeller spun roaring when he released the brakes he felt the cessna bump along the dirt lane the two additional passengers added weight reducing the engines power come on page thought move feeling the cessna bump faster along the lane page imagined the guard racing to get within range he braced himself for bullets that would tear through the rear windscreen and slam into his backor that would damage the rear wings and make it impossible for him to get the cessna into the air the planes blowing dust the reporter shouted from the back i cant see the guard which means the guard cant see the plane page thought but that wont stop him from shooting toward us their speed reached fiftyfive knots page pulled back the yoke and felt the aircraft leave the ground he stayed low wanting to gain more speed before he went higher right now distance was the key not height when he thought hed gone a sufficient distance he eased farther back on the yoke and pointed the planes nose toward the horizon he was abruptly aware that his shirt was soaked with sweat tori take the controls he put on his headset it muffled the engines roar as he activated the radio system taking back the controls he said he couldnt contact medrano on the police radio after all his excuse for entering the prohibited airspace was that the police radio had failed instead he used the planes standard radio although rostovs airport didnt have a control tower he hoped someone in the office would hear him rostov traffic cessna four three alpha has an injured passenger a gunshot victim we need an ambulance at the airport my eta is five minutes rostov i hear you four three alpha a voice said through pages head set it belonged to the man in the frayed coveralls whod given page his rentalcar papers ill get that ambulance page tilted his head toward the reporter in back how is she unconscious but it looks like the duct tape sealed the wound to pages right the stock pens outside rostov came into view as did the courthouse on the main street people and vehicles seemed everywhere exploring the town before night settled and they went to the viewing area he descended toward the airport northeast of town but not before he took a hard look at the collapsed rusted hangars and the cracked overgrown airstrip on the abandoned military airbase in the opposite direction there wasnt any sign of the vehicles hed seen on the base the evening before beyond the ruin of the airbase he frowned toward the boulders that looked like giant cinders strewn in a chaotic semi circle all that remained of the volcanic rim that had spewed them to the surface eons earlier lockhart lay on the ground and spoke into the radio the planes taking off theres a lot of dust but i can see that the guards still running and firing shoot the son of a bitch raleighs voice ordered im not within accurate range sir get closer yes sir he scanned the sky it looks like the plane escaped by tomorrow therell be no way to contain this if i hadnt put a quarantine on that place thered be police cars all over there by now i dont want anybody guessing what that facility really does after you take care of the guard destroy all the equipment in the observatory make it look as if he did it yes sir remaining low lockhart watched the guard continue firing to ward the departing airplanehe kept squeezing the trigger even after he ran out of ammunition as the lowering sun made the dust look scarlet the guard glared toward the sky then turned and took long angry strides back toward the first of the three fences lockhart was to the guards right just behind him and about two hundred yards away bullets from an m could travel that far but lockhart couldnt depend on where they would hit to stop the guard rather than merely startle him he needed to get closer satisfied that he wasnt in the guards line of vision he stood tucked the radio into the duffel bag that hung from his shoulder picked up his m and broke into a run as the man passed the burning van and got closer to the observatory lockhart increased his pace the duffel bag bumping against his side his thicksoled shoes crunched on the pebbly soil but the breeze was blowing in his direction so the slight sound wouldnt carry he couldnt allow the man to reach the door to the shed he strained his legs to their full length charging across the scrub grass he ignored the sweat that dripped from his face the guard reached the first gate lockhart raced nearer the guard reached the second gate lockhart had seen the difficulty that the guard had experienced when trying to shoot through the three fences continuing to rush forward he simultaneously veered toward the lane need to shoot through the open gates he thought a hundred yards abruptly the guard stopped walking toward the tiny building does he hear me lockhart worried the guard turned but instead of looking in lockharts direction he came back and reached for the first open gate as he started to close it he froze at the sight of lockhart racing toward the lane lockhart stopped raised the m fought to control his breathing and leveled the rifles sights on the target his exertion made his arms unsteady years of combat training enabled him to brace his muscles and keep the barrel from wavering the guard raised his weapon and tried to shoot first but nothing happenedhed used all his ammunition when hed fired at the air plane he turned and ran toward the middle gate lockhart pulled the trigger the selector switch on his rifle was set to deliver bursts of three shots the first group missed he took a deep breath held it and fired again the guard lurched but kept running he passed through the second gate and headed toward the final one each frenzied step taking him farther away making him a more difficult target lockhart fired another burst and again the guard seemed to lurch but he made it past the openbacked truck disappearing into the darkness beyond the sheds open door cursing lockhart fired into the void of the door his ammunition ran out so he ejected the empty magazine pulled a fresh one from his duffel bag slammed it home freed the bolt and fired yet again through the open door then he realized how out in the open he was and what an excellent target he made now that the guard had been given the opportunity to reload he darted to the left of the lane stopping where the three lines of fences provided some cover and dropped to the ground making himself a smaller target unfortunately while the fences gave him some protection potentially deflecting bullets they also protected the guard lockhart studied the open door i hit him twice im almost positive hes probably bleeding to death in there the void taunted him sure its just a matter of time ill wait for a while and let him bleed out after that therell be no problem getting inside right no problem abruptly the door was slammed shut in the weakening light lockhart stared at it cautiously he stood walked to the lane and went through the three open gates he looked for blood on the lane but didnt see any i didnt hit him after all he just stumbled aiming his weapon he approached the closed door it was solid metal yesterday when hed arrived with colonel raleigh and the team hed noticed how thick it was he had no doubt that it locked automatically just as he had no doubt that similar thick metal lined the entire concrete structure the pad next to the door would require a specific sequence to unlock it and it wouldnt matter if the colonel knew the numbers that had been used yesterdaythe guard would almost certainly have changed that sequence by now even if i had grenades i wouldnt be able to get through that door lockhart thought he studied the ground again but didnt see any blood he walked to the openbacked truck and smelled the corpses before he saw them to vent his frustration he shot the security camera above the door and a security camera on one of the fence poles there were plenty of others to destroy and he did so one after the other now the guard wouldnt be able to see what he was doing but the destruction didnt really accomplish anything because lockhart had no way of getting inside the colonel isnt going to be happy lockhart waited several seconds before making himself reach for the twoway radio in the duffel bag page landed as softly as he could keeping the nose wheel off the ground as long as possible so the injured woman wouldnt feel a jolt he taxied from the runway toward the airports adobe office where the man in frayed coveralls stood waiting after shutting off the engine page quickly got out tilted the seat forward and eased the woman from the back seat she remained unconscious the man in the coveralls rushed to help the ambulance is on the way he said as they set her gently on the pavement using the cessnas shadow to keep her out of the sun page heard the wail of approaching sirens the highway patrols on its way too the man said page didnt look forward to that conversation tori and the reporter joined them tinted by the red light of the sunset the reporter faced him i didnt get a chance to introduce myself he had the television camera on his shoulder and it took some effort for him to hold it with his left arm while he extended his right hand the sleeve of his suit coat was torn brent loft i know who you are page said loft missed his tone evidently pleased that page recognized him and i certainly know who you are excuse me page asked you have red hair loft said turning to tori youre the couple ive been looking fordaniel and victoria page from santa fe ive done my homework you stopped the shootings on thursday night is that camera still on page asked its worthless if it isnt page had been through so much that his emotions nearly over whelmed him his need to shield tori almost made him yank the camera from lofts hands and hurl it onto the concrete the approaching sirens helped him keep control he took a deep breath cant this wait its not something we want to talk about right now we saved your life with luck we got your friend back here in time isnt that worth something give us a break loft glanced in the direction of his unconscious companion and nodded as he turned back to tori the sirens wailed closer i have only one question you expect me to believe that really just one question what is it tori demanded im tired of hiding from you lets get this over with i can understand how your husband was able to do what he did hes a professional trained to take charge in emergencies but youre a real estate agent in your place most people would have panicked somehow you found the strength to pick up a pistol and stop the gunman your courage was remarkable how on earth were you able to do that there wasnt a choice tori answered he was trying to kill my husband she looked directly at page then back to the reporter how could i not have tried to protect my husband so youre saying it was love that gave you courage loft asked yes tori looked again at page love gave me courage loft lowered the camera and studied each of them thank you for saving anita and me the sirens became terribly loud an ambulance sped into view and skidded to a stop next to the airports office followed closely by a highway patrol car attendants jumped from the ambulance hurrying to unfold the wheels of a gurney one carried an emergency kit as they rushed toward the woman lying on the pavement medrano got out of the patrol car put on his stetson straightened to his full height and took powerful strides toward page his voice was strong i told you not to fly into that area thats news to me page said next to him the ambulance attendants put an oxygen mask over the womans face and attached an iv line you said the government gave me clearance to ignore the restriction and then they revoked it i warned you to get out of there if you told us to leave we didnt hear it tori said the police radio stopped working loft stepped forward balancing the television camera on his shoulder focusing it on medrano captain im brent loft from firstonthescene news in el paso this couple did an amazing thing at great risk to their lives they landed their aircraft on hazardous terrain at the observatory so they could stop a guard from killing us in fact as you can see hed al ready shot my partner they loaded us on their plane and took off the entire time i was afraid the maniac would fire another grenade at us medrano was taken by surprise grenade hed already used one to shoot down a helicopter then he fired one at our van why was he firing grenades i have no idea any more than i know why he piled all those corpses onto the back of a truck corpses in a truck a lot of them enough to fill it he kept babbling about wanting to listen to music loft continued aiming the camera something bad is going on over there captain you need to get your men to that observatory before god knows what else happens medrano opened his mouth to say something then decided against it he hurried to his cruiser where he reached for the micro phone on his police radio and spoke urgently into it loft lowered the camera and aimed it toward the ambulance attendants as they lifted the woman onto the gurney hows she doing page asked lost plenty of blood an attendant answered shed have lost more if it werent for the guy with the camera ill use that quote when i edit this loft said he stepped quickly over to the ambulance and began talking to the attendants at the open doors he used his free hand to gesture persuasively the next thing he climbed into the back page shook his head i hate to say this but i think were going to be seeing a lot more of him on television siren blaring the ambulance rushed away the man in the frayed coveralls came over to them ill help you push your plane to a tiedown spot actually were going up again page told him the man frowned toward the dimming sky never liked flying at night we still have something to settle am i right tori or maybe you dont feel the need any longer more than ever tori said lets finish this the hum had become so intense that it felt like a drill boring into halloways skull soon he thought soon i wont hear it any longer soon the only thing ill hear will be the music but despite his determination he needed all of his willpower not to be distracted while he finished rigging the booby trap the designlearned in iraqconsisted of two trip wires the first was stretched across the upper part of the stairs if an assault team some how managed to force the door open up there theyd respond to their training and check for traps after they spotted the wire and the grenades it was attached to theyd disengage it then proceed down the stairs the second wirein shadows stretched across a lower part of the stairswas the killer as he worked the hum made halloways hands want to shake but he refused to let that happen grinding his teeth he tied the wire to a cluster of concealed grenades satisfied that the work had been done correctly he carefully descended the remainder of the stairs at the bottom he increased speed along the hallway and entered the surveillance room where he saw that even more screens had gone blank one of the few that was working showed the man whod shot at him as he raised his m and fired another screen went dead well thats okay halloway thought i wasnt going to be watching the monitors anyhow he picked up his reloaded m and went down the hallway to the door marked data analysis inside hed already placed five other ms on a table along with numerous hundredround magazines and a small stack of grenades if an assault team tried to stop him from listening to the music he planned to show them just how furious that would make him the room still smelled of death mostly because of the dried blood that covered the floor but halloway didnt have time to clean it any way when the music started the scent of cinnamon would replace the stench of the blood because he didnt know how to manipulate the electronic instruments hed kept all of them on their panels glowing continuously the only switch he felt confident using was the one that activated either the speakers or the headphones and the only knob he knew how to control was for the volume while hed prepared the booby trap hed kept the sound coming from the speakers it had been loud enough that he could hear the static from a distance more important hed been able to hear growing hints of music emerging from the static those halfheard alluring echoes were what had made him capable of working despite the agony of his headache now the music was more than just hints and echoes strengthening it drifted and floated halloway felt its eerie tones lifting him the pain of the drill boring into his brain mercifully receded the hum diminished overcome by the sensual melody that again brought the taste of orange juice and vodka he closed his eyes the woman he danced with whispered into each of his ears kissed them drew her tongue along them it left his ears wet he put his hands to them and opened his eyes long enough to see what was on them blood was dripping from his ears raleigh finished yet another phone call in a successful effort to keep law enforcement away from the observatory the voices in the urgent conversation had sounded distant because he couldnt take the risk of removing his earplugs now that it was almost dark outside and the static on the audio monitors was beginning to resolve itself into music the words national security were a powerful invocation with the cooperation of the fbi raleigh had again stopped the highway patrol from entering the restricted area hed arranged for equipment to be delivered that would allow an assault team to break into the observatory after they eliminated the guard and cleaned the facility so that outside agencies couldnt question its true purpose raleigh would make sure the bastards autopsy revealed a high blood level of crack cocaine explaining his psychotic behavior with one crisis dealt with but anticipating more he set down the phone stepped from the command center and surveyed the eight men poised in front of the numerous electronic consoles their faces reflecting the glow of instruments they turned dials refining and adjusting the incoming signals in response to his orders theyd turned off the audio capability of their monitors their earplugs were firmly in place raleigh thought about his greatgrandfather who in had flown toward the lights and never been seen again his great grandmother had taken her twoyearold son and moved to boston but despite the distance that shed put between herself and the lights she hadnt been able to keep them out of her thoughts her memories of the lights and her husband became the bedtime stories she told her son who grew up dreaming about them when he was twenty and skin cancer finally killed his mother he hitchhiked all the way to texas he needed to hitchhike because the great depression continued to ravage the nation using his legs and his thumb was the only way he could afford to make the trip his name was edward his mothers story about his fathers disappearance had so obsessed him from when he was a child that he was drawn to rostov the way religious people are drawn to holy places it took him three months to get there when he finally arrived his belt was cinched so tightly that it barely kept his pants up his shoes had holes in them his shirt was tattered his face was browned by the sun the drygoods store that edwards mother had told him about was still in businessalthough barely judging from the meager samples in the front window a bell rang when he opened the door a tired looking grayhaired man and woman looked questioningly at him from behind a counter despite their age he could see the resemblance immediately im your grandson he announced they gaped before they could ask any questions he said the thing he had wanted to say all his life tell me where to go to see the lights they gaped even more edward helped at the drygoods store he also found parttime jobs painting barns and repairing wooden sidewalks in exchange for new shoes clothes and the extra food his grandmother needed to prepare in boston meat had been a luxury but not in cattle country his grandmothers beef and potatoes helped him regain the weight hed lost on his trek every night edward borrowed his grandfathers battered chevrolet pickup truck and drove out to see the lightsor to try to see them because they didnt appear are you sure theyre real he asked his grandparents have you ever seen them yes his grandmother said and his grandfather nodded in agreement its been a while since we tried though my mother swore she saw them a lot at first she couldnt see them either his grandfather explained it took quite a while my father believed in them enough to risk his life edward said beginning to feel angry as if something were being hidden from him so where are they why cant i see them some people just cant his grandmother said matteroffactly why not no one knows that left him feeling more exasperated than ever on the days when he couldnt find work he hiked through the area where the lights were said to appear he stood where his father had built the airfield during world war i weeds and grass filled the un paved runway the length of which was just barely visible the adobe buildings that had functioned as hangars were piles of dirt he studied the distant rim of black boulders that looked like huge cinders the aptly named badlands he stared to the south toward mexico no one ever found the wreckage of an airplane he asked his grandparents some of his former students tried they flew fifty milesall the way to mexico a couple of them actually flew into mexico they went back and forth in what they called grids but no one ever found your father or his plane but nobody just disappears the wings were covered with linen and hardened by shellac if the plane crashed and burned the debris could have been blown away by the wind and his body coyotes god bless him johns bones could have been carried off i want to see the lights maybe youre trying too hard the next day edward dug postholes on a ranch until he earned enough to buy a bottle of whiskeysomething that wasnt easy to locate because even though prohibition had ended four years earlier rostov had voted to remain dry at dark edward drove out to the old airfield sat on the ground opened the bottle and began sipping until then the only alcohol hed ever sampled was beer but the chance of obtaining beer in rostov turned out to be even slimmer than that of finding whiskey be sides he wanted something strong it burned his throat he felt its heat go all the way to his stomach he gagged and almost threw it up at least it acted more quickly than beer would have because he wasnt used to it he didnt need much before he felt off balance as if something in his skull were tilting soon his tongue felt thick his eyes became heavy the moon and stars went out of focus come on edward shouted let me see you his words were slurred im not trying hard anymore im relaxed more than relaxed he laughed giddily and took another sip hell im drunk drunk as a skunk damned stinkin drunk he closed his eyes fought to open them closed them again and passed out the night brought a cool breeze that wavered edwards hair and caressed his cheeks he dreamed of being on a boat floating on a current his mind drifted rising and falling he woke to the glare of the rising sun but when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids he saw darkness off to his right the stars and the moon were still there but mostly he saw darkness on his right on his left the rising sun persisted and when edward lifted his painful head from the dirt on which he lay he saw that the sun was in fact a floating ball of light groggy he watched it divide becoming red and yellow the two orbs dissolved into four adding blue and green they split into eight adding orange purple brown and a blinding silver pulsing closer they grew larger their shimmer more intense there was something else some kind of sound he couldnt identify a hiss or hum or possibly distant music as if from a radio station that had faded almost beyond hearing even though his mother had said that the lights had frightened her the first time shed seen them edward hadnt expected to have the same reaction after all the lights had caused his mother and father to fall in love if it hadnt been for the lights edward would never have been born his father had been so mesmerized by the lights that hed done everything possible to try to find where they came from but as the colors of the lights increased before him dispelling the darkness what edward felt wasnt the fear his mother had described it was worse than that it was terror his mother had been a fervent churchgoer each sunday shed made edward go with her always staying at the back coming in late and leaving early so that people wouldnt see the lesions on her face he recalled very little of those sunday mornings except his impatience to go and playand a particular sermon that the minister had delivered the subject was christs transfiguration a word that ed ward then ten years old hadnt understood but that he asked his mother to repeat several times afterward until he memorized it because the sermon had made an unnerving impression on him in the gospels the minister had said christ took three of the apostles to the top of a mountain where he transformed himself into his true radiance his clothes became as brilliant as the sun the light was so blinding that the apostles fell to the ground lowering their eyes in fear when they finally looked up again christ had changed back to human form rise he told them dont be afraid dont tell others about this vision the minister had used this passage to explain how glorious heaven would be how brilliant and spellbinding but that hadnt made any sense to edward how could something be both glorious and terrifying at the same time it seemed to him that heaven should make someone want to rush toward it rather than fall to the ground in fear that story about christs blinding light gave edward nightmares perhaps because it merged with his mothers story about the lights and his fathers disappearance in years to come he would often think about it after his mother died he even spoke to the minister about it although the minister didnt seem to get his point which was that it might not be so easy to tell the difference between good and evil if a vision of goodness made the apostles afraid was it possible that a vision of evil would make them walk toward it that would be logical because evil was tempting but in a sane world shouldnt evil be terrifying and goodness tempting why was everything reversed thats gods way of testing us the minister said but why do we need to be tested because our first parents were tested and failed we are their fallen children we need to prove that we wont repeat their sin the choice ought to be clearer edward persisted the story only tells me that its hard to know the difference if christ showed the apostles a vision of heaven shouldnt it have been so wonderful that hed have urged them to spread the word why did he tell them to keep it a secret that passage isnt clear hows this for a theory reverend what if heavens so radiant that its terrifying maybe people shouldnt know what its really like until they finally get there and its too late to back out ill pray for your soul now the brilliance of the lights made edward as frightened as the apostles had been at the sight of christs heavenly radiance he told himself that his reaction was wrong that he ought to be entranced by the shimmering beauty he was finally seeing i came all this way and tried so hard to see you youre glorious i ought to feel awestruck maybe his fear was a sign of how truly good the lights were he thought but then he was struck by something more than awe the lights changed clouds of the darkest thunderstorm suddenly churned within them lightning flashed at their core as thunder punished his ears he saw a figure amid the clouds a young man in a uniform who looked like the photographs edward had seen of his father the man held out his hand beckoning for edward to step into the clouds and join him edward screamed turning he ran without realizing it he charged along the airstrip that his father had built and had flown from countless times years ago he stumbled falling on stones scraping his jaw he scrambled to his feet and ran harder he heard a wail and realized that it was coming from him that he couldnt stop screaming the next thing he knew people were all around him grabbing him trying to calm him hed raced all the way back to town and had been so frenzied that he hadnt realized how far hed gone standing in the middle of the main street he was surrounded by townspeople most of whom wore nightclothes and held lanterns or flashlights edward whats the matter his grandfather asked in alarm what happened to you clouds lightning edward blurted whats he talking about someone asked look at the stars the skys perfectly clear lights clouds in the lights i smell whiskey thunder saw a man in the clouds reeks of it my father look at the blood on his chin hes so drunk he fell down edward whered you get the whiskey his grandfather demanded goods terrifying edward blurted so bright too drunk to make sense wheres my truck edward did you wreck my truck his grand father asked sternly evil feels welcoming edward raved his grandfather shook him answer me edward wheres my truck well ive got better things to do than waste a good nights sleep on a drunk someone said come on sarah lets go back to bed saw my father edward persisted damn it edward just be honest and tell me if you wrecked my truck the next morning edward walked to where hed left the truck near the old airstrip for a long time he stared toward the southern horizon had he been so drunk that hed hallucinated no he didnt believe that he was convinced that the whiskey had long since worn off by the time hed seen the lights i wasnt drunk when it happened i know it i know what i saw he started the truck drove back to town left it outside the dry goods store and hitchhiked two hundred miles to el paso where he joined the army from that moment he had one ambitionto read the reports his father had written about the lights edward had no doubt that those reports would be hard to obtain but he was certain of something elsethat the son of a revered world war i ace would advance quickly in his military career he judged correctly it turned out that many officers of importance had served with his father during the expedition into mexico and later in france and germany by after pearl harbor and americas en try into world war ii edward had risen quickly to the rank of captain in military intelligence a branch hed pursued because it gave him the best chance of learning where his fathers reports were located on a rainy october afternoon after having searched in washing ton dc and at the presidio in san francisco edward uncovered hints that took him back to el pasos fort bliss from a disintegrating box in a musty quonset hut filled with hundreds of similar long forgotten boxes he withdrew documents that his father had written twentyfour years earlier they were yellow with age the words looked painfully typed the ink on his fathers signature had turned from blue to brown edward read the reports then read them again and again the text was revealing especially the section in which his father maintained that the lights had somehow caused his student pilots to at tack one another in night training his father had become convinced that somehow the lights could be used as a weapon anita had an iv line leading into her right arm prongs from an oxy gen tube filled her nostrils behind her a beeping monitor indicated her pulse blood pressure and heart rhythm the doctor says you need surgery but youre going to be okay brent told her sitting next to her bed she managed to nod and raise her eyelids slightly groggily at tempting to see him her dark skin was only slightly less pale the bullet broke your arm brent continued the doctor says thats why the pain feels so deep the bone needs to be set again anita managed a slight nod theyre going to take you to the operating room now brent said when you wake up ill be here that might not be the most thrilling promise maybe im the last person you want to see all the same like it or not when you wake up ill be here anita tried to raise her uninjured arm save your strength brent said she reached weakly for his hand brent held it you did damned good today he told her you never stopped trying you never gave up i promiseyoull win an emmy you deserve it her hand drooped after easing it onto the bed brent heard foot steps behind him two nurses entered ready to wheel her to the operating room he went out to the echoing corridor where hospital visitors gave him troubled looks as they passed him his torn coat sleeve flopped at his side his hair was rumpled and dusty dirt and blood smeared his suit his producer waited for him you really want to go on the air looking like that youll scare the hell out of some of your viewers good let them realize what it takes to get a story they walked quickly toward the elevator did you see the video i got on that camera brent asked dynamite were editing it now ill do a commentary we could use sections of it tonight then run all the footage as a onehour special brent pressed the elevators down button the other stations wont come near us in the ratings how are we going to connect the lights with what the guard did we dont need to run the stories back to back viewers will make the connection on their own we wont be accused of misrepresenting get me to the viewing area i have a feeling this storys about to become even more sensational sharons anchoring the show at the moment the producer braced himself as if he expected an outburst brent nodded why not ive been hogging the camera she deserves more airtime thats a surprising answer coming from you one thing anita made me realize is sometimes two people can get a better story brent looked down the hallway toward where anitas gurney appeared the nurses wheeling her from the room is she really going to be okay the producer asked the bullet didnt just break her arm it shattered bones brent told him the doctor warned me that he might not be able to save it in the gathering darkness page and tori climbed into the cessna behind them the airports office had a light over the door other lights gleamed through the windows page was careful not to look in that direction human eyes needed thirty minutes to adjust fully to the dark bright light could ruin night vision in an instant with the result that another thirty minutes would be required the only color of light that didnt compromise night vision was red as a consequence the two flashlights page kept in his flight bag came with a choice of lenses clear or red he switched to the latter and used a cord to hang the flashlight around his neck tori did the same in the dark human eyes had difficulty seeing anything that was straight ahead for that reason page focused on murky objects to the right and left doing a slow scan to make sure it was safe to switch on the engine clear he shouted through his open window warning anyone in the vicinity to stay away he turned the ignition key and the engine roared to life he used his left thumb to press the radio button on the cessnas controls speaking into his headsets microphone addressing any active planes in the area rostov traffic cessna four three alpha is taxiing to one five he tested the brakes did another scan of the shadowy area around him and guided the plane along the yellow taxiway line tori the way you answered that reporters question i told you this afternoon for the first time i feel as if i under stand you maybe i should have asked to go along with you in your police car so i could get an idea of what you go through each day the terrible things people do to one another i didnt talk about them because i didnt want you to feel what i do thank you for trying to shield me she fell silent for a moment then spoke again whatever the cancer doctors say after my operation on tuesday whether my life is going to be short or long i cant imagine not sharing it with you and i dont want you to stop being a policeman youre too good at it now quit talking and get this crate in the air page taxied past the indistinct shapes of airplanes in the tiedown area and reached the entrance to the runway the final checklist helped him to calm his emotions and concentrate on the task ahead he radioed his intentions then increased speed along the runway at fiftyfive knots he pulled back the yoke the plane rose through the darkness looking down he noticed a steady stream of headlights moving toward the blockedoff observation area the vehicles were parking along the road in a line much longer than the one the evening before the viewing area had floodlights pointed toward the concrete barriers presumably to emphasize that the place was offlimits the lights from three helicopters showed where they hovered keeping a safe distance from one another listening to their radio communications page learned that they were television news choppers a wonderful clear sky tori said look at the glow from the streets and houses in rostov and thereheadlights from cars driving in from mexico i can actually count six pairs page banked the cessna in a slow gentle circle using the flood lights at the observation area as a reference how high do you plan to go tori asked enough to get above everything he answered sounds like the way to run a life the concrete barriers were wide enough for medrano to stand on raising his left hand to shield his eyes from the glaring floodlights he watched in dismay as the crowd got larger this areas closed he shouted through a bullhorn turn around drive back to town amid the clamor of the crowd someone yelled back at him this roads public property my taxes paid for it ive got a right to stay here as long as i want it isnt safe medrano responded im telling you go back to town you know where you can go somebody shouted to hell people stretched to grip the top of the barriers and climb over what is it you dont want us to see a woman demanded what are you hiding turn off those damned floodlights a man complained they hurt my eyes yeah those arent the kind of lights we came for no sooner did police officers pull one group of people off the barricades than another group tried to climb them three helicopters roared above the viewing area keeping a distance from one another aiming their landing lights and exterior television cameras toward the commotion i dont have anywhere near enough officers medrano thought surveying the chaos somebody yelled if you wont let us over those barricades well go around them my wifes got alzheimers were here for the miracle medrano watched helplessly as hundreds of people headed down the road and veered toward a field on the right but some went in the opposite direction toward the abandoned military airfield and that was one place medrano definitely couldnt let anyone go stop them from getting onto that airbase he shouted to his officers theyll blow themselves up jumping from the barricade medrano bent his knees as he landed on the roads gravel shoulder breathless he straightened and ran to ward the base there a man and a furiously barking german shepherd warned people not to climb the barbedwire fence suddenly the floodlights failed people shouted in alarm as darkness enveloped him all medrano saw were the residual images of the glaring lights imprinted on his eyes somebody must have sabotaged the generator he thought but it wasnt only the generator automobile engines and head lights suddenly failed in place of the helicopters hectic thumping the only sound from the air was the whistle of slowing rotors medrano flinched from the sound of a massive crash it took him a stunned moment to realize that one of the helicopters had plum meted to the ground the impact echoed from the field on the opposite side of the road accompanied by a soaring fireball a second crash reverberated from the same direction medrano crouched sightlessly worried about where the third crash would occur on the road there wasnt one impact but several as the final helicopter dropped onto cars crumpling and shredding metal as rotors tore into asphalt an explosion knocked him backward raleigh watched the chaos on the monitors the nightvision capability of the outside cameras made the panicked crowd have a surreal greenish glow did that cop really believe all he needed to do was put up concrete barriers and everyone would stay away floodlights had gone dark cars and their headlights had become inoperative helicopters had fallen from the sky just one explanation could account for all thata massive electromagnetic pulse similar to one from a nuclear blast had sent a power surge through all the electronic equipment in the viewing area destroying it exactly as predicted raleigh thought hed reinforced the outside cameras and the entire underground facility with multiple layers of electromagnetic shielding the office behind him had three times the amount that the rest of the building had sir the readings are becoming more intense a member of his team said watching a computer screen despite his earplugs raleigh thought he felt a slight vibration or was he imagining it he glanced toward the shielded door to the command center youre channeling the signal through the dish above us he asked yes sir the signals being relayed to the observatory and then up to a satellite the satellite is beaming the signal to the white sands missile range but i dont know if the circuits can handle this much power weve never tested them at this level before july anybody here know what nuclear fission is the general in charge of the emergency intelligence meeting asked like the other officers at the long metal table capt edward raleigh did not im not sure i do either the general admitted apparently if you smash two sections of uranium together and you do it with enough force you can create a bomb with more power than anybodys ever imagined some scientists argue that the explosion could set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world but most conclude that it could be controlled to the extent of vaporizing a city general with all due respect a colonel asked youre serious about this three years ago einstein wrote a letter to the president alerting him that tests had validated the theory apparently einsteins contacts in the european scientific community warned him that the germans were stockpiling uranium and moving aggressively forward with nuclearfission research at that time of course we werent in the war but now we are and the presidents about to order a top secret program to create a nuclear weapon as soon as possible the scientist in charge will be robert oppenheimer he was a red sympathizer during the s so the fbis doing a thorough back ground check our job will be to maintain security at a place called los alamos in new mexico its marked on the map behind me a major went to the map and indicated the exact spot santa fe and a few other towns are a halfdays drive away otherwise theres nothing but ranches in the area which were confiscating the general said los alamos is a boys camp in the middle of nowhere oppenheimer went there when he was a kid its on top of a mesa with one road up and one road down easily contained oppenheimers thinking about using that mesa as the principal site for designing the bomb were going to make sure nobody eavesdrops sir there might be another outoftheway place thats equally suitable edward took the opportunity to say the general looked unhappy about being interrupted and where would that place be he asked impatiently west texas outside a town called rostov nothings there except millions of acres of ranchland we built an airstrip there before we entered the last war it was a good place to hide the pilots we were training so the germans wouldnt suspect how actively we were preparing to help the allies oppenheimers got his mind set on los alamos rostov may offer another advantage edward pressed there might be fission already occurring there the general began to look interested continue captain edward focused his remarks so that they related exclusively to nuclear fission he described his fathers reports and concluded by saying theres no doubt the lights are powerful ultimately my mother died from the skin cancer they gave her one theory is that theyre caused by radioactive elements in the soil if the rays can be channeled and used as a weapon the general held up a hand cutting him off put it in writing ill submit it to oppenheimer yes sir but edward knew what happened to reports a week later during the next meeting the general announced that los alamos would be the primary site for designing the atomic bomb edward contained his disappointment then the general surprised him by adding the germans are pursuing the development of a second major weapon the room became silent it may be related to nuclear fission or possibly its based on a totally different principle all we know is that since germany invaded norway in theyve sent a disproportionate number of soldiers therea halfmillion occupiers in a country of two million people many of those soldiers are in a position that strategically makes no sensesurrounding a small valley in the middle of norway the valleys called hessdalen the general looked directly at edward reports indicate that those soldiers are providing security for scientists investigating strange lights that appear there lights sir edward tried not to show the emotion building in side him with effects that apparently range from mass hallucination to religious rapture some people went blind from looking at them others became violenteven murderous still others developed cancerous lesions theres no telling if any of it is real but germanys committed to exploring those lights as a possible weapon and once they get interested in something you know damned well we need to do the same even if the lights are bogus all hitler needs to do is start the rumor that hes figured out how to use them as a weapon and de ploy it anywhere he wants sometimes psychological warfare can win more battles than tanks a colonel spoke up sir are these lights similar to the west texas phenomena that captain raleigh was talking about thats the conclusion the president came to if hitlers using them as smoke and mirrors to distract us from his nuclearfission program we can do the same thing captain raleigh youre ordered to take an exploratory team to whatever this town is in west texas its called rostov sir to prove how apparently serious we are two of oppenheimers researchers will accompany you theyll send equipment from the university of chicago the army corps of engineerswhich is building the los alamos facilitywill contribute a dozen men therell also be a rifle platoon to make a show of providing security if it turns out there is something useful about these lights so much the better but im willing to bet that the main thing well accomplish is to drive hitler crazy by making him think were not only commit ted to this project but actually making progress as a bonus youll act as a diversion from whats happening at los alamos before the end of the month edwards team flew on a c military transport plane to fort bliss then drove ten trucks of men and equipment to rostov as soon as they reached the old airfield they set up tents and unpacked electronic instruments activating a generator to provide an independent source of power oppenheimers researchers scanned the ground with geiger counters but couldnt find any trace of radioactivity youll need to scan a lot more ground than that edward pointed past the badlands the lights come from way over there i hope we made a big enough fuss about getting here one of the researchers said german spies keep watch on oppenheimer and anybody associated with him since were here word is bound to get back to germany the gangly bespectacled man scanned the featureless horizon the only things in sight were two jackrabbits and five scattered cows trying to eat the meager grass hell nobody would bother to come here if it wasnt desperately important the sunset was spectacular as darkness thickened the air cooled making them cross their arms across their chests so where are the lights a soldier asked they dont always come out give them time edward answered anybody got a smoke an engineer went into the sizable main tent and leaned his watch toward one of the glowing instruments its this has been a long day if something doesnt happen by oclock im heading for my cot you might need to give the lights more time than that edward said they dont exactly appear on a schedule well wake me if you see hitlers new secret weapon not that itll be easy to sleep with that generator droning and the static coming from that directional radio a researcher said doesnt matter what frequency i use thats all i receive no theres something in the background but i can barely hear it somebody chuckled probably a mexican radio station playing mariachi music look whats that over there a shooting star wow havent seen one since i was a kid ive been living in the city for so long i almost forgot what they look like theres another one no that ones not a shooting star its too low on the horizon and its lasting too long a bunch of them they look like skyrockets i bet were seeing fireworks from across the border does anybody know if its a mexican holiday hey whoevers in that tent stop turning up the volume on that radio the statics hurting my ears nobodys in the tent one of the researchers said the statics getting louder on its own and the fireworks are getting brighter a soldier said look at all those colors they remind me of the northern lights i saw them once when i was a kid and my dad took me camping on lake michigan but these are to the south and theyre awfully low on the horizon an engineer reminded him he turned and stared toward the tent are you sure nobodys screwing with that radio now the statics louder than the generator abruptly the static ended so did the shooting stars or the skyrockets or the northern lightsor whatever they were the horizon turned completely dark so did the glowing instruments in the tent the generator stopped droning what the hell happened to everything gentlemen edward said welcome to the lights page frowned when something changed on the ground behind the cessna the glow of the spotlights abruptly went out tori noticed it also something happened behind us he banked the aircraft to the left and returned in the direction from which theyd come but the landscape no longer appeared the same wheres the observation area i dont see the floodlights not only that tori said i dont see any headlights there was a whole line of traffic a couple of minutes ago now the roads invisible and the helicoptersi dont see their lights anymore either their radio transmissions have stopped page told her puzzled below them a fireball suddenly illuminated the darkness two other explosions followed startled page saw the twisting impact of a helicopter crashing onto vehicles at the side of the road its distant rumble reaching him huge chunks of metal flipped along the ground the spreading flames revealed specks of people racing away in panic god help them tori murmured shock waves bumped the plane maybe we should head back page managed to say no it cant be a coincidence somehow whats happening down there has to be connected to the lights we came up here to do somethingif we dont finish this now i dont think ill ever have the strength to try it again tori paused i want to find the truth whatever you want page assured her were in this together yes tori savored the word together avoiding the updraft of the flames and debris page flew south to ward the murky horizon what are those dark lumps ahead tori asked the badlands tori pointed somethings beyond them i dont see anything faint red lights three of them page concentrated i still dont see them theyre getting brighter where are they coming from give me a heading tori looked at the indicator one hundred and forty degrees all i see is blackness theyre dividing theyre even brighter now theyre changing from red to blue and green and yellow how can you possibly not see them maybe if i went lower theyre dividing again page eased back on the throttle the aircraft gradually descended the sinking floating sensation reminding him of what he felt when he saw the lights except that this time he didnt see them so many now theyre like a rainbow rippling across the ground tori said her voice strange theyre moving toward the observation area im as open as i can possibly be why cant i see them as page descended farther toward the darkness all at once he did see the lights it was as if a veil had dissolved but the colors werent rippling the way tori had described they writhed in anger somethings wrong page shoved in the throttle and raised the nose a yellow filament shot up like a flare from a solar storm it lengthened until it snapped free condensing into a twisting mass that sped higher climbing page banked to the right the light kept coming he banked to the left the light did the same transparent iridescent pulsing it suddenly filled the cockpit page could no longer hear the planes engine instead he heard a rushing wind shades of yellow swirled around him images flickered he saw an aquarium filled with wavering plants and a model of a shipwreck but the plants were actually cuttlefish their tentacles resembling ferns and parts of the shipwreck were more cuttlefish that had cleverly camouflaged themselves to match their surroundings and now his father was pointing toward more and more cuttlefish and his mother who would die from breast cancer within the year was smiling because her husband and son were getting along for a change and page heard a voice within the rushing air it was his father sometimes we need to learn to see in a new way the engine stopped the yellow vanished without warning page found himself in darkness his night vision blunted by the residual image of the light he strained his eyes desperate to see out through the canopy with relief he found that the difference between the glow of the stars and moon above him and the darkness below him was enough for him at least to identify the horizon the ground straight ahead seemed darker than the areas around it lumpy page frantically realized that trying to escape the pursuing light hed become disoriented and turned the aircraft toward the bad lands the silence was dismaying normally his headphones muffled the sound of the engine reducing it to a drone but now he heard nothing the instrument panel was dark the radio was dead his father had told him repeatedly what to do in case of an engine failure the first thing was to put the aircraft into a glide at a speed of sixtyfive knots the cessna would lose a thousand feet for every nine thousand feet that it glided in theory this provided enough time to choose a location for an emergency touchdownideally a field or even a road during the day the options would be visible but in the dark it wasnt possible to know if a stretch of blackness was grass or rocks or a chasm at least the moon and the stars made the dark lumps of the bad lands look different from the flatness around them page kept the cessna gliding at what he could only estimate was sixtyfive knots with the airspeed indicator not visible he needed to rely on the feel of the aircraft on thousands of hours of judging how it handled at various speeds they continued to drop tori make sure your seat belts tight just before we touch down open your door the impact of landing might twist the fuselage and wedge the door shut he decided not to add and trap you inside to minimize the possibility of a fire page twisted the fuel selector dial to the off position sealing the fuel lines the closer they got to the ground the more his eyes worked sufficiently for him to distinguish the lumps of the badlands tori saw them too will we clear them she shouted thats the plan a damned good one the cessna glided lower time stretched a minute felt like forever my skin feels burned tori said page frowned touching his cheek so does mine i saw my father she said what when the light swirled around us i saw my father i was a little girl he was dragging me to the car i hit him trying to get away so i could look at the lights i saw my father too the dark ground sped closer i love you tori said i love you the boulders loomed brace yourself skimming over the badlands page thought he felt a wheel strike something at once the uneven darkness was gone replaced by what seemed to be grassland but anything could be under the cessna rocks that would snap the wheels and flip the aircraft or a fence that could do the same thing they were over the old military airbase page realized floating he tried to hold off landing as long as possible not only because that made for a theoretically softer impact but because as long as they were still in the air they remained alive he couldnt help thinking about the unexploded bombs below him blood dripped from halloways nostrils he stopped dancing long enough to wipe the back of his right hand across his mouth seeing the red liquid on his knuckles he felt troubled but only for a moment that blood didnt matter anymore than the blood trickling from his ears did the woman in his arms mattered the glass of vodka and orange juice always fullthat mattered most of all the music mattered halloway remembered his youthful dreams of becoming a rock star of having the world at his feet of being able to give orders and do anything he wanted hed practiced with his guitar until his fingers had calluses hed written song after song hed followed rock bands from city to city doing his best to be indispensable buying drugs for them getting girls for them trying to persuade them to listen to his songs and maybe record them and maybe even let him sing in the background because good buddy earl deserved repayment for all the favors hed done pretty soon hed be the guy people followed and got girls and drugs for but one city became another and another just as one band became another and another and one day halloway realized that nobody was ever going to record his songs just as they damned sure werent going to let him sing what was he some kind of moron that he didnt grasp that they were laughing at him and using him he went back to providence worked as a busboy in a restaurant got his girlfriend pregnant and joined the army the next thing he knew he was killing people instead of singing to them the sadness of his life spilled over him as he danced to the heart breaking music his eyes blurred with tears when he used his right hand to wipe them he managed to see that there was a lot more blood on his knuckles than thered been a minute ago frowning he used his left hand to wipe his eyes seeing red liquid on those knuckles he realized that blood was streaming from his tear ducts as well as his ears and his nose but that didnt matter eitherbecause then it occurred to him that his eyes were blurred for another reason he smelled something other than the cinnamon hair of the woman coughing he looked toward the hallway beyond the open door but he couldnt actually see the hallway a haze filled it lockhart piled more dead grass and tumbleweeds on the fire hed built over the aircirculation pipes the area around him blazed from spot lights that had been activated at sunset casting a grotesque glare over the huge dishes the lights were so powerful that he felt their heat or maybe it was the heat from the fire which rose about five feet into the air now after shooting every surveillance camera lockhart could find hed searched the area for another way to get into the complex damn it the place is airtight hed thought immediately hed realized that of course the facility couldnt possibly be airtight there had to be pipes to pump the air in and out otherwise people inside would suffocate in the end lockhart discovered three sets of them hidden among the dishes he didnt have matches muzzle flashes from his m had done just fine however first hed piled dead grass and tumbleweeds over the pipes then shooting into them hed had no trouble starting fires the trick was to keep hurrying from one fire to another constantly adding more brush it quickly became obvious which pipes were which smoke was sucked into one and blown upward from another even though the night air was pleasantly cool the effort soaked his shirt with sweat but hed never felt more satisfied by exertion thinking of the corpses in the truck and the threat the bastard in side was to the mission he inwardly chanted come on baby burn he imagined the crazy prick trying to breathe through a wet towel while he coughed his guts out sooner or later the outside door would open lockhart had a distant view of it as he rushed from fire to fire focusing exclusively on the intake vents throwing on more dead brush lumber left over from a construction project made the flames dance higher he kept looking at the door the moment halloway showed himself lockhart would teach him why it was a bad idea to ruin things for the colonel the fires roared but lockhart now heard a louder sound staring toward the west he saw the lights of a swiftly approaching black hawk helicopter finally he thought the colonel said the equipment would arrive that would get me through that door he grabbed his m and ran the landing pad had been destroyed by the wreckage of the exploding chopper he stood under a flood light and waved both arms to get the pilots attention then motioned toward the area just beyond the open gates soon the black hawk settled onto the lane its nose pointed through the gates toward the steel door of the concreteblock shed what took that chopper down the pilot shouted as the black hawks rotors whistled to a stop his face tightened as lockhart explained a specialops team leaped from the side hatch assault rifles in hand youre telling me that truck has corpses piled in the back the pi lot demanded seeing three coyotes leap from the truck things dangling from their mouths he shook his head in disgust the colonel said youd bring equipment we could use to get through that door lockhart said what have you got claymores detonator cord for this guy ive got something better a minute later the chopper lifted off hovered a hundred feet above the lane and fired a rocket from a safe distance lockhart watched with joy hed wanted something to get him through the door but this was so much better with a satisfying roar the rocket blew the whole damned concrete shed into pieces brent stood on the motor home describing the chaos of the crowd below him mindful of what had happened the night before hed al most decided to do his commentary from the ground or from some thing modestly higher but how the hell would that look im supposed to be the toughest re porter in the business and i do my spot on a picnic table even so every time the crowd jostled the motor home and forced him to correct his balance he remembered what it had felt like to plummet to the ground no camera operator had enough of anitas determination to be willing to get on the roof with him the producer had finally put a remote camera up there it and the handheld cameras among the crowd as well as the nose camera on the chopper would provide ample coverage but there wasnt any question where the viewers attention would bewith the guy risking his life on the mo tor homes roof while all the other television reporters looked like wimps doing their spots from the ground when the floodlights went out brent made a dramatic moment of it did somebody sabotage the lights he asked before realizing that his own lights had gone out alsonot to mention the lights on the cameras the cars and the choppers jesus dont tell me im off the air blinded by the sudden darkness he groped toward the ladder at the side of the motor home people banged against the vehicle shouting in panic he wavered reached the ladder started down and froze as helicopters plummeted to the ground bursting into flames shrapnel flying past him brent hugged the ladder and waited for the shock waves to subside his eyes were level with the motor homes roof he looked directly over the concrete barrier toward the field beyond the viewing area a glow approached at first brent thought it was the residual image that the broadcast lights had imprinted on his eyes but then he realized that what he saw stretched a hundred yards from right to left the glow got bigger and closer so strong that it dispelled the darkness a tidal wave of colors rushing angrily across the grassland toward him maybe the microphone is still working he spoke frantically into it tonight this reporter is seeing the most powerful manifestation yet of the rostov lights stretching across my field of vision and approaching the crowd that has gathered here the glow became harsh lightning appears to be flashing inside it the effect on the spectators is tremendous people in the crowd wept wailed and prayed but the sounds they made werent loud enough to shut out the growing hum of the lights speeding toward them the airs getting hotter brent shouted grass is catching fire wait a minute somethings racing from the lights the microphones almost too hot to hold my face is he screamed when the black hawk blew the concrete shed apart lockhart and the assault team whistled in approval a hole gaped pointing the way downward now lets toast the son of a bitch lockhart said without warning all the floodlights went off plunging the area into darkness tensing he told himself it was only because of the damage the explosion had inflicted but before the chopper could land its lights went off also so did its engine abruptly losing altitude it walloped fifty feet onto the ground rotors whistling skids snapping the only illumination was from the fires no im wrong lockhart thought to the southeast where the abandoned military base was located a glow attracted his attention even with his eyes straining to adjust to the darkness it was impossible to ignore what the hell is that a member of the specialops team shouted i dont know but its getting brighter and its coming this way hit the ground for an instant lockhart thought it was a missile streaking toward them but as he landed on his chest he realized it was a beam of light the light was composed of spinning colorsred green yellow blue it shot from the horizon hissed across the ground and radiated heat as it passed over him he smelled smoke from his hair and swatted out embers throwing sparks the light struck a satellite dish that was tilted sideways in the direction of the airbase at once the light was redirected so that it rocketed upward from a dish pointed toward the sky it reminded lockhart of world war ii movies in which powerful spotlights searched the sky for enemy bombers making a night raid though it was only one beam of light the multicolored radiance hurt his eyes it soared higher stretching toward heaven until it reached something up there and threw off sparks before it suddenly blazed on a downward angle streaking toward something on the ground far away to the northwest it left a tube of pulsing light that continued to crackle over the ground and pointed upward from the dishes im on fire somebody yelled his teammates hurried to swat at the mans flaming clothes lockhart held his hands over his ears the beam of light hissed and crackled but there was another soundstatic that might have been a hum that might have been highpitched music threatening to split his eardrums july just before dawn the first atomic bomb was detonated outside alamogordo in remote southern new mexico as the blinding mushroomshaped fireball rose thirtyeight thousand feet into the air and burned ten thousand times more fiercely than the exterior of the sun the projects director robert oppenheimer recited a passage from the bhagavad gita in which god reveals his true awesome terrifying form to a disciple if the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky that would be like the splendor of the mighty one oppenheimer quoted now i am become death destroyer of worlds at the same time all telephone and radio messages ceased to be acknowledged by or sent from the military airbase outside rostov texas two hundred and fifty miles southeast of alamogordo of particular concern was the status of the facility beneath the airbase where research on an alternative weapon of mass destruction had been in progress since after six hours of attempts to reestablish communication the army sent a p warhawk fighter plane on a reconnaissance mission from fort bliss it arrived at in the afternoon flying over the airfield the pilot reported no activity whatsoever i see open hangars trucks and aircraft at the side of the runway a bs at the end of the runway looking as if its about to take off but the propellers arent moving in fact nothings moving i dont see any people ordered to land and investigate the pilot banked into a final approach at two hundred feet he finally did see something moving a man in uniform staggering down the runways centerline the pilot performed an emergency goaround and watched the man in uniform continue staggering until he collapsed at the end of the runway after landing the pilot did a quick scan of the area but still didnt see any people among the motionless trucks and aircraft he rushed to the man hed seen collapse the man was semiconscious moaning his uniform had a colonels insignia and was covered with blood his face was burned identification in a pocket revealed that his name was edward raleigh the pilot ran to a truck hoping to use it to drive colonel raleigh out of the sun but the truck refused to start every other vehicle also refused to start the best he could do was give the colonel elementary first aid and struggle to carry him into a hangar there the pilot found the corpses of numerous military personnel all of whom were covered with blood from their ears noses tear ducts mouths and other orifices some faces had hemorrhaged so badly that their skin had disintegrated the corpses were in positions that suggested a desperate effort to take cover huddling against walls or aircraft or equipment at least twelve soldiers seemed to have shot one another moans led the pilot to a few survivors all of whom were bleeding semiconscious and delirious when the pilot radioed his report he was told to stand by ten minutes later an authoritative voice told him stay where you are try to help colonel raleigh do not go anywhere else on the base two cs are being dispatched with a medical team after they arrive return to fort bliss and report immediately for debriefing with that exception do not discuss what youve seen with anyone i repeatdo not go anywhere else on the base while the first c did in fact carry medical personnel the second brought a security team whose purpose was to investigate the integrity of the underground facility a similar scene of devastation awaited them most of the men dead from burns and hemorrhages a few survivors moaning in pain again some victims seemed to have shot one another blood covered the walls within three days the airbase was shut down the official explanation for the deaths was that a massive fuel leak had caused a devastating fire the planes and other equipment were removed to various other bases the entrance to the underground facility was sealed signs warned trespassers about unexploded bombs lockhart and the specialops team hurried away from the beam of light clutching their ms they reached the hole the rocket had made when it blasted the concrete shed stairs led downward where a glow revealed smoke we came with teargas capability the specialops leader told him they pulled gas masks from their equipment backpacks motioning for him to stay back they hurried down the stairs lockhart crouched to protect himself from the heat that the beam of light gave off i see a trip wire a voice yelled step over it stupid bastard should have hidden it better lockhart heard boots clattering farther down the metal stairs without warning he was thrown back by the force of an explosion below another trip wire he realized landing hard on rubble he groaned from the pain screams at the bottom of the stairs dwindled until the only sound was the hisscracklehum from the beam of light and the unearthly music which now had an eerie throbbing quality he had believed that it came from the beam of light but now as he squirmed shakily to his feet it was obvious that the music echoed from the bottom of the stairs he picked up his m moved to the gaping hole and looked cautiously down the glow beyond the smoke showed him that the stairs were now a tangle of twisted metal and bodies outraged lockhart slung his assault carbine over his shoulder the right banister dangled from where its metal was anchored in concrete it wobbled when he put his weight on it holding his breath sweating he climbed down the railing hand over hand at the bottom he tried not to cough from the bitter smoke after surveying the mangled bodies he had no doubt that there was nothing he could do to help he took a gas mask from a dead man and put it on it made him feel smothered but at least it stifled his need to cough the smoke drifted past its lenses the music continued pulsing some of the corpses had grenades lockhart took a few then un slung his m and inched forward ready to shoot at any movement the glow from the walls intensified he inched along a hallway reached an open door on the right and threw a grenade into it quickly ducking back amid the glare of the explosion he heard glass and metal blowing apart he continued through the swirling smoke and reached an open door on the leftthe source of the music pulling a pin from another grenade he was about to free the arming lever when a weak voice came from inside dont im sick all i want to do is listen to the music let me die listening to the music youre halloway he replied without moving into the doorway used to be used to be that doesnt make sense do you like vodka and orange juice youre still not making sense you dont taste vodka and orange juice all i taste is smoke the first time i got drunk it was on vodka and orange juice the weak voice said its owner having trouble breathing well thisll be your last lockhart replied angrily please just let me listen to the music a little longer its all i have the voice sucked air i cant even dance any longer i dont know what the hell youre talking about but i guarantee your dancing days are over lockhart continued to hold the grenade his fingers over the arming lever you shouldnt have messed with the colonels project the colonels a prick lockhart hesitated youre right about that he was suddenly aware that the floor felt unsteady did you ever want to be a rock star holloway managed to ask lockhart had once heard a man breathing through a hole in his throat that same liquid wheezing sound was what he now heard rock star wasnt high on my list what did you want to be never thought about it unbidden lockhart remembered the harleydavidson hed left a couple of miles away as he prepared to throw the grenade he frowned feeling the walls tremble i didnt know it was possible to bleed from so many places at once halloway murmured his voice sounding more gurgly im pretty much dead already just let me go listening to the music amid the smoke the roof vibrated a chunk of concrete dropping from it lockhart had the sense that everything was somehow connected to the music he imagined riding the harley the floor shifted enough that he had trouble keeping his balance yeah lockhart said colonel raleighs a prick what you did was it worth it hell yes halloway coughed up something thick hells where youre going i doubt theres music though lockhart threw the grenade into the room and stepped back put ting his hands over his ears the blast shook him he heard flying debris clatter from the room what he didnt hear any longer was the music the corridor kept trembling as more chunks fell from the walls and the ceiling he turned and hurried as quickly as he could through the smoke hand over hand he climbed the wobbling metal banister fearful that it would snap at the top he heard the cracklehisshum of the beam of light and emerged into its hovering glare when he threw away the gas mask he noticed that the air had the odor of an electrical fire the earth vibrated he ran through the three open gates charging along the lane all he could think of was the motorcycle and how hed love to ride it forever he stretched his legs farther racing faster when he was about a mile from the observatory he felt the heat of an explosion behind him the shock wave made him stagger he looked over his shoulder and saw the observatory erupting the dishes blew apart the most dramatic detonation took place in the sky like the hugest skyrocket hed ever seen but it seemed much farther away than a simple rocket could go the only explanation he could think of was that a satellite was exploding raleigh felt a vibration does the floor seem unsteady he asked the men in front of the electronic instruments the earplugs made his voice sound distant everythings starting to tremble a man acknowledged im hearing some kind of hum push your earplugs in deeper theyre in as far as theyll go then use the noisereducing headphones raleigh and the rest of the team put them on i still hear a hum the man said faintly on a video monitor raleigh saw the flames from the crashed helicopters otherwise the area was dark people reacting in panicked confusion the green of the nightvision camera making them look grotesque another monitor revealed how out of control the german shepherd had become jaws snapping it lunged at its trainer shoot it raleigh urged the trainer did in fact reach for a pistol under his shirt but the dogs snapping jaws made him lurch back and fall the trainer fired once into the air as the animal leaped over him yanked the leash free and rushed into the night the hums getting worse someone said his voice thickly muffled the tables rattling jesus my nose is bleeding the signals too strong the shields arent working raleigh thought in alarm on a different screen a tidal wave of light streaked across the range land igniting the grass beneath it a beam shot from it rocketing to ward the old airbase it reached the hidden dish and sped through it in the direction of the observatory abruptly all the monitors went dark the shields on the cameras failing a mans eyes dripped blood raleigh backed away turn off the equipment somebody yelled no raleigh shouted continuing to step back keep everything on as long as possible my ears someone vomited blood raleigh reached the entrance to the office stepped inside closed the steel door and locked it the room had three times the electromagnetic shielding that the rest of the facility had he hurried to the monitors on his desk and watched the men outside some realized what raleigh had done and rushed to the door pounding on it the frantic movement of their lips showed raleigh that they begged to be let in a man picked up an m that had a grenade launcher attached to it and pushed the others away he fired at the door raleigh felt the concussion on the monitors he saw the smoke from the explosion and the damage the shrapnel had done to some of the team but the door was intact screaming silently the man fired another grenade again with no effect on the door but the pain that the explosion and the shrapnel inflicted on the rest of the team made someone pick up his carbine and shoot the man who held the grenade launcher the man with the carbine then shot three other members of the team proving that the force associated with the lights did indeed provoke irrational violence testing that theory was why raleigh had made firearms easily available to them a moment later the man dropped the carbine and pressed his hands over his skull his face contorting in agony the monitors on raleighs desk went dark the shields on the cam eras failing raleigh sank to the chair behind his desk stunned he tried to tell himself that hed truly never believed he would actually need to take refuge here the shielding on the rest of the facility was so massive that hed been confident it would hold but thered been only one way to test its limits he looked at his watch it was a long time until sunrise but hey no big deal ive got food and water to get through the night it shouldnt be a problem to wait until after dawn before i leave the overhead light dimmed the generator failing stay calm if the generator fails thats no big deal either ill just put my head on the desk and do whats normal at night sleep the timell speed by those poor bastards out there the lights went out raleigh found himself immersed in the deepest darkness hed ever experienced im safe thats what matters in the morning ill have all the light i want sleep when raleigh put his head on the desk and closed his eyes he saw imaginary speckles that seemed to be on the backs of his eyelidsa trick of the brain he opened his eyelids and the darkness seemed thicker a slight ringing in his ears made him uneasy until he decided that the ringing was normal when ambient sound was blocked its there all the time normally other sounds mask it even so could i be hearing the lights no he couldnt allow himself to panic think of something else like what but the answer came automatically my grandfather edward raleigh never recovered from whatever had happened to him at the rostov airbase on july the officers who wrote the army intelligence reports felt relieved a man in a state of permanent catatonia wasnt likely to tell anyone about a weapon of mass destruction that might be more powerful than the atomic bomb with the awesome success of oppenheimers project the president and the military decided there wasnt any point in trying to develop a backup especially when its elements were so little understood and so destructively unpredictable and unreliable the lights didnt reappear for two months and then only dimly japans unconditional surrender reinforced the decision one super weapon was sufficient to control the worlds destiny but then the soviets developed their own atomic bomb and as the nuclear race intensified the research done at rostov was so well buried that it was forgotten edward raleigh spent the next twentyfive years in an army mental hospital visited every day by his wife whom hed married while he was stationed at the presidio in san francisco in their son was named robert a devout roman catholic edwards wife refused to remarry to do that she would need to divorce her husband and she believed that a divorce would damn her soul in the mounting expenses of the vietnam war forced the us military to cut back on fulltime medical care for personnel whose treatment went as far back as the two world wars edwards wife moved him from the hospital to her apartment where her life gained greater purpose as she devoted herself to taking care of him by then her son was twentynine and himself a father with a son named warren growing up warren visited his grandfather and was by turns horrified and fascinated by the bearded old man who sat unmoving in a rocking chair in the living room always wearing pajamas and a housecoat always watching televisionalthough if his grandfather was aware of anything he watched no one could tell warren was thirteen when a stroke killed his grandmother at the funeral everyone said she had been a saint he never forgot how in tensely his parents talked about what to do with the old man as they called him we dont have room his mother insisted while his father a war rant officer in the army argued that they didnt have the money to put the old man in a facility in the end grandfather came to live in their small unit at fort bragg and warren was given the responsibility of taking care of him after school while his mother went to her parttime job at the bases px warren didnt mind his friends were allowed to come over and they werent too grossed out by the wrinkled shrunken whitehaired whitebearded old man he just sat there watching whatever television programs they decided to watch he never moved on his own but he could be made to walk if he was prompted and he could be made to chew if food were put into his mouth also he was pretty good about going to the toilet all warren needed to do was lead him into the bathroom every two hours pull down his pajama bottoms sit him down and come back five minutes later if the old man needed his rear end cleaned warren used a wet brush disgusting sure but warren discovered that he could get used to a lot of things in exchange for the new video game his father let him buy every week one day after school warren was alonewhich was what it felt like whenever he was in the living room with his grandfather playing a video game that had a lot of floating drifting balls of light his grandfather shocked the hell out of him by speaking the lights warren dropped the video game control turned toward his grand father and gaped i saw them the old man said you can talk warren asked in astonishment his grandfather didnt seem to hear him instead the old man just kept talking his voice hoarse a lot of it warren didnt understand stuff about texas an airbase lights and an underground research station rostov whatever that meant ears bleed nose tear ducts burns time sped up god help me alice that was the name of warrens grandmother his grandfather began to weep warren ran to get a kleenex and wiped his grandfathers bearded face its all right grandpa ill help you what are you trying to say warrens grandfather stopped talking then it was days before warren realized that when hed wiped his grandfathers tears he had stood between his grandfather and the balls of light in the video game his parents thought he was lying no he talked for five minutes warren insisted what about warren told them lights his father said my mother talked about the research hed been doing down in texas something about lights texas outside a nothing town called rostov his father had something to do with lights too way back in the first world war i never figured it out arent there some letters warrens mother asked letters between his father and mother i remember alice showed them to us according to her edward treasured anything to do with his father because he was just a toddler when his father disappeared she said some of the letters came from france during the first world war they mentioned something about lights yes i remember now where did we put dads stuff after a twentyminute search they found the letters in the bottom of a box in a closet they took them into the living room and clustered around the whitebearded figure in his rocking chair yep look at this warrens father said i dream about the lights i cant wait to come back and find them january twentieth wow dad what do you know about this but warrens grandfather was again catatonic the next afternoon as warren played the video game his grand father pointed toward the floating drifting lights and began to tell a story that hed kept locked within him since about a secret facility under a remote airbase in texas and a weapon of unknown power spellbound warren felt as if electricity straightened the hairs on his arms from then on he told his friends that his father had chores for him to do after school he hurried home and put on the video game as the floating drifting balls of light appeared his grandfather talked increasingly about the lights but one day when warren rushed home his mother met him out side and told him to be quiet because his grandfather was asleep in the bedroom this disappointed warren because he wanted to hear more about the lights and what had happened that terrible morning in he played a video game got bored and decided to see if his grand father was awake opening the door he found that the bed was empty a window was open he called his mother who hurried home although the two of them drove along every street on fort bragg they couldnt find him military policemen widened the search the police outside the base widened the search even farther hospitals shelters churches parks warrens grandfather wasnt at any of them how the hell can an old man disappear warrens father demanded i think i know where he went warren said maybe he figured out where alice is buried and decided to visit her warrens mother suggested no he went to rostov warren said rostov texas the airfield where he got hurt hes always talking about it i think thats where he went how could an old man get to texas im not saying he got there im just saying i bet thats where he went the police sent a missingperson bulletin to georgia alabama mississippi and louisiana all the states between north carolina where fort bragg was located and west texas three days later the rostov police chief phoned yes warrens grandfather had managed to get there hed been found at the old airfield he was dead raleigh felt the table beneath his head begin to vibrate in the darkness he straightened the room seemed warmer enough to make him sweat of course its warmer he thought the generator failed the air conditioner isnt working but if thats the case then the aircirculation pump isnt working either he realized the only oxygen i can get is in this room the darkness made him imagine that the room was smaller than it was relax take slow calm breaths theres plenty of air the ringing in raleighs ears persisted aggravated by the earplugs the noisereducing headphones pinched the sides of his head sweat trickled from under them he wiped the sweat away with his hands thirst made him wish that hed thought to put bottles of water on the table while the light was dimming when he came to his feet the darkness intensified the scrape of the chair he turned to the left ex tended his arms and shuffled across the floor pawing the empty space sooner than he expected his fingers touched the smooth metal of the filing cabinet no problem the bottles of water were in the top drawer he groped inside and tucked three of the bottles under his left arm he gripped two energy bars with his right hand and shuffled back toward the desk he bumped a sharp corner cursing he quickly set down what he carried and rubbed his throbbing hip the accumulating humidity made his nostrils moist after wiping them with a handkerchief he felt his way around the table to where his chair again made a screeching sound he took three long swallows from a bottle of water wiped moisture from his lips tore open the wrapping on an energy bar and suddenly felt queasy the water hed swallowed had an aftertaste as if there were metal in it was it starting to turn bad will it make me throw up the metallic taste became stronger sweat trickled down his face as the table continued vibrating the darkness seemed less absolute perhaps because his eyes were adjusting he could almost see the water bottles of course ive always had great eyesight the blackness developed shades of gray he definitely saw the outline of the bottles that was the good news the bad news was that the ringing in his ears was sharper and the metallic taste almost made him gag the bottles were coming into view but a haze surrounded them damned sweats getting in my eyes he wiped them with the back of a hand but the bottles remained blurred even though the gray of the room was now so pale that he could see a hint of the table and the energy bars and his hands the effect was similar to the way night fades just before dawn through blurred vision raleigh was able to distinguish the filing cabinet he saw walls and the metal door across from him every thing still hazy again he rubbed his eyes to clear them of sweat the room was now light enough that he could see colors the orange wrappers on the energy bars the blue labels on the water bottles the red on his hands red drops of blood covered the table his shirt was blotched with it in dismay he realized that the metallic taste hadnt come from the water and the moisture on his face hadnt been sweat it was blood running from his tear ducts and his nose he screamed the illumination came from the floor the walls and the ceiling raleigh lunged toward the door unlocked it and yanked it open a glare made him shield his eyes the team lay before him covered with blood those who were still alive groaned one man had the strength to aim his m at him raleigh stooped to grab the carbine with the grenade launcher but didnt need to use itthe man with the m passed out his gun clattering to the concrete floor raleigh charged over the bodies yanked open another door and raced into the chamber where the now useless suburbans were parked the glare was even brighter as he hurried toward the stair well that led to the surface if i run fast enough maybe i can go far enough i wasnt exposed as long as the rest of the team maybe i wont bleed out chest heaving he pounded up the stairs he reached the door to the outside turned the knob rammed his shoulder against it but couldnt make it budge he jabbed numbers on a pad next to the door entering the unlock sequence but the door still wouldnt budge of course raleigh thought without electricity the code pad cant work wailing uncontrollably he hurried down the steps raised the carbine and fired a grenade at the door the explosion threw him off balance when the smoke cleared he saw that the door hung askew a glare showed beyond it as blood dripped from his face he rushed up the stairs entered the ruins of the hangar and sprinted outside behind him a massive light intensified but straight ahead lay the darkness of the road keep running he managed only three long frenzied strides before something bounded from the darkness and struck his chest knocking him onto his back jaws snapped at his neck the german shepherd its face was bloody in a frenzy the dog drove its teeth toward raleighs neck he grabbed its throat trying to push it away it clawed and writhed he couldnt keep hold of its bloodslicked fur about to tear into his throat it suddenly stopped and stared be yond his face the blood on its muzzle reflected churning lights with a yelp it spun and raced into the darkness raleigh struggled to his feet and staggered forward the impact of falling had knocked his headphones off the flow of blood had loosened his earplugs without their protection he heard a hisscrackle hum behind him and something else the motor of an airplane of all the stories his grandfather had told him the one that haunted him the most was about how raleighs greatgrandfather had flown a world war i biplane toward the dark horizon in an effort to learn the origin of the lights as a boy raleigh had imagined that biplane going farther and farther away getting smaller receding into the distance becoming only a speck vanishing my greatgrandfather turning he was nearly blinded by a wave of lights speeding toward him in the distance grassland was ablaze the flames adding to the glare the smoke reflecting it he gaped toward the twisting colors the dominant hue of which was orange and reminded him of the sun something moved inside them a biplane swooped into view its orange at first indistinguishable from that of the flares around it the biplane had two seats one behind the other in the rear seat a young man worked the controls he wore a uniform and goggles even at a distance it was obvious that he was handsome he had a mustache the tail of a scarf floated behind him before raleigh understood what he was doing he started along the old airstrip he knew he ought to run toward the road but ever since the age of thirteen all of his thoughts had been about the lights and their secrets when he was eighteen hed come to this airbase and searched it finding a way into the underground facility like his grandfather hed joined the army with the purpose of rising through military intelligence at last hed gained the authority he needed to track down his greatgrandfathers reports about the lights to follow clues that led him to his grandfathers reports about the lights the biplane swooped nearer without warning the engine stopped the biplane disappeared it was instantly replaced by a small singlewing aircraft a cessna the engine of which was silent its propeller fluttering uselessly raleigh saw a man and a woman through the canopy their faces were twisted with fear the plane was about to crash one moment page was trying to guide the cessna over the badlands and onto the murky grass the next swirling colors enveloped the plane if time had seemed prolonged during the gliding descent it became even more so now the cessna appeared not to be moving a beam of light shot from the colors that pulsed on the right side of the aircraft it produced so much illumination that he could see the collapsed hangars of the old airfield the beam of light streaked into one of them and angled toward the northwest in the direction of the observatory in the distance the beam surged into the sky deflected off somethinga satellite page guessedand rocketed toward the ground even farther northwest i hear an engine tori shouted it isnt ours a shadow passed through the colors on his left another plane page yelled not just another plane a biplane of a type that dated back to world war i a young man with a mustache and goggles was behind the controls in the rear seat the tail of a scarf fluttering behind him other images swirled within the colors a man herding cattle a woman on horseback riding along a dark road a handsome young manjames deaconleaning against a fence staring toward darkness a teenager on a motorcycle racing across a murky field soldiers holding their heads as if they feared their skulls would explode edward mullen shooting toward the lights then firing into a crowd tori sitting on a bench at the viewing area gazing spellbound toward the shadowy distance at once all the images vanished including the biplane its engine could no longer be heard the cessna resumed its glide the lights which were now behind it provided enough illumination for page to see the weeds and dirt on the old runway were coming in short the ground rose swiftly someones ahead of us tori yelled what theres a man staggering along the runway page saw him then wavering a man gaped at the cessna his head and clothes soaked with what had to be blood tori get your door open page yanked up the lever on his own door and pushed he saw rocks among the weeds before the runway the cessna couldnt stay in the air any longer he pulled the controls back raising the nose hoping to keep the front wheel above the rocks the left wheel struck and collapsed he felt the plane drop on that side the left wing dragged along the ground then buckled snagging it caused the fuselage to twist to the left the propeller struck earth a blade breaking off and flipping away the torque yanking the engine out of its housing dust billowed over the canopy as the fuselage kept tilting violently to the left page found that he was lying on his side the snapping and grinding of metal was matched by the crunch of the plane skidding over dirt the shock of stopping would have slammed pages chest against the controls if his seat belt and shoulder harness hadnt been tight but even so the snap of his chest against the harness made him feel as if hed been punched he had trouble breathing tori he managed to say are you all right she didnt answer tori i think im okay thank god page thought we need to get out in case theres a fire his door was wedged against the ground in pain he managed to free his seat belt and harness climb through your door with the fuselage on its side page was able to half stand and help tori unbuckle her harness he pushed at her hips helping her get through the door on the right wincing he pulled himself up squirmed through the open door crawled over the side and dropped to the ground his chest ached but the pain hardly mattered when he smelled aviation fuel run he shouted but tori didnt need encouragement she charged forward onto the old runway flanking her page ran as hard as he could ahead the man theyd seen on the runway had collapsed without hesitation they knelt beside him turning him onto his back even with all the blood page knew hed seen this man before on the previous night he and tori had driven past the abandoned airbase a man in his forties bald and sinewy with rigid shoulders and an air of authorityhed been unlocking the gate can you stand page asked we need to get you out of here the man mumbled something that sounded like greatgrandfather page and tori lifted him to his feet guiding him along the old run way the beam of light continued radiating through one of the hangars streaking toward the northwest soaring into the sky then angling down toward something on the far horizon the air was filled with a hisscracklehum that smelled like an electrical fire page felt his hair standing up struggling to get the man to the road page looked over his shoulder and was stunned by how much brighter the lights were explosions tore up ground in the distance bombs from long ago the grass fire spread toward the runway when the flames reached the cessna the fuel tanks erupted sending a fireball into the sky the hisscracklehum became unbearable as heat from the beam of light threatened to set pages clothes on fire the sky was abruptly filled with what seemed a gigantic skyrocket higher and farther away than any fireworks could reach it sent huge trails of sparks flying in every direction what the hell is that tori asked in amazement the sparks radiated high and low far and wide across the heavens blazing tendrils showed every color imaginable so massive a display that page was stopped in his tracks awestruck the sky seemed on fire at once the ray of light ceased it vanished at the same time as a blast lit the horizon off in the direction of the observatory the colors drooped in the sky the sparks fell their luster fading as the hisscracklehum went silent the only illumination came from the grass fires coughing from smoke that drifted over him page found that he was able to move again he and tori urged the man through the darkness they reached a fence lifted the man over it passed between parked cars and sank onto the road a new sound filled the night the sound of hundreds of people crying greatgrandfather the man said people stumbled past them some got into cars but the vehicles wouldnt start others called the names of loved ones pleas for help from god or somebody anybody blended with moans a crowd gathered on the road plodding along it people looking like refugees from a war zone as they made their way toward rostov sirens wailed from the direction of the town the fires showed medrano climbing onto a pickup truck everybody stay calm he yelled well take care of you helps on the way page looked at the stranger theyd set on the road his face was dark with blood hear those sirens just hang on and youll be okay page tried to assure him the man didnt respond at first page worried that he had died but then he saw that the mans eyes were open unblinking staring at something that might have been far away or else locked in his mind page reached over and gripped toris hand youre sure youre okay were alive she answered cant get much better than that the siren blared closer red and blue lights flashing in the dark anita woke periodically in the night gradually recovering from the effects of the anesthetic this time when she opened her eyes sun light drifted between slats in blinds revealing the hospital bed she lay on her left arm was in a cast the weight of which added to the deep pain in her arm the bullet did a lot of damage to the bones in your arm a voice next to her said with effort but they were able to save it anita looked to her left and found someone in the rooms other bed she recognized the voiceit was brentsbut she couldnt see his face which was covered with bandages i told you id be here when you woke up he said his voice muffled im a man of my word anita frowned what happened to you i chased that story until it caught me still groggy from the drugs shed been given anita said i dont understand i got too close to it brents voice dropped i got burned by it burned i dont think ill be going to atlanta in fact i dont think ill be coanchoring with sharon anymore either but given what the story cost us i can guarantee that you and i will get that emmy anita tried to sit up she was desperate to make sense out of what he was saying you were burned the doctors arent sure how bad the scars will be they talked about skin grafts and specialists if im lucky i might be able to do some investigative reporting as long as my face is in shadows when im on camera anita couldnt speak for a moment lo siento since im probably going to be in el paso for quite a while i guess id better start learning spanish what did you just tell me im truly sorry thank you we made a good team were still a good team anita said all the same i think youd better start looking for another partner do you like mexican food i dont know what thats got to do with anything but the truth is i tried the stuff once and hated it thats because you didnt eat in the right place you havent tasted anything till you dig into my mothers chicken enchiladas a massive electrical storm costigan leaned back behind his desk although he wore his uniform and gunbelt he still had the bandage around his head it made him look vulnerable a huge cell of dry lightning thats what the feds say happened medrano told him all kinds of government types got involved particularly the fbi and the national science foundation the nsf runs the observatory or used to the facility blew up last night from dry lightning costigan looked confused is that even possible could something like that disable the power systems in a couple of hundred vehicles not to mention several helicopters and a cessna whether or not its possible isnt the point thats the official explanation for what happened and with all the television cameras disabled last night we dont have pictures to prove otherwise what about the satellite that exploded half the southern united states saw it space debris blew it apart what looked like sparks was the wreckage burning as it entered the atmosphere the fact that it happened at the same time as the dry lightning is entirely coincidental theres no way the governmentll admit that it was experimenting with a weapon that uses electromagnetic energy church bells rang across the street announcing the start of the sunday service a weapon costigan frowned you think thats what was going on i was there and i promise you that what i saw wasnt dry lightning i can think of only one thing that stops engines and generators and everything else that depends on electricity or magnets you know anything about astronomy enough to tell the difference between it and astrology ever since i was a kid and saw my first comet ive had a telescope medrano said i subscribed to astronomy magazine for as long as i can remember black holes supernovas spiral nebulae theyre all pretty sexy but solar storms are my personal favorite i dont dare look at the sun through a telescope of course i need to rely on films taken by special cameras in observatories solar storms give off flares that look like the flicking end of a giant whip they can get as hot as a hundred million degrees they radiate the electromagnetic energy of ten million atomic bombs costigan listened intently they tend to run in elevenyear cycles medrano continued from almost no activity to spectacular eruptions at their peak the electromagnetic waves have so much strength that when they reach earth they can knock satellites out of orbit shut down power plants and turn television broadcasts into static the northern lights are caused by them what i saw last night looked like a combination of the two northern lights and solar flares solar flares an awful long way from the sun im not saying they were solar flares im just saying thats what they looked like an electromagnetic burst from somewhere on the ground would explain a lot of what happened last night but what caused it thats another way of asking what the lights are heres a theory the earths core is hotter than the surface of the sun medrano shrugged maybe there are fault lines around here that allow electro magnetic waves to find their way to the surface costigan thought about it as good an explanation as swamp gas quartz crystals radioactive gas and temperature inversions i suppose well whatevers going on i wont let this get any worse medrano said most visitors have had enough and are going home on their own but just to make sure as of tonight were blocking the road anybody who wants to drive in that direction will need to take a long detour the viewing area the portable toilets the roadside plaque the concrete barriers the parking loteverythings being removed that place will look like just another section of a field by the time were finished meanwhile the feds are cleaning up the mess at the observatory and the airbase well probably never know what went on there they wont let us in and well never officially know what happened at white sands last night either white sands costigan asked the missile range yeah its all over the news and the conspiracy theorists are having a field day some kind of ray hit a target at white sandsa mockup of a town i think we can guess where the ray came from apparently it destroyed the mockup town blew apart the monitoring station and obliterated a halfdozen other buildings five miles away not to mention taking out the electricity for the entire base including the batteries in their vehicles the ray was too visible for them to deny it happened reports are that twenty military technicians were killed civilians watching the night sky from alamogordo claim they saw a blinding light the army attributes all this to a massive explosion at a munitions depot the explosion was caused by dry lightning they said that dry lightning sure gets around costigans features were suddenly creased with exhaustion are you okay medrano asked across the street the church bells kept ringing maybe ill stroll over there later costigan said its been a while the police dispatcher knocked on the open door mr and mrs page are here to see you show them in when page and tori stepped into the doorway costigan smiled its good to see you even if you do look a little sunburned so does captain medrano tori said seems were in the land of the midnight sun medrano replied we discussed your phone call youre right that were going to need you here to fill in some of the gaps but at the moment we have plenty of other details to take care of so if you can get back here in ten days thatll be fine mrs page you mentioned that youre going to have surgery tuesday morning in san antonio will ten days give you enough time to feel strong enough to travel well see tori said we can always set up a video conference call if necessary i hope it isnt anything serious page and tori didnt reply the falcon jet took off from the airbase at fort bliss and started its fourhour flight toward glen burnie airport near fort meade maryland it was piloted by army intelligence personnel who were also affiliated with the nsa its passengers were a medical team and colonel raleigh the colonel stared straight ahead his eyes blinking occasionally but otherwise making no movement how long has he been like this someone asked because raleigh was catatonic and couldnt turn his head he wasnt able to identify the speaker apparently since twentytwo hundred hours last night someone replied that man too was out of raleighs line of sight whats wrong with him the best i can say right now is traumainduced paralysis i dont know if it has a physical cause a psychological one or both hell need to be tested considering the mess we found in that underground facility im not surprised he freaked out not a very scientific term but yeah basically thats what happened he freaked out do you think he can hear us i have no idea his ears were bleeding there might have been permanent hearing loss or else the shock of what happened might have put him in a state of psychological disassociation yeah but the thing is what did happen the cameras down there stopped working the digital recordings were all wiped all weve got are the bodies except for the men who were shot those other poor bastards bled to death before we got to them unless the colonel starts communicating we might never know incapable of movement raleigh kept staring straight ahead the hiss of the jet engines gradually changed to the drone of a propeller and a pistondriven motor the interior of the falcon dissolved giving him a backseat view of a biplane skimming above a dark field while stars glistened he wore goggles and a scarf one end of which fluttered behind him he worked the controls and drifted toward the horizon ahead colors shimmered beckoning the waiting room had plastic chairs linked together a television was bolted to an upper corner of the room tuned to the home and gar den channel at the entrance a hospital volunteer sat at a desk and wrote down the names of people who came in letting them know that coffee tea and water were available on the table behind her page sat next to toris mother after a while their tension kept them from making small talk page flipped through a twomonthold issue of time then looked at the television where a woman wearing gloves and holding a trowel gave viewers a tour of her flower garden how long do you suppose itll take margaret asked looking pale i guess it depends on what they find and how much needs to be removed my poor baby toris mother said a woman wearing a surgical gown and bonnet walked into the waiting room she scanned it saw the two of them and came over her expression was difficult to read its far too soon page thought somethings gone wrong the woman sat next to them theres been a mistake oh dear god margaret said maybe toris films and records got confused with someone elses the surgeon continued or maybe there was something wrong with the equipment when the tests were given page sat forward i dont understand what are you saying your wife doesnt have cancer what theres no trace of it page felt off balance a mistake thats the only way i can explain it her mammogram and cat scan both show a sizable mass that might have spread to the chest wall tori never told me it was that serious page thought but that mass definitely isnt there now the surgeon said on occasion tumors go into remission but they dont just vanish in a week somehow the equipment must have malfunctioned or your wife was given someone elses results were working to find out what happened my wifes going to be all right page managed to ask she should be fine and i can tell you for certain that she doesnt have breast cancer toris mother wept page had his own theory equipment hadnt malfunctioned records hadnt been mislabeled test results hadnt been misrouted back in rostov while hed been buying a fresh shirt and jeans in a clothing store hed heard a customer ask a clerk about the lights my wife has diabetes the customer had said we heard this place makes miracles happen like at lourdes if she sees the lights shell be cured at the time page had thought cured wouldnt that be nice and now it had happened tori had been cured they returned to rostov for the further questioning and to sign their statements by then costigan no longer had the bandage around his skull and his short gray hair revealed a scar along the side of his head havent seen any sign of the lights since everything happened costigan told them captain medrano and i drove harriett ward out there if anybody can be depended upon to see the lights its her she says theyre gone whats the phrase she used in remission yes tori said in remission page took her home to santa febut it didnt seem like home any longer she said she kept thinking of rostov dreaming about the lights and page was dreaming about them now too the insurance payment for the crashed cessna helped him buy a thirtyyearold replacement a year later page and tori flew back to rostov they rented a car and drove to costigans office where the police chief was coughing from what he said was a bad summer cold although page had a strong idea about the true source of this ex smokers cough were thinking about moving here page said any chance you have a job open a deputys pay isnt much but the cost of living here isnt much either and i can earn some extra cash as a mechanic at the airport costigan cleared his throat truth is there might be an opening for my job im sorry to hear it tori said looking closely at him dont be he said with a smile i learned a long time ago nothing lasts forever but im not ready to go yet so for the time being the deputys job is yours if you want it i do page said and weve got so many artists moving here from austin santa fe and sedona the real estate markets picking up costigan told tori i dont suppose itll surprise you that theres something about the colors here that attracts them i think you could earn a living id like to try she responded one thing i knowwe wont be lonely here we made some good friends you did indeed six months later page became the police chief after costigans funeral he and tori drove out to where they guessed the viewing area had been medrano had meant what hed saidonce everything was removed the place looked like just another section of a field they arrived at sunset got out of the car and watched the horizon as the darkness settled they saw the headlights from cars approaching from mexico they saw a shooting star they saw a hint of a shimmer beyond the badlands you think thats the start of the lights coming back page asked it might be tori answered harriet says they have cycles weak and strong maybe shes right but i guess i really dont need to see them even back in town i canfeel them thats enough more than enough page agreed they match what people bring to them if you need something to believe in theyll inspire you but if you built a wall around yourself you wont be able to see them if youre angry theyll make you angrier if you want to turn them into a weapon theyll use that weapon against you and make you realize just how terrifying a weapon can be plus if you hope hard enough for a miracle tori said they can make one happen the headlights of a car approached it pulled up next to their car and a man rolled down a window hey isnt this where those weird lights used to show up lights dont know anything about them page said were just admiring the stars probably a lot of bunk anyhow so we hear tori said the car drove on its taillights fading into the darkness want to head back page asked im ready if that shimmer out there is in fact the lights weve probably seen enough in the car page hesitated before turning the ignition key whats wrong tori asked just remembering what this place used to look like what i felt when i saw you on the bench staring toward the horizon i almost lost you but because of the lights that didnt happen what they are to you thats what you are to me i love you page made a point of saying that every day emotion filled him did you ever read the plaque that was at the side of the road no i figured it would be touristy like it was written by somebody in the chamber of commerce not quite page told her as near as i can recall it said welcome to the rostov lights many people have claimed to see them but no one has ever been able to explain them if youre lucky enough to experience them decide for yourself what they are well i know what they are to me page kissed her afterword specters in the dark on november i paged through the sunday edition of my local newspaper the santa fe new mexican although i dont normally read the travel section the headline for one of its articles caught my attention light up your life tiny marfa texas boasts weird natural phenomena the caption for a ghostly photograph referred to mystery lights i couldnt resist reprinted from the washington post the article described how its author zofia smardz had taken her family to marfa a small town in west texas searching for strange lights that are visible there on many nights throughout the year its difficult to tell how far away the lights are magical they bob and weave float and waver blink and glow appear and vanish as the article pointed out no one can say for sure what causes them perhaps quartz crystals absorb the heat of the day and give off static electricity when the rocks cool at night perhaps the lights are formed by radioactive gases or perhaps temperature inversions in the atmosphere refract lights from faraway vehicles whatever the explanation the lights have been in west texas for quite a while as far back as the s a rancher noticed them and assumed they came from indian campfires except that when he searched in the morning he didnt find evidence of any campfires the articles author described her visit to the areas viewing station along with her husband and two boys she stood at the side of a country road and stared toward the dark horizon pointing excitedly when the lights made their dramatic appearance on occasion how ever she saw the lights when her family didnt or else her family saw the lights when she saw nothing a similar contrast happened when other tourists joined them some people were transported by the lights while others couldnt see what all the fuss was about i finished my coffee tore out the page and went to my office where i put the article among others on a shelf of research materials ive been doing this for decades stacking items that intrigue me waiting to discover which of them calls to my subconscious it didnt take long for the marfa lights to do exactly that during many nights in the final months of just before i went to sleep a persistent image kept appearing in my imagination a woman stood at a viewing platform at the side of a road staring spellbound toward alluring lights on a dark horizon unlike the author of the marfa lights article this woman was not accompanied by her husband and children although married she was alone having stopped while driving to visit her mother she was so obsessed by the lights that nothing else mattered to her including the husband who came looking for her that was all i had and as began i didnt even have thatthe image stopped appearing in my imagination im used to ideas not being ready to reveal themselves completely so i worked on other projects creepers scavenger and the spy who came for christmas periodically though i removed the article from the stack on my office shelf rereading it i felt compelled to do increasing research until i had a thick binder crammed with notes i learned that marfa isnt the only place where the lights appear three other locationsthe hessdalen valley in norway a remote part of the mekong river in thailand and a rugged area in northeastern australiahave similar phenomena in australia theyre called the min min lights and when an australian fan got in touch with me through my website i asked if he knew anything about the lights it turned out that the fan a police officer named daniel browning had actually experienced the lights my dad robert and i were out near a town called muttaburra in central queensland doing some kangaroo shooting about years ago muttaburra was a tiny little town houses dad was a professional roo shooter we were doing some shooting at night by spotlight we were out in the middle of nowhereno houses or roads anywhere nearby we saw a light it was just suddenly there we didnt see it coming at all it just appeared and shadowed us it did not seem to get closer or move away it just stayed the same distance from us moving with us the thing wasnt on the ground or high in the air it just sort of hovered it lasted about minutes and what makes it vivid in my memory is that it shook my old man up he knew we werent remotely anywhere near homes or vehicles this thing really had him worried and then it was gone with that image drifting through my mind i came across the dvd version of one of my favorite movies giant directed by george stevens it stars james dean elizabeth taylor and rock hudson in an epic about a texas oilmans multidecade feud with a prominent cattle family to my amazement a documentary informed me that a lot of the film had been photographed in marfa the same town where the lights appear moreover a subsequent internet search revealed that james dean had been fascinated by the lights hed dragged his costars and his director to the viewing area but he turned out to be the only one who could see them these elements worked on my imagination until almost three years after that november morning when id come across the news paper article i was again visited by the image of the solitary woman who stood in the darkness at the side of a road staring at the mysterious lights but now i had another image a man flying a singleengine airplane i had recently started privatepilot lessons to this i added the giant dishes of a radio observatory there is in fact an observatory near marfa and the ruins of a military airbase from world war ii an abandoned airbase does exist outside marfa near where the lights appear i wasnt sure how all these items could be connected even so i suddenly couldnt wait to begin i made a list of all the elements i wanted to include creating my own versions of people who in actuality had seen the lights the rancher in the s the schoolteacher in the s james dean in the s and the crowd involved with the ghostlight hunt in the s yes there really was a ghostlight hunt a surprising amount of reality is in the shimmer of course its an alternate reality in the same way that marfa and rostov are alternate versions of a town in west texas marfa is supposedly named after a character in dostoyevskys crime and punishment whereas i named rostov after a character in tolstoys war and peace despite the parallels no one in the shimmer is meant to be identified with anybody in marfa although i hope that this novel makes you want to visit marfa which has come a long way since its cattletown days and is now a picturesque artists community similar to sedona arizona and santa fe in one respect however reality needed improving outside marfa the famous ranchhouse set for giant which i call birthright was indeed only a facade although it appeared to be an entire grand building if you walked behind it you found only open grassland over the years that fake front disintegrated until only its support beams re main and they wont stay upright much longer because of my fondness for giant in the shimmer i allowed the movie set to endure for more information about this novels background search the internet for marfa lights youll find over half a million sites the more you learn the more youll understand what i meant earlier when i wrote that a surprising amount of reality is in this book about the author my father was killed during world war ii shortly after i was born in my mother had difficulty raising me and at the same time holding a job so she put me in an orphanage and later in a series of boarding homes i grew up unsure of who i was desperately in need of a father figure books and movies were my escape eventually i decided to be a writer and sought help from two men who became metaphorical fathers to me stirling silliphant the head writer for the classic tv series route about two young men in a corvette who travel america in search of themselves and philip klass whose pen name is william tenn a novelist who taught at the pennsylvania state university where i went to graduate school from to the result of their influence is my novel first blood which introduced rambo the search for a father is prominent in that book as it is in later ones most notably the brotherhood of the rose a thriller about orphans and spies during this period i was a professor of american literature at the university of iowa with two professions i worked seven days a week until exhaustion forced me to make a painful choice and resign from the university in one year later my fifteenyearold son matthew died from bone cancer and thereafter my fiction tended to depict the search for a son particularly in fireflies and desperate measures to make a new start my wife and i moved to the mountains and mystical light of santa fe new mexico where my work changed yet again exploring the passionate relationships between men and women highlighting them against a background of action as in the newest burnt sienna to give his stories a realistic edge he has been trained in wilderness survival hostage negotiation executive protection antiterrorist driving assuming identities electronic surveillance and weapons a former professor of american literature at the university of iowa morrell now lives in santa fe new mexico
