a summer in a canyon a california story by kate douglas wiggin scene a camping ground in the canyon las flores people in the tents dr paul winship mine host mrs truth winship the guardian angel dicky winship a small scamp of six years bell winship the camp poetess polly oliver a sweet but saucy lass margery noble a nutbrown mayde philip noble the useful member geoffrey strong a harvard boy jack howard prince of mischief hop yet a heathen chinee pancho gutierrez a mexican manofallwork chapter i preparation and departure one to make ready and two to prepare it was nine oclock one sunny california morning and geoffrey strong stood under the liveoak trees in las flores canyon with a pot of black paint in one hand and a huge brush in the other he could have handled these implements to better purpose and with better grace had not his arms been firmly held by three laughing girls who pulled not wisely but too well he was further incommoded by the presence of a small urchin who lay on the dusty ground beneath his feet fastening an upward clutch on the legs of his trousers there were three large canvas tents directly in front of them yet no one of these seemed to be the object of dissension but rather a redwood board some three feet in length which was nailed on a tree near by camp frolic please let us name it camp frolic cried bell winship with a persuasive twitch of her cousins sleeve no no not camp frolic pleaded polly oliver pray pray let us have camp haha my heart is set upon it as you are strong be merciful quoted margery noble coaxingly take my advice and call it harmony camp at this juncture a lovely woman whose sweet face and smile made you love her at once came up the hill from the brookside what what still quarrelling children she asked laughingly let me be peacemaker ive just asked the doctor for a name and he suggests camp chaparral what do you say bell released one coattail that isnt wholly bad she said critically while the other girls clapped their hands with approval for anything that aunt truth suggested was sure to be quite right wait a minute good people cried jack howard flinging his fishingtackle under a tree and sauntering toward the scene of action suppose we have a referee a wise and noble judge call hop yet and let him decide this allimportant subject his name being sung and shouted in various keys by the assembled company hop yet appeared at the door of the brush kitchen a broad grin on his countenance a plucked fowl in his hand geoffrey took the floor now hop yet you know i got name you got name everybody got name we want name this camp you sabe miss bell she say camp frolic frolic all same heap good time here he executed a sort of wardance which was intended to express wild joy miss pauline she say camp haha big

too muchee talk mrs winship she say camp chaparral you sabe chaparral hop yet now what you say hop yet seemed to regard the question with mingled embarrassment and amusement but being a sharp and talkative chinaman gave his answer promptly me say camp chaplal heap good name plenty chaplal all lound me hang um dishcloth towl little boys stockin on chaplal all same closeline velly good miss bell she folic miss polly she ha ha allee same camp chaplal and so camp chaparral it was the redwood board flaunted the assertion before the eyes of the public which was a rather limited one to be sure in less than half an hour and the artist after painting the words in rustic letters a foot long cut branches of the stiff ungracious bushes and nailed them to the tree in confirmation and illustration of the fact he then carefully deposited the paintpot in a secret place where it might be out of sight and touch of a certain searching eye and mischievous hand well known and feared of him but before the setting sun had dropped below the line of purple mountain tops a small boy who will be known in these annals as dicky winship might have been seen sitting on the empty paintpot while from a dingy pool upon the ground he was attempting to paint a copy of the aforesaid inscription upon the side of a too patient goat who saw no harm in the operation he was alone and very very happy and now i must tell you the way in which all this began you may not realise it dear young folks but this method of telling a story is very much the fashion with grownup people and of course i am not to blame since i didnt begin it the plan is this you must first write a chapter showing all your people men women children dogs and cats in a certain place doing certain things then you must go back a year or two and explain how they all happen to be there perhaps you may have to drag your readers twentyfive years into the regions of the past and show them the first tooth of your oldest character but that doesnt matter a bit the further the better then when everybody has forgotten what came to pass in the first chapter you are ready to take it up again as if there had never been any parenthesis however i shall not introduce you to the cradles cribs or trundlebeds of my merry young campers but merely ask you to retrace your steps one week and look upon them in their homes on one of the pleasantest streets of a certain little california town stood and still stands for aught i know a pretty brown cottage with its verandahs covered with passionvine and a brilliant rosegarden in front it is picturesque enough to attract the attention of any passerby and if you had chosen to peep through the crevices in the thick vines and look in at the open window you might have thought it lovelier within than without it was a bright day and the gracious june sunshine flooded the room with yellow light three young girls perhaps fourteen or fifteen years old were seated in different parts of the large room plying industrious crochet needles and tatting shuttles three pairs of bright eyes were dancing with fun and gladness and another pair the softest and clearest of all looked out from a broad white bed in the corner tired eyes and oh so patient for the healthgiving breezes wafted in from the blue ocean and carried over mountain tops and vinecovered slopes had so far failed to bring back elsie howards strength and vigour the graceful brownhaired girl with the bright laughterloving face was bell winship she of the dancing blue eyes pink cheeks and reckless little sunbonnet was pauline otherwise polly oliver did you ever know a polly without some one of these things well my polly had them all and besides a saucy freckled nose a crown of fluffy reddishyellow hair and a shower of coaxing little pitfalls called dimples round her pretty mouth she made you think of a sunbeam a morning songbird a dancing butterfly or an impetuous little crocus just out after the first spring shower dislike her you couldnt approve of her you wouldnt always love her of course you couldnt help yourself i defy you to be sure if you prefer a quiet life and do not want to be led into exploits of all kinds invariably beginning with risk attended with danger and culminating in despair you had better not engage in an intimate friendship with miss pauline oliver but fix your affections on the quiet thoughtful but not less lovable girl who sits by the bedside stroking elsie howards thin white hand nevertheless i am obliged to state that margery noble herself earnest demure and given to reflection was pollys willing slave and victim however ive forgotten to tell you that polly was as open and frank as the daylight at once torrid and constant in her affections brave selfforgetting as well as selfwilled and that though she did have a tongue just the least bit saucy she used it valiantly in the defence of others shell come out all right said a dear oldfashioned grandfather of hers whom she had left way back in a vermont farmhouse shes got to be purged o considerable dross but shell come out pure gold i tell you pretty wise tender margery noble with her sleek brown braids her innocent questioning eyes her soft voice willing hands and shy quiet manners she will either end as the matron of an orphan asylum or as headnurse in a hospital so bell winship often used to say but then she was chiefly celebrated for talking nonsense and nobody ever paid much attention to her but if you should crave a breath of fresh air or want to believe that the spring has come just call bell winship in as she walks with her breezy step down the street her very hair seems instinct with life with its flying tendrils of bronze brightness and the riotous little curls on her brow and temples then too she has a particularly jaunty way of putting on her jacket or wearing a flower or a ribbon and as for her ringing peal of laughter it is like a chime of silver bells elsie howard the invalid friend of the girls was as dear to them as they were to each other she kept the secrets of the firm mourned over their griefs and smiled over their joys was proud of their talents and tenderly blind to their faults the little wicker rockingchair by the bedside was often made a sort of confessional at which she presided the tenderest and most sympathetic little priestess in the universe and every afternoon the piazza with its lattice of green vines served as a mimic throneroom where she was wont to hold high court surrounded by her devoted subjects here geoffrey strong used often to read to the assembled company david copperfield alice in wonderland or snatches from the magazines while jack howard lazily stretched himself under the orangetrees and braided lariats a favourite occupation with california boys about four oclock philip noble would ride up from his fathers fruit ranch some three miles out on the san marcos road and hitching his little sorrel mare chispa at the gate stay an hour before going to the postoffice this particular afternoon however was not one of elsies bright ones and there was no sign of court or invalid queen on the piazza the voices of the girls floated out from elsies bedroom while the boys too seemed to be somewhere in the vicinity for there was a constant stirring about as of lively preparation together with noise of hammering and sawing if you were only going elsie our cup of happiness would be full sighed bell not only would it be full bell but it would be running over and we should positively stand in the slop said polly no you neednt frown at me miss that expression is borrowed from no less a person than sydney smith dont think any more about me smiled elsie perhaps i can come down in the course of the summer i know it will be the happiest time in the world but i dont envy you a bit in fact im very glad youre going because youll have such a lovely budget of adventures to tell me when you come back when we come back indeed exclaimed bell why we shall write long roundrobin letters every few days and send them by the team papa says pancho will have to go over to the stage station at least once a week for letters and any provisions we may need oh wont that be delightful almost as good as being there myself and margery dear you must make them tell me every least little thing that happens you know they are such flyaways that theyll only write me when they learn to swim or shoot a wildcat or get lost in the woods i want to know all the stupid bits what you have for dinner how and where you sleep how your camp looks what you do from morning till night and how dicky behaves i can tell you that beforehand said bell dolefully jack will shoot him by mistake on thursday he will be kicked by the horses friday and bitten by tarantulas and rattlesnakes saturday he will eat poison oak on sunday get lost in the canyon monday be eaten by a bear tuesday and drowned in the pool wednesday these incidents will complete his first week and if they produce no effect on his naturally strong constitution he will treat us to another week containing just as many mishaps but no duplicates by the time this dismal prophecy was ended the other girls were in a breathless fit of laughter though all acknowledged it was likely to be fulfilled i went over the campingground last summer said margery you know it is quite near papas sheep ranch and it is certainly the most beautiful place in california the tents will be pitched at the mouth of the canyon where there is a view of the ocean and just at the back will be a lovely grove of wild oaks and sycamoretrees oh wont it be delicious sighed elsie i feel as if i could sniff the air this minute but there i wont pretend that im dying for fresh air with the breath of the sea coming in at my south window and a whiff of jasmine and honeysuckle from the piazza that would be nonsense are your trunks packed trunks exclaimed polly would you believe it our clothes are packed in gunnysacks we start in our campingdresses with ulsters for the steamer and dusters for the long drive then we each have let me see what we have a short tough ridingskirt with a jersey a bathingdress and some gingham morninggowns to wear about the camp at breakfasttime and flannel gowns for the night and two pairs of boots and a ridingcap and one hat apiece added margery but oh elsie my dear you should see dicky in his campingsuits laughed bell they are a triumph of invention on mammas part just imagine one is of some enamelled cloth that was left over from the new carriage cushions it is very shiny and elegant and the other truly is of soft tanned leather and just as pretty as it can be then he has hobnailed coppertoed boots and a hat that ties under his chin poor little man he has lost his curls too and looks rather like a convict mrs howard came in the door while bell was speaking and laughed heartily at the description of dickys curious outfit what time do you start she asked as she laid a bunch of mignonette on elsies table at eleven tomorrow morning bell answered everything is packed we are to start in the steamer and when we come to our old landing about forty miles down the coast we are to get off and take a threeseated thoroughbrace wagon and drive over to las flores canyon pancho has hired a funny little pack mule he says we shall need one in going up the mountain and that the boys can take him when they go out shooting to carry the deer home you know if i can bring elsie down as i hope we must come by land said mrs howard i thought we could take two days for the journey sleeping at the burtons ranch on the way the doctor says that if she can get strength enough to bear the ride the openair life will do her good even if she does nothing but lie in the hammock and be waited upon by six willing slaves added polly and be fed on canned corned beef and tomato stew laughed bell not a bit of it said margery hop yet is a splendid cook if he has anything to cook and well feed her on broiled titbits of baby venison goats milk wild bees honey and cunning little mourning doves roasted on a spit good gracious cried bell what angels food only i would as soon devour a pet canary as a mourning dove but to think that ive been trying to diet for a week in order to get intimate with suffering and privation polly came to stay with me one night and we slept on the floor with only a blanket under us and no pillow it was perfectly horrid polly dreamed that her grandfather ate up her grandmother and i that dicky stabbed the jersey calf with a picklefork horrors ejaculated margery thats a pleasant prospect for your future bedfellows i hope the gophers wont make you nervous gnawing and scratching in the straw i got used to them last summer but we really must go darling and she stooped to kiss elsie goodbye well i suppose you ought she answered but remember you are to start from this gate aunt truth has promised me the fun of seeing you out of sight the girls went out at a side door and joined the boys who were busily at work cleaning their guns on the broad western porch how are you coming on questioned polly oh finely answered jack who always constituted himself chief spokesman unless driven from the rostrum by some one possessed of a nimbler tongue i only hope your feminine togs are in half as good order we take no baggage to speak of said bell loftily papa has cut us down to the very last notch and says the law allows very few pounds on this trip the less the better quoth geoff cheerily then youll have to polish up your mental jewels which you consider imitation i suppose sniffed polly perish the thought cried jack but speaking of mental jewels you should see the arrangements geoff has made for polishing his he has actually stuck in six large volumes any one of which would be a remedy for sleeplessness what are you going to study miss polyonomous oliver now jack let us decide at once whether you intend to be respectful or not i dont propose to expose myself to your nonsense for two months unless you make me good promises why that wasnt disrespectful it is my newest word and it simply means having many titles im sure you have more than most people very well then ill overlook the irreverence this time and announce that i shall not take anything whatever to read but simply reflect upon what i know already that may last for the first week said bell slyly but what will you do afterward ill reflect upon what you dont know retorted polly that will easily occupy me two months fortunately at the very moment this stinging remark was made phil noble dashed up to the front gate flung his bridle over the hitchingpost and lifted his hat from a very warm brow hail chief of the commissary department cried geoffrey with mock salute have you despatched the team yes everything is all right said phil breathlessly delivering himself of his information in spasmodic bursts of words such a lot of work it was heres the list pancho will dump them on the ground and let us settle them when we get there such a load you should have seen it hardly room for him to sit up in front with the chinaman just hear this and he drew a large document from what polly called a backstairs pocket forty cans corned beef four guns three dutch cheeses pickles fishingtackle flour bacon three bushels onions crate of dishes jacks banjo potatoes short history of the english people cooking utensils three hair pillows box of gingersnaps four hammocks coffee cartridges sugar macaulays essays ponds extract sixteen hams bells guitar popcorn molasses salt st jacobs oil conquest of mexico sack of almonds fleapowder and smoked herring whew i packed them all myself in precisely that order questioned polly in precisely that order miss oliver returned phil urbanely any one who feels that said packing might be improved upon has only to mount the fleet arabian yonder the animal alluded to seized this moment to stand on three legs hang his head and look dejected and giving him the rein speed oer the trackless plain which leads to san miguel oertake the team and repack the contents according to her own satisfaction no butter nor eggs nor fresh vegetables asked margery we shall starve not at all quoth jack polly will gracefully dispose a horseblanket about her shoulders to shield her from the chill dews of the early morn mount the pack mule exactly at cockcrow everyday and ride to a neighbouring ranch where there are tons of the aforesaid articles awaiting our consumption can you see me doing it girls does it seem entirely natural asked polly with great gravity now hear my report as chairman of the committee of arrangements said geoffrey strong seating himself with dignity on a barrel of nails the tents ropes toolboxes bedsacks blankets furniture etc all went down on mondays steamer and i have a telegram from larrys landing saying that they arrived in good order and that a mexican gentleman who owns a mammoth woodcart will take them up tomorrow when we go ourselves the procession will move at one pm wind and weather permitting in the following order chief noble on his gallant broncho commander strong on his ditto ditto main conveyance or triumphal chariot driven by aidedecamp john howard and carrying dr and mrs winship our most worshipful and benignant host and hostess master dick winship the heirapparent three other young persons not worth mentioning and four cans of best leaf lard which i omitted to put with the other provisions woodcart containing baggage driven by senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega from dead wood gulch one small tan terrier oh geoff geoff pray do stop its too much cried the girls in a fit of laughter hurrah shouted jack tossing his hat into a tall eucalyptustree in his excitement tent life for ever goodbye ye pomps and vanities chanted bell kissing her hand in imaginary farewell verily the noisy city shall know us no more for we depart for the green forests and the city will not be as noisy when you depart murmured jack with an impudence that luckily passed unnoticed if elsie could only come too sighed polly wednesday morning dawned as bright and beautiful as all mornings are wont to dawn in southern california a light mist hung over the old adobe mission church through which with its snowwhite towers and cold clearcut lines it rose like a frozen fairy castle bell opened her sleepy eyes with the very earliest birds and running to the little oval window framed with whiterose vines looked out at the new day just creeping up into the world oh dear and beautiful home of mine how charming how charming you are i wonder if you are not really paradise she said dreamily and the marvel is that the rising sun did not stop a moment in sheer surprise at the sight of this radiant morning vision for the oval window opening to the east was a pretty frame with its outline marked by the dewy rosevine covered with hundreds of pure halfopened buds and swaying tendrils and she stood there in it a fair image of the morning in her innocent white gown her luminous eyes still mirrored the shadowy visions of dreamland mingled with dancing lights of hope and joyful anticipation while on her fresh cheeks which had not yet lost the roundness of childhood there glowed as in the eastern skies the faint pink blush of the morning the town is yet asleep and in truth it is never apt to be fairly wide awake the air is soft and balmy the lovely pacific a quivering sparkling sheet of blue and grey and green flecked with white foam stretches far out until it is lost in the rosy sky and the mountains all purple and pink and faint crimson and grey stand like sentinels along the shore the scent of the roses violets and mignonette mingled with the cloying fragrance of the datura is heavy in the still air the bending willowy peppertrees show myriad bunches of yellow blossoms crimson seedberries and fresh green leaves whose surface not rainwashed for months is as full of colour as ever the palmtrees rise without a branch tall slender and graceful from the warmly generous earth and spread at last as if tired of their straightness into beautiful crowns of fans which sway toward each other with every breath of air innumerable butterflies and hummingbirds in the hot dazzling sunshine of noonday will be hovering over the beds of sweet purple heliotrope and finding their way into the hearts of the passionflowers but as yet not the faintest whirr of wings can be heard looking eastward or westward you see either brown foothills or a little later on emerald slopes whose vines hang heavy with the halfripened grapes and hark a silvery note strikes on the dewy stillness it is the mission bell ringing for morning mass and if you look yonder you may see the franciscan friars going to prayers with their loose grey gowns their girdle of rope their sandaled feet and their jingling rosaries and perhaps a spanish senorita with her trailing dress and black shawl loosely thrown over her head from out the folds of which her two dark eyes burn like gleaming fires a solitary mexican gallops by with gayly decorated saddle and heavily laden saddlebags hanging from it perhaps he is taking home provisions to his wife and darkeyed babies who live up in a little dimple of the mountain side almost hidden from sight by the olivetrees and then a patient hardy little mustang lopes along the street bearing on his back three laughing boys one behind the other on a morning ride into town from the mesa the mist had floated away from the old mission now the sun has climbed a little higher and bell has come away from the window in a gentle mood oh polly i dont see how anybody can be wicked in such a beautiful beautiful world humph said polly dipping her curly head deep into the waterbowl and coming up looking like a little drowned kitten when you want to be hateful you dont stop to think whether youre looking at a cactus or a rosebush do you very true sighed bell quite silenced by this practical illustration now ill try the effect of the landscape on my temper by dressing dicky while he dances about the room and plays with his tan terrier but it happened that dicky was on his very best behaviour and stood as still as a signpost while being dressed it is true he ate a couple of matches and tumbled downstairs twice before breakfast so that after that hurried meal bell tied him to one of the verandah posts that he might not commit any act vicious enough to keep them at home as he had a huge pocket full of apricots he was in perfect goodhumour not taking his confinement at all to heart inasmuch as it commanded a full view of the scene of action his amiability was further increased moreover by the possession of a bright new policemans whistle which was carefully tied to his buttonhole by a neat little silk cord and which his fond parents intended that he should blow if he chanced to fall into danger during his rambles about the camp we might as well state here however that this precaution proved fruitless for he blew it at all times and seasons and everybody became so hardened to its melodious shriek that they paid no attention to it whatever history or fable thus again repeating itself mr and mrs noble had driven margery and phil into town from the fruit ranch and were waiting to see the party off mrs oliver was to live in the winship house during the absence of the family and was aiding them to do those numberless little things that are always found undone at the last moment she had given her impetuous daughter a dozen fond embraces smothering in each a gentle warning and stood now with mrs winship at the gate watching the three girls who had gone on to bid elsie goodbye i hope pauline wont give you any trouble she said she is so apt to be too impulsive and thoughtless i shall enjoy her said sweet aunt truth with that bright cordial smile of hers that was like a blessing she has a very loving heart and is easily led how pretty the girls look and how different they are polly is like a thistledown or a firefly margery like one of our home mayflowers and i cant help thinking my bell like a sunbeam the girls did look very pretty for their mothers had fashioned their campingdresses with much care and taste taking great pains to make them picturesque and appropriate to their summer life under the greenwood tree over a plain full skirt of heavy crimson serge bell wore a hunting jacket and drapery of dark leafgreen like a bit of forest against a sunset her hair which fell in a waving mass of burnished brightness to her waist was caught by a silver arrow and crowned by a wide soft hat of crimson felt encircled with a birds breast margery wore a soft grey flannel the colour of a doves throat adorned with rows upon rows of silver braid and sparkling silver buttons while her big grey hat had nothing but a silver cord and tassel tied round it in spanish fashion polly was all in sailor blue with a distractingly natty little doublebreasted coat and great white rolling collar her hat swung in her hand as usual showing her boyish head of sunny auburn curls and she carried on a neat chatelaine a silver cup and little claspknife as was the custom in the party its very difficult polly often exclaimed to get a dress that will tone down your hair and a hat that will tone up your nose when the first is red and the last a snub my nose is the root of all evil it makes people think im saucy before i say a word and as for my hair they think i must be peppery no matter if i were really as meek as moses now theres margery the dear darling mouse people look at her two sleek braids every hair doing just what it ought to do and lying straight and smooth and ask who is that sweet girl theres something wrong somewhere i ought not to suffer because of one small simple turnedup nose and a head of hair which reveals the glowing tints of autumn as jack gracefully says here they come shouted jack from the group on the howards piazza christopher columbus what gorgeousness the flamingo the dove and the bluejay goodmorning young ladies may we be allowed to travel in the same steamer with your highnesses you neednt be troubled laughed bell we shall not disclose these glories until we reach the camp but you are dressed as usual whats the matter why the fact is answered geoffrey our courage failed us at the last moment we donned our uniforms and looked like brigands highway robbers cowboys firemen anything but modest young men and as it was too warm for ulsters we took refuge in civilised raiment for today when we arrive you shall behold our dashing sombreros fixed up with peacock feathers and our refulgent shirts which are of the most original style and decoration aboriginal in fact said jack we have broad belts of alligator skin pouches pistols bowieknives and tancoloured shoes but we dislike to flaunt them before the eyes of a city public here they are cried geoffrey from the gate uncle and aunt and dicky and good gracious is he really going to take that wretched tan terrier wont go without him said bell briefly there are cases where it is better to submit than to fight so the last goodbyes were said and elsie bore up bravely better indeed than the others who shed many a furtive tear at leaving her make haste and get well darling whispered the girls lovingly pray pray dear mrs howard bring her down to us as soon as possible well take such good care of her teased bell with one last squeeze and strong signs of a shower in both eyes come girls and boys said kind dr paul the steamer has blown her first whistle and we must be off oh how clear and beautiful a day it was and how charmingly gracious dame ocean looked in her white caps and blue ruffles even the combination steamboat smell of dinner oil and close air was obliterated by the keen seabreeze the good ship orizaba ploughed her way through the sparkling sunlit waves traversing quickly the distance which lay between the young people and their destination they watched the long white furrow that stretched in her wake the cloud of black smoke which floated like a dark shadow above the laughing crests of the waves and the flocks of seagulls sailing overhead with wild shrill screams ever and anon swooping down for some bit of food flung from the ship and then floating for miles on the waves how they sung life on the ocean wave bounding billow and rocked in the cradle of the deep how jack chanted i wish i were a fish with a great long tail a tiny little tittlebat a wiggle or a whale in the middle of the great blue sea oh my oh how i long to be there exclaimed philip to throw aside all the formal customs of a wicked world i abhor and live a free life under the blue sky why philip noble i never saw you inside of a house in my life cried polly oh yes youre mistaken ive been obliged to eat most of my meals in the house and sleep there but i dont approve of it and its a trial to be borne with meekness only when theres no remedy for it besides said jack even when we are outofdoors we are shelling the reluctant almond poisoning the voracious gopher pruning grapevines and sich now i am only going to shoot to eat and eat to shoot hope youve improved since last year or youll have a low diet murmured phil in an undertone the man of genius must expect to be the butt of ridicule sighed jack meekly but youll not repine although your heartstrings break will you said polly sympathisingly especially in the presence of several witnesses who have seen you handle a gun how glad i am that im too nearsighted to shoot said geoffrey taking off the eyeglasses that made him look so wise and dignified i shall lounge under the trees read macaulay and order the meals i shall need an assistant about the camp said aunt truth smilingly but i hardly think hell have much time to lounge when everything else fails theres always dicky you know geoffrey looked discouraged and furthermore i declare by the nose of the great tam o shanter that i will cut down every tree in the vicinity ere you shall lounge under it said jack softly my boy hills bluegum forest is not so very far away youll have your hands full laughed dr paul here margery and bell joined the group after a quick walk up and down the deck papa said bell excitedly we certainly are nearing the place do you see that bend in the shore and dont you remember that the landing isnt far below bells bump of locality is immense there are nineteen bends in the shore exactly like that one before we reach the landing how many knots an hour do you suppose this ship travels my fair cousin asked geoffrey i could tell better replied bell calmly if i could ever remember how many knots made a mile or how many miles made a knot but i always forget oh see theres a porpoise cried jack polly why is a porpoise like a waterlily but before he could say guess phil geoff and the girls had drawn themselves into a line and with a whispered one two three to secure a good start replied in concert wegiveitup what a deafening shout cried aunt truth coming out of the cabin whats the matter pray nothing aunty laughed polly but we have formed a society for suppressing jacks conundrums and this is our first public meeting how do you like the watchword aunt truth smiled it was very audible she said yours is evidently not a secret society i wish i could find out who originated this plan quoth jack murderously but i suppose its one of you girls and i cant revenge myself oh when will this barrier between the sexes be removed i trust not in your lifetime shuddered polly or we might as well begin to stand round our dying beds at once chapter ii the journey away away from men and towns to the wild wood and the downs to the silent wilderness whatever the distance was in reality the steamer had consumed more time than usual and it was quite two oclock instead of halfpast twelve as they had expected before they were landed on the old and almost forgotten pier and saw the smoke of the orizaba as she steamed away after counting over their bags and packages to see if anything had been forgotten they looked about them there was a dirty little settlement a mile or two to the south consisting of a collection of tumbledown adobe houses which looked like a blotch on the brown hillside a few cattle were browsing near by and the locality seemed to be well supplied with lizards which darted over the dusty ground in all directions but the startling point of the landscape was that it showed no sign of human life and panchos orders had been to have senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega and his woodcart on hand promptly at halfpast twelve can pancho have forgotten can he have lost his way and never arrived here at all can senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega have grown tired of waiting and gone off has senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega been drinking too much aguardiente and so forgotten to come has pancho been murdered by highway robbers and served up into stew for their evening meal with hop yet for dessert oh horrible these were some of the questions and exclamations that greeted the ears of the lizards and caused them to fly over the ground in a more excited fashion than ever one thing is certain if pancho has been stupid enough to lose his way coming fifty miles down the coast ill discharge him said dr winship with decision when you find him added aunt truth prudently of course but really mamma this looks discouraging i am afraid we cant get into camp this evening shall we go up to the nearest ranch house for the night and see what can be done tomorrow never exclaimed the young people with one deafening shout never echoed philip separately i have vowed that a bed shall not know me for three months and ill keep my vow what do you say to this uncle doc said geoffrey suppose you go up to the storehouse and office its about a mile and see if the goods are there all right and whether the men saw pancho on his way up to the canyon meanwhile phil and i will ride over here somewhere to get a team or look up senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega jack can stay with aunt truth and the girls to watch developments but papa cant we pitch the camp tonight somehow asked bell piteously i dont see how we are behindhand already and if we get started within an hour we cant reach the ground i selected before dark and we cant choose any nearer one because if pancho is anywhere in creation he is on the identical spot i sent him to but dr paul ill tell you what we could do suggested jack if we get any kind of a start we cant fail to reach camp by seven or eight oclock at latest now its bright moonlight and if we find pancho hell have the baggage unloaded and hop yet will have a fire lighted whats to prevent our swinging the hammocks for the ladies and well just roll up in our blankets by the fire for tonight then well get to housekeeping in the morning this plan received a most enthusiastic reception very well replied the doctor if you are all agreed i suppose we may as well begin roughing it now as at any time you may have noticed sometimes after having fortified yourself against a terrible misfortune which seemed in store for you that it didnt come after all well it was so in this case for just as dr winship and the boys started out over the hillside at a brisk pace an immense cloud of dust some distance up the road attracted their attention and they came to a sudden standstill the girls held their breath in anxious expectation and at length gave an irrepressible shout of joy and relief when there issued from the dense grey cloud the familiar fourhorse team with daisy tule molly villikins and dinah looking as fresh as if they had not been driven a mile tough little mustangs that they were a long conversation in spanish ensued which being translated by dr winship furnished all necessary information concerning the delay s d m f h n stated that pancho was neither faithless nor stupid but was waiting for them on the campingground and that as the goods were already packed in his woodcart he would follow them immediately so the whole party started without more delay dr and mrs winship master paul jack howard and the three girls riding in the wagon while geoffrey and philip galloped ahead on horseback it was a long dusty tiresome ride and dicky who had been as good all day as any saint ever carved in marble and set in a niche grew rather warm cross and hungry although he had been consuming gingersnaps and apricots since early morning after asking plaintively for the fiftieth time how long it would be before dinner he finally succumbed to his weariness and dropping his yellow head that was like a cowslip ball in his mothers lap he fell asleep but the young people whose eyes were not blinded by hunger and sleep found more than enough to interest them on this dusty california road winding as it did through grand old growths of trees acres and acres of waving grain and endless stretches of gorgeous yellow mustard the stalks of which were five or six feet high almost hiding from view the boys who dashed into the golden forest from time to time at the foot of the hill they passed an old adobe hut with a crowd of pretty swarthy frowzy mexican children playing in the sunshine while their mother blackhaired and ample of figure occupied herself in hanging great quantities of jerked beef on a sort of clothesline running between the eucalyptustrees the father a wildlooking individual in a red shirt and enormous hat came from behind the hut unhitched the stout little broncho tied to the fence gave the poor animal a desperately tight cinch threw himself into the saddle without touching his foot to the lumbering wooden stirrups and digging his spurs well into the horses sides was out of sight in an instant leaving only a huge cloud of dust to cover his disappearance how those fellows do ride exclaimed dr winship savagely i wish they were all obliged to walk until they knew how to treat a horse then theyd walk straight into the millennium said jack sagely for their cruelty seems to be an instinct but how beautifully they ride too said polly mamma and i were sitting on the hotel piazza the other day watching two young spaniards who were performing feats of horsemanship they dropped fourbit pieces on the dusty road and riding up to them at full speed clutched them from the ground in some mysterious way that was perfectly wonderful then nick gutierrez mounted a bucking horse and actually rolled and lighted a cigarette while the animal bucked with all his might see that cunning cunning muchachita mamma cried bell for as they stopped at the top of the hill to let the horses breathe one of the little mexican children ran after them holding out a handful of glowing yellow poppies she was distractingly pretty with a beauty that is shortlived with the people of her race the afternoon sun shone down fiercely on her waving coalblack locks and brought a rich colour to her nutbrown cheek she had one little flimsy ragged garment neither long broad nor thick which hung about her picturesquely and with her soft dark sleepy eyes the rows of little white teeth behind her laughing red mouth and the vivid yellow blossoms in her tiny outstretched hand she was a very charming vision como te llamas muchachita what is your name little one asked bell airing her spanish which was rather good teresita she answered with a pretty accent as she scratched a set of five grimy little toes to and fro in the dusty ground throw her a bit papa whispered bell and as he did so teresita caught the piece of silver very deftly and ran excitedly back to the centre of the chattering group in front of the house how intense everything is in california do you know what i mean mamma said bell the fruit is so immense the canyons so deep the trees so big the hills so high the rain so wet and the drought so dry the fleas so many the fleas so spry chanted jack who had perceived that bell was talking in rhyme without knowing it california is just the place for you bell it gives you a chance for innumerable adjectives heaped one on the other i dont always heap up adjectives replied bell with dignity when i wish to describe you for instance i simply say that hateful boy and let it go at that jack retired to private life for a season id like to paint a picture of teresita said margery who had a pretty talent for sketching and call it the summer child or some such thing i should think the famous old colour artists might have loved to paint this gorgeous flametinted poppy not poppy eschscholtzia corrected jack coming rapidly to the surface again after bells rebuke and delivering himself of the tongueconfusing word with a terrible grimace im not writing a botany retorted margery and i can never remember that word much less spell it i dont see how it grows under such an abominable russian name its worse than ichthyosaurus do you remember that funny nonsense verse i is for ichthyosaurus who lived when the world was all porous but he fainted with shame when he first heard his name and departed a long while before us the spaniards are more poetic said aunt truth for they call it la copa de oro the golden cup oh see them yonder it is like the field of the cloth of gold the sight would have driven a royal florist mad with joy a hillside that was a swaying mass of radiant bloom a joyous carnival of vivid colour in which the thousand golden goblets turned upward to the sun were dancing and glowing and shaming out of countenance the purple and blue and pink masses which surrounded them on every side you know professor pinnie told us that every wellinformed young girl should know at least the flora of her own state said jack after the excitement had subsided well one thing is certain professor pinnie never knew the state of his own flora or at least he kept his wife sorting and arranging his specimens all the time and i think hes a regular old frump said polly irreverently but meeting aunt truths reproving glance which brought a blush and a whispered excuse me she went on well what i mean is he doesnt know any more than other people after all for he cares for nothing but bushes and herbs and seeds and shrubs and roots and stamens and pistils and he cant tell whether a flower is lovely or not he is so crazy to find out where it belongs and tie a tag round it i must agree with polly laughed jack why i went to ride with him one day in the cathedral oaks and he made me get off my horse every five minutes to dig up roots and tie them to the pommel of his old saddle so that we came into town looking like moving herbariums the stableman lifted him on to his horse when he started i suppose and he would have been there yet if he hadnt been helped off bah for jack had a supreme contempt for any man who was less than a centaur by this time they had turned off the main thoroughfare and were travelling over a bit of old stage road which was anything but easy riding there they met some men who were driving an enormous band of sheep to a distant ranch for pasture which gave saucy polly the chance to ask dr winship innocently why white sheep ate so much more than black ones he fell into the trap at once and answered unsuspectingly in a surprised tone why do they giving her the longedfor opportunity to respond yes of course because there are so many more of em dont you see you are behind the times dr paul said jack thats an ancient joke just look at those sheep sir how many are there eight hundred say even more i should think a thousand certainly and rather thin they look too i should imagine they might said bell sympathetically when i first came to california i never could see how the poor creatures found anything to eat on these bare brown hillsides until the farmers showed me the prickly little burr clover balls that cover the ground but see mamma there are some tiny lambs poor tired weaklegged little things i wonder if they will live through the journey which reminds me said jack giving villikins a touch of the whip that nothing is so calculated to disturb your faith in and love for lambs as life on a sheep ranch innocent good gracious i never saw such such gasping staggering stuttering stammering tomfools interposed bell thats what carlyle called one lamb dear mr roast pig charles and a mean old thing he was too for doing it well it is just strong enough to apply to the actual lamb not the lamb of romance but the lamb of reality you cant get him anywhere he doesnt know enough he wont drive he cant follow hes too stupid why i went out for a couple of em once that were lost in the canyon i found them that was comparatively easy but when i tried to get them home i couldnt at last after infinite trouble i managed to drive them up on to the trail which was so narrow there was but one thing for a rational creature to do and that was to go ahead then if youll believe me those idiots kept bleating and getting under the horses forefeet finally one of them the champion simpleton tumbled over into the canyon and i tied the legs of the other one together and carried him home on the front of my saddle they are innocent any way insisted margery i wont believe theyre not i cant bear these people who interfere with all your cherished ideas and say that columbus didnt discover america and shakespeare wasnt shakespeare and william tell didnt shoot the apple nevertheless i claim that the lamb is not half so much an emblem of innocence as he is of utter and profound stupidity there is that charming old lyric about marys little lamb i can explain that after he came to school which was an error of judgment at the very beginning he made the rumpus you know and then the teacher turned him out but still he lingered neear and waited patiently about till mary did appeear of course he did he didnt know enough to go home alone and then he ran to her and laid his head upon her arrum as if to say im not afraid youll keep me from all harrum as if a lamb could be capable of that amount of reasoning and then what makes the lamb love mary so the eager children cry why mary loves the lamb you know the teacher did reply and might have added that as mary fed the lamb three times a day and twice on sundays he probably not only knew on which side his daily bread was buttered but also who buttered it dreadful boy laughed bell polly pray lower the umbrella we are going to meet some respectable people and we actually are too dirty to be seen i have really been eating dust they must be equally dusty said polly sagely why it is the burtons from tacitas ranch the burton ranch wagon was drawn up as its driver recognised dr winship and he proceeded to cheer the spirits of the party by telling them that he had passed pancho two hours before and that he was busily clearing rubbish from the campingground this was six oclock and by a little after eight the weary happy party were seated on saddleblankets and carriagecushions round a cheery campfire eating a frugal meal which tasted sweeter than nectar and ambrosia to their keen appetites the boys expressed their intention of spending the night in unpacking their baggage and getting to rights generally but dr winship placed a prompt and decisive veto on this proposition and they submitted cheerfully to his better judgment getting to bed was an exciting occupation for everybody dicky was first tucked up in a warm nest of rugs and blankets under a tree and sank into a profound slumber at once with the happy unconsciousness of childhood his father completed the preparations for his comfort by opening a huge umbrella and arranging it firmly over his head so that no falling leaf might frighten him and no sudden gust of air blow upon his face bell stood before her hammock and meditated well she said going to bed is a simple matter after all when you have shorn it of all useless formalities let me see i generally walk to and fro in the room eating a bunch of grapes or an orange look out of the window five or ten minutes brush my hair read my chapter in the bible take my book and study spanish five minutes on the principle of that abnormal woman who learned ninetysix languages while she was waiting for the kettle to boil in the morning must have been a slow boiler interrupted polly wickedly seems to me it would have been economy to sell it and buy a new one oh polly you are so wilfully stupid the kettle isnt the point but the languages besides she didnt learn all the ninetysix while the kettle was boiling once you know oh didnt she that alters the case thank you said polly sarcastically now observe me said bell i have made the getting into a hammock a study i first open it very wide at the top with both hands then holding it in that position i gracefully revolve my body from left to right as upon an imaginary swivel meantime i raise my right foot considerably from mother earth with a view to passing it over the hammocks edge every move is calculated you perceive and produces its own share of the perfect result the method is the same that rachel used in rehearsing her wonderful tragic poses i am now seated in the hammock you observe with both hands extending the net from side to side and the right foot well in position i now raise the left foot with a swift but admirably steady movement and i am help help murder in short you are not in but out cried polly in a burst of laughter for bell had leaned too far to the right and on bringing the other foot in with its swift but admirably steady motion she gave a sudden lurch pulled the hammock entirely over herself and fell out head first on the other side leaving her feet tangled in its meshes shall we help her out meg she doesnt deserve it after that pompous oration and attempt to show off her superior abilities nevertheless she always accepts mercy more gracefully than justice heave ahoy my hearties bell was extricated and looked sufficiently ashamed we are much obliged for the lesson said margery but the method is open to criticism so i think well manage in our ordinary savage way we may not be graceful or scientific but we get in which is the main point the hammocks did not prove the easiest of nests as the girls had imagined in fact to be perfectly candid about the matter the wicked flea of california which man pursueth but seldom catcheth is apt on many a summer night to interfere shamelessly with slumber on this particular night he was fairly rampant perhaps because sweet humanity on which to feed was very scarce in that canyon goodnight girls called jack when matters seemed to be finally settled for sleep bell you must keep one eye open for the coyotes will be stealing down the mountain in a jiffy and yours is the first hammock in the path of course moaned bell thats why the girls gave me this one they knew very well that one victim always slakes the animals thirst for blood well let them come on i shiver with terror but my only hope is that i may be eaten in my sleep if at all there was a young party named bell who slept out of doors for a spell when asked how she fared she said she was scared but otherwise doing quite well hows that asked jack i shall be able to drive bell off her own field with a little practice go to sleep roared dr paul in your present condition of mind and body you are not fit for poetry thats just the point sir retorted jack slyly for you remember poets are not fit but nascitur dont you know and he retired under his blanket for protection but quiet seemed to be impossible there were all sorts of strange sounds and the moon too was so splendid that they almost felt as if they were lying beneath the radiance of a calcium light while in the dark places midst the branches of thick foliage the owls hooted gloomily if you had happened to be an owl in that vicinity you might have heard not only the feverish tossing to and fro of the girls in the hammocks but many dismal sighs and groans from dr winship and the boys for the bare ground is after all more rheumatic than romantic and they too tumbled from side to side seeking comfort but at midnight quiet slumber had descended upon them and they presented a funny spectacle enough to one openeyed watcher a long slender sycamore log was extended before the fire and constituted their pillow on this their heads reposed each decorated with a tightly fitting silk handkerchief then came a compact papooselike roll of grey blanket terminated by a pair of erect feet whose generous proportions soared to different heights there was a little snoring too perhaps the log was hollow at midnight you might have seen a quaintly despondent little figure whose curly head issued from a hooded cloak staggering hopelessly from a hammock and seating herself on a mossy stump from the limpness of her attitude and the pathetic expression of her eyes i fear polly was reviewing former happy nights spent on springbeds and at this particular moment the realities of campingout hardly equalled her anticipations whatever may have been her feelings however they were promptly stifled when a certain insolent head reared itself from its blanketroll and a hoarse voice cackled pretty polly polly want a canyon at this insult miss oliver wrapped her drapery about her and strode to her hammock with the air of a tragedy queen chapter iii life in the canyon the heir apparent loses himself knowst thou the land where the lemontrees bloom where the gold orange glows in the green thickets gloom where the wind ever soft from the blue heaven blows and groves are of myrtle and olive and rose on the next morning as we have seen they named their summer home camp chaparral and for a week or more they were the very busiest colony of people under the sun for it takes a deal of hard work and ingenuity to make a comfortable and beautiful dwellingplace in the forest the best way of showing you how they accomplished this is to describe the camp after it was nearly finished the two largest bedroom tents were made of bright awning cloth one of red and white the other of blue and white both gaily decorated with braid they were pitched under the same giant oak and yet were nearly forty feet apart that of the girls having a canvas floor they were not quite willing to sleep on the ground so they had brought empty bedsacks with them and panchos first duty after his arrival had been to drive to a neighbouring ranch for a great load of straw in a glorious tree near by was a sky parlour arranged by a few boards nailed high up in the leafy branches and reached from below by a primitive ladder this was the favourite sittingroom of the girls by day and served for panchos bedroom at night it was beautiful enough to be fit shelter for all the woodland nymphs with its festoons of mistletoe and wild grapevines but pancho was rather an unappreciative tenant even going so far as to snore in the sacred place just beyond was a cardroom imagine it in which a square board nailed on a low stump served for a table where dr paul and the boys played many a game of crib backgammon and checkers here too all elsies letters were written and bells nonsense verses and here was the identical spot where jack howard that mischievous knight of the brush perpetrated those modern travesties on the william henry pictures for elsies delectation the dressingroom was reached by a path cut through bushes to a charming little pool here were unmistakable evidences of feminine art lookingglasses hanging to trees snowy washcloths each bearing its owners initials adorning the shrubs while numerous towels waved in the breeze between two trees a thin board was nailed which appeared to be used as nearly as the woodpeckers could make out as a toothbrush rack in this philip the skilful carpenter had bored the necessary number of holes and each one contained a toothbrush tied with a gorgeous ribbon in this secluded spot bell was wont to marshal every morning the entire force of the toothbrush brigade and conducting the drill with much ingenuity she would take her victims through a long series of military manoeuvres arranged for the toothbrush oh the gaspings the chokings and stranglings which occurred when she mounted a rock by the edge of the pool and after calling in tones of thunder brush brothers brush with care brush in the presence of the commandaire ordered her unwilling privates to polish their innocent molars to the tune of hail columbia or auld lang syne and if they became mutinous it was geoffrey who reduced them to submission and ordered them to brush for three mornings to the tune of bluebells of scotland as a sign of loyalty to their commander as for the furnishing of the camp there were impromptu stools and tables made of packingboxes and trunks all covered with bright turkeyred cotton there were no less than three rustic lounges and two armchairs made from manzanita branches and a queen anne bedstead was being slowly constructed day by day by the ambitious boys for their beloved elsie one corner of each tent was curtained off for a bathroom another for a clothespress and there were a dozen devices for comfort as dr winship was opposed to any more inconvenience than was strictly necessary dr and mrs winship and little dicky occupied one tent the boys another and the girls a third when bell polly and margery emerged from their tent on the second morning they were disagreeably surprised to see a large placard over the front entrance bearing the insolent inscription tent chatter they said nothing but on the night after a committee of two stole out and glued a companion placard tent clatter over the door of their masculine neighbours and to tell the truth one was as well deserved as the other for if there was generally a subdued hum of conversation in the one there never failed to be a perfect din and uproar in the other under a great sycamoretree stood the diningtable which consisted of two long wide boards placed together upon a couple of barrels and not far away was the brush kitchen which should have been a work of art for it represented the combined genius of american mexican and chinese carpenters dr winship pancho and hop yet having laboured in its erection it really answered the purpose admirably and looked quite like a conventional california kitchen that is it was ten feet square and contained a table a stove and a chinaman the young people by the way had fought bitterly against the stove protesting with all their might against taking it polly and jack declared that they would starve sooner than eat anything that hadnt been cooked over a campfire bell and philip said that they should stand in front of it all the time for fear somebody would ride through the canyon and catch them camping out with a stove imagine such a situation it made them blush margery said she wished people werent quite so practical and wouldnt ruin nature by introducing such ugly and unnecessary things she intended to point the moral by drawing a picture of adam and eve in the garden of eden eve bending over a cookstove and adam peeling apples with a machine geoffrey scoffed at margerys sentimentalism put on his most trying air and declared that if he had his pork and onions served up hot and reglar he didnt care how she had her victuals cooked they were all somewhat appeased however when they found that dr winship was as anxious as they for an evening campfire and merely insisted upon the stove because it simplified the cookery furthermore being an eminently just man he yielded so far as to give them permission to prepare their own meals on a private campfire whenever they desired and this effectually stopped the argument for no one was willing to pay so heavy a price for effect the hammocks made of gailycoloured cords were slung in various directions a short distance from the square tent which being the family sittingroom was the centre of attraction it was arranged with a gay canopy twenty feet square three sides were made by hanging full curtains of awning cloth from redwood rods by means of huge brass rings these curtains were looped back during the day and dropped after dark making a cosy and warm interior from which to watch the campfire on cool evenings as for the canyon de las flores itself this little valley of the flowers it was beautiful enough in every part to inspire an artists pencil or a poets pen so quiet and romantic it was too it might almost have been under a spell the home of some sleepy enchanted princess waiting the magic kiss of a princely lover it reached from the ocean to the mountains and held a thousand different pictures on which to feast the eye for dame nature deals out beauty with a lavish hand in this land of perpetual summer song and sunshine there were many noble oaktrees some hung profusely with mistletoe and others with the long spanish greybeard moss that droops from the branches in silvery lines like water spray sometimes in the moonlight it winds about the oak like a shroud and then again like a filmy bridal veil or drippings of mist from a frozen tree here and there were open tracts of ground between the clumps of trees like that in which the tents were pitched sunny places where the earth was warm and dry and the lizards blinked sleepily under the stones farther up the canyon were superb baytrees with their glossy leaves and aromatic odour and the madrono which with its bloodred skin is one of the most beautiful of california trees having an open growth like a maple bright green lustrous leaves and a brilliant red bark which peels off at regular seasons giving place to a new one of delicate peagreen there were no birches with pure white skin or graceful elms or fluffy pussy willows but so many beautiful foreign things that it would seem ungrateful to mourn those left behind in the dear new england woods and as for flowers there are no yellow and purple violets fragile anemones or blushing mayflowers but in march the hillsides are covered with red in april flushed with pink and blue in may brilliant with yellow blossoms and in the canyons where the earth is moist there are flowers all the year and then the girls would never forgive me if i should forget the superb yucca or spanish bayonet which is as beautiful as a tropical queen its tall slender stalk has no twigs or branches but its leaves hang down from the top like bayonetblades and oh there rises from the centre of them such a stately princess of a flower like a tree in itself laden with creamwhite velvety fragrant blossoms the boys often climbed the hillsides and brought home these splendid treasures which were placed in pails of water at the tent doors to shed their luxuriant beauty and sweetness in the air for days together they brought home quantities of spanish moss and wild clematis and manzanita berries too with which to decorate the beloved camp and even dicky trotted back with his arms full of gorgeous blossoms and grasses which he arranged with great taste and skill in mugs bottles and cans on the diningtable cant you see what a charming place it was and i have not begun to tell you the half yet for there was always a soft wind stirring the leaves in dreamy music and above and through this whispered sound you heard the brook splashing over its pebbly bed splashing and splashing and laughing all it possibly could knowing it would speedily be dried up by the thirsty august sun every few yards part of the stream settled down contentedly into a placid little pool while the most inquisitive and restless little drops flowed noisily down to see what was going on below the banks were fringed with graceful alders and poisonoak bushes vivid in crimson and yellow leaves while delicate maidenhair ferns grew in miniature forests between the crevices of the rocks yet with the practicality of chinese human nature hop yet used all this beauty for a dishpan and refrigerator now confess that after having seen exactly how it looks you would like to rub a magic lamp like aladdin and wish yourself there with our merry young sextette for california is a lovely land and a strange one even at this late day when her character has been nearly ruined by dreadful stories or made ridiculous by foolish ones when you were all babies in long clothes some people used to believe that there were nuggets of gold to be picked up in the streets and that in the flowery valleys flowing with milk and honey there grew groves of beettrees and forests of cabbages and shady bowers of squashvines and they thought that through these fertile valleys strode men of curious mien wild bandits and highway robbers with red flannel shirts and many pockets filled with playingcards and revolvers and bowieknives and that when you met these frightful persons and courteously asked the time of day they were apt to turn and stab you to the heart by way of response now some of these things were true and some were not and some will never happen again for the towns and cities no longer conduct themselves like headstrong young tomboys out on a lark but have grown into ancient and decorous settlements some twentyfive or thirty years old perhaps california isnt really so interesting since she began to learn manners but she is a land of wonders still with her sublime mountains and valleys her precious metals her vineyards and orchards of lemons and oranges figs limes and nuts her mammoth vegetables each big enough for a newspaper story her celebrated trees on the stumps of which dancingparties are given her vultures her grizzly bears and her people drawn from every nook and corner of the map pink yellow blue red and green countries and though the story of california is not written in all its romantic details in the schoolbooks of today it is a part of the poetry of our late american history full of strange and thrilling scenes glowing with interest and dramatic fire i know a little girl who crossed the plains in that great ungeneraled army of fifteen or twenty thousand people that made the long and weary journey to the land of gold in she tells her children now of the strange long days and months in the oxteam passing through the heat and dust of alkali deserts fording rivers and toiling over steep mountains she tells them how at night she often used to lie awake curled up in her grey blanket and hear the men talking together of the gold treasures they were to dig from the ground treasures it seemed to her childish mind more precious than those of which she read in the arabian nights and from a little hole in the canvas cover of the old emigrant wagon she used to see the tired fathers and brothers worn and footsore from their hard days tramp some sleeping restlessly and others guarding the cattle or watching for indians who were always expected and often came and the last thing at night when her eyes were heavy with sleep she peered dreamily out into the darkness to see the hundreds of gleaming campfires which dotted the plain as far as the eye could reach you will have noticed that this first week of camplife was a quiet one spent mostly by the young people in getting their openair home comfortably arranged making conveniences of all kinds becoming acquainted with the canyon so far as they could and riding once or twice to neighbouring ranches for hay or provisions dr winship believed in a good beginning and as this was not a weeks holiday but a summer campaign he wanted his young people to get fully used to the situation before undertaking any of the exciting excursions in prospect so before the week was over they began to enjoy sound dreamless sleep on their hard straw beds to eat the plain fare with decided relish to grow a little hardy and brown and quite strong and tough enough for a long tramp or horseback ride after a religious devotion to cold cream for a few nights polly had signified her terrible intention of letting her nose go i disown it she cried peeping in her tiny mirror and lighting up her too rosy tints with a tallow candle hideous objick i defy thee spot and speckle yea burn to a crisp and shed thy skin afterwards i care not indeed i shall be well rid of thee thou hm thou well leopard for instance one beautiful day followed another each the exact counterpart of the one that had preceded it for california boys and girls never have to say wind and weather permitting from march or april until november they always know what the weather is going to do and whether this is an advantage or not is a difficult matter to settle conclusively new england boys affirm that they wouldnt live in a country where it couldnt rain any day it felt like it and california lads retort that they are glad their dispositions are not ruined by the freaks of new england weather at all events it is a paradise for wouldbe campers and any one who should assert the contrary would meet with energetic opposition from the loyal dwellers in camp chaparral bell returned one day from a walk which she had taken by herself while the other girls were off on some errand with the doctor after luncheon she drew them mysteriously into the square tent and lowered the curtains what is it polly whispered with an anxious expression of countenance have you lost your gold thimble again or your temper or have you discovered a silver mine i have found she answered mysteriously the most beautifully secret place you ever beheld it will be just the spot for us to write and study in when we want to be alone or it will even do for a theatre and it is scarcely more than half a mile up the canyon how did you find it asked margery as i was walking along by the brookside i saw a snake making its way through the bushes and goodness shrieked polly i shall not write there thank you goose just wait a minute i looked at it and followed at a distance it was a harmless little thing and i thought for the fun of it i would just push blindly on and see what i should find because we are for ever walking in the beaten path and i long for something new a bad instinct remarked madge and one which will get you into trouble so you should crush it in its infancy well i took up my dress and ploughed through the chaparral until i came in about three minutes of scratching and fighting to an open circular place about as large as this tent it was exactly round which is the curious part of it and in the centre was one stump covered with moss and surrounded by great white toadstools how any one happened to go in there and cut down a single tree i cant understand nor yet how they managed to bring out the tree through the tangled brush it is so strange that it seems as if there must be a mystery about it certainly said margery promptly a tragedy of the darkest kind some cruel wretch has cut down in the pride and pomp of it beauty one sycamoretree its innocent lifeblood has stained the ground and given birth to the white toadstools which mark the spot and testify to the purity of the victim well continued bell impressively i knew i could never find it again and i wanted so much you should see it that i took the ball of twine we always carry unrolled it and dropped the thread all the way along to the brookside like phrygia or melpomene or anemone or whatever her name was or artesia or polynesia or euthanasia interrupted polly i think the lady you mean is ariadne exactly now well take papa to see it and then well fit it up as a retreat wont it be charming well call it the lone stump oh i like that it makes me shiver cried polly im going to write an ode to it at once ahem it shall begin let me see o lonely tree what cruel he did lay thee low tell us the facts did cruel axe abuse thee so sublime second verse said bell slowly with pauses between the lines or did a gopher the wicked loafer gnaw at thy base and doing so contrive to go and leave no trace oh dear sighed margery if you will do it wait a minute o toadstools white pray give us light upon the question did gopher gnaw and live in awe of indigestion good continued bell or did a man malicious plan the good trees ruin and leave it so convenient low a seat for bruin for travelling grizzlies you know we may go there and see a hungry creature making a stumpspeech while an admiring audience of grasshoppers and tarantulas seat themselves in a circle on the toadstools charming prospect said madge i dont think i care to visit the lone stump or pass my mornings there nonsense dear child it is just like every other part of the canyon only a little more lonely it is not half a mile from camp and hardly a dozen steps from the place where the boys go so often to shoot quail very well said the girls we must go there tomorrow morning and perhaps wed better not tell the boys they are so peculiar jack will certainly interfere with us in some way if he hears about it now let us take our books and run down by the pool for an hour or two said bell papa and the boys are all off shooting and mamma is lying down we can have a cool quiet time the sunshine is so hot here by the tents accordingly they departed as they often did for one of the prolonged chats in which schoolgirls are wont to indulge and which so often too are but idle senseless chatter these young people however had been fortunate in having the wisest and most loving guardianship so that all their happy young lives had been spent to good purpose they had not shirked study and so their minds were stocked with useful information they had read carefully and digested thoroughly whatever they had read so that they possessed a good deal of general knowledge the girls were bright sensible industrious little women who tried to be good too in the oldfashioned sense of the word and full of fun nonsense and chatter as they were among themselves they never forgot to be modest and unassuming the boys were pretty well in earnest about life too with good ambitions and generous aspirations they had all been studying with dr winship for nearly two years and that means a great deal for he was a real teacher entering into the lives of his pupils sympathising with them in every way and leading them through the study of nature of human beings and of god to see the beauty and meaning of life geoffrey strong of course was older than the rest having completed his junior year at college but dr winship who was his guardian thought it wiser for him to rest a year and come to him in california as his ambition and energy had already led him into greater exertions than his age or strength warranted he was now studying medicine with the good doctor but would go back to the land of perpetual pie in the fall and complete his college course a splendid fellow he was so earnest thoughtful and wise so gravely tender in all his ways to aunt truth who was the only mother he had ever known so devoted to dr winship who loved him as his own elder son what will geoffrey strong be as a man the twig is bent and it is safe to predict how the tree will incline his word will be as good as his bond he will be a good physician for his eye is quick to see suffering and his hand ready to relieve it little children with feverish cheeks and tired eyes will love to clasp his cool strong sand he will be gentle as a woman yet thoroughly manly as he is now for he has made the most of his golden youth and every lad who does that will have a golden manhood and a glorious old age as for philip noble he was a dear good trustworthy lad too kindly generous practical and industrious a trifle slow and reserved perhaps but full of common sense the kind of sense which after all is most uncommon bell once said this is the difference between philip and geoffrey one does and the other is geoff is the real simonpure ideal which we praise philip for trying to be a very good description for a little maiden whose bright eyes had only looked into life for sixteen summers and now we come to jack howard who never kept still long enough for any one to write a description of him to explain how he differed from philip or geoffrey would be like bringing the equator and the tropic of cancer together for purposes of comparison if there were a horseback ride jack rode the wildest colt was oftenest thrown and least often hurt if a fishingparty jack it was who caught all the fish though he made more noise than any one else and followed no rules laid down in the complete angler he was very often in trouble but his misdemeanours were those of pure mischief and were generally atoned for when it was possible he excelled in all outofdoor sports and indeed if his prudence had at all kept pace with his ability he might have done remarkable things in almost any direction but he constantly overshot the mark and people looked to him for the dazzling brilliancy and uncertainty of a meteor but never for the steady glow of a fixed star just now jack was a good deal sobered and appeared at his very best the teaching of dr paul and the companionship of geoffrey had done much for him while the illness of his sister elsie who was the darling of his heart acted constantly as a sort of curb upon him for he loved her with all the ardour and passion which he gave to everything else you might be fearful of jacks high spirits and riotous mirth of his reckless actions and heedless jokes but you could scarcely keep from admiring the boy for he was brave and handsome and winsome enough to charm the very birds off the bush as aunt truth acknowledged after giving him a lecture for some misdemeanour the three girls made their way a short distance up the canyon to a place which they called prospect pool because it was so entirely shut in from observation dear old geoff said bell throwing her shawl over a rock and opening her volume of carlyle he has gone all through this for me and written nice little remarks on the margin explanations and things and interrogations where he thinks i wont know what is meant and had better find out bless his heart what have you brought margery by the way you must move your seat away from that clump of poisonoak bushes we cant afford to have any accidents which will interfere with our fun we have all sorts of new remedies but i prefer that the boys should experiment with them its the softest seat here too grumbled margery we must get the boys to cut these bushes down why you havent any book you lazy polly are you going to sleep or shall you chatter and prevent our reading neither she answered here is a doughnut which i propose to send down the red pathway of fate and here a pencil and paper with which i am going to begin our roundrobin letter to elsie thats good she has only had notes from jack and one letter from us which if i remember right had nothing in it thanks i wrote it sniffed bell well i meant it had no news no account of things you know no i wouldnt descend to writing news and i leave accounts to the butcher stop quarrelling girls this is my plan i will begin in my usual rockety style sometimes maliciously called the pollyoliver method margery will take up the thread sedately bell will plunge in with a burst of enthusiasm and seventeen adjectives followed by a verse of poor poetry geoff will do the sportive or instructive just as he happens to feel and phil will wind up the letter by some practical details which will serve as a key to all the rest wont it be a box of literary bonbons for her to read in bed poor darling let me see i represent the cayenne lozenges sharp but impressive margery will do for jujube paste which i adore mild pleasant yielding delicious sticky and insipid murmured madge plaintively not at all my dear bell stands for the peppermints jack for chocolates the ladies delight geoffrey for a winedrop altogether good but sweetest in its heart phil let me see phil is like what is he like no more like candy than a cold boiled potato said his sister he is candid suggested bell let us call him rockcandy pure healthful and far from soft or marshmallow said margery good but tough or caramel laughed polly it always sticks to a point thanks gentle creatures said a voice from the bushes on the other side of the pool and phil stalked out from his covert like a wounded deer how long have you been in there villain cried bell ever since lunch but i only waked from a sound sleep some twenty minutes ago ive heard a most instructive conversation never been more amused in my life dont know whether i prefer being a cold boiled potato or a ladiesdelight you havent any choice snapped polly a trifle embarrassed at having been overheard im glad it was my own sister who called me a c b p the most loathsome thing in existence by the way because sisters never appreciate their brothers i didnt call you a c b p remonstrated margery i said you were no more like candy than a c b p there is a difference is there my poor brain fails to grasp it but never mind ill forgive you listeners never hear good of themselves sighed polly are you writing a copybook miss oliver i didnt want to listen it was very painful to my feelings but i was too sleepy to move and now our afternoon is gone and we have not read a word sighed little margery i never met two such chatterboxes as you and polly and to hear us talk is a liberal education retorted polly exactly said philip dryly come ill take the books and shawls its nearly five oclock and we shall hear hop yet blowing his lusty dinnerhorn presently why didnt you go off shooting with the others asked margery stayed at home so theyd get a chance to shoot why do you mean you always scare the game away inquired polly artlessly no i mean that i always do all the shooting and the others get discouraged clasp hands over the bloody chasm said bell and let us smoke the pipe of peace at dinner philip and bell came through the trees and as they neared the camp saw aunt truth sitting at the door of tent chatter looking the very picture of comfort as she drew her darningneedle in and out of an unseemly rent in one of dickys stockings margery and polly came up just behind and dropped into her lap some beautiful branches of wild azalea did you have a pleasant walk dears she asked yes indeed dear auntie now just hold your head perfectly still while we decorate you for dinner we will make uncle docs eyes fairly pop with admiration have you been lonely without us oh not a bit you see there has been a good deal of noise about here and i felt as if i were not alone hop yet has been pounding soaproot in the kitchen and i hear the sound of panchos axe in the distance the doctor asked him to chop wood for the campfire was dicky any trouble where is he why darling mother are you crazy asked bell if you think a moment he was in the hammock and you were lying down in the tent when we started why i certainly thought i heard him ask to go with you said mrs winship in rather an alarmed tone so he did but i told him it was too far i didnt hear that in fact i was half asleep i was not feeling well ask hop yet he has been in the kitchen all the afternoon hop yet replied with discouraging tranquillity oh i no know i no sabe dicky he allee time lun loun camp i no look too muchee work i chop hash dicky come in kitch make heap work no good i tell him go long he go bimeby you catchum you see whereupon he gracefully skinned an onion and burst into a chinese song with complete indifference as to whether dicky lived or died perhaps he is with pancho ill run and see cried polly dashing swiftly in the direction of the skyparlour but after a few minutes she ran back with a serious face hes not there pancho has not seen him since lunch well ive just happened to think said pale aunt truth that papa came into the tent for some cartridges after you left and of course he took dick with him i dont suppose it is any use to worry he always does come out right and i have told him so many times never on any account to go away from the camp alone that he surely would not do it papa and the boys will be home soon now it is nearly six oclock and i told them that i would blow the horn at six as usual if they are too far away to hear it they will know the time by the sun well said bell anxiously i hope it is all right papa is so strict that he wont be late himself did all the boys go with him mamma yes all but philip oh then dicky must be with them said margery consolingly geoffrey always takes him wherever he can so the girls went into the tent to begin their dinner toilet which consisted in carefully brushing burrs and dust from their pretty dresses and donning fresh collars and stockings with low ties of russet leather which polly declared belonged only to the stage conception of a camping costume then with smoothly brushed hair and bright flowerknots at collar and belt they looked charming enough to grace any drawingroom in the land the horn was blown again at six oclock aunt truth standing at the entrance of the path which led up the canyon shading her anxious eyes from the light of the setting sun here they come she cried joyously as the welcome party appeared in sight guns over shoulder full gamebags and jack and geoff with a few rabbits and quail hanging over their arms the girls rushed out of the tent bell took in the whole group with one swift glance and then turned to her mother who like most mothers believed the worst at once and grew paler as she asked papa where is little dick dick why my dear he has not been out with us what do you mean are you sure you didnt take him faltered aunt truth of course i am good heavens doesnt any one know where the child is looking at the frightened group you know uncle said geoffrey we started out at three oclock i noticed dicky playing with his blocks in our tent and said goodbye to him did you see him when you came back for the cartridges certainly i did he called me to look at his dog making believe go to sleep in the hammock we girls went down to the pool soon after that said bell tearfully he asked to go with us and i told him it was too far and that hed better stay with mamma who would be all alone he said yes so sweetly i couldnt mistrust him oh was it my fault papa please dont say it was and she burst into a passion of sobs no no my child of course it was not dont cry we shall find him go and look about the camp geoff while we consider for a minute what to do if there is any fault it is mine for going to sleep said poor aunt truth but i never dreamed he would dare to wander off alone my poor little disobedient darling what shall we do have you spoken to pancho and hop yet asked phil yes they have seen nothing hop yet just at this moment issued from his kitchen with an immense platter of muttonstew and dumplings which he deposited on the table on being questioned again he answered as before with the greatest serenity intimating that dicky would come home heap bimeby when he got plenty hungly he seemed to think a lost boy or two in a family rather a trifle than otherwise and wound up his unfeeling remarks with the practical one dinner all leady you no eat mutton he get cold misser wins i no find pickle you catchum i dont believe he would care if we all died right before his eyes muttered polly angrily i should just like to see a chinamans heart once and find out whether it was made of resin or cuttlefish or what well said phil as dr winship came through the trees from the cardroom we must start out this instant and of course we can find him somehow somewhere he hasnt been gone over two hours and he couldnt walk far thats certain now uncle doc shall we all go different ways and leave the girls here to see if he doesnt turn up oh papa cried bell do not leave us at home we can hunt as well as any one we know every foot of the canyon let me go with geoff and well follow the brook trail very well now mamma pancho and i will go down to the main road and you wait patiently here make all the noise you can children and the one who finds him must come back to the camp and blow the horn hop yet we go now if dicky comes back you blow the horn yourself will you all light boss you eat um dinner now then go bimeby mutton heap cold you dinner shouted jack confound your impudence if you say dinner again ill cut the queue off your stupid head good murmured polly giving a savage punch to her blue tam o shanter cap jack jack remonstrated aunt truth i know dear auntie but the callous old heathen makes me so mad i cant contain myself come margery lets be off get your shawl and hurrah for the one who comes back to blow the horn first ill wager you ten to one ill have dick in aunties lap inside the hour at which aunt truths eyes brightened and she began to take heart again but as he tore past the brush kitchen and out into the woods dragging madge after him at a breathless pace he shut his lips together rather grimly saying id give five hundred dollars sposin i had a cent to see that youngster safe again tell me one thing jack said margery her teeth chattering with nervousness are there any animals in this canyon that would attack him oh of course it is possible that a california lion or a wildcat might come down to the brook to drink they have been killed hereabouts but i hardly believe it is likely and neither do i believe they would be apt to hurt him any way for he would never attack them you know what i am afraid of is that he has tumbled over the rocks somewhere in climbing or tangled himself up in the chaparral he couldnt have made off with a pistol could he he is up to all such tricks presently the canyon began to echo with strange sounds which i have no doubt sent the owls birds and rabbits into fits of terror for the boys had whistles and pistols while polly had taken a tin pan and a hammer she had gone with phil out behind the thicket of manzanita bushes and they both stood motionless undecided where to go oh phil i cant help it i must cry i am so frightened let me sit down a second yes i know its an anthill and i shouldnt care if it were a hornets nest i deserve to be stung what do you think i said to margery this morning that dicky was a perfect little marplot and spoiled all our fun and i wished he were in the bottom of the red sea and then i called him a kkkilljoy and polly buried her head in her blue tam and cried a good honest oldfashioned cry there chirk up poor little soul and dont you fret over a careless speech that meant nothing at all ive wished him in the red sea more than once but im blessed if i ever do it again come lets go over yonder where we caught the young owl dicky may have wanted to try that little game again so they went on calling listening then struggling on again more anxious every moment but not so thoroughly dazed as bell who had rocked her babybrother in his cradle and to whom he was the embodiment of every earthly grace if not of every heavenly virtue i might have known this would happen she said miserably he is so careless that if we ever find him again we must keep him tied to something take care of your steps dear said geoff and munch this cracker or you wont have strength enough to go on with me i wish it were not getting so dark the moment the sun gets behind these mountaintops the light seems to vanish in an instant dicky think of the poor darling out in this darkness hungry frightened and alone sighed bell its past his bedtime now oh why did we ever come to stay in this horrible place you must not blame the place dear we thought it the happiest in the world this morning here we are by the upper pool and the path stops which way had we better go ive been here before today said bell we might follow the trail i made but where is my string light a match geoff please what string what do you mean why i found a beautiful spot this morning and fearing i shouldnt remember the way again i took out my ball of twine and dropped a white line all the way back like ariadne but i dont see it where can it have disappeared unless jack or phil took it to tease me oh no ive been with them all day perhaps a snake has swallowed it come but a bright idea had popped into bells head i want to go that way geoff dear its as good as any other and there are flowers just the other side in an open sunny place perhaps he found them all right lets go ahead the trouble is i dont know which way to go here is the rock i remember it was a spotted one with tall ferns growing beside it now i went let me see this way and they both plunged into the thick brush bell bell this is utter nonsense cried geoff no child could crawl through this tangle dicky could crawl through anything in this universe if it was the wrong thing he isnt afraid of beast bird or fish and he positively enjoys getting scratched said bell meanwhile what had become of this small hero and what was he doing he was last seen in the hammock playing with the longsuffering terrier lubin who was making believe go to sleep it proved to be entirely a makebelieve for at the first loosening of dickys strangling hold upon his throat he tumbled out of the hammock and darted into the woods dicky followed but lubin was fleet of foot and it was a desperate and exciting race for full ten minutes at length as lubin heard his little masters gleeful laugh he realised that his anger was a thing of the past consequently he wheeled about and ran into dickys outstretched arms licking his face and hands exuberantly in the joy of complete forgiveness by this time the voice of conscience in dickys soul and it was a very very still small one on all occasions was entirely silenced he strayed into a sunny spot and picked flowers enough to trim his little sailor hat probably divining that this was what lost children in sundayschool books always did and it would be dishonourable not to keep up the superstition then he built a fine strong dam of stones across the brook wading to and fro without the bother of taking off his shoes and stockings and filled his hat with rocks and sunk it to the bottom for a wharf keeping his hatband to tie an unhappy frog to a bit of bark and setting him afloat as the captain of a slaveship when at length the struggling creature freed himself from his bonds and leaped into the pool dicky played that he was a drowning child and threw lubin into the water to rescue him in these merry antics the hours flew by unnoticed he had never been happier in his life and it flashed through his mind that if he were left entirely to himself he should always be good here ive been a whole day offul good by my lone self havent said one notty word or did one notty fing nor gotted scolded a singul wunst did i lubin i guess we better live here bettent we lubin and ven we wunt git stuck inter bed fur wettin our feets little teenty mites of wet evry singul night all the livelong days will we lubin but this was a long period of reflection for master dicky and he capered on farther and farther the water sozzling frightfully in his little coppertoed boots at length he sat down on a stone to rest himself and glancing aimlessly about his eyes fell on a white string which he grasped with alacrity pulling its end from beneath the stone on which he sat luby winship the anjulls gaved me this string fur ter make an offul splendid tight harness for you little luby and you can drag big heavy stones wont that be nice lubin looked doubtful and wagged his tail dissentingly as much as to say that his ideas of angel ministrations were a trifle different but there was no end to the string how very very curious dicky wound and wound and crept and crept along until he was thoroughly tired but thoroughly determined to see it through and lubin meanwhile had seized the first convenient moment after the mention of the harness to retire to the camp at length oh joy the tired and torn little man following carefully the leadingstring issued from the scratching bushes into a clean beautiful round place with a great restfullooking stump in the centre and round its base a small forest of snowy toadstools what could be a lovelier surprise dicky clapped his hands in glee as he looked at them and thought of a little verse of poetry which bell had taught him some fairy umbrellas came up today under the elmtree just over the way and as we have had a shower of rain the reason they came is made very plain tonight is the woodland fairies ball and drops from the elmtree might on them fall so little umbrellas wait for them here and under their shelter theyll dance without fear take care where you step nor crush them i pray for fear you will frighten the fairies away oh thought dicky in a trance of delight now i shall go to the fairies ball and see em dance under the cunning little teenty umberells and wunt they be mad at home when nobuddy cant see em but just only me and then if that potry is a big whopper like that there uvver one laddinlamp story of bells ill just pick evry white toadstool for my papas sunday dinner and she shant never see a singul fairy dance but he waited very patiently for a long long time that seemed like years for lubin had disappeared and all at once it grew so dark in this thicklywooded place that dickys courage oozed out in a single moment without any previous warnings as to its intention the toadstools looked like the ghosts of little pastandgone fairy umbrellas in the darkness and not a single fairy couple came to waltz under their snowy canopies or exchange a furtive kiss beneath their friendly shadows dicky thought the situation exceedingly gloomy and without knowing it followed the example of many older people who on being deserted by man experienced their first desire to find favour with god he was not in the least degree a saintly child but he felt instinctively that this was the proper time for prayer and not knowing anything appropriate to the occasion he repeated over and over again the timeworn plaint of childhood now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep if i should die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take amen like older mortals of feeble faith he looked for an immediate and practical answer in the shape perhaps of his mother with his little nightgown and bowl of bread and milk my sakes alive he grumbled between his sobs theyre the meanest fings i ever saw how long do they spose im goin to wait for em in this dark when the bears have et me up in teenty snips then theyll be saterfied i guess and wisht theyd tookened gooder care of me a little speck of a boy lefted out in this dark beary place all by his lone self o oo oo oh and he wound up with a murderous yell which had never failed before to bring the whole family to his side his former prayer seeming to be in vain he found a soft place brushed it as clean as possible and with difficulty bending his little stiff scratched body into a kneeling position he prayed his nightly postscript to now i lay me god bless papa n mamma n bell n jack n madge n polly n phil n geoff n elsie then realizing that he was in a perilous position and it behoved him to be as pious as possible he added and please bless pancho n hop yet n lubin n the goat not the wild goat up on the hill but my goat what got sick to his stummick when i painted him with black letters what a dreadful calamity to be sure if the wrong goat had been blessed by mistake his whole duty performed he picked the toadstools for his papas sunday dinner and leaning his head against the lone stump cried himself to sleep but relief was near though he little suspected it as he lay in the sound dreamless sleep which comes only to the truly good there was a crashing sound in the still darkness and bell plunged through the thick underbrush with a cry of delight he is here dear dear geoff he is all here i knew it i knew it hurrah no i mean thank god she said softly as she stooped down to kiss her mischievous little brother but what a looking creature exclaimed geoff as he stooped over the recovered treasure see bell his curls are glistening with pitch his dress is torn into ribbons and his hands ugh how dirty poor little darling he is thoroughly used up whispered bell wiping tears of joy from her brown eyes now ill run home like lightning to blow the horn and you carry dicky for he is too sleepy and stiff to walk and geoff here she laid an embarrassed hand on his shoulder im afraid hell be awfully cross but youll not mind it will you hes so wornout not i laughed geoff as he dropped a brotherly kiss on bells pale cheek but ive no idea of letting you go alone youre tired to death and youll miss the path i wish i could carry you both tired afraid cried bell with a ringing laugh while dicky woke with a stare and nestled on geoffreys shoulder as if nothing had happened why now that this weight is lifted off my heart i could see a path in an untravelled forest goodbye you dear darling cruel boy i must run for every moment is precious to mamma and with one strangling hug which made dickys ribs crack she dashed off oh how joyously how sweetly and tunefully the furious blast of the old cracked dinnerhorn fell on the anxious ears in that canyon it seemed clearer and more musical than a chime of silver bells in a trice the wandering couples had gathered jubilantly round the campfire all embracing bell who was the heroine of the hour entirely by chance and not though superior vision or courage as she confessed it was hardly fifteen minutes when geoff strode into the ring with his sorrylooking burden which he laid immediately in aunt truths lap oh my darling she cried embracing him fondly to think you are really not dead after all no he is about as alive as any chap i ever saw and while the happy parents caressed their restored darling geoff gathered the girls and boys around the dinnertable and repeated some of dickys remarks on the homeward trip it seems that he considered himself the injured party and with great ingenuity laid all the blame of the mishap on his elders nobuddy takes care of me anyhow he grumbled if my papa wasnt a mean fing id orter to have a black nurse with a white cap and apurn like billy thomas n then i couldnt git losted so offul easy an you all never cared a cent about it either or youd a founded me quicker n this n ive been hungry fur nineteen hours n i guess ive been gone till december by the feelin but you was too lazy to found me f i freezed to def n there aint but one singul boy of me round the whole camp n t would serveded you right if i had got losted for ever then i bet you wouldnt had much fun fourth of july thout my two bits n my firecrackers it was an hour or two before peace and quiet were restored to the camp the longdelayed dinner had to be eaten and to hop yets calm delight it was a very bad one dickys small wounds were dressed with sweet oil and after being fed and bathed he was tucked lovingly into bed with a hundred kisses or more from the whole party a little rest and attention had entirely restored his goodhumour and when dr paul went into the tent to see that all was safe for the night he found him sitting up in bed with a gleeful countenance prattling like a little angel we had an offul funny time bout my gittin losted didnt we mamma chuckled he with his gurgling little laugh next time im goin to get losted in annover brannew place where nobuddy can find me i fink it was the nicest time cept fourth of july dont you mamma and he patted his mothers cheek and imprinted an oily kiss thereon truth said the doctor with mild severity i know you dont believe in applying the slipper but i do think we should arrange some plan for giving that child an idea of the solemnity of life so far as i can judge he looks at it as one prolonged picnic my sentiments exactly cried bell energetically i cant stand many more of these trying scenes i am worn to a shadder dicky tucked his head under his mothers arm with a sigh of relief that there was one person at least whose sentiments were always favourable and always to be relied upon i love you the best of anybuddy mamma whispered he and fell asleep chapter iv rhyme and reason a budget of letters from the camp mailbag the letter of a friend is a likeness passing true our friend polly was seated in a secluded spot whence all but her had fled her grave demeanour her discarded sunbonnet her corrugated brow all bespoke more than common fixedness of purpose the cause of which will be discovered in what follows i from the countess paulina olivera to her friend and confidante the lady elsie howard scene a sequestered nook in the valley of the flowers camp chaparral july the countess is discovered at her ommerlu a writingtable a light zephyr b plays with her golden locks c and caresses her grecian d nose a nose that carries on its surface a few trifling freckles which serve but to call attention to its exquisite purity of outline and the height of its ambition her eyes reflect the changing shadows of moonlight and her mouth is one fit for sweet sounds e yet this only gives you a faint idea of the beauteous creature whose fortunes we shall follow in our next number f i have given that style a fair trial my dear darling but i cannot stand it another minute not being familiar with the language of what our cook used to call the fuddal aristocracy feudal you know i your faithful polly am seated in the cardroom writing with a dreadful pen which phil gave me yesterday its internal organs are filled with ink which it disgorges when pressed to do so but just now it is too full for utterance as you will see by the blots we have decided not to make this a real roundrobin letter like the last because we want to write what we like and not have it read by the person who comes next i have been badgered to death over my part of the communication sent to you last week for the young persons connected with this camp have a faculty of making mountains out of molehills as you know and i have to suffer for every careless little speech however as we didnt wish to bore you with six duplicate letters we invented a plan for keeping off each others ground and appointed geoff a committee of one to settle our line of march it is to be a collective letter made up of individual notes and these are geoffs sealed orders which must be obeyed on pain of dismissal from the camp no polly is to amuse no phil inform no geoff edify no madge gossip no bell versify no jack illustrate so my dear if you get any information or happen to be edified by what i write dont mention it for worlds i just screamed my fears about this matter to jack and he says i neednt fret i shall certainly slap that boy before the summer is over i could just tell you a lovely story about dickys getting lost in the woods the day before yesterday and our terrible fright about him and how we all joined in the boyhunt until geoff and bell found him at the lone stump but i suppose the chronicle belongs to phils province so i desist but what can i say suppose i tell you that uncle doc and the boys have been shooting innocent tame sheep skinning and cutting them up on the way home and making us believe for two days that we were eating venison and we never should have discovered the imposition had not dicky dragged home four sheepskins from the upper pool and told us that he saw the boys peeling them off a venison perhaps phil may call this information and margery will vow that it is gossip and belongs to her any way they consider it a splendid joke and chuckle themselves to sleep over it every night but i think the whole affair is perfectly maddening and it makes me boil with rage to be taken in so easily such a todo as they make over the matter you never saw you would think it was the first successful joke since the deluge that wasnt a dry joke was it ha ha this is the way they twang on their harp of a thousand strings at breakfast this morning when jack passed me the cornbread i said innocently why what have we here it is manna that fell in the night answered jack with an exasperating snicker you didnt know mutton but i thought being a sundayschool teacher you would know something about manna nb he alludes to that time i took the infant class for miss jones and they all ran out to see a military funeral procession i wish you knew something about manners snapped i and then aunt truth had to warn us both as usual oh dear its a weary world id just like to get jack at a disadvantage once next paragraph crossed out we climbed pico negro yesterday bell geoff phil and i had quite an experience in losing the trail i will tell you about it just as goodness me what have i written oh elsie pray excuse those horizontal evidences of my forgetfulness and disobedience i have bumped my head against the table three times as penance and will now try to turn my thoughts into right channels this letter is a blackandwhite evidence that i have not a frivolous order of mind and have always been misunderstood from my birth up to this date we have had beautiful weather since but no of course phil will tell you about the weather for that is scarcely an amusing topic i do want to be as prudent as possible for uncle doc is going to read all the letters not of course aloud and see whether we have fulfilled our specific obligations i just asked bell whether specific had a c or ans in the middle and she answered c of course with such an air you should have heard her i had to remind her of the time she spelled tophet with an f in the middle then she subsided i just read this last paragraph to madge to see if she called it gossip as i was going to take it out if it belonged to her topic but she said no she didnt call it gossip at all that she should call it slander you dont know how we all long to see you dear darling that you are we live in the hope of having you with us very soon and meanwhile the beautiful bedstead is almost finished and a perfect success i wish to withdraw the last three quarters of that sentence for obvious reasons dear dear geoffrey calls time up and ive scarcely said anything i should never never again will i submit to this method of correspondence it is absolutely petrifying to ones genius when i am once forced to walk in a path nothing but the whole outofdoors will satisfy me im very much afraid i havent amused you dear but when i lie in the green kirkyard with the mould upon my breast say not that she did well or ill only she did her best now do you think that will interfere with bell when its only a quotation any way its so appropriate that uncle doc will never have the heart to strike it out the trouble is that geoff thinks all the poetry in the universe is locked up in bells head and if she once allows it to escape felicia hemans and the rest will be too discouraged ever to try again i cant remember whether f h is alive or not and am afraid to ask but you will know that i dont mean to be disrespectful laura anne and scott burton were here for the play and laura is coming down again to spend the week i cant abide her and there will probably be trouble in the camp the flame of my genius blazes high just now but geoff has spoken and it must be snuffed so goodbye sizzzz and im out pollioliver ii from philip to elsie camp chaparral july my dear elsie i believe i am to inform you concerning the daily doings of our party not on any account however permitting myself to degenerate into gossip or frivolous amusement they evidently consider me a quiet stupid fellow who will fulfil such a task with no special feeling of repression and i dare say they are quite right they call me the solid man of the camp which may not be very high praise to be sure as geoffrey carries his head in the clouds and jack is well jack is jack so as the light of a tallow dip is valuable in the absence of sun and moon i am raised to a fictitious reputation we fellows have had very little play so far for the furnishing of the camp has proved an immense undertaking although we have plenty of the right sort of wood and excellent tools we think the work will pay however as dr paul has about decided to stay until october or until the first rain he writes two or three hours a day and thinks that he gets on with his book better here than at home as for the rest of us when we get fairly to rights we shall have regular study hours and lose no time in preparing for the examinations i suppose you know that you have a full bedroom set in process of construction i say suppose you know because it is a profound secret and the girls could never have kept it to themselves as long as this the loungingchair is my allotted portion and although it is a complicated bit of work i accepted it gladly feeling sure that you would use it oftener than any of the other pieces of furniture i shall make it so deliciously easy that you will make me knight of the chair and perhaps permit me to play a sort of devoted john brown to your victoria you will need one dull and prosy squire to arrange your pillows so that you can laugh at jacks jokes without weariness and doze quietly while geoff and uncle doc are talking medicine of course the most exciting event of the week was the mysterious disappearance and subsequent restoration of the heirapparent but i feel sure somebody else will describe the event because it is uppermost in all our minds bell for instance would dress it up in fine style she is no historian but in poetry and fiction none of us can touch her though by the way pollys abilities in that direction are a good deal underrated its as good as a play to get her after jack when he is in one of his teasing moods they are like flint and steel and if aunt truth didnt separate them the sparks would fly with a girl like polly you have either to lie awake nights thinking how youll get the better of her or else put on a demeanour of gentleness and patience which serves as a sort of lightningrod round which the fire of her fun will play all day and never strike polly is a good deal of a girl she seems at first to have a pretty sharp tongue but i tell you she has a heart in which there is swimmingroom for everybody this may not be information to you whom we look upon as our clairvoyant but it would be news to most people uncle doc bell geoff polly meg and i started for the top of pico negro the other morning bell rode villikins and polly took a mule because she thought the animal would be especially surefooted he was in fact he was so surefooted that he didnt care to move at all and we had to take turns in beating him up to the top we boys walked for exercise which we got to our hearts content it is only five or six miles from the old mountain mill a picture of which jack will send you and the ascent is pretty stiff climbing though nothing terrific we lost the trail once and floundered about in the chaparral for half an hour till bell began to make a poem on the occasion when we became desperate and dashed through a thicket of brush tearing ourselves to bits but stumbling on the trail at last the view from the top is simply superb the valleys below are all yellow with grainfields and green with vineyards with here and there the roofs of a straggling little settlement the depression in the side of the mountain you will observe it in the picture polly says has evidently been bitten out by a prehistoric animal and it turns out to be the loveliest little canyon imaginable we have had one novel experience that of seeing a tarantula fight and not between two but five tarantulas we were about twenty miles from camp loping along a stretch of hot dusty road jack got off to cinch his saddle and so we all stopped a moment to let our horses breathe as i was looking about at nothing in particular i noticed a black ball in the deep dust at the side of the road it suddenly rolled over on itself and i called to the boys to watch the fun we got off hitched our horses and approached cautiously for i had seen a battle of the same kind before there they were five huge hairy dirty black creatures as large as the palm of dickys hand all locked in deadly combat they writhed and struggled and embraced their long curling legs fastening on each other with a sound that was actually like the cracking of bones it takes a little courage to stand and watch such a proceeding for you feel as if the hideous fellows might turn and jump for you but they were doubtless absorbed in their own battle and we wanted to see the affair to the end so we took the risk if there was any at last they showed signs of weariness but we prodded them up with our ridingwhips preferring that they should kill each other rather than do the thing ourselves finally four of them lay in the dust doubled up and harmless slain i suppose by their own poison one the conquering hero remained and we dexterously scooped him into a tomatocan that jack had tied to his saddle for a drinkingcup covered him up with a handkerchief and drew lots as to who should carry him home to dr paul knowing that the little beasts were gregarious we hunted about for a nest which we might send to you after ousting its disagreeable occupant after much searching we found a group of them quite a tarantula village in fact their wonderful little houses are closed on the outside by a circular manywebbed mesh two or three inches across and this web betrays the spiders den to the person who knows the tricks of the trade directly underneath it you come upon the tiny circular trapdoor which you will notice in the nest we send with these letters you will see how wonderfully it is made with its silken weaving inside and its bits of bark and leaves outside and i know you will admire the hinge which the tarantula must have invented and which is as pretty a bit of workmanship as the most accomplished mechanic could turn out we tore away the web and the door from one of the nests and then poured water down the hole the spider was at home came out as fact as his clumsy legs would carry him and clutched the end of the stick jack held out to him then we tumbled him into the tomatocan just as he appeared to be making for us the two didnt agree at all one of them despatched the other on the way home the same hero who had killed the other four but on hearing his bloody record aunt truth refused to have him about the camp so we gave him an alcohol bath and you shall see his lordship when you come as dr paul says they have been known to clear fourteen feet at a jump perhaps you will feel happier to know that he is in alcohol though their bite is not necessarily fatal if it is rightly cared for the girls have been patronising the landscape by naming every peak valley grove and stream in the vicinity and as there is nobody to object the names may hold we carry about with us a collection of strong flat stakes which have various names painted on them in neat black letters jack likes that kind of work and spends most of his time at it for now that dr paul has bought a hundred acres up here we are all greatly interested in its improvement geoff has named the mountain pico negro as i told you and the little canyon on its side is called the giants yawn then we have mirror pool the lone stump field of the clothofgold cosy nook the imps washbowl duncecap hill the saints rest and il penseroso fall in honour of dicky who was nearly drowned there if anybody fails to call these localities by their proper names he has to pay a fine of five cents which goes towards beautifying the place dr paul has had to pay two fines for bell three for aunt truth and seven for dicky so he considers it an illjudged arrangement our encampment is supposed to be in the forest of arden and jack has begun nailing verses of poetry on the trees like a second orlando save that they are not lovepoems at all but appropriate quotations from wordsworth or bryant and this brings me to our thrilling rendition of the play as you like it last evening but it is deserving of more than the passing notice which i can give it here one thing however i must tell you as the girls will not write it of themselves that although bell carried off first honours and fairly captivated the actors as well as the audience all three of them looked bewitching and acted with the greatest spirit much better than we fellows did of course we didnt give the entire play and we had to double up on some of the characters in the most ridiculous fashion but the burtons helped out wonderfully scott playing oliver and laura doing audrey they were so delighted with the camp that aunt truth has invited them to come again on saturday and stay a week at the risk of being called conceited i will also state that we boys consider that the stage management was a triumph of inventive art we worked like beavers for two days and the results were marvellous if i do say so as shouldnt just consider we were six miles from a lemon as sydney smith would say and yet we transformed all out of doors first into an elegant interior and then into a conventional stage forest a great deal of work is available for other performances and so we do not regret it a bit we propose doing as you like it again when you are down here and meanwhile we give diversified entertainments which jack calls variety shows but which in reality are very chaste and elegant occasions the other night we had a minstrel show wearing masks of black cambric with red mouths painted on them you should have seen us all in a dusky semicircle seated on boards supported by nailkegs it was a scene better imagined than described this is certainly the ideal way to live in summertime and we should be perfectly happy and content if you could only shake off your troublesome cough and come to share our pleasure we feel incomplete without you and no matter how large our party may grow as the summer progresses there will always be a vacant niche that none can

elsie your weekly chronicle is almost ready for mondays stage and i am allowed to come in at the close with as many pages of gossip as i choose which means that i may run on to my hearts content and tell you all the little things that happen in the chinks between the great ones for uncle doc has refused to read this part of the letter first for some commissions aunt truth asks if your mother will kindly select goods and engage mrs perkins to make us each a couple of scotch gingham dresses she has our measures and we wish them simple fullskirted gowns like the last everybody thinks them so pretty and becoming bells two must be buff and pink pollys grey and green and mine blue and brown we find that we havent clothes enough for a three months stay and the outofdoor life is so hard upon our forest suits that we have asked mrs perkins to send us new ones as soon as possible we have had a very busy and exciting week since polly began this letter for there have been various interruptions and an unusual number of visitors first there was our mountain climb to the top of pico negro phil says he has written you about that but i hardly believe he mentioned that he and the other boys worried us sadly by hanging on to the tails of our horses as they climbed up the steepest places to be sure they were so awfully tired that i couldnt help pitying them but uncle doc had tried to persuade them not to walk so that it was their own fault after all you cannot imagine what a dreadful feeling it gives one to be climbing a slippery rocky path and know that a great heavy boy is pulling your horse backwards by the tail polly insisted that she heard her mules tail break loose from its moorings and on measuring it when she got back to camp she found it three inches longer than usual the mule acted like original sin all day and polly was so completely wornout that she went to bed at five oclock jack was a good deal the worse for wear too so that they got on beautifully all day it is queer that they irritate each other so for i am sure that there is no lack of real friendship between them but jack is a confirmed tease and he seems to keep all his mischief bottled up for especial use with polly i have tried to keep him out of trouble as you asked me and although it gives me plenty to do i am succeeding tolerably well except in his dealings with polly i lecture him continually but every time he opens his mouth he puts his foot in it polly was under a cloud the first of the week villikins was sick and dr winship sent her to aunt truth for a bottle of sweet oil aunt truth was not in sight so polly went to the box of stores and emptied a whole quart bottle of salad oil into a pail and villikins had to take it wheel or whoa jacks joke auntie went to make the salad dressing at dinnertime and discovered her loss and pollys mistake it was the last bottle and as we cant get any more for a week the situation was serious and she was very much tried poor polly had a good cry over her carelessness and came to the dinnertable in a very sensitive frame of mind then what should jack do but tell dicky to take villikins a head of lettuce for his supper and ask polly why she didnt change his name from villikins to saladin polly burst into tears and left the table while dr paul gave jack a scolding which i really think he deserved though it was a good joke the next morning the young gentleman put on a pair of old white cotton gloves and his best hat gathered her a bouquet of wild flowers and made her a handsome apology before the whole party so she forgave him and they are friends until the next quarrel on the night before the play laura and scott burton arrived on horseback and the next morning the rest of the family appeared on the scene we had sent over to see if laura would play audrey on so short notice and bring over some odds and ends for costumes we actually had an audience of sixteen persons and we had no idea of playing before anybody but aunt truth and dicky there were three of the burtons pancho hop yet the people from the dairy farm and a university professor from berkeley with eight students they were on a walking tour and were just camping for the night when scott and jack met them and invited them over to the performance geoffrey and phil were acquainted with three of them and uncle paul knew the professor laura anne and scott went home the next morning but came back in two days for their weeks visit the boys like scott very much he falls right into the camp ways and doesnt disturb the even current of our life and anne who is a sweet little girl of twelve has quite taken dicky under her wing much to our relief with lauras advent however a change came over the spirit of our dreams and to tell the truth we are not over and above pleased with it by the way she spent last summer at the hotel and you must have seen her did you not anyway mrs burton and aunt truth were old school friends and bell has known laura for two years but they will never follow in their mothers footsteps laura is so different from her mother that i should never think they were relations and she has managed to change all our arrangements in some mysterious way which we cant understand i get on very well with her she positively showers favours upon me and i more than half suspect it is because she thinks i dont amount to much as for the others she rubs polly the wrong way and i believe she is a little bit jealous of bell you see she is several months older than the rest of us and has spent two winters in san francisco where she went out a great deal to parties and theatres so that her ideas are entirely different from ours she wants every single bit of attention one boy to help her over the brooks one to cut walkingsticks for her another to peel her oranges and another to read spanish with her and so on now you know very well that she will never get all this so long as bell winship is in camp for the boys think that bell drags up the sun when shes ready for him in the morning and pushes him down at night when she happens to feel sleepy we who have known bell always cannot realise that any one can help loving her but there is something in laura which makes it impossible for her to see the right side of people she told me this morning that she thought bell had grown so vain and airy and selfconscious that it was painful to see her i could not help being hurt for you know what bell is brimful of nonsense and sparkle and bright speeches but just as open as the day and as warm as the sunshine if she could have been spoiled we should have turned her head long ago but she hasnt a bit of silly vanity and i never met any one before who didnt see the pretty charm of her brightness and goodness did you and yet somehow laura sticks needles into her every time she speaks she feels them too but it only makes her quiet for she is too proud and sensitive to resent it i can see that she is different in her ways as if she felt she was being criticised polly is quite the reverse if anybody hurts her feelings she makes creation scream and i admire her courage aunt truth doesnt know anything about all this for laura is a different girl when she is with her or dr paul not that she is deceitful but that she is honestly anxious for their good opinion you remember aunt truths hobby that we should never defend ourselves by attacking any one else and none of us would ever complain if we were hung drawn and quartered laura was miffed at having to play audrey but we didnt know that she could come until the last moment and we were going to leave that part out i dont believe you appreciate my generosity in taking this thankless part she said to bell when we were rehearsing nobody would ever catch you playing second fiddle my dear all leading parts reserved for miss winship by order of the authors i suppose indeed laura bell said if we had known you were coming we would have offered you the best part but i only took rosalind because i knew the lines and the girls insisted youve trained the girls well hasnt she geoffrey asked laura with a queer kind of laugh but i will leave the unpleasant subject i should not have spoken of it at all except that she has made me so uncomfortable today that it is fresh in my mind bell and polly and i have talked the matter all over and are going to try and make her like us whether she wants to or not we have agreed to be just as polite and generous as we possibly can and see if she wont come round for she is perfectly delighted with the camp and wants to stay a month polly says she is going to sing home sweet home to her every night and drop double doses of the homoeopathic cure for homesickness into her tea with a view of creating the disease goodbye and a hundred kisses from your loving margery daw v the camp poetess adds her store of mental riches to the general fund my darling i have a thousand things to tell you but i cannot possibly say them in rhyme merely because the committee insists upon it i send you herewith all the poetry which has been written in camp since last monday and it has been a very prosy week i have given them to papa and he says that the best of my own which are all bad enough is the following hammocksong i thought it out while i was swinging margery and here it is to fro dreamily slow under the trees swing swing drowsily sing the birds and the bees sleep rest slumber is best wakefulness sad rest sleep forget how to weep dream and be glad papa says it is all nonsense to say that slumber is best and wakefulness sad and that it is possible to tell the truth in poetry perhaps it is but why dont they do it oftener then and how was he to know that polly and jack had just gone through a terrible battle of words in which i was peacemaker and that dicky had been as naughty as nero all day these two circumstances made me look at the world through blue glasses and that is always the time one longs to write poetry i send you also geoffs verses written to mamma and slipped into the box when we were playing machine poetry i know a woman fair and calm whose shining tender eyes make when i meet their earnest gaze sweet thoughts within me rise and if all silver were her hair or faded were her face she would not look to me less fair nor lack a single grace and if i were a little child with childhoods timid trust i think my heart would fly to her and love because it must and if i were an earnest man with empty heart and life i think but i might change my mindshed be my chosen wife isnt that pretty oh elsie i hope i shall grow old as beautifully as mamma does so that people can write poetry to me if they feel like it here is jacks for pollys birthday he says he got the idea from a real poem which is just as silly as his a pollywog from a wayside brook is a goodly gift for thee but a milkwhite steed or a venison sheep will do very well for me for you a quivering asphodel two ducks and a good fat hen for me a withering hollyhock for seven and three are ten rosered locks and a pug for thee the falling dew is chill a dove a rope and a rose for me oh passionate paleblue pill for you a greenery yallery gown hath one tomb room for four dig me a narrow gravelet here oh red is the stain of gore i told jack i thought it extremely unhitched but he says thats the chief beauty of the imitation i give you also some verses intended for pollys birthday which we shall celebrate when the day arrives by a grand dinner you remember how we tease her about her love for tea which she cannot conceal but which she is ashamed of all the same well i have printed the poem on a card and on the other side margery has drawn the picture of a cross old maid surrounded by seven cats all frying to get a drink out of her teacup then geoff is going to get a live cat from the milk ranch near here and box it up for me to give to her when she receives her presents at the dinnertable wont it be fun owed to polly because of her birthday she camps among the untrodden ways forninst the mountain mill a maid whom there are few to praise and few to wish her ill she lives unknown and few could know what pauline is to me as dear a joy as are to her her frequent cups of tea a birthday this dear creature had full many a year ago she says she is but just fifteen of course she ought to know but still this gift i bring to her appropriate to her age regardless of her stifled scorn or well concealed rage she smiles upon these tender lines as you all plainly see but when she meets me all alone how different it will be now comes geoffs to be given with a pretty little inkstand there was a young maiden whose thought was so airy it couldnt be caught so what do you think we gave her some ink and captured her lightwinged thought here is jacks last on polly theres a pert little poppet called polly who frequently falls into folly shes a terrible tongue for a creetur so young but if she were dumb shed be jolly i helped polly with a reply and we delivered it five minutes later id rather be deaf master jack for if only one sense i must lack to be rid of your voice i should always rejoice nor mourn if it never came back and now goodnight and goodbye until i am allowed to write you my own particular kind of letter the girls and boys are singing round the campfire and i must go out and join them in one song before we go to bed yours with love now and always bell p s our happy hexagon has become a sort of obstreperous octagon laura and scott burton are staying with us scott is a good deal of a bookworm and uses very long words his favourite name for me at present is calliope i thought it was a sort of steamwhistle but margery thinks it was some one who was connected with poetry we dont dare ask the boys will you find out vi camp chaparral july studio raphael dear little sis the enclosed sketches speak for themselves or at least i hope they do keep them in your private portfolio and when i am famous you can produce them to show the public at what an early age my genius began to sprout at first i thought id make them real william henry pictures but concluded to give you a variety cant stop to write another line and if you missed your regular letter this week you must not growl for the sketches took an awful lot of time and im just rushed to death here anyway love to mother and father your loving brother jack ps polly says you need not expect to recognise that deer by his portrait should you ever meet him as no one could expect to get a striking likeness at a distance of a halfmile but honestly we have been closer than that to several deer chapter v the forest of arden good news from the east to western ind no jewel is like rosalind her worth being mounted on the wind through all the world bears rosalind all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind let no face be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind the grand performance of as you like it must have a more extended notice than it has yet received inasmuch as its double was never seen on any stage the reason of this somewhat ambitious selection lay in the fact that our young people had studied it in dr winships shakespeare class the preceding winter but they were actually dumb with astonishment when bell proposed it for the opening performance in the new theatre i tell you she argued there are not many pieces which would be effective when played out of doors by dim candlelight but this will be just as romantic and lovely as can be you see it can be played just as you like it philip and aunt truth wanted a matinee performance but the girls resisted this plan very strongly feeling that the garish light of day would be bad for the makeshift costumes and would be likely to rob them of what little courage they possessed we give the decoration of the theatre entirely into your hands boys polly had said on the day before the performance you have some of the hardest work done already and can just devote yourselves to the ornamental part but dont expect any more ideas from us for you will certainly be disappointed i should think not indeed cried bell energetically here we have the wall decorations for the first scene and all the costumes besides and the trouble is that three or four of them will have to be made tomorrow after laura comes with the trappings of war i hope she will get here for dinner tonight then we can decide on our finery and have a rough rehearsal well girls shouted jack from the theatre come and have one consultation and then well let you off phil wants to change the location altogether oh nonsense cried madge as the three girls ran towards the scene of action its the only suitable place within a mile of the camp i think it will be simply perfect when you have done a little more cutting said bell just see our advantages first we have that rising knoll opposite the stage which is exactly the thing for audience seats then we have a semicircular background of trees and a flat place for the stage which is perfectly invaluable last of all just gaze upon that madronotree in the centre and the oak on the left why they are worth a thousand dollars for scenery especially in the first scene ducal interior or whatever it is said phil disconsolately jingo that is a little embarrassing groaned jack not at all said polly briskly there is plenty of room to set the interior in front of those trees it can be all fixed beforehand and just whisked away for good at the end of the first act thats true said geoff thoughtfully but we cant have any adams cottage we talked it over last night and decided it couldnt be did did you indeed exclaimed bell sarcastically then allow me to remark that you three boys represent a very obtuse triangle thanks most acid rosalind murmured geoff meekly could you deign as spokesman of the very acute triangle to suggest something certainly there is the rear of the brush kitchen in plain sight to convey the idea of a rustic hut to be sure its a good distance to the left but let the audience screw round in their seats when they hear the voices and adam oliver and orlando can walk out carelessly and go through their scene right there admirable quoth geoff we bow to your superior judgment what an inspiration that was to bring those chinese lanterns for the fourth of july they have just saved us from utter ruin said margery who was quietly making leaftrimming yes the effect is going to be perfectly gorgeous exclaimed polly clasping her hands in anticipation how many have we ten oh thats splendid and how many candles as many as we care to use phil answered from the top of the ladder where he was at work and look at my arrangement for holding them to these trees arent they immense by the way said bell dont forget the mossy banks under those trees for stage seats and make me some kind of a thing on the left side to swoon on when i sniff orlandos gory handkerchief a couple of rocks suggested jack not exactly replied the critical rosalind with great dignity i am black and blue already from practising my faint and i expect to shriek with pain when i fall tomorrow night st jacobs oil relieves stiffened joints smooths the wrinkles from the brow of care soothes lacerated feelings and ushes the owl of hinfancy remarked geoffrey serenely as he prepared to build the required mossy banks my dear cousin there are times when i am glad it is only second cousin have you a secret contract to advertise a vulgar patent medicine or why this eloquence laughed bell and jack suggested polly you dont seem to be doing anything fix a stump for me to sit on while orlando and rosalind are making love all right countess id like to see you stumped once in my life shall we have the canvases brought for stage carpets we say no cried rosalind firmly we shall be a thousand times more awkward stumbling over stiff billows of carpet lets sweep the ground as clean and smooth as possible and let it go for all the scenes yes we shall then be well grounded in our parts remarked phil hiding his head behind a bunch of candles take care young man laughed polly or you may be run to earth instead or be requested by the audience to get up and dust cried the irrepressible jack whose wit was very apt to be of a slangy character now let us settle the interior or i shall go mad bell and i have it all settled said geoffrey promptly the background is to be made of three sheets hung over a line and the two sides will be formed of canvas carpets the walls will have japanese fans parasols and jupiter exclaimed jack who as knight of the brush felt compelled to be artistic imagine a ducal palace in the year so many hundred and something decorated with japanese bricabrac i blush for you now jack we might as well drop the whole play as begin to think of the nakkeronisms or whatever the word is i have got to wear an old white wrapper to the wrestlingmatch but i dont complain said polly just here bell ran back from the kitchen exclaiming i have secured pancho for charles the wrestler oh he was fearfully obstinate but when i told him he would only be on the stage two minutes and would not have to speak a word but just let geoff throw him he consented isnt that good did you decide about the decorations it will have to be just as we suggested answered margery fans parasols flowers and leaves with the madronowood furniture scattered about sheepskins etc a few venison rugs i presume you mean said geoffrey slyly say polly omit the cold cream for once will you you dont want to outshine everybody thank you she replied i will endeavour to take care of my own complexion if you will allow me as for yours you look more like othello than orlando come come girls said industrious margery let us go to the tent and sew it is nothing but nonsense here and we are not accomplishing anything so they wisely left the boys to themselves for the entire day and transformed their tent into a mammoth dressmaking establishment with clever aunt truth as chief designer the intervening hours had slipped quickly away and now the fatal moment had arrived and everything was ready for the play the wouldbe actresses were a trifle excited when the professor and his eight students were brought up and introduced by jack and scott burton and as if that were not enough who should drive up at the last moment but the family from the neighbouring milk ranch and beg to be allowed the pleasure of witnessing the performance mr sandford was the gentleman who had sold dr winship his land and so they were cordially invited to remain all the cushions and shawls belonging to the camp were arranged carefully on the knoll for audience seats it was a brilliant moonlight night and the stage assumed a very festive appearance with its four pounds of candles and twelve chinese lanterns meanwhile the actors were dressing in their respective tents bells first dress was a long pink muslin wrapper of mrs burtons which had been belted in and artistically pasted over with bouquets from the cretonne trunk covers in imitation of flowered satin under this she wore a short blue lawn skirt of her own catching up the pink muslin on the left side with a bouquet of wild roses and producing what she called a positively neilson effect her bright hair was tossed up into a fluffy knot on the top of her head and with a flat coronet of wild roses and another great bunch at her belt one might have gone far and not have found a prettier rosalind i declare you are just too lovely isnt she laura asked margery yes she looks quite well answered laura abstractedly being much occupied in making herself absurdly beautiful as audrey of course the dress fits horridly but perhaps it wont show in the dim light oh is it very bad sighed bell plaintively i cant see it in this glass well the next one fits better and i have to wear that the longest shall i do your hair laura no thanks margery has such a capital knack at hairdressing and she doesnt come on yet during this conversation polly was struggling with aunt truths trained white wrapper it was rather difficult to make it look like a court dress but she looked as fresh and radiant as a rose in it for the candlelight obliterated every freckle and one could see nothing but a pair of dancing eyes the pinkest of cheeks and a head running over with curls of ruddy gold now bell criticise me she cried taking a position in the middle of the tent and turning round like a wax figure i have torn out my hair by the roots to give it a done up look and have i succeeded and shall i wear any flowers with this lace surplice and what on earth shall i do with my hands theyre so black they will cast a gloom over the stage perhaps i can wrap my handkerchief carelessly round one and ill keep the other round your waist considerable tucked under your watteau pleat will i do do i should think so and bell eyed her with manifest approval your hair is very nice and your neck looks lovely with that lace handkerchief as for flowers why dont you wear a great mass of yellow and white daisies youll be as gorgeous as as a sunset by turner said laura with a glance at pollys auburn locks seems to me this is a mutual admiration society isnt it and she sank languidly into a chair to have her hair dressed yes it is cried polly boldly and its going to continner meg youre a darling in that blue print and pretty hat ill fill my fernbasket with flowers and you can take it as to have something in your hand to play with you look nicer than any phoebe i ever saw thats a fact and now hurrah were all ready and theres the boys bell so let us assemble out in the kitchen oh dear i believe im frightened in spite of every promise to the contrary when the young people saw each other for the first time in their stage costumes there was a good deal of merriment and some honest admiration geoff looked very odd without his eyeglasses and with the yellow wig that was the one property belonging to this star dramatic organisation the girls had not succeeded in producing a great effect with the masculine costumes because of insufficient material but the boys had determined not to wear their ordinary clothes no matter what happened so jack had donned one of hop yets blue blouses for his sylvius dress and had ready a plaid shawl to throw gracefully over one shoulder whenever he changed to the banished duke his sylvius attire was open to criticism but no one could fail to admire his appearance as the duke on account of a magnificent ducal headgear from which soared a bunch of tall peacock feathers oh jack what a headdress for a duke laughed margery no wonder they banished you did you offend the court hatter phil said that at all events nobody could mistake him for anything but a fool in his touchstone costume and so he was jester going to be contented scott burton was arranging panchos toilette for the wrestlingmatch and meanwhile trying to raise his drooping spirits and rosalind was vainly endeavouring to make adams beard of grey moss stay on while these antics were going on behind the scenes the audience was seated on the knoll making merry over the written programmes which had been a surprise of geoffs and read as follows the princess theatre july th appearance the greatest

went off with good effect and when celia and rosalind came through the trees in an affectionate attitude and celias blithe voice broke the stillness with i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry there was a hearty burst of applause which almost frightened them into silence at the end of the first act everybody was delighted the stagemanager carpenter sceneshifter costumier and all the stars were called successively before the curtain hop yet declared it was all the same good as china theatre and every one agreed to that criticism without a dissenting voice to be sure there was an utter absence of stagemanagement and all the traditions were remarkable for their absence but i fancy that the spirits of siddons and kemble macready and garrick looked down with kind approval upon these earnest young actors as they recited the matchless old words moving to and fro in the quaint setting of trees and moonlight with an orchestra of cooing doves and murmuring zephyrs the forest scenes were intended to be the features of the evening and in these the young people fairly surpassed themselves any one who had seen neilson in her doublet and hose of silvergrey modjeska in her shades of blue and ada cavendish in her lovely suit of green might have thought bells patchedup dress a sorry mixture yet these three brilliant stars in the theatrical firmament might have envied this little rosalind the dewy youth and freshness that so triumphed over all deficiencies of costume margerys campingdress of grey shortened to the knee served for its basis round the skirt and belt and sleeves were broad bands of laurelleaf trimming she wore a pair of margerys long grey stockings and lauras dainty bronze newport ties a soft grey chudda shawl of aunt truths was folded into a mantle to swing from the shoulder its fringes being caught up out of sight and a laurelleaf trimming added on her bright wavy hair was perched a cunning flat cap of leaves and as she entered with polly leaning on her manzanita staff and sighing oh jupiter how weary are my spirits one could not wish a lovelier stage picture and so the play went on with varying fortunes margery was frightened to death and persisted in taking touchstones speeches right out of his mouth much to his discomfiture adams beard refused to stay on so did the moustache of the banished duke and the clothes of sylvius but nothing could damp the dramatic fire of the players nor destroy the enthusiasm of the sympathetic audience dicky sat in the dresscircle wrapped in blankets and laughed himself nearly into convulsions over touchstones jokes and the stage business of the banished duke for it is unnecessary to state that jack was not strictly shakespearean in his treatment of the part as for polly she enjoyed being celia with all her might and declared her intention of going immediately on the regular stage but jack somewhat destroyed her hopes by affirming that her nose and hair wouldnt be just the thing on the metropolitan boards although they might pass muster in a backwoods theatre hello whats this exclaimed philip one morning a visitor yes no why its senor don manuel felipe hilario noriega coming up the canyon hes got a loaded team too i wonder if uncle doc is expecting anything the swarthy gentleman with the long name emerged from one cloud of dust and disappeared in another until he neared the gate where philip and polly were standing philip opened the gate and received a bow of thanks which would have made manuels reputation at a spanish court going up to camp si senor those things for us si senor what are they si senor exactly well are there any letters si senor whereupon he drew one from his gorgeouslydecorated leather belt philip reached for it and polly leaned over his shoulder devoured with curiosity its for aunt truth she said and yes i am sure it is mrs howards writing and if it is hereupon as manuel spoke no english and neither philip nor polly could make inquiries in spanish polly darted to the cart in her usual meteoric style put one foot on the hub of a wheel and climbed to the top like a squirrel snatched off a corner of the canvas cover and cried triumphantly i knew it elsie is coming heres a tent and some mattresses and pillows hurry help me down quick oh slowcoach keep out of the way and ill jump give me the letter i can run faster than you can and before the vestige of an idea had penetrated philips head nothing could be seen of polly but a pair of twinkling heels and the gleam of a curly head that caught every ray of the sun and turned it into ruddier gold it was a dusty rocky path and uphill at that but polly who was nothing if not ardent never slackened her pace but dashed along until she came in sight of the camp where she expended her last breath in one shrill shriek for aunt truth it was responded to promptly indeed it was the sort of shriek that always commands instantaneous attention and aunt truth came out of her tent prepared to receive tragic news bell followed and the entire family would have done the same had they been in camp polly thrust the letter into mrs winships hand and sank down exhausted exclaiming breathlessly theres a mattress and a tentcoming up the canyon its elsies i know philip is down at the gate with the cart but i came ahead phew but its warm what cried bell joyfully elsie at the gate it cant be true and she darted like an arrow through the trees come back come back screamed polly elsie is not at the gate don s d m f h n is there with a team loaded down with things isnt it from mrs howard aunt truth yes it is written this morning from tacitas rancho why how is this let me see tacitas rancho monday morning dear truth you will be surprised to receive a letter from me written from tacitas but here we are elsie and i and what is better we are on our way to you i knew it exclaimed the girls elsie has been growing steadily better for three weeks the fever seems to have disappeared entirely and the troublesome cough is so much lessened that she sleeps all night without waking the doctor says that the camplife will be the very best thing for her now and will probably complete her recovery oh joy joy cried the girls i need not say how gladly we followed this special prescription of our kind doctors nor add that we started at once oh aunt truth there is nobody within a mile of the camp cant i please cant i turn one little handspring just one little ladylike one pleaded polly dancing on one foot and chewing her sunbonnet string no dear you cant keep quiet and let me read elsie would not let me tell you our plans any sooner lest the old story of a sudden ill turn would keep us at home and i think very likely that she longed to give the dear boys and girls a surprise we arrived at the burtons yesterday elsie bore the journey exceedingly well but i would not take any risks and so we shall not drive over until day after tomorrow morning you neednt have hurried quite so fast polly dear i venture to send the tent and its belongings ahead today so that jack may get everything to rights before we arrive the mattress is just the size the girls ordered and of course ive told elsie nothing about the proposed furnishing of her tent i am bringing my little china boy with me for i happen to think that with the burtons we shall be fourteen at table gin is not quite a success as a cook but he can at least wash dishes wait at table and help hop yet in various ways while i shall be only too glad to share all your housekeeping cares if you have not escaped them even in the wilderness i shall be so glad to see you again and oh truth i am so happy so happy that please god i can keep my child after all the weary burden of dread is lifted off my heart and i feel young again just think of it my elsie will be well and strong once more it seems too good to be true always your attached friend janet howard mrs winships voice quivered as she read the last few words and polly and bell threw themselves into each others arms and cried for sheer gladness come come dears i suppose you will make grand preparations and there is no time to lose one of you must find somebody to help philip unload the team papa and the boys have gone fishing and laura and margery went with them i think and mrs winship bustled about literally on hospitable thoughts intent polly tied on her sunbonnet with determination turned up her sleeves as if washing were the thing to be done and placed her arms akimbo first and foremost said she her eyes sparkling with excitement first and foremost i am going to blow the horn certainly not said aunt truth are you crazy polly it is scarcely ten oclock and everybody would think it was dinnertime and come home at once no theyd think something had happened to dicky said bell and that would bring them in still sooner of course i forgot but cant i blow it earlier than usual cant i blow it at halfpast eleven instead of twelve we cant do a thing without the boys and they may not come home until midnight unless we do something desperate oh delight theres don s d m f h n and phil has found pancho to help unload isnt it lucky that we decided on the place for elsies tent and saved it in case she should ever come said bell now philip and pancho can set it up whenever they choose and isnt it fortunate that we three stayed at home today and refused to fish now we can plan everything and then all work together when they come back meanwhile polly was tugging at an immense bundle literally tooth and nail as she alternated trembling clutches of the fingers with frantic bites at the offending knot like many of her performances the physical strength expended was out of all proportion to the result produced and one stroke of philips knife accomplished more than all her illdirected effort at length the bundle of awning cloth stood revealed oh isnt it beautiful she cried it will be the very prettiest tent in camp cant i blow the horn look mamma exclaimed bell it is green and grey in those pretty broken stripes and the edge is cut in lovely scollops and bound with green braid wont it look pretty among the trees aunt truth came out to join the admiring group oooh screamed polly there comes a piece of the floor theyve sent it all made in three pieces what fun well have it all up and ready to sleep in before we blow the horn and heres a roll of straw matting said phil depositing a huge bundle on the ground near the girls ill cut the rope to save your teeth green and white plaid exclaimed bell well mrs howard did have her wits about her oh do let me blow the horn teased the irrepressible polly here are a lookingglass and a towelrack and a shaker rockingchair called philip guess theyre going to stay the rest of the summer yes of course they wouldnt want a lookingglass if they were only going to stay a month or two laughed bell dear aunt truth if you wont let me turn a single decorous little handspring or blow the horn or do anything nice will you let us use all that new white mosquitonetting bell says that it has been in the storehouse for two years and it would be just the thing for decorating elsies tent why of course you may have it polly and anything else that you can find there i hear dickys voice in the distance perhaps the girls are coming bell and polly darted through the swarm of tents and looked up the narrow path that led to the brook sure enough margery and laura were strolling towards home with little anne and dick dangling behind after the manner of children margery carried a small string of trout and dick the inevitable tin pail in which he always kept an unfortunate frog or two the girls had discovered that he was in the habit of crowding the cover tightly over the pail and keeping his victims shut up for twentyfour hours after which he said they were nice and tame so very tame as it transpired that they generally gave up the ghost in a few hours after their release margery had with difficulty persuaded him of his cruelty and the cover had been pierced with a certain number of airholes guess the loveliest thing that could possibly happen called bell at the top of her voice elsie has come answered margery in a second nobody knew why let me hug her this minute with those fish laughed polly no youll have to wait until day after tomorrow and then your guess will be right isnt it almost too good to be true and she is almost well added bell joyfully slipping her arm through margerys and squeezing it in sheer delight mrs howard says she is really and truly better oh if elsie howard in bed is the loveliest dearest thing in the world what will it be like to have her out of it and with us in all our good times has she always been ill since you knew her asked laura yes a terrible cold left her with weakness of the lungs and the doctors feared consumption but thought that she might possibly outgrow it entirely if she lived in a milder climate so mrs howard left home and everybody she cared for and brought elsie to santa barbara papa has taken an interest in her from the first and as far as we girls are concerned it was love at first sight you never knew anybody like elsie is she pretty pretty cried polly she is like an angel in a picturebook interesting interesting said bell in a tone that showed the word to be too feeble for the subject elsie is more interesting than all the other girls in the other world put together popular popular exclaimed margery taking her turn in the oral examination i dont know whether anybody can be popular who is always in bed but if its popular to be adored by every man woman child and animal that comes anywhere near her why then elsie is popular and is she a favourite with boys as well as girls favourite said bell why they think that she is simply perfect of course she has scarcely been able to sit up a week at a time for a year and naturally she has not seen many people but if you want a boys opinion just ask philip or geoffrey i assure you laura after you have known elsie a while and have seen the impression she makes upon everybody you will want to go to bed and see if you can do likewise it isnt just the going to bed remarked margery sagely and it isnt the prettiness either added polly though if you saw elsie asleep a flower in one hand the other under her cheek her hair straying over the pillow o for hair that would stray anywhere you would expect every moment to see a halo above her head i dont believe it is because she is good that everybody admires her so said laura i dont think goodness in itself is always so very interesting if elsie had freckles and a snub nose dont mind me murmured polly you would find that people would say less about her wonderful character there are things that puzzle me said polly thoughtfully it seems to me that if i could contrive to be ever so good nobody ever would look for a halo round my head now is it my turnedup nose and red hair that make me what i am or did what i am make my nose and hair what they are which well have to ask aunt truth said margery that is too difficult a thing for us to answer wasnt it nice i catched that big bullfrog margie cried dick his eyes shining with anticipation now ill have as many as seven or leven frogs and lots of horned toads when elsie comes and she can help me play with em when the girls reached the tents again the last article had been taken from the team and manuel had driven away the sound of phils hammer could be heard from the carpentershop and pancho was already laying the tent floor in a small open sunny place where the low boughs of a single sycamore hung so as to protect one of its corners leaving the rest to the full warmth of the sunshine that was to make elsie entirely well again i am tired to death sighed laura throwing herself down in a bamboo loungingchair such a tramp as we had and after all the boys insisted on going where dr winship wouldnt allow us to follow so that we had to stay behind and fish with the children i wish i had stayed at home and read the colonels daughter oh laura remonstrated margery think of that lovely pool with the forests of maidenhair growing all about it and poisonoak grumbled laura i know i walked into some of it and shall look like a perfect fright for a week i shall never make a country girl its no use for me to try its no use for you to try walking four miles in highheeled shoes my dear said polly bluntly they are not high retorted laura and if they are i dont care to look like a a cowboy even in the backwoods im an awful example sighed polly seating herself on a stump in front of the tent and elevating a very dusty little commonsense boot sir walter raleigh would never have allowed me to walk on his velvet cloak with that boot would he girls oh wasnt that romantic though and dont i wish that i had been queen elizabeth youve got the hair said laura thank you i had forgotten elizabeths hair was red so it was this is my court train snatching a tablecloth that bung on a hush near by and pinning it to her waist in the twinkling of an eye this my farthingale dangling her sunbonnet from her belt this my sceptre seizing a japanese umbrella this my crown inverting a bright tin plate upon her curly head she is just alighting from her chariot thus the courtiers turn pale thus why dont you do it what shall be done the royal feet must not be wet go round the puddle prit me lud ods body forsooth certainly not remove the puddle she says haughtily to her subjects they are just about to do so when out from behind a neighbouring chaparral bush stalks a beautiful young prince with coalblack hair and rosered cheeks he wears a rich velvet cloak glittering with embroidery he sees not her crown her hair outshines it he sees not her sceptre her tiny hand conceals it he sees naught save the loathly mud he strips off his cloak and floats it on the puddle with a haughty but gracious bend of her head the queen accepts the courtesy crosses the puddle thus waves her sceptre thus and saying you shall hear from me by return mail me lud she vanishes within the castle the next morning she makes sir walter british minister to florida he departs at once with a cargo of tobacco which he exchanges for sweet potatoes and everybody is happy ever after the girls were convulsed with mirth at this historical romance and as mrs winship wiped the tears of merriment from her eyes polly seized the golden opportunity and dropped on her knees beside her please aunt truth we cant get the white mosquitonetting because dr winship has the key of the storehouse in his pocket and so mayi blow the horn mrs winship gave her consent in despair and polly went to the oaktree where the horn hung and blew all the strength of her lungs into blast after blast for five minutes thats all i needed she said on returning that was an escapevalve and i shall be ladylike and wellbehaved the rest of the day chapter vi queen elsie visits the court an hour and friend with friend will meet lip cling to lip and hand clasp hand now laura asked bell when quiet was restored advise us about elsies tent we want it to be perfectly lovely and you have such good taste let me think said laura oh if she were only a brunette instead of a blonde we could festoon the tent with that yellow tarlatan i brought for the play what difference does it make whether she is dark or light asked bell obtusely why a room ought to be as becoming as a dress so mrs pinkerton says you know i saw a great deal of her at the hotel and oh girls her bedroom was the most exquisite thing you ever saw she had a french toilettable covered with pale blue silk and white marquise lace perfectly lovely with yards and yards of robinsegg blue watered ribbon in bows and on it she kept all her toilet articles everything in hammered silver from tiffanys with monograms on the back three or four sizes of brushes and combs and mirrors and a full manicure set it used to take her two hours to dress but it was worth it oh such gorgeous teagowns as she had one of old rose and lettuce was a perfect dream she always had her breakfast in bed you know i think its delightful to have your breakfast before you get up and dress as slowly as you like i wish mamma would let me do it what does she do after she gets dressed in her rows of old lettuce i mean her old rows of lettuce asked polly do why really polly you are too stupid what do you suppose she did what everybody else does of course oh said polly apologetically how old is mrs pinkerton asked margery between nineteen and twenty there is not three years difference in our ages though she has been married nearly two years it seems so funny only nineteen cried bell why i always thought that she was old as the hills twentyfive or thirty at the very least she always seemed tired of things well said laura in a whisper intended to be too low to reach mrs winships tent i dont know whether i ought to repeat what was told me in confidence but the fact is well she doesnt like mr pinkerton very well the other girls who had not enjoyed the advantages of city life and travel looked as dazed as any scandalmonger could have desired dont like him gasped polly nearly falling off the stump why shes married to him where on earth were you brought up snapped laura what difference does that make she cant help it if she doesnt happen to like her husband can she you cant make yourself like anybody can you well did she ever like him asked margery for shes only been married a year or two and it seems to me it might have lasted that long if there was anything to begin on but whispered laura mysteriously you see mr pinkerton was very rich and the dentons very poor mr denton had just died leaving them nothing at all to live on and poor jessie would have had to teach school or some dreadful thing like that the thought of it almost killed her she is so sensitive and so refined she never told me so in so many words but i am sure she married mr pinkerton to save her mother from poverty and i pity her from the bottom of my heart i suppose it was noble said bell in a puzzled tone if she couldnt think of any other way but well did she try very hard to think of other ways asked polly she never looked especially noble to me i thought she seemed like a dieaway frizzlygig kind of a girl i wish miss oliver that you would be kind enough to remember that mrs pinkerton is one of my most intimate friends said laura sharply and i do wish also that you wouldnt talk loud enough to be heard all through the canyon the colour came into pollys cheeks but before she could answer mrs winship walked in stockingbasket in hand and seated herself in the little wicker rockingchair pollys clarion tones had given her a clue to the subject and she thought the discussion needed guidance you were talking about mrs pinkerton girls she said serenely you say you are fond of her laura dear and it seems very ungracious for me to criticise your friend that is a thing which most of us fail to bear patiently but i cannot let you hold her up as an ideal to be worshipped or ask the girls to admire as a piece of selfdenial what i fear was nothing but indolence and selfgratification you are too young to talk of these things very much but you are not too young to make up your mind that when you agree to live all your life long with a person you must have some other feeling than a determination not to teach school jessie dentons mother my dear laura would never have asked the sacrifice of her daughters whole life and jessie herself would never have made it had she been less vain proud and luxurious in her tastes and a little braver more selfforgetting and industrious these are hard words dear and i am sorry to use them she has gained the riches she wanted the carriages and servants and teagowns and hammered silver from tiffanys but she looks tired and disappointed as bell says and ive no doubt she is poor girl i dont think you do her justice mrs winship i dont indeed said laura if you are really attached to her laura dont make the mistake of admiring her faults of character but try to find her better qualities and help her to develop them it is a fatal thing when girls of your age set up these false standards and order their lives by them there are worse things than schoolteaching yes or even floorscrubbing or windowwashing lovely teagowns and silverbacked brushes are all very pretty and nice to have if they are not gained at the sacrifice of something better i should have said to my daughter had i been mrs denton we will work for each other my darling and try to do whatever god gives us to do but no matter how hard life is your heart is the most precious thing in the world and you must never sell that if we part with everything else oh my girls my girls if i could only make you believe that poor and content is rich and rich enough i cannot bear to think of your growing year by year into the conviction that these pretty glittering things of wealth are the true gold of life which everybody seeks forgive me laura if i have hurt your feelings i know you would never hurt anybodys feelings if you could help it mrs winship laura answered with a hint of coldness in her voice though i cant help thinking that you are a little hard on poor jessie but even then one can surely like a person without wishing to do the very same things she does yes that is true said mrs winship gravely but one cannot constantly justify a wrong action in another without having ones own standard unconsciously lowered what we continually excuse in other people we should be inclined by and by to excuse in ourselves let us choose our friends as wisely as possible and love them dearly helping them to grow worthier of our love at the same time we are trying to grow worthier of theirs because we live by admiration hope and love you know but not by admiring and loving the wrong things but there is the horn and i hear the boys let us come to luncheon and tell our good news of elsie music follows with incredible energy the horn the horn the lusty lusty horn tis not a thing to laugh to scorn a thing to laugh to scorn long before the boys appeared in sight their voices rang through the canyon in a chorus that woke the echoes and presently they came into view bearing two quarters and a saddle of freshly killed mutton hanging from a leafy branch swung between jacks sturdy shoulder and geoffs a splendid still hunt this morning aunt truth exclaimed jack game plenty and not too shy dogs in prime condition hunters ditto behold the result the girls could scarcely tell whether or no laura was offended at aunt truths unexpected little lecture she did not appear quite as unrestrained as usual but as everybody was engaged in the preparations for elsies welcome there was a general atmosphere of hilarity and confusion so that no awkwardness was possible the toolshop resounded with blows of hammer and steel dicky was under everybodys feet and his seven or ten frogs together with his unrivalled collection of horned toads were continually escaping from their tin pails and boxes in the various tents and everybody was obliged to join in the search to recover and reincarcerate them in order to keep the peace hop yet was making a gold and silver cake with elsie in pink letters on chocolate frosting philip had pitched the new tent so that in one corner there was a slender manzanitatree which had been cropped for some purpose or other he had nailed a crosspiece on this so that it resembled the letter t and was now laboriously boring holes and fitting in pegs that elsie might have a sort of closet behind her bed as for the rustic furniture the girls and boys declared it to be too beautiful for words they stood in circles about it and admired it without reserve each claiming that his own special piece of work was the gem of the collection the sunlight shining through the grey and green tints of the tent was voted perfection philips closet a miracle of ingenuity the green and white straw matting an inspiration the lookingglass had been mounted on a packingbox and converted by laura into a dressingtable that rivalled mrs pinkertons for green tarlatan and white mosquitonetting had been so skilfully combined that the traditional mermaid might have been glad to make her toilet there with a comb and a glass in her hand the rest of the green and white gauzy stuff had been looped from the corners of the tent to the centre of the roofpiece and delicate tendrils of wild clematis climbed here and there as if it were growing its roots plunged in cunningly hidden bottles of water bell had gone about with pieces of awning cloth and green braid and stitched an elaborate system of pockets on the inside of the tent wherever they would not be too prominent there were tiny pockets for needlework thimbles and scissors mediumsized pockets for soap and combs and brushes bigger pockets for shoes and slippers and stockings and mammoth pockets for anything else that elsie might ordain to put in a pocket by four oclock in the afternoon margery had used her clever fingers to such purpose that a white silesia flag worked with the camp name floated from the tip top of the front entrance to the tent the ceremony of raising the flag was attended with much enthusiasm and its accomplishment greeted by a deafening cheer from the entire party unless one wants paradise sighed margery who wouldnt be contented with dear camp chaparral who would live in a house any way exclaimed philip sniff this air and look up at that sky and this is what they call roughing it in santa barbara quoth dr winship why you youngsters have made that tent fit for the occupancy of a society belle now lets organise for reception cried geoffrey assemble good people come over here aunt truth i will take the chair myself since i dont happen to see anybody who would fill it with more dignity i am going to mount my broncho and go out on the road to meet my beloved family said jack sauntering up to the impromptu councilchamber how can you tell when they will arrive asked mrs winship i can make a pretty good guess theyll probably start from tacitas as early as eight or nine oclock if elsie is well lets see its about twentyfive miles isnt it uncle doc say twentythree to the place where they turn off the main road well ill take a bit of lunch ride out ten or twelve miles hitch my horse in the shade and wait very well said geoffrey it is not usual for committees to appoint themselves but as you are a near relative of our distinguished guests we will grant you special consideration and order you to the front ladies and gentlemen passing over the slight informality of the nomination all in favour of appointing mr john howard envoy extraordinary please manifest it by the usual sign six persons yelled ay four raised the right hand and one stood up there seems to be a slight difference of opinion as to the usual sign all right contrary minded no shouted polly at the top of her lungs it is a unanimous vote said geoffrey crushingly bringing down his fist as an imaginary gavel with incredible force and dignity dr and mrs winship will you oblige the chair by acting as a special reception committee certainly responded the doctor smilingly will the chair kindly outline the general policy of the committee hmmm yes certainly of course the chair suggests that the reception committee well that they stay at home and receive the guests yes that will do very nicely allinfavourandsoforthitisavoteandsoordered secretary will please spread a copy on the minutes gavel i rise to a point of order said jack sagely there is no secretary and there are no minutes mere form said the chair sit down there will be minutes in a minute got to do some more things first that will do sit down will the misses burton and messrs burton and noble kindly act as committee on decoration wheres the committee on music and refreshments and olympian games and all that sort of thing interrupted polly who had not the slightest conception of parliamentary etiquette and why dont you hurry up and put me on something if miss oliver refuses to bridle her tongue and persists in interrupting the business of the meeting the chair will be obliged to remove her said geoffrey with chilling emphasis polly rose again undaunted i would respectfully ask the chair who put him in the chair any way question roared philip second the motion shrieked bell that being the only parliamentary expression she knew order cried geoffrey in stentorian accents i will adjourn the meeting and clear the courtroom unless there is order do remarked polly encouragingly i will rise again like phoebus from my ashes to say that here jack sprang to his feet i would suggest to the chair that the last speaker amend her motion by substituting the word phoenix for phoebus accept the amendment said polly serenely amidst the general hilarity question called bell with another mighty projection of memory into a missionary meeting that she had once attended i am not aware that there is any motion before the house said geoffrey cuttingly second the motion second the amendment shouted the girls ladies there is no motion will you oblige the chair by remaining quiet until speech is requested move that the meeting be adjourned and another one called with a new chair remarked margery who felt that the honour of her sex was at stake move that this motion be so ordered and spread upon the minutes and a copy of it be presented to the chairman suggested philip move that the copy be appropriately bound in calf said jack dodging an imaginary blow move that the other committees be elected by ballot concluded scott burton this is simply disgraceful exclaimed the chair order order i appoint miss oliver committee on entertainment with a view of keeping her still this was received with particular as well as general satisfaction miss winship we appoint you committee on music all right do you wish it to be original certainly not we wish it to be good but we only know one chorus and thats my witching dinah snow never mind either write new words to that tune or sing tralala to it mr richard winship the chair appoints you committee on menagerie and suggests that as we have proclaimed a legal holiday you give your animals the freedom of the city dont know what freedom of er city means said dicky who feared that he was being made the butt of ridicule why we want you to allow the captives to parade in the evening with torchlights and mottoes all right cried dicky kindling in an instant n luby n the doat n my horn toads all ecept the one that just gotted away in lauras bed but may be shell find him tonight so theyll be all there this was too much for the various committees and lauras wild shriek was the signal for a hasty adjournment a common danger restored peace to the assembly and they sought the runaway in perfect harmony well said jack when quiet was restored i am going a little distance up the pico negro trail there are some magnificent spanish bayonets growing there and if youll let me have pancho uncle doc we can bring down four of them and lash them to each of the corners of elsies tent theyll keep fresh several days in water you know take him certainly said dr winship do let me go with you pleaded laura with enthusiasm i should like the walk so much its pretty rough laura objected margery if you couldnt endure our walk this morning you would never get home alive from pico negro oh that was in the heat of the day she answered i feel equal to any amount of walking now if jack doesnt mind taking me delighted of course miss laura youll be willing to carry home one of the trees i suppose in return for the pleasure of my society snub him severely laura cried bell we never allow him to say such things unreproved i think he is snubbed too much already replied laura with a charming smile and i shall see how a course of encouragement will affect his behaviour that will be what i long have sought and mourned because i found it not sang jack nonchalantly oh laura remonstrated bell think twice before you encourage him in his dreadful ways we have studied him very carefully and we know that the only way to live with him is to keep him in a sort of pint pot where we can hold the lid open just a little and clap it down suddenly whenever he tries to spring out do not mind that young person miss laura but form your own impressions of my charming character excuse me please while i put on a celluloid collar and make some few changes in my toilet necessary to a proper appearance in your distinguished company i prefer you as you are answered laura laughingly let us start at once do you hear that young person she prefers me as i are now see what magic power her generosity has upon me and he darted into the tent from which he issued in a moment with his derby hat a manzanita cane a pockethandkerchief tied about his throat and a flower pinned on his flannel campingshirt a most ridiculous figure since nothing seems so out of place in the woods as any suggestion of city costumes or customs laura was in high goodhumour and looked exceedingly brilliant and pretty as she always did when she was the central figure of any group or the bright particular star of any occasion be home before dark said dr winship pancho keep a lookout for the packmule truth one of the packmules has disappeared so dumpling or ditto ditto curiously enough his name should have led him not to set an example but to follow one elsie came perhaps you thought that this was going to be an exciting story and that something would happen to keep her at the tacitas ranch but nothing did everything came to pass exactly as it was arranged and jack met his mother and sister at twelve oclock some four miles from the camp and escorted them to the gates welcome had been painted on twenty different boards or bits of white cloth and paper and nailed here and there on the trees that lined the rough woodroad the strains of an orchestra formed of a guitar banjo castanets chinese fiddle and tin cans greeted them from a distance but were properly allowed to die away in silence when the guest neared the tents everything wore a new and smiling face and elsie never came more dangerously near being squeezed to death elsie in the prettiest of gingham dresses and her cloud of golden hair braided in two funny little pugs to keep it out of the dust elsie with a wide hat that shaded her face already a little tanned and burned no longer colourless elsie with no lines of pain in her pretty forehead and the hollow ring gone from her voice elsie who jumped over the wheel of the wagon and hugged her huggers with the strength of a young bear it was too good to believe and nobody did quite believe it for days at three oclock the happiest party in the world assembled at the rough diningtable under the sycamoretrees elsie beamed upon the feast from the highbacked manzanita chair a faint colour in her cheeks and starry prisms of light in a pair of eyes that had not sparkled for many a weary month hop yet smiled a trifle himself wore his cap with a red button on the top to wait upon the table and ministered to the hungry people with more interest and alacrity than he had shown since he had been dragged from santa barbara his joss and his nightly game of fantan and such a dinner as he had prepared in honour of the occasion longer by four courses than usual and each person was allowed two plates in the course of the meal bill of fare for her majestys dinner quail soup crackers chili colorado mutton stew in spanish style with chili peppers tomatoes and onions cold boiled ham fried potatoes apples and onions stewed together gingersnaps pickles peaches apricots and nectarines california nuts and raisins coffee and last of all a surprise of bells flapjacks long teased for by the boys and prepared and fried by her own hands while the merry party waited at table to get them smoking hot she came in flushed with heat and pride the prettiest cook anybody ever saw with her hair bobbed up out of the way and doing its best to escape a highnecked white apron sleeves rolled up to the elbow and an insinuating spot of batter in the dimple of her left cheek there she cried joyfully as she deposited a heaping plate in front of her mother and set the tin can of maple syrup by its side begin on those and ill fry like lightning on two griddles to keep up with you and she rushed to the brush kitchen to turn her next instalments that had been left to brown hop yet had retired to a distant spot by the brook and was washing dishtowels all chinese cooks are alike in their horror of a woman in the kitchen but some of them will unbend so far as to allow her to amuse herself so long as they are not required to witness the disagreeable spectacle bell delicately inserted the caketurner under the curled edges of the flapjacks and turned them over deftly using a little too much force perhaps in the downward stroke when she flung them back on the griddle seems to me they come down with considerable of a thud she said reflectively i hope theyre not tough for i should never hear the last of it guess ill punch one with the handle of this tin shovel and see how it acts goodness its sort of elastic thats funny well perhaps its the way they ought to look here she transferred the smoking mysteries to her plate passed a bit of pork over the griddles and after ladling out eight more flew off to the group at the table are they good she was beginning to ask when the words were frozen on her lips by the sight of a significant tableau the four boys were standing on the bench that served instead of diningchairs each with a plate and a pancake on the table in front of them jack held a hammer and spike scott burton a hatchet geoffrey a saw and philip a rifle bell was nothing if not intuitive no elaborate explanations ever were needed to show her a fact without a word she flung the plate of flapjacks she held as far into a thicket as she had force to fling it and then dropped on her knees shoot if you must this old grey head but spare my flapjacks sirs she said whats the matter with them tough i refuse to believe it your tools are too dull thats all use more energy nothing in this world can be accomplished without effort theyre a lovely brown began mrs winship sympathetically and they have a very good flavour added elsie dont touch them dearest cried bell snatching the plate from under elsies very nose i wont have you made ill by my failures but as for the boys i dont care a fig for them let them make flapjacks more to their taste the odious things polly oliver did you put in that baking powder as i told you while i went for the pork polly blanched baking powder she faltered yes baking powder baking powder do i make myself plain oh baking powder to be sure well now that you mention the matter i do remember that dicky called me away just as i was getting it and now that i think of it elsie came just afterwards and and and thats the whole of my story o sang jack i recommend the criminal to the mercy of the court a case of too many cooks laughed dr winship cheer up girls better fortune next time there are eight more of them burning on the griddles this moment polly said bell scathingly and as they are yours not mine i advise you to throw them in the brook with the rest of the batter so that hop yet wont know that there has been a failure some people blight everything they touch sighed polly gloomily as she departed for the kitchen but when i lie in the green kirkyard oh polly dear interrupted margery that apology will not serve any longer youve used it too often this is going to be entirely different continued polly tragically but when i lie in the green kirkyard with the mould upon my breasts say not that she made flapjacks well only she did her best we promise cried bell chapter vii pollys birthday first half in which she rejoices at the mere fact of her existence o frabjous day calooh callay he chortled in his joy pollys birthday dawned auspiciously at six oclock she was kissed out of a sound sleep by bell and margery and the three girls slipped on their wrappers and prepared to run through the trees for a morning plunge in mirror pool although it was august there was still water enough in minnehaha brook to give one a refreshing dip mirror pool was a quarter of a mile distant and well guarded with rocks and deep hidden in trees but a little pathway had been made to the waters edge and thus the girls had easy access to what they called the mermaids bath a baytree was adorned with a little redwood sign which bore a picture of a mermaid drawn by margery and below the name these lines in rustic letters a hidden brook that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune laura had not lived long enough in the woods to enjoy these cold plunges and as her ideal was a marble tub with scented water and a french maid to apply the same with a velvet sponge it is not much wonder she insisted that though it was doubtless a very romantic proceeding the bottom and sides of the natural tub were quite too rocky and rough for her taste and that she should be in constant terror of snakes curling round her toes ive a great mind to wake laura just for once said bell opening the tent door there never was such a morning i believe ive said that regularly every day but i simply never can get used to it there must have been a wonderful sunrise dears for the glow hasnt faded yet not a bit of morning fog thats good for elsie and what a lovely day for a birthday did they use to give you anything like this in vermont polly hardly said polly peering over bells shoulder lets see what did they give us in vermont this month why i cant think of anything but dogdays hot nights and hay fever but that sounds ungrateful why geoffs up already theres elsies bunch of vines and twigs and pretty things hanging on her tentdoor hes been off on horseback just my luck to have him get up first jack always does you know and last night i sewed up the tentopening with carpetthread good and tight overhand stitches i wouldnt be ashamed of at a sewingschool oh you naughty girl laughed bell the boys could rip it open with a knife in half the time it took you to sew it certainly i didnt mean to keep them sewed up all day but i thought id like jack to remember me the first thing this morning girls whispered margery excitedly dont stand there mooning or sunning for ever i thought there was a gopher in this tent last night i heard something scratching and i thought it was the dog outside but just look at these two holes almost under lauras pillow lets fill them up cover them over anything gasped bell laura will never sleep here another night if she sees them nobody insured laura against gophers said polly she must take the fortunes of war i wouldnt wake her said margery she didnt sleep well and her face is flushed come or we shall be late for breakfast when they returned fresh and rosy from their bath there was a stir of life in all the tents pancho had come from the stagestation with mail an odour of breakfast issued from the kitchen where hop yet was humming a fragment of chinese song that ran something like this not loud but unearthly enough as bell used to say to spoil almost any cooking music follows fong fong mongmong tiu he sun yiu sow chong how kiu me yun tantar che ku choi song dicky was abroad radiant in a new suit of clothes and elsie pushed her golden head out between the curtains and proclaimed herself strong enough for a wrestlingmatch with any boy or man about the camp but they found laura sitting on the edge of her straw bed directly over the concealed gopherholes a mirror in her hand and an expression of abject misery on her countenance whats the matter cried the girls in one breath but they needed no answer as she turned her face towards the light for it was plainly a case of poisonoak one eye almost closed and the cheek scarlet and swollen where do you suppose you got it asked bell oh i dont know its everywhere so i dont see how i ever hoped to escape it yet ive worn gloves every minute i think i must have touched it when i went up the mountain trail with jack im a perfect fright already and i suppose it has only begun is it very painful asked polly sympathetically oh you do look so funny i can hardly help laughing but im as sorry as i can be i should expect you to laugh you generally do retorted laura no its not painful yet but i dont care about that its looking so ridiculous i wonder if dr winship could send me home i wish now that i had gone with scott for i cant be penned up in this tent a week oh it wont hurt you to go out said bell and you can lie in the sittingroom just wait and let mamma try and cure you shes a famous doctor and bell finished dressing hurriedly and went to her mothers tent while polly and margery smoothed the bed with a furtive kick of straw over the offending gopherholes and hung a dark shawl so as to shield lauras eyes aunt truth entered speedily with a family medical guide under one arm and a box of remedies under the other the doctor has told me just what to do and he will see you after breakfast himself it doesnt look so very bad a case dear dont run about in the sun for a day or two and well bring you out all right the doctor has had us all under treatment at some time or other because of that troublesome little plant i dont want to get up to breakfast moaned laura just as you like but it is pollys birthday you know many happy returns my sweet pollykins and there are great preparations going on i cant help it mrs winship the boys would make fun of my looks and i shouldnt blame them appear as the veiled lady suggested margery as mrs winship went out i wont come and thats the end of it said laura perhaps if i bathe my face all the morning i can come to dinner after breakfast was cleared away hop yet and mrs howards little china boy gin were given a halfholiday and allowed to go to a neighbouring ranch to see a flend of hop yets for it was a part of the birthday scheme that bell and geoffrey should cook the festival dinner jack was so delighted at the failure of pollys scheme to sew him in his tent that he simply radiated amiability and spent the whole morning helping elsie and margery with a set of elaborate dinnercards executed on halfsheets of notepaper the dinner itself was a grand success half of the cards bore a caricature of polly in the shape of a parrot with the inscription polly want a cracker the rest were adorned with pretty sketches of her in her campingdress a kettle in one hand and underneath polly put the kettle on well all have tea this was the bill of fare arranged by bell and geoffrey and written on the reverse side of the dinnercards dinner a la mother goose camp chaparral august come with a whoop come with a call come with a good will or not at all victuals and drink bean soup she gave them some broth she gave them some bread salt codfish you shall have a fishy in a little dishy roast mutton a la venison dear sensibility o la i heard a little lamb cry baa potatoes in jackets the butcher the baker the candlestickmaker all jumped out of a roasted potato stewed beans you nor i nor nobody knows where oats peas beans and barley grows chicken and beef sandwiches hickety pickety my pretty hen laid good eggs for gentlemen taffy was a welshman taffy was a thief taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef lemon pie a pie sat on a peartree plum tarts the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summers day fruit nuts and raisins you shall have an apple you shall have a plum i had a little nuttree nothing would it bear but a silver nutmeg and a golden pear bread and cheese when i was a bachelor i lived by myself and all the bread and cheese i got i put upon the shelf coffee and lemonade one two three how good you be i love coffee and billy loves tea oranges and lemons says the bell of st clemens what they ate i cant tell but tis known very well that none of the party grew fat bell and geoff took turns at dishing up in the kitchen and sat down at the table between whiles and they barely escaped being mobbed when they omitted one or two dishes on the programme and confessed that they had been put on principally for the style of the thing a very poor excuse to a company of people who have made up their mouths for all the delicacies of the season jack was head waiter and having donned a clean white blouse of hop yets and his best cap with the red button from which dangled a hastily improvised queue of black worsted he proceeded to convulse everybody with his mongolian antics these consisted of most informal remarks in clever pigeon english and snatches of chinese melody rendered from time to time as he carried dishes into the kitchen elsie laughed until she cried and laura sat in the shadiest corner her head artistically swathed in white tarlatan polly occupied the seat of honour at the end of the table opposite dr winship and was happier than a queen she wore her new green cambric with a bunch of leaves at her belt she was sunburned but the freckles seemed to have disappeared mysteriously from her nose and almost any one would have admired the rosy skin the dancing eyes and the graceful little auburn head sunning over with curls when the last bit of dessert had been disposed of and dicky had gone to sleep in his mothers lap like an infant boaconstrictor after a hearty meal the presentation of gifts and reading of poems took place and polly had to be on the alert to answer all the nonsensical jokes that were aimed at her finally bell crowned the occasion by producing a song of miss mulocks which had come in the morning mail from some girl friend of pollys in the east who had discovered that pollys name had appeared in poetry and song without her knowledge and who thought she might be interested to hear the composition with the aid of bells guitar and jacks banjo the girls and boys soon caught the pretty air and sung it in chorus pretty polly oliver will you be my own pretty polly oliver as cold as a stone but my love has grown warmer as colder youve grown o pretty polly oliver will you be my own pretty polly oliver i love you so dear pretty polly oliver my hope and my fear ive waited for you sweetheart this many a long year for pretty polly oliver ive loved you so dear pretty polly oliver ill bid you good bye pretty polly oliver for you ill not die youll never get a truer true lover than i so pretty polly oliver goodbye love goodbye at the end dr winship raised his glass of lemonade and proposed to drink miss olivers health this was done with enthusiasm and geoffrey immediately cried speech speech i cant said polly blushing furiously speech sung jack and philip vociferously pounding on the table with knifehandles to increase the furore speech demanded the genial doctor going over to the majority and smiling encouragingly at polly who was pushed to her feet before she knew very well what she was doing oh if laura were not looking at me she thought id just like to speak right out and tell them a little bit of what is in my heart i dont care i will i know you are all in fun she said looking bravely into the good doctors eyes and of course no one could make a proper speech with jack grinning like a cheshire cat but i cant help telling you that this is the happiest summer and the happiest birthday of my whole life and that i scarcely remember nowadays that i have no father and no brothers and sisters for i have never been alone or unhappy since you took me in among you and bell chose me for her friend and i think that if you knew how grateful i am for my beautiful summer dear dr paul and aunt truth you would be glad that you gave it to me and i love you all dearly dearly dearly whereupon the impulsive little creature finished her maiden speech by dashing round the table and giving mrs winship one of her bear hugs at which everybody laughed and rose from the table laura burton who was thoroughly out of conceit with the world and who was never quite happy when other people seemed for the moment to be preferred to herself thought this burst of affection decidedly theatrical but she did not know of any one to whom she could confine her opinions just then indeed she felt too depressed and out of sorts to join in the general hilarity dinner being over dr paul and the boys took the children and sauntered up the canyon for a lazy afternoon with their books elsie went to sleep in the new hammock that the doctor had hung in the sycamores back of the girls sleepingtent and mrs winship lay down for her afternoon nap pancho saddled the horses for bell and margery who went for a gallop polly climbed into the skyparlour to write a long letter to her mother and laura was left to solitude in the sleepingtent now everybody knows that a tent at midday is not a particularly pleasant spot and after many a groan at the glare of the sun which could not be tempered by any system of shawls and moans at the gopherholes which she discovered while searching for her earring and repeated consultations with the handglass at brief intervals during which she convinced herself that she looked worse every minute she finally discovered a series of alarming new spots on her neck and chin she felt then that camping out was a complete failure and that she would be taken home forthwith if it could be managed since she saw nothing before her but day after day of close confinement and unattractive personal appearance its just my luck she grumbled as she twisted up her hair and made herself as presentable as possible under the trying circumstances i dont think i ever had a becoming or an interesting illness the chickenpox mumps and sties on my eyes thats the sort of thing i have i feel much worse mrs winship she said going into the sittingroom tent and waking aunt truth from a peaceful snooze if you can spare pancho over night i really think i must trouble you to send anne and me home at once i feel as if i wanted to go to bed in a dark room and i shall only be a bother if i stay why my child im sorry to have you go off with your visit unfinished you know we dont mind any amount of trouble if we can make you comfortable you are very kind but indeed id rather go i hardly dare let you start in the hot sun without consulting the doctor and everybody is away except polly they will feel badly not to say goodbye it is nearly three oclock now so the worst of the sun is over and we shall be at the ranch by eight this evening i feel too ill to say goodbye any way and we shall meet bell and margery somewhere on the road for they were going to the milk ranch very well my dear if youve made up your mind i must yield replied mrs winship getting up and smoothing her hair i dont dare wake elsie she has had such an exciting day but ill call polly to help you pack and then tell pancho to find anne and harness the team while he is doing that ill get you a little lunch to take with you and write a note to your mother perhaps you can come again before we break camp but im sorry to send you home in such a sad plight chapter viii pollys birthday second half in which she wishes see had never been born from hebrew wit the maxim sprung though feet should slip neer let the tongue polly came at once to the tent where she found laura getting her belongings together why laura it seems too bad you should go off so suddenly what can i do to help you the very spirit of evil entered lauras heart as she looked at polly so fresh and pretty and radiant with her dimples dancing in and out her hair ruffled with the effort of literary composition and the glow of the days happiness still shining in her eyes she felt as if polly was glad inside that she was poisoned she felt sure she was internally jumping for joy at her departure and above all she felt that polly was entirely too conceited over the attention she had received that day and needed to be taken down a peg or two redhaired stuckup saucy thing she thought how i should like to give her a piece of my mind before i leave this place if i only dared i dont need any help thank you she said aloud in her iciest manner but it will only make your head ache to bend over and tug away at that valise and ill be only too glad to do it ive no doubt of that responded laura meaningly it is useless for you to make any show of regret over my going for i know perfectly well that you are glad to get me out of the way why laura what do you mean exclaimed polly completely dazed at this bombshell of candour i mean what i say and i should have said it before if i could ever have found a chance because i didnt mention it at the time you neednt suppose ive forgotten your getting me into trouble with mrs winship the day before the howards came that was not my fault said polly hotly i didnt speak any louder than the other girls and i didnt know aunt truth objected to mrs pinkerton and i didnt know she was anywhere near you roared like the bull of bashan thats what you did perhaps you cant help your voice but anybody in the canyon could have heard you and mrs winship hasnt been the same to me since and the boys dont take the slightest notice of me lately you are entirely mistaken laura dr and mrs winship are just as lovely and cordial to you as they are to everybody else and the boys do not feel well enough acquainted with you to frolic with you as they do with us it isnt so but you are not sensitive enough to see it and i should never have been poisoned if it hadnt been for you oh go on do said polly beginning to lose her selfcontrol which was never very great i didnt know i was a lucrezia borgia in disguise how did i poison you pray i didnt say you poisoned me but you made me so uncomfortable that day bringing down mrs winships lecture on my head and getting my best friend abused that i was glad to get away from the camp and went out with jack for that reason when i was too tired and warm and you are always trying to cut me out with bell and the boys thats a perfectly jet black fib cried polly who was now thoroughly angry and i dont think it is very polite of you to attack the whole party and say they havent been nice to you when theyve done everything in the world it isnt your party any more than mine is it and if i dont know how to be polite i certainly shant ask you for instruction for i must know as much about the manners of good society as you do inasmuch as i have certainly seen more of it polly sank into a campchair too stunned for a moment to reply while laura who had gone quite beyond the point where she knew or cared what she said went on with a rush of words i mean to tell you now that i am started that anybody who isnt blind can see why you toady to the winships who have money and social position and why you are so anxious to keep everybody else from getting into their good graces but they are so partial to you that they have given you an entirely false idea of yourself and you might as well know that unless you keep yourself a little more in the background and grow a little less bold and affected and independent other people will not be quite as ready as the winships to make a pet of a girl whose mother keeps a boardinghouse poor laura it was no sooner said than she regretted it a little not much but poor polly where was her good angel then why could she not have treated this thrust with the silence and contempt it deserved but how could laura have detected and probed the most sensitive spot in the girls nature she lost all command of herself her rage absolutely frightened her for it made her deaf and blind to all considerations of propriety and selfrespect and for a moment she was only conscious of the wild desire to strike yes even to kill the person who had so insulted all that was dearest to her dont dare to say another word she panted with such flaming cheeks and such flashing eyes that laura involuntarily retreated towards the door half afraid of the tempest her words had evoked dont dare to say another word or i dont know what i may do yes i am glad you are going and everybody will be glad and the sooner you go the better youve made everybody miserable ever since you came with your jealousy and your gossip and your finelady airs and if aunt truth hadnt loved your mother and if we were mean enough to tell tales we would have repeated some of your disagreeable speeches long ago how can you dare to say i love the winships for anything but themselves and if you had ever seen my darling mother you never could have called her a boardinghouse keeper you cruel oh but the dashing torrent of angry words stopped at the mere mention of her mother the word recalled her to herself but too late it woke in her memory the clasp of her mothers arms the sound of the sweet tired voice only two of us against the big world polly you and i be brave little daughter brave and patient oh how impatient and cowardly she had been would she never learn to be good the better impulses rushed back into her heart and crowded out the bad ones so quickly that in another moment she would have flung herself at lauras feet and implored her forgiveness merely to gain again her own selfrespect and her mothers approval but there was no time for repentance there isnt sometimes for the clatter of wheels announced panchos approach with the team and mrs winship and anne burton came into view walking rapidly towards the tent laura was a good deal disconcerted at their illtimed appearance but reflected rapidly that if mrs winship had overheard anything it was probably pollys last speech in which case that young person would seem to be more in fault than herself so stepping out of the tent she met mrs winship and kissed her goodbye little anne ran on and jumped into the wagon with all a childs joy at the prospect of going anywhere pollys back was turned but she could not disappear entirely within the tent without causing mrs winship surprise and she went through a lifetime of misery and selfreproach in that minute of shame and fear when she dared neither to advance nor retreat i dont quite like to let you go alone laura without consulting the doctor and i cant find him said mrs winship why you are nervous and trembling hadnt you better wait until tomorrow no thank you mrs winship i am all ready now and would prefer to go i think perhaps i have stayed quite long enough as polly has just told me that everybody is glad to see the last of me and that ive made you all miserable since i came this was the climax to pollys misery for she was already so overcome by the thought of her rudeness that she was on the point of begging lauras pardon for that particular speech then and there and she had only to hear her exact words repeated to feel how they would sound in mrs winships ears mrs winship was so entirely taken aback by lauras remark that she could only ejaculate polly said that what do you mean oh i am quite ready to think she said more than she intended but those were her words polly polly turned alas it was plain enough that this was no false accusation her downcast eyes flushed tearstained cheeks quivering lips and the silent shame of her whole figure spoke too clearly can it be possible polly that you spoke in such a way to a guest who was about to leave my house yes the word was wrung from pollys trembling lips what could she say but yes it was true and how could she repeat the taunts that had provoked her to retort they were not a sufficient excuse and for that matter nothing could be a sufficient excuse for her language now that she was confronted with her own fault lauras seemed so small beside it that she would have been ashamed to offer it as any justification mrs winship grew pale and for a moment was quite at a loss as to the treatment of such a situation dont say any more about it mrs winship said laura we were both angry or we should never have forgotten ourselves and i shall think no more of it laura spoke with such an air of modest virtue and seemed so ready to forgive and forget that polly in her silence and confusion appeared worse than ever but i want you to remember that you are my guest not paulines that i asked you to come and ask you to remain i cannot allow you to go simply because you do not chance to be a favourite with another of my guests oh the pang these words gave pollys faulty tender little heart i am only going because i feel so ill not a bit because of what polly said i was in the wrong too perhaps but i promise not to let anybody nor anything make me quarrel when i visit you again goodbye and laura stepped into the wagon i trust you will not mention this to your mother since i hope it is the only unpleasant incident of your visit and it is no fault of mine that you go away with an unhappy impression of our hospitality here mrs winship reached up and kissed little anne and as the horses were restive and no one seemed to have anything further to say pancho drove off i dont care to talk with you any more at present polly said mrs winship i am too hurt and too indignant to speak of your conduct quietly i know the struggles you have with your temper and i am quite willing to sympathise with you even when you do not come off victorious but this is something quite different i cant conceive how any amount of provocation or dislike could have led you into such disloyalty to me and with this she walked away polly staggered into a little playroom tent of dickys where she knew that she could be alone pinned the curtains together so that no one could peep in and threw herself down upon the long cushioned seat where dicky was wont to take his afternoon nap there in grief and despair she sobbed the afternoon through dreading to be disturbed and dreading to be questioned my beautiful birthday spoiled she moaned and all my own fault i was so happy this morning but now was ever anybody so miserable as i and even if i tell aunt truth what laura said she will think it no excuse and it isnt as it neared suppertime she made an opening in the back of the tent and after long watching caught sight of gin on his way to the brook for water signalled him and gave him this despairing little note for mrs winship dear aunt truth i dont ask you to forgive me i dont deserve to be forgiven but i ask you to do me just one more of your dear little kindnesses let me stay alone in dickys tent till morning and please dont let any one come near me you can tell everybody the whole story tonight if you think best though i should be glad if only dr paul and bell need know but i do not mind anything after displeasing you nothing can be so bad as that perhaps you think i ought to come out and confess it to them myself as a punishment but oh aunt truth i am punishing myself in here alone worse than any one else can do it i will go back to santa barbara any time that you can send me to the stage station and i will never ask you to love me again until i have learned how to control my temper your wretched wretched polly ps i remember that it is my birthday and all that you have done for me today and all the other days it looks as if i were ungrateful but in spite of what i did i am not the words just blazed out and i never knew that they were going to be said till i heard them falling from my mouth it seems to me that if i ever atone for this i will have a slate and pencil hanging to my belt and only write what i have to say polly the moisture came to mrs winships eyes as she read this tearstained little note theres something here i dont quite understand she thought and yet polly confessed that laura told the truth poor child but she has got to learn patience and selfcontrol through suffering however ill keep the matter a secret from everybody at present and stand between her and my inquisitive brood of youngsters and she slipped the note into her pocket at six oclock the members of the family came into camp from various directions and gathered about the suppertable all were surprised at lauras sudden departure but no one seemed especially griefstricken dicky announced confidentially to philip that laura was a norful fraidcat of frogs and jack ventured the opinion that miss laura hadnt boy enough in her for camplife but where is polly asked bell looking round the table as she pinned up her ridingskirt and sat down in her usual seat she has a bad headache and is lying down said mrs winship quietly shell be all right in the morning headache ejaculated four or five people at once dropping their napkins and looking at each other in dismay ill go and rub her head with cologne said margery let me go and sit with her said elsie have you been teasing her jack asked mrs howard too much birthday asked dr paul tell her we can spare almost anybody else better bless the child she wants me if she is sick go on with your suppers ill see to her and bell rose from the table no my dear i want you all to leave her alone at present said mrs winship decidedly ive put her to bed in dickys playtent and i want her to be quiet gin has taken her some supper and she needs rest polly oliver in need of rest what an incomprehensible statement nobody was satisfied but there was nothing more to be said though bell and philip exchanged glances as much as to say something is wrong supper ended and they gathered round the campfire but nothing was quite as usual it was all very well to crack jokes but where was a certain merry laugh that was wont to ring out at the smallest provocation in such an infectious way that everybody else followed suit and who was there when polly had the headache to make a saucy speech and look down into the fire innocently while her dimples did everything that was required in order to point the shaft and pray what was the use of singing when there was no alto to bells treble or of giving conundrums since it was always polly who thought of nonsensical answers better than the real ones and as for jack why it was folly to shoot arrows of wit into the air when there was no target he simply stretched himself out beside elsie who was particularly quiet and snoozed peacefully without taking any part in the conversation avowing his intention to turn in early turn in early forsooth what was the matter with the boy its no use said bell plaintively we cant be anything but happy now that we have elsie here but it needs only one small headache to show that polly fills a longfelt want in this camp you think of her as a modest spoke in the wheel till she disappears and then you find she was the hub yes said margery i think every one round this fire is simply angelic unless i except jack but the fact is that polly is well she is polly and i dare any one to contradict me the judgment of the court is confirmed said philip and the shark said if you dont believe it is true just look at my wisdom tooth sang geoffrey and if any one ever tells me again that she has red hair and hasnt good features i should just like to show them a picture of her as she was today at the dinnertable exclaimed bell as if anybody needed features with those dimples added elsie or would mind red hair when it was such pretty hair i think a report of this conversation would go far towards curing polly said dr winship with a smile and you say we cant go in there before we go to bed mamacita whispered bell in her mothers ear as the boys said goodnight and went towards their tent my dear she answered decidedly with a fond kiss for each of the girls polly herself asked me to keep everybody away polly herself wanted to be alone would wonders never cease meanwhile dicky who had disappeared for a moment came back to the fire his bosom heaving with grief and rage i went to my playtent he sobbed and putted my hand underneath the curtain and gave polly a piece of my supper cake i saved for hernot the frosted part but the burnt part i couldnt eat and she liked it and kissed my hand and then i fought she was lonesome and would like to see my littlest frog and i told her to put out her hand again for a sprise and i squeezed him into it tight so t he wouldnt jump and she fought it was more cake and when she found it wasnt she frew my littlest frog clear away and it got losted this brought a howl of mirth from everybody and dicky was instructed while being put to bed not to squeeze little frogs into peoples hands in the dark as it sometimes affected them unpleasantly all this time polly was lying in the tent quite exhausted with crying and made more wretched by every sound of voices wafted towards her presently gin appeared with her nightwrapper and various things for comfort sent her by the girls and as she wearily undressed herself and prepared for the night she found three little messages of comfort pinned on the neck and sleeves of her flannel gown written in such colossal letters that she could easily read them by the moonlight on the right sleeve cheer up i will never desert mr micawber bell on the left sleeve darling polly get well soon or we shall all be sick in order to stay with you lovingly meg ps jack said you were the life of the camp what do you think of that m on the neck dearest you have always called me the fairy godmother and pretended i could see things that other people couldnt the boys great stupids think you have the headache we girls can all see that you are in trouble but only the fairy godmother knows why and though she cant make a beautiful gold coach out of this pumpkin because theres something wrong about the pumpkin yet she will do her best for cinderella and pull her out of the ashes somehow elsie pollys tears fell fast on the dear little notes which she kissed again and again and tucked under her pillow to bring her sleep elsie knows something she thought but how she knows that im in trouble and that ive done wrong or she wouldnt have said that about not being able to turn a bad pumpkin into a beautiful gold coach but perhaps she can get aunt truth to forgive me and try me again unless she can do it it will never come to pass for i havent the courage to ask her i would rather run away early in the morning and go home than have her look at me again as she did today oh what shall i do and polly went down on her knees beside the rough couch and sobbed her heart out in a childish prayer for help and comfort it was just the prayer of a little child telling a sorrowful story because it is when we are alone and in trouble that the unknown and mysterious god seems to us most like a father and we throw ourselves into the arms of his love like helpless children and tell him our secret thoughts and griefs dear father in heaven she sobbed dont forgive me if i ought not to be forgiven but please make aunt truth feel how sorry i am and show me whether i ought to tell what made me so angry though its no excuse bless and keep my darling patient little mother and help me to grow more like her and braver and stronger too so that i can take care of her soon and she neednt work hard any longer please forgive me for hating some things in my life as much as i do and i will try and like them better but i think yes i know that i am full of wicked pride and oh it seems as if i could never never get over wanting to live in a pretty house and wear pretty dresses and have my mother live like bells and margerys and oh if thou canst only forgive me for hating boarders so dreadfully and being ashamed of them every minute i will try and like them better and tell everybody that we take them i will indeed and if i can only once make aunt truth love and trust me again i will make the boarders beds and dust their rooms for ever without grumbling please dear father in heaven remember that i havent any father to love me or to teach me to be good and though mamma does her best please help her to make something out of me if it can be done amen truth said mrs howard when all was quiet about the camp elsie wants to see you a moment before she goes to sleep will you go to her tent while i play a game of cribbage with dr paul elsie looked like a blossom in all the beautiful greenness of her tent with her yellow head coming out from above the greens and browns of the cretonne bedcover for all the world like a daffodil pushing its way up through the mould towards the spring sunshine aunt truth she said softly as mrs winship sat down beside her you remember that dr paul hung my hammock in a new place today just behind the girls sleepingtent now i know that polly is in trouble and that you are displeased with her what i want to ask if i may is how much you know for i overheard a great deal myselfenough to feel that polly deserves a hearing i overheard nothing replied mrs winship all that i know polly herself confessed in lauras presence polly told laura just as she was going away that everybody would be glad to see the last of her and that she had made everybody miserable from the beginning of her visit it was quite inexcusable you know dear for one of my guests to waylay another just as she was leaving and make such a cruel speech i would rather anything else had happened i know how impetuous polly is and i can forgive the child almost anything her heart is so full of love and generosity but i cannot overlook such a breach of propriety as that of course i have seen that laura is not a favourite with any of you i confess she is not a very lovable person and i think she has led a very unwholesome life lately and is sadly spoiled by it still that is no excuse for pollys conduct no of course it isnt sighed elsie with a little quiver of the lip i thought i could plead a better case for polly but i see exactly how thoughtless and impolite she was yet if you knew everything auntie dear you would feel a little different do you think it was nice of laura to repeat what polly said right before her and just as she was going away when she knew it would make you uncomfortable and that you were not to blame for it no hardly it didnt show much tact but girls of fifteen or sixteen are not always remarkable for social tact i excused her partly because she was halfsick and nervous well elsie went on i didnt hear the whole quarrel so that i do not know how long it lasted nor who began it i cant help thinking it was laura though for shes been trying her best to provoke polly for the last fortnight and until today she has never really succeeded i was half asleep and heard at first only the faint murmur of voices but when i was fully awake laura was telling polly that she doted on you simply because you had money and position while she had not that you were all so partial to her that she had lost sight of her own deficiencies then she called her bold and affected and i dont know what else and finally wound up by saying that nobody but the winships would be likely to make a pet of the daughter of a boardinghouse keeper elsie ejaculated mrs winship this grows worse and worse is it possible that laura burton could be guilty of such a thought i cant be mistaken i was too excited not to hear very clearly and the moment the words were spoken i knew my poor dears fiery temper would never endure that and it didnt it blazed out in a second but it didnt last long for before i could get to the tent she had stopped herself right in the middle of a sentence and in another minute i heard your voice and crept back to the hammock thinking that everything would be settled by lauras going away id no idea that she would pounce on polly and get her in disgrace the very last thing when she knew that she was responsible for the whole matter you see auntie that impolite as polly was she only told laura that we girls were glad she was going she didnt bring you in after all and laura knew perfectly well that she was a welcome visitor and we all treated her with the greatest politeness though its no use to say we liked her much i am very sorry for the whole affair sighed mrs winship there is so much wrong on both sides lauras remark it is true would have angered almost anybody who was not old and wise enough to see that it deserved only contempt but both the girls should have had too much respect for themselves and for me to descend to such an unladylike quarrel however i am only too glad to hear anything which makes pollys fault less for i love her too dearly not to suffer when i have to be severe with her she wouldnt ask you to overlook her fault continued elsie with tears in her eyes i know just how wretched and penitent she must be polly is always so fierce against her own faults but what must be making her suffer most is the thought that she has entirely lost your confidence and good opinion oh i cant help thinking that god feels sorrier this very minute for polly who fights and fights against her temper like a dear sunbeam trying to shine again and again when a cloud keeps covering it up than he does for laura who has everything made smooth for her and who is unhappy when her feathers are ruffled the least bit you are right dear in so far that a fiery little soul like pollys can if it finds the right channels do gods work in the world better than a character like lauras which is not courageous nor strong nor sweet enough for great service unless it grows into better things through bitter or rich experiences now goodnight my blessed little peacemaker sleep sweetly for i am going into pollys tent to have a good talk with her as mrs winship dropped the curtains of elsies tent behind her and made her way quietly through the trees the tinkling sound of a banjo fell upon the still night air and presently as she neared pollys retreat this facetious serenade sung by jacks wellknown voice was wafted to her ears prithee polly oliver why bide ye so still pretty polly oliver we fear you are ill im singing neath thy window when night dews are chill for pretty polly oliver we hear you are ill she was about to despatch master jack to his tent with a round scolding when the last words of the song were frozen on his lips by the sound of a smothered sob in place of the saucy retort he hoped to provoke the unexpected sob frightened him more than any fusilade of hot words and he stole away in the darkness more crestfallen than he had been for many a year mrs winship more troubled than ever pulled apart the canvas curtains and stood in the opening silently the sight of the forlorn little figure huddled together on the straw bed touched her heart and when polly started up with an eloquent cry and flew into her extended arms she granted willing forgiveness and the history of the afternoon was sobbed out upon her motherly shoulder the next morning mrs winship announced that polly was better sent breakfast to her tent and by skilful generalship drove everybody away from the camp but elsie who brought polly to the sittingroom made her comfortable on the lounge and administering much good advice to margery and bell concerning topics to be avoided admitted them one by one into her presence so that she gradually regained her selfcontrol and at the dinnertable a very pale polly was present again with such a white face and heavy eyes that no one could doubt there had been a headache while two people at least knew that there had been a heartache as well the next days mail carried the following letter to laura burton camp chaparral august my dear laura as i told you when you were leaving i cannot well say how sorry i am that anything should have occurred to mar your pleasant remembrance of your stay with us that your dear mothers daughter should have been treated with discourtesy while she was my guest was very disagreeable to me but i have learned that you were yourself somewhat to blame in the affair and therefore you should have borne the harsh treatment you received with considerable patience and perhaps have kept it quite to yourself that little cat told her after all said laura when she read this i didnt think she was that kind polly would never have confessed the cause of the quarrel because she knew nothing could justify her language but elsie was lying in the hammock behind the tent and overheard the remark which so roused pollys anger you were not aware of course how sore a spot you touched upon or you could never have spoken as you did though i well know that you were both too angry to reflect polly is a peculiarly proud and highspirited girl proud i confess to a fault but she comes on her mothers side from a long line of people who have had much to be proud of in the way of unblemished honesty nobility fine attainments and splendid achievements of her fathers honourable services to his country and his sad and untimely death you may have heard but you may not know that mrs olivers misfortunes have been very many and very bitter and that the only possibility of supporting and educating polly lies at present in her taking boarders for her health will not admit just now of her living anywhere save in southern california i fail to see why this is not thoroughly praiseworthy and respectable but if you do not consider it quite an elegant occupation i can only say that mrs oliver presides over the table at which her boarders sit with a highbred dignity and grace of manner that the highest lady in the land might imitate and that when health and circumstances permit her to diminish the distance between herself and the great world she and her daughter polly by reason of their birth and their culture will find doors swinging wide to admit them where you and i would find it difficult to enter polly apologises sincerely for her rudeness and will write you to that effect as of course she does not know of this letter sincerely your friend truth winship chapter ix round the campfire the time before the fire they sat and shortened the delay by pleasing chat the august days had slipped away one after another and september was at hand there was no perceptible change of weather to mark the advent of the new month the hills were a little browner the dust a little deeper the fleas a little nimbler and the water in the brook a trifle lower but otherwise dame nature did not concern herself with the change of seasons inasmuch as she had no old dresses to get rid of and no new ones to put on for a long time yet indeed she is never very fashionable in this locality and wears very much the same garments throughout the year elsie seemed almost as strong as any of the other girls now and could enter with zest into all their amusements the appetite of a young bear the sound dreamless sleep of a baby and the constant breathing in of the pure lifegiving air had made her a new creature mrs howard and jack felt day by day that a burden of dread was being lifted from their hearts and mrs howard especially felt that she loved every rock and tree in the canyon it was a charming morning and polly was seated at the diningroom table deep in the preparation of a lesson in reading and pronunciation for hop yet her forehead was creased with many wrinkles of thought and she bit the end of her leadpencil as if she were engaged in solving some difficult problem but if that were so why did the dimples chase each other in and out of her cheeks in such a suspicious fashion she was a very gentle a very sedate polly these latter days and not only astonished her friends but surprised herself by her good behaviour her elegant reserve of manner her patience with jack and her abject devotion to dicky im afraid it wont last she sighed to herself occasionally im almost too good thats always the way with me i must either be so bad that everybody is discouraged or else so good that i frighten them now i catch bell and elsie exchanging glances every day as much as to say poor polly she will never hold out at this rate do you notice that nothing ruffles her that she is simply angelic as if i couldnt be angelic for a fortnight why i have often done it for four weeks at a stretch margery was in the habit of giving hop yet an english lesson every other day as he had been very loath to leave his evening school in santa barbara and bury himself in a canyon away from all educational influences but she had deserted her post for once and gone to ride with elsie so that polly had taken her place and was evolving an exercise that hop yet would remember to the latest day of his life it looked simple enough the grass is dry the fruit is ripe the chaparral is green the new road is all right the bayrum tree is fresh and pretty but as no chinaman can pronounce the letter r it was laboriously rendered thus when the unhappy time of the lesson came theglassisdly thefluitislipe thechaplalisgleen thenewloadisalllightee the baylumtleeisfleshandplitty finally when she attempted to introduce the sentence around the rough and rugged rock the ragged rascal ran hop yet rose hurriedly remarking all lightee i go no more school jus now i lun get lunchee bell came running down the path just then and linking her arm in pollys said papa has the nicest plan you know the boys are so disappointed that colonel jackson didnt ask them over to that rodeo at his cattle ranch though a summer rodeo is only to sort out fat cattle to sell and it is not very exciting but papa promised to tell them all about the oldfashioned kind some night and he has just remembered that tomorrow is admission day september so he proposes a real celebration round the campfire to amuse elsie she doesnt know anything about california even as it is now and none of us know what it was in the old days dont you think it will be fun perfectly splendid and papa wants us each to contribute something a picnic but i dont know anything thats just what im coming to i have such a bright idea he said that we might look in any of his books but geoff and jack are at them already and id like a surprise now juan capistrano an old vaquero of colonel jacksons is over here he is a wonderful rider papa says that he could ride on a comet if he could get a chance to mount it was he who told the boys that the rodeo was over now i propose that we go and interview pancho and juan and get them to tell us some old california stories they are both as stupid as they can be but they must have had some adventures i suppose somewhere sometime ill translate and write the things down for my part and you and margery can tell them lovely oh if we can only get an exciting grizzly story so that every ones blood upon end it will stand and the hair run cold in their veins and was dr paul out here when california was admitted into the union wasnt it of course why my child he was one of the delegates called by general riley the military governor to meet in convention at monterey and make a state constitution that was september too the first day of september he went back to the east some time afterwards and stayed ten or fifteen years but he was a real pioneer and fortyniner all the same the next night september th was so cool that the campfire was more than ordinarily delightful accordingly they piled on more wood than usual and prepared for a grand blaze it was always built directly in front of the sittingroom tent so that mrs howard and mrs winship could sit there if they liked but the young people preferred to lie lazily on their cushions and saddles under the oaktree a little distance from the blaze the clear red firelight danced and flickered and the sparks rose into the sombre darkness fantastically while the ruddy glow made the great oak an enchanted palace into whose hollow dome they never tired of gazing when the light streamed highest the bronze green of the foliage was turned into crimson and as it died now and then the stars winked brightly through the thousand tiny windows formed by the interlacing branches well said the doctor bringing his chinese loungingchair into the circle and lighting his pipe so as to be thoroughly happy and comfortable will you banish distinctions of age and allow me to sit among you this evening certainly margery said thats the very point of the celebration this is admission day you know and why shouldnt we admit you true and having put myself into a holiday humour by dining off panchos dish of guisado i suppose tonight of all nights we must call beef and onion stew by its local name i will proceed to business and we will talk about california by the way i shall only conduct the exercises for i feel rather embarrassed by the fact that ive never killed or been killed by a bear never been bitten by a tarantula poisoned by a rattlesnake assaulted by a stagerobber nor anything of that sort you have all read my story of crossing the plains i even did that in a comparatively easy and unheroic fashion i only wish my dear girls and boys that we had with us some one of the brave and energetic men and women who made that terrible journey at the risk of their lives the history of the california crusaders the thirty thousand or more emigrants who crossed the plains in more than equals the great military expeditions of the middle ages in magnitude peril and adventure some went by way of santa fe and along the hills of the gila others starting from red river traversed the great stake desert and went from el paso del norte to sonora others went through mexico and after spending over a hundred days at sea ran into san diego and gave up their vessels others landed exhausted with their seven months passage round the horn and some reached the spot on foot after walking the whole length of the california peninsula what privations they must have suffered said mrs howard i never quite realised it why the amount of suffering that was endured in those mountain passes and deserts can never be told in words those who went by the great desert west of the colorado found a stretch of burning salt plains of shifting hills of sand with bones of animals and men scattered along the trails of terrible and ghastly odours rising in the hot air from the bodies of hundreds of mules and human creatures too that lay halfburied in the glaring white sand a terrible journey indeed but if any state in the union could be fair enough fertile enough and rich enough to repay such a lavish expenditure of energy and suffering california certainly was and is the one now who can tell us something of the name california you geoffrey geoffrey has crammed exclaimed bell maliciously i believe hes been reading up all day and told papa what question to ask him ill pass it on to you if you like laughed geoffrey no youd never get another that you could answer go on in one hernando de grijalva was sent by hernando cortez to discover something or other and it was probably he who then saw the peninsula of california but a quarter of a century before this a romance called esplandian had appeared in spain narrating the adventures of an amazonian queen who brought allies from the right hand of the indies to assist the infidels in their attack upon constantinople by the way i forgot to say that she was a pagan this queen of the amazons was called calafia and her kingdom rich in gold and precious stones was named california the writer of the romance derived this name perhaps from calif a successor of mohammed he says know that on the right hand of the indies there is an island named california very close to the terrestial paradise and it was peopled by black women without any man among them for they lived in the fashion of the amazonia they were of strong and hardy bodies of ardent courage and of great force their island was the strongest in all the world with its steep cliffs and rocky shore their arms were all of gold and so was the harness of the wild beasts which they tamed and rode for in the whole island there was no metal but gold they lived in caves wrought out of the rocks with much labour and they had many ships with which they sailed out to other countries to obtain booty cortez and grijalva believed that they were near the coast of asia for they had no conception of the size of the world nor of the vastness of the pacific ocean and as the newlydiscovered land corresponded with the country described in the romance they named the peninsula california my book said philip declared that the derivation of the name was very uncertain and that it was first bestowed on one of the coast bays by bernal diaz now philip exclaimed margery do you suppose we are going to believe that after geoffs lovely story certainly not i only thought id permit you to hear both sides i knew of course that you would believe the prettier story of the two girls always do that isnt a pretty story your remark i mean so we wont believe it will we girls asked bell now polly your eyes sparkle as if you couldnt wait another minute your turn next said dr winship i am only afraid that i cant remember my contribution which is really bells and still more really panchos for he told it to us and bell translated it and made it into a story we call it valerio or the mysterious mountain cave begins well exclaimed jack now jack you must be nice remember this is bells story and she is letting me tell it so that i can bear my share in the entertainment pancho believes every word of it added bell and says that his father told it to him but as i had to change it from bad spanish into good english i dont know whether ive caught the idea exactly oh it will do quite nicely ive no doubt said jack encouragingly weve often heard you do good english into bad spanish and turn and turn about is only fair play dont mind me polly i will be gentle jack if you dont behave yourself ill send you to bed said elsie and he ducked his head obediently into her lap as polly with her hands clasping her knees and with the firelight dancing over her bright face leaned forward and told the legend of valerio or the mysterious mountain cave a long time ago before the settlement of santa barbara by the whites the mission padres had a great many indians under their control who were known as peons or serfs they were given enough to eat were not molested by the outside indians and were entirely peaceable there were so few mountain passes by which to enter santa barbara that they were easily held and of course the padres were anxious to keep their indians from running away lest they should show the wilder tribes the way to get in and commit depredations these peaceable indians paid tribute to intermediary tribes to hold the passes and do their fighting those about the mission gave corn and cereals and hides and the products of the sea and got in exchange pinones pine nuts one of these indians named valerio was a strong brave handsome youth whose haughty spirit revolted at his servitude and after seeking an opportunity for many weeks he finally escaped to the santa ynez mountains where he found a cave in which he hid himself drawing himself up by a rope and taking it in after him the indians had unlimited belief in valerios mysterious and wonderful powers pancho says that he could make himself invisible at will that locks and keys were powerless against him and that no one could hinder his taking money horses or food all sorts of things disappeared mysteriously by day and by night and the robberies were one and all laid to the door of valerio but after a while valerio grew lonely in his mountain retreat he longed for human companionship and at length becoming desperate he descended on the mission settlement and kidnapped a young indian boy named chito took him to his cave and admitted him into his wild and lawless life but chito was not contented he liked home and comfortable slavery better than the new strange life so he seized the first opportunity and being a bright daring little lad and fleet of foot he escaped and made his way to the mission arriving there he told wonderful stories of valerio and his life how his marvellous white mare seemed to fly rather than gallop and leaped from rock to rock like a chamois and how they lived upon wheatbread cheeses wine and other delicacies instead of the coarse fare of the indians he told them the location of the cave and described the way thither so the alcalde he was the mayor or judge you know elsie got out the troops with their muskets and the padres gathered the mission indians with their bows and arrows and they all started in pursuit of the outlaw among the troops were two hechiceros wizards or medicinemen whose bowed shoulders and grizzled beards showed them to be men of many years and much wisdom when asked to give their advice they declared that valerio could not be killed by any ordinary weapons but that special means must be used to be of any avail against his supernatural powers accordingly one of the hechiceros broke off the head of his arrow cast a charm over it and predicted that this would deal the fatal blow the party started out with chito as a guide and after many miles of wearisome travel up rugged mountain sides and over steep and almost impassable mountain trails they paused at the base of a cliff and saw far up the height the mouth of valerios cave and what was more valerio himself sitting in the doorway fast asleep alas he had been drinking too heavily of his stolen wine or he would never have so exposed himself to the enemy they fired a volley at him one shot only took effect and even this would not have been possible save that the spell was not upon him because of his sleep but the one shot woke him and half rising he staggered and fell from the mouth of the cave to a ledge of rocks beneath he sprang to his feet in a second and ran like a deer towards a tree where his white mare was fastened they fired another volley but though the shots flew in every direction valerio passed on unharmed but just as he was disappearing from view the hechicero raised his bow and the headless arrow whizzed through space and pierced him through the heart they clambered up the cliffs with shouts of triumph and surrounded him on every side but poor valerio had surrendered to a more powerful enemy than they wonderful to relate he still breathed though the wound should have been instantly fatal they lifted him from the ground and tied him on his snowwhite mare his long hair reaching almost to the ground his handsome face as pale as death the blood trickling from his wound but the mysterious power that he possessed seemed to keep him alive in spite of his suffering finally one of the hechiceros decided that the spell lay in the buckskin cord that he wore about his throat a rough sort of necklace hung with bears claws and snake rattles and that he never would die until the magic cord was cut this after some consultation was done valerio drew his last breath as it parted asunder and they bore his dead body home in triumph to the mission but he is not forgotten stories are still told of his wonderful deeds and people still go in search of money that he is supposed to have hidden in his cave the mexican women who tell suertes or fortunes describe the location of the money but as soon as any one reaches the cave he is warned away by a little old man who stands in the door and protects the buried treasure an indian lad who was riding over the hills one day with his horse and his dogs dismounted to search for his moccasin when he suddenly noticed that the dogs had chased something into a cave in the rocks he followed and peering into the darkness saw two gleaming eyes he thrust his knife between them but struck the air and though he had been standing directly in front of the opening so that nothing could have passed him yet he heard the clatter of hoofs and the tinkle of spurs and turning saw a mysterious horseman whose pale face and streaming hair melted into the mountain mist as it floated down from the purple santa ynez peaks into the lap of the vinecovered foothills below chapter x more campfire stories and still they watched the flickering of the blaze and talked together of the good old days brava bravissima splendid polly exclaimed the boys bell youre a great author couldnt have done better myself give you my word cried jack bowing profoundly to bell and polly in turn and presenting them with bouquets of faded leaves hastily gathered from the ground polly covered herself with glory said the doctor and i am very proud of your part in it too my little daughter i have some knowledge of panchos capabilities as a narrator and i think the story of valerio owes a good deal to you now who comes next margery no please said margery for i have another story take one of the boys and lets have more facts yes something historic and profound out of the encyclopaedia from jack said polly saucily thanks miss oliver with you for an audience any man might be inspired but but not a boy mother dear remove that child from my sight or i shall certainly shake her phil go on just to keep polly quiet very well being the oldest californian present i what about dr paul asked the irrepressible polly he wasnt born here responded philip dryly and i was i think thats a quibble interrupted bell papa was here twenty years before you were its not my fault that he came first answered philip margery and i are not only the oldest californians present but the only ones isnt that so sir quite correct oh if you mean that way i suppose you are but still papa helped frame the constitution and was here on the first admission day and was one of the vigilantes and i think that makes him more of a real californian than you youve just grown up with the country bless my soul what else could i do i would have been glad to frame the constitution admit the state and serve on the vigilance committee if they had only waited for me but they went straight ahead with the business and when i was born there was nothing to do but stand round and criticise what they had done or as you express it grow up with the country well as i was saying when i was interrupted beg pardon dont mention it uncle doc has asked me to tell mrs howard and elsie how they carried on the rodeos ten or fifteen years ago of course i was only a little chap very little murmured his sister but never too small to stick on a horse and my father used often to take me along the rodeos nowadays are neither as great occasions nor as exciting ones as they used to be but this is the way a rodeo is managed when the spring rains are mostly over and the grass is fine say in april the ranchero of a certain ranch sends word to all his neighbours that he will hold a rodeo on a certain day or days of course the cattle used to stray all over the country and get badly mixed as there were no fences so the rodeo was held for the purpose of separating the cattle and branding the calves that had never been marked the owners of the various ranches assemble the night before bringing their vaqueros with them they start out very early in the morning having had a cup of coffee and ride to the rodeoground which is any flat convenient place where canyons converge many of the cattle on the hills round about know the place having been there before and the vaqueros start after them and drive them to the spot how many vaqueros would there be asked elsie oh nine or ten perhaps and often from one thousand to three thousand cattle it depends on the number of ranches and cattle represented some of the vaqueros form a circle round the cattle that they have driven to the rodeoground and hold them there while others go back to the ranch for breakfast and fresh horses fresh horses so soon said mrs howard i thought the mustangs were tough hardy little beasts that would go all day without dropping yes so they are but you always have to begin to part out the cattle with the freshest and besttrained horses you have the owners and their best vaqueros now go into the immense band of cattle and try to get the cows and the unbranded calves separated from the rest you can imagine what skilful engineering this takes even though you never saw it two work together they start a certain cow and calf and work them through the band of cattle until they near the outside and then rush them to a place three or four hundred yards beyond where other vaqueros are stationed to receive and hold them of course the cattle dont want to leave the band and of course they dont want to stay in the spot to which they are driven i dont blame them cried bell impetuously probably the cows remember the time when they were branded themselves and they dont want their dear little bossies put through the same operation very likely then more cows and calves are started in the same way the greatest difficulty being had with the first lot for the cattle always stay more contentedly together as the group grows larger occasionally one breaks and runs off on the hills and a vaquero starts after him throws the reata and lassos him or lasss him as the california boys say there must be frightful accidents said mrs winship yes but not so many as you would suppose for the horsemanship in its particular way is something wonderful when an ugly steer is lassoed and he feels the reata or lariat round his neck he sometimes turns and makes for the horse and unless the vaquero is particularly skilful he will be gored and his horse too but he gives a dexterous turn to the lariat the animal steps over it gets tangled and thrown frequently an animal breaks a horn or a leg sometimes one fall is not enough the steer jumps up and pursues the horse then the vaquero keeps a little ahead of him and leads him back to the rodeoground where another vaquero lassos him by the hind legs and throws him while the reata is taken off his neck there is another danger too added dr winship the vaquero winds the reata very tightly round the pommel of his saddle to hold the steer and he is likely to have his finger caught in the hairrope and cut off yes i forgot that two or three of the famous old vaqueros about santa barbara jose maria jose antonio and old clemente have each lost a finger well the vaqueros at length form in a circle round the band of selected cattle the ranch owner who gives the rodeo takes his own cattle that he has found the ones bearing his brand you know and drives them in with the ones to be branded leaving in the rodeoground the cattle bearing the brands of all the other rancheros there has been much drinking of aguardiente brandy and everybody by this time is pretty reckless then they drive this selected band to the home corral the vaqueros yelling the cattle calling and the reatas whizzing and whistling through the air if any unfortunate tries to escape his fate he is pursued lassd and brought back by this time the cattle are pretty well heated and angry and when they get into the crowded corral they horn each other and try to gore the horses a fire is then built in one corner of the corral and the brandingirons are heated oh hold my hand polly if the branding is going to begin i hate it so exclaimed elsie i wont say much about it but its no worse than a thousand things that people have to bear every year of their lives animals never have to have teeth filled for instance nor limbs amputated oh just think of a calf with a wooden leg or a cow with false teeth wouldnt it be funny laughed bell they dont have a thousand ills that human flesh is heir to so they must be thankful they get off so easy well the brandingirons are heated as i say each cattleowner having his special brand which is properly recorded and which may be any device not previously used two men now catch the calves one lassoing them by the head the other by the legs a third man takes the iron from the fire and brands the chosen letter or hieroglyphic on the animals hind quarter sometimes on the fore quarter dont they asked bell ive seen brands there your horse has two and our cow has one also yes a brand on the fore quarter shows that the animal has been sold but it always has the original brand on the hind quarter when a sale is effected the new brand is put anywhere in front of the fifth rib and this constitutes what they call a venta or sale if you notice some of the little plugs ridden by santa barbara boys youll see that they bear half a dozen brands by the way if the rodeo has been a very large one they are several days branding the cattle so they are turned out to pastorear a little while each day the brand was absolute sign of ownership you know girls said dr winship and though there was the greatest care exercised in choosing and recording the brands there was plenty of opportunity for cheating for instance a man would often see unbranded cattle when riding about and there was nothing to prevent his dismounting building a fire heating his iron and putting his own brand on them then at the next rodeo they were simply turned over to him for as i say the brand was absolute ownership wheneer i take my rides abroad how many calves i see and as i brand them properly they all belong to me said bell how i should like to see a rodeo sighed elsie i cant imagine how the vaqueros can fling the reata while they are riding at full speed it isnt so very wonderful said polly nonchalantly the most ordinary people can learn it why your brother jack can lasso almost as well as a mexican and i can lass any stationary object myself cried bell a hitchingpost or even a doorknob i can do it two or three times out of ten that shows immense skill answered jack but as the thing you want to lass never does stay still and as it is absolutely necessary to catch it more than three times out of ten you probably wouldnt make a name and fortune as a vaquero juan capistrano by the way used to be famous with the lariat i had heard of his adventure with a bull on the island of santa rosa and i asked him about it today but he had so exhausted himself telling stories to bell that he had very few words for me you see there was a bull on santa rosa island so wild that they wanted to kill him but nobody could do it though he was a terror to any one who ventured on the island they called him antiguelo because of his long horns and long tail he was such a terrible fighter that all the vaqueros were afraid to lass him for he always broke away with the lariat you see a horse throws a bull by skill and not by strength of course you can choke almost any bull but this one was too smart he would crouch on his haunches and pull back until the rope nearly choked him and then suddenly make for the horse juan capistrano had a splendid horse you see as much depends on the horse as the man in such a case and he came upon antiguelo on the cerro negro and lassd him well did he fight i asked si senor well what happened yo lo mate i killed him he said with a shrug of his shoulders and thats all i could get out of juan regarding his adventure but you havent done your share you lazy boy objected bell you must tell us more what do you want to hear i am up on all the animal and vegetable life of southern california full of interesting information concerning its old customs can give you spanish names for all the things that come up in ordinary conversation and am the only man present who can make a rawhide reata said jack modestly go on and tell us how o great and wise reatero said bell ill tell you that myself said elsie for ive seen him do it dozens of times when he should have been studying his little lessons he takes a big piece of raw hide cuts a circle right out of the middle and then cuts round and round this until he has one long continuous string half an inch wide he then stretches it and scrapes the hair off with a knife or a piece of glass gets it into four strands and braids it round perhaps you think braiding round is easy to do retorted jack in an injured tone but i know it took me six months to learn to do it well i fail to see said his mother how a knowledge of braiding round and lassoing of wild cattle is going to serve you in your university life and future career oh yes it will i shall be the buffalo bill of harvard and i shall give charming little entertainments in my rooms or in some little gardenplot suitable to the purpose shall you make a point of keeping up with your class asked mrs winship oh yes unless they go too fast my sports wont take any more time than rowing or baseball theyll be a little more expensive because ill have to keep some wild cattle constantly on hand and perhaps a vaquero or two but a vaquero wont cost any more than a valet i didnt intend furnishing you with a valet remarked his mother but i shall be selfsupporting mother dear i shall give exhibitions on the campus and the gatemoney will keep me in luxury this is all very interesting said polly cuttingly but what has it to do with california id like to know poor dear your brain is so weak cant you see that when i am the fashion in cambridge it will be noised about that i gained my marvellous skill in california this will increase emigration i dont pretend to say it will swell the population like the discovery of gold in but it will have a perceptible effect you are more modest than a whole mossy bank of violets laughed dr paul now margery will you give us your legend mine is the story of juan de dios literally juan of god and im sorry to say that it has a horse in it like pollys only hers was a snowwhite mare and mine is a coalblack charger but they wouldnt tell us any romantic lovestories they were all about horses story of juan de dios in early days when americans were coming in to santa barbara there were many cattlebuyers among them and there were large bands of robbers all over the country who were ready to pounce on these travellers on their way to the great cattle ranchos kill them and steal their money and clothes as well as their horses and trappings no one could understand how the robbers got such accurate information of the movements of the travellers unless they had a spy somewhere near the mission where they often stopped for rest and refreshment now there was a certain young indian vaquero in the employ of the padres at la mission de la purisima he was a wonderful horseman and greatly looked up to by his brother vaqueros because he was so strong alert and handsome and because he was always dressed elegantly in rich old spanish embroideries and velvets given to him he said by men for whom he had done great services one day a certain traveller a spanish official of high degree came from monterey to wed his sweetheart the daughter of the richest cattleowner in all the country round his spurs and bit and bridle were of solid silver his jaquima halter was made of a hair rope whose strands had been dyed in brilliant colours his tapaderos front of the stirrups mochilas large leather saddle flaps and sudaderos thin bits of leather to protect the legs from sweat were all beautifully stamped in the fashion used by the mexicans his saddle blankets and his housings were all superb and he wore a broad sombrero encircled with a silver snake and trimmed with silver lace the traveller stayed at la purisima all night and set out early in the morning to ride the last forty miles that separated him from his bride but juan and two other robbers were lying in wait for him behind a great rock that stood at the entrance of a lonely canyon they appeared on horseback one behind the unfortunate man and two in front so that he could escape neither way they finally succeeded in lassoing the horse and throwing him to the ground with his rider who defended himself bravely with his knife but was finally killed and robbed juan taking his clothes and trappings and the other two dividing the contents of his purse they could not have buried their victim as successfully as usual or else they were surprised and had to escape for the body was found and juan whom the padres had begun to view with suspicion was nowhere to be found about the mission troops were sent out in pursuit of him for this particular traveller was a high official and it was necessary that his death should be avenged they at last heard that juan had been seen going towards santa ynez mission and pursuing him thither they came upon him as he was driving a band of horses into a corral and just in the act of catching his own horse a noble and powerful animal called azabache because of his jetblack colour the men surrounded the corral and ordered him to surrender he begged them to wait until he had saddled azabache and then they might shoot them both down together he asked permission to call three times pegar tres gritos and after the third call they were to shoot his last wish was granted he saddled and mounted his splendid horse called oncetwice thrice but when the last shout faded in the air and the troops raised their muskets to fire behold there was no juan de dios to be seen they had been surrounding the corral so that no one could have ridden out they looked among the horses but asabache was nowhere to be found just then a joyous shout was heard so ringing and triumphant that every man turned in the direction from which it came there galloping up the hillside nearly half a mile distant was juan de dios mounted on his coalblack azabache but it was no common sunshine that deepened the gorgeous colours of his trappings and danced upon his silver spurs till they glistened like two great stars it was a broad glittering stream of light such as no mortal had ever seen before and which almost blinded the eyes and over this radiant path of golden sunbeams galloped juan de dios until he disappeared over the crest of the mountain then the light faded the padres crossed themselves in silence and went home to their mission and juan de dios never was heard of more modest little margery was hailed with such cheers that you could not have seen her cheeks for the blushes and just as the party began to think of forsaking the fascinating campfire for bed bell jumped up impetuously and cried here philip give me the castanets please polly and jack you play las palomas for me and ill sing and show you the dance of that pretty mexican girl whom i saw at the ball given under the big grape vine wait till i take off my hair ribbon lend me your scarf mamma now begin las palomas the doves cuatro palomitas blancas que vienen de por a lla unas a las otras dicen no hay amor como el de aca it is barely possible but not likely that anything prettier than bells mexican danza was to be seen under the light of the september stars that night although they were doubtless shining down upon a thousand lovely things with all the brightness of her loosened hair rising and falling with the motion of her swaying figure with her twinkling feet her crimson cheeks and parted lips she looked the very spirit of the dance and her enraptured audience only allowed her to stop when she was absolutely breathless oh what a beautiful evening exclaimed elsie when the celebration was finally over was there ever such a dear dear canyon with such dear people in it if it only wouldnt rain and we could live here for ever rain rain stay away come again another day little elsie wants to play recited polly and then everybody went to their straw beds chapter xi breaking camp the thirsty earth soaks up the rain and drinks and gapes for drink again the plants suck in the earth and are with constant drinking fresh and fair but it did rain and it didnt wait until they were out of the canyon either it began long before the proper time and it by no means confined itself to a shower but opened the winter season fully a month before there was any need of it and behaved altogether in a most heartless and inconsiderate manner like a very spoilsport of a rain it began after dark so as to be just as disagreeable as possible and under the too slight cover of their tents the campers could hear the rush and the roar of it like the tramping of myriad feet on the leaves pancho and the two chinamen huddled under the broad sycamores in their rubber blankets and were dry and comfortable but all the waterproof tents leaked save elsies but when it was dawn the sun having heard nothing apparently of any projected change in the weather rose at the usual time in the most resplendent fashion brighter rosier and more gloriously if you will believe me than he had risen that whole long sunshiny summer and he really must have felt paid for getting up at such an unearthly hour in the morning when after he had clambered over the grey mountain peaks he looked down upon las flores canyon bathed in the light of his own golden beams if he knew anything about ancient history and biblical geography and if he didnt i dont know who should inasmuch as he had been present from the beginning of time he must have thought it as fair as the garden of eden for natures face simply shone with cleanliness like that of a smiling child just fresh from its bath and every leaf of every tree glistened as he beamed upon it and shook off its crystal drops that he might turn them into diamonds it was only a shower said dr winship as he seated himself on a damp board and partook of a moist breakfast and with this sun the tents will be dry before night elsie has caught no cold the dust will be laid and we can stay another week with safety everybody was hilarious over this decision save the menofallwork who longed unspeakably for a less poetic existence hop yet particularly who thought camping out not muchee good dicky was more pleased than anybody perhaps as every day in the canyon was one day less in school not that he had ever been to school but he knew in advance instinctively that it wouldnt suit him accordingly he sought the wettest possible places and played all day with superhuman energy he finally found hop yets box of blueing under a tree in a very moist and attractive state of fluidity and just before dinner improved the last shining hour by painting himself a brilliant hue and appearing at dinner in such a fiendish guise that he frightened the family into fits now dr winship was one of the most weatherwise men in california and his predictions were always quite safe and sensible but somehow or other it did rain again in two or three days and it poured harder than ever too to be sure it cleared promptly but the doctor was afraid to trust so fickle a person as the clerk of the weather had become and marching orders were issued the boys tramped over all their favourite bits of country and the girls visited all their best beloved haunts every one of them dear from a thousand charming associations they looked for the last time in mirror pool and saw the reflection of their faces rather grave faces just then over the leavetaking the watermirror might have been glad to keep the picture for ever on its surface margery with her sleek braids and serene forehead with polly saucy nose and mischievous eyes laughing at you like a merry watersprite bell with her brilliant cheeks glowing like two roses just fallen in the brook and gold elsie who if you had put a frame of green leaves about her delicate face and yellow locks would have looked up at you like a waterlily they wafted a farewell to pico negro and having got rid of the boys privately embraced a certain whispering tree under whose singing branches they had been wont to lie and listen to all the murmuring that went on in the forest then they clambered into the great thoroughbrace wagon where they all sat in gloomy silence for ten minutes while dickys tan terrier was found for the fourth time that morning and the long train with its baggagecarts its saddlehorses and its dogged little packmules moved down the rocky steeps that led to civilisation the gate that shut them in from the county road and the outer world was opened for the last time and shut with a clang and it was all overtheir
