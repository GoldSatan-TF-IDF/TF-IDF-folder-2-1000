decision saboteur hero temple of glass retreat space drive phoenix interlude chapter one spaceguard sooner or later it was bound to happen on june moscow escaped destruction by three hours and four thousand kilometres a margin invisibly small by the standards of the universe again on february yet another russian city had a still narrower escape when the second great meteorite of the twentieth century detonated less than four hundred kilometres from vladi vostok with an explosion rivalling that of the newly invented uranium bomb in those days there was nothing that men could do to protect themselves against the last random shots in the cosmic bombardment that had once scarred the face of the moon the meteorites of and had struck uninhabited wilderness but by the end of the twenty first century there was no region left on earth that could be safely used for celestial target practice the human race had spread from pole to pole and so inevitably at gmt on the morning of september in the exceptionally beautiful summer of the year most of the inhabitants of europe saw a dazzling fireball appear in the eastern sky within seconds it was brighter than the sun and as it moved across the heavens at first in utter silence it left behind it a churning column of dust and smoke somewhere above austria it began to disintegrate pro ducing a series of concussions so violent that more than a million people had their hearing permanently damaged they were the lucky ones moving at fifty kilometres a second a thousand tons of rock and metal impacted on the plains of northern italy destroying in a few flaming moments the labour of cen turies the cities of padua and verona were wiped from the face of the earth and the last glories of venice sank for ever beneath the sea as the waters of the adriatic came thundering landwards after the hammerblow from space six hundred thousand people died and the total dam age was more than a trillion dollars but the loss to art to history to science to the whole human race for the rest of time was beyond all computation it was as if a great war had been fought and lost in a single morning and few could draw much pleasure from the fact that as the dust of destruction slowly settled for months the whole world witnessed the most splendid dawns and sunsets since krakatoa after the initial shock mankind reacted with a de termination and a unity that no earlier age could have shown such a disaster it was realized might not occur again for a thousand years but it might occur tomor row and the next time the consequences could be even worse very well there would be no next time a hundred years earlier a much poorer world with far feebler resources had squandered its wealth attempting to destroy weapons launched suicidally by mankind against itself the effort had never been successful but the skills acquired then had not been forgotten now they could be used for a far nobler purpose and on an infinitely vaster stage no meteorite large enough to cause catastrophe would ever again be allowed to breach the defences of earth so began project spaceguard fifty years later and in a way that none of its designers could ever have an ticipated it justified its existence chapter two intruder by the year the marsbased radars were discovering new asteroids at the rate of a dozen a day the space guard computers automatically calculated their orbits and stored away the information in their enormous mem ories so that every few months any interested astronomer could have a look at the accumulated statistics these were now quite impressive it had taken more than a hundred and twenty years to collect the first thousand asteroids since the discovery of ceres largest of these tiny worlds on the very first day of the nineteenth century hundreds had been found and lost and found again they existed in such swarms that one exasperated astronomer had christened them vermin of the skies he would have been appalled to know that spaceguard was now keeping track of half a million only the five giants ceres pallas juno eunomia and vesta were more than two hundred kilometres in dia meter the vast majority were merely oversized boulders that would fit into a small park almost all moved in orbits that lay beyond mars only the few that came far enough sunwards to be a possible danger to earth were the concern of spaceguard and not one in a thousand of these during the entire future history of the solar system would pass within a million kilometres of earth the object first catalogued as according to the year and the order of its discovery was detected while still outside the orbit of jupiter there was nothing un usual about its location many asteroids went beyond saturn before turning once more towards their distant master the sun and thule ii most farranging of all travelled so close to uranus that it might well have been a lost moon of that planet but a first radar contact at such a distance was un precedented clearly must be of exceptional size from the strength of the echo the computers deduced a diameter of at least forty kilometres such a giant had not been discovered for a hundred years that it had been overlooked for so long seemed incredible then the orbit was calculated and the mystery was resolved to be replaced by a greater one was not travelling on a normal asteroidal path along an ellipse which it retraced with clockwork precision every few years it was a lonely wanderer between the stars making its first and last visit to the solar system for it was mov ing so swiftly that the gravitational field of the sun could never capture it it would flash inwards past the orbits of jupiter mars earth venus and mercury gaining speed as it did so until it rounded the sun and headed out once again into the unknown it was at this point that the computers started flashing their hi there we have something interesting sign and for the first time came to the attention of human beings there was a brief flurry of excitement at spaceguard headquarters and the interstellar vagabond was quickly dignified by a name instead of a mere num ber long ago the astronomers had exhausted greek and roman mythology now they were working through the hindu pantheon and so was christened rama for a few days the news media made a fuss of the visitor but they were badly handicapped by the sparsity of information only two facts were known about rama its unusual orbit and its approximate size even this was merely an educated guess based upon the strength of the radar echo through the telescope rama still ap peared as a faint fifteenth magnitude star much too small to show a visible disc but as it plunged in towards the heart of the solar system it would grow brighter and larger month by month before it vanished for ever the orbiting observatories would be able to gather more pre cise information about its shape and size there was plenty of time and perhaps during the next few years some spaceship on its ordinary business might be routed close enough to get good photographs an actual rendez vous was most unlikely the energy cost would be far too great to permit physical contact with an object cutting across the orbits of the planets at more than a hundred thousand kilometres an hour so the world soon forgot about rama but the as tronomers did not their excitement grew with the pass ing months as the new asteroid presented them with more and more puzzles first of all there was the problem of ramas light curve it didnt have one all known asteroids without exception showed a slow variation in their brilliance waxing and waning within a period of a few hours it had been recognized for more than two centuries that this was an inevitable result of their spin and their irregular shape as they toppled end over end along their orbits the reflecting surfaces they presented to the sun were continually changing and their brightness varied accordingly rama showed no such changes either it was not spin ning at all or it was perfectly symmetrical both explana tions seemed equally unlikely there the matter rested for several months because none of the big orbiting telescopes could be spared from their regular job of peering into the remote depths of the universe space astronomy was an expensive hobby and time on a large instrument could easily cost a thou sand dollars a minute dr william stenton would never have been able to grab the farside twohundredmetre reflector for a full quarter of an hour if a more impor tant programme had not been temporarily derailed by the failure of a fifty cent capacitor one astronomers bad luck was his good fortune bill stenton did not know what he had caught until the next day when he was able to get computer time to process his results even when they were finally flashed on his display screen it took him several minutes to under stand what they meant the sunlight reflected from rama was not after all absolutely constant in its intensity there was a very small variation hard to detect but quite unmistakable and extremely regular like all the other asteroids rama was indeed spinning but whereas the normal day for an asteroid was several hours ramas was only four minutes dr stenton did some quick calculations and found it hard to believe the results at its equator this tiny world must be spinning at more than a thousand kilometres an hour it would be rather unhealthy to attempt a landing anywhere except at the poles the centrifugal force at ramas equator must be powerful enough to flick any loose objects away from it at an acceleration of almost one gravity rama was a rolling stone that could never have gathered any cosmic moss it was surprising that such a body had managed to hold itself together and had not long ago shattered into a million fragments an object forty kilometres across with a rotation period of only four minutes where did that fit into the astro nomical scheme of things dr stenton was a somewhat imaginative man a little too prone to jump to conclusions he now jumped to one which gave him a very uncom fortable few minutes indeed the only specimen of the celestial zoo that fitted this description was a collapsed star perhaps rama was a dead sun a madly spinning sphere of neutronium every cubic centimetre weighing billions of tons at this point there flashed briefly through dr stentons horrified mind the memory of that timeless classic h g wellss the star he had first read it as a very small boy and it had helped to spark his interest in astronomy across more than two centuries of time it had lost none of its magic and terror he would never forget the images of hurricanes and tidal waves of cities sliding into the sea as that other visitor from the stars smashed into jupiter and then fell sunwards past the earth true the star that old wells described was not cold but incandes cent and wrought much of its destruction by heat that scarcely mattered even if rama was a cold body reflect ing only the light of the sun it could kill by gravity as easily as by fire any stellar mass intruding into the solar system would completely distort the orbits of the planets the earth had only to move a few million kilometres sunwards or starwards for the delicate balance of climate to be destroyed the antarctic icecap could melt and flood all lowying land or the oceans could freeze and the whole world be locked in an eternal winter just a nudge in either direction would be enough then dr stenton relaxed and breathed a sigh of relief this was all nonsense he should be ashamed of himself rama could not possibly be made of condensed matter no starsized mass could penetrate so deeply into the solar system without producing disturbances which would have betrayed it long ago the orbits of all the planets would have been affected that after all was how neptune pluto and persephone had been discovered no it was utterly impossible for an object as massive as a dead sun to sneak up unobserved in a way it was a pity an encounter with a dark star would have been quite exciting while it lasted chapter three rama and sita the extraordinary meeting of the space advisory coun cil was brief and stormy even in the twentysecond cen tury no way had yet been discovered of keeping elderly and conservative scientists from occupying crucial ad ministrative positions indeed it was doubted if the prob lem ever would be solved to make matters worse the current chairman of the sac was professor olaf davidson the distin guished astrophysicist professor davidson was not very much interested in objects smaller than galaxies and never bothered to conceal his prejudices and though he had to admit that ninety per cent of his science was now based upon observations from spaceborne instruments he was not at all happy about it no less than three times during his distinguished career satellites specially launched to prove one of his pet theories had done pre cisely the opposite the question before the council was straightforward enough there was no doubt that rama was an unusual object but was it an important one in a few months it would be gone for ever so there was little time in which to act opportunities missed now would never recur at rather a horrifying cost a spaceprobe soon to be launched from mars to beyond neptune could be modi fied and sent on a highspeed trajectory to meet rama there was no hope of a rendezvous it would be the fast est flyby on record for the two bodies would pass each other at two hundred thousand kilometres an hour rama would be observed intensively for only a few min utes and in real closeup for less than a second but with the right instrumentation that would be long enough to settle many questions although professor davidson took a very jaundiced view of the neptune probe it had already been approved and he saw no point in sending more good money after bad he spoke eloquently on the follies of asteroidchas ing and the urgent need for a new highresolution inter ferometer on the moon to prove the newlyrevived big bang theory of creation once and for all that was a grave tactical error because the three most ardent supporters of the modified steady state theory were also members of the council they secretly agreed with professor davidson that asteroidchasing was a waste of money nevertheless he lost by one vote three months later the spaceprobe rechristened sita was launched from phobos the inner moon of mars the flight time was seven weeks and the instrument was switched to full power only five minutes before intercep tion simultaneously a cluster of camera pods was re leased to sail past rama so that it could be photo graphed from all sides the first images from ten thousand kilometres away brought to a halt the activities of all mankind on a bib lion television screens there appeared a tiny featureless cylinder growing rapidly second by second by the time it had doubled its size no one could pretend any longer that rama was a natural object its body was a cylinder so geometrically perfect that it might have been turned on a lathe one with centres fifty kilometres apart the two ends were quite flat apart from some small structures at the centre of one face and were twenty kilometres across from a distance when there was no sense of scale rama looked almost comic ally like an ordinary domestic boiler rama grew until it filled the screen its surface was a dull drab grey as colourless as the moon and completely devoid of markings except at one point halfway along the cylinder there was a kilometrewide stain or smear as if something had once hit and splattered ages ago there was no sign that the impact had done the slight est damage to ramas spinning walls but this mark had produced the slight fluctuation in brightness that had led to stentons discovery the images from the other cameras added nothing new however the trajectories their pods tracedthrough ramas minute gravitational field gave one other vital piece of information the mass of the cylinder it was far too light to be a solid body to nobodys great surprise it was clear that rama must be hollow the longhopedfor longfeared encounter had come at last mankind was about to receive its first visitor from the stars chapter four rendezvous commander norton remembered those first tv trans missions which he had replayed so many times during the final minutes of the rendezvous but there was one thing no electronic image could possibly convey and that was ramas overwhelming size he had never received such an impression when land ing on a natural body like the moon or mars those were worlds and one expected them to be big yet he had also landed on jupiter viii which was slightly larger than rama and that had seemed quite a small object it was very easy to resolve the paradox his judgement was wholly altered by the fact that this was an artifact millions of times heavier than anything that man had ever put into space the mass of rama was at least ten million million tons to any spaceman that was not only an aweinspiring but a terrifying thought no wonder that he sometimes felt a sense of insignificance and even depression as that cylinder of sculptured ageless metal filled more and more of the sky there was also a sense of danger here that was wholly novel to his experience in every earlier landing he had known what to expect there was always the possibility of accident but never of surprise with rama surprise was the only certainty now endeavour was hovering less than a thousand metres above the north pole of the cylinder at the very centre of the slowly turning disc this end has been chosen because it was the one in sunlight as rama rotated the shadows of the short enigmatic structures near the axis swept steadily across the metal plain the north ern face of rama was a gigantic sundial measuring out the swift passage of its fourminute day landing a fivethousandton spaceship at the centre of a spinning disc was the least of commander nortons worries it was no different from docking at the axis of a large spacestation endeavours lateral jets had already given her a matching spin and he could trust lieutenant joe calvert to put her down as gently as a snowflake with or without the aid of the nay computer in three minutes said joe without taking his eyes from the display well know if its made of antimatter norton grinned as he recalled some of the more hair raising theories about ramas origin if that unlikely speculation was true in a few seconds there would be the biggest bang since the solar system was formed the total annihilation of ten thousand tons would briefly provide the planets with a second sun yet the mission profile had allowed even for this re mote contingency endeavour had squirted rama with one of her jets from a safe thousand kilometres away nothing whatsoever had happened when the expanding cloud of vapour arrived on target and a matteranti matter reaction involving even a few milligrams would have produced an awesome firework display norton like all space commanders was a cautious man he had looked long and hard at the northern face of rama choosing the point of touchdown after much thought he had decided to avoid the obvious spot the exact centre on the axis itself a clearly marked circular disc a hundred metres in diameter was centred on the pole and norton had a strong suspicion that this must be the outer seal of an enormous airlock the creatures who had built this hollow world must have had some way of taking their ships inside this was the logical place for the main entrance and norton thought it might be un wise to block the front door with his own vessel but this decision generated other problems if endive our touched down even a few metres from the axis ramas rapid spin would start her sliding away from the pole at first the centrifugal force would be very weak but it would be continuous and inexorable com mannered norton did not relish the thought of his ship slithering across the polar plain gaining speed minute by minute until it was slung off into space at a thou sand kilometres an hour when it reached the edge of the disc it was possible that ramas minute gravitational field about one thousandth of earths might prevent this from happening it would hold endeavour against the plain with a force of several tons and if the surface was sufficiently rough the ship might stay near the pole but commander norton had no intention of balancing an un known frictional force against a quite certain centrifugal one fortunately ramas designers had provided an answer equally spaced around the polar axis were three low pill box shaped structures about ten metres in diameter if endeavour touched down between any two of these the centrifugal drift would fetch her up against them and she would be held firmly in place like a ship glued against a quayside by the incoming waves contact in fifteen seconds said joe as he tensed him self above the duplicate controls which he hoped he would not have to touch commander norton became acutely aware of all that had come to focus on this instant of time this surely was the most momentous landing since the first touchdown on the moon a century and a half ago the grey pillboxes drifted slowly upwards outside the control port there was the last hiss of a reaction jet and a barely perceptible jar in the weeks that had passed commander norton had often wondered what he would say at this moment but now that it was upon him history chose his words and he spoke almost automatically barely aware of the echo from the past rama base endeavour has landed as recently as a month ago he would never have believed it possible the ship had been on a routine mission checking and emplacing asteroid warning beacons when the order had come endeavour was the only spacecraft in the solar system which could possibly make a rendezvous with the intruder before it whipped round the sun and hurled itself back towards the stars even so it had been necessary to rob three other ships of the solar survey which were now drifting helplessly until tankers could refuel them norton feared that it would be a long time before the skippers of calypso beagle and challenger would speak to him again even with all this extra propellant it had been a long hard chase rama was already inside the orbit of venus when endeavour caught up with her no other ship could ever do so this privilege was unique and not a moment of the weeks ahead was to be wasted a thousand scientists on earth would have cheerfully mortgaged their souls for this opportunity now they could only watch over the tv circuits biting their lips and thinking how much better they could do the job they were prob ably fight but there was no alternative the inexorable laws of celestial mechanics had decreed that endeavour was the first and the last of all mans ships that would ever make contact with rama the advice he was continually receiving from earth did little to alleviate nortons responsibility if splitsecond decisions had to be made no one could help him the radio timelag to mission control was already ten min utes and increasing he often envied the great navigators of the past before the days of electronic communications who could interpret their sealed orders without continual monitoring from headquarters why they made mistakes no one ever knew yet at the same time he was glad that some decisions could be delegated to earth now that endeavours orbit had coalesced with ramas they were heading sunwards like a single body in forty days they would reach peri helion and pass within twenty million kilometres of the sun that was far too close for comfort long before then endeavour would have to use her remaining fuel to nudge herself into a safer orbit they would have per haps three weeks of exploring time before they parted from rama for ever after that the problem would be earths endeavour would be virtually helpless speeding on an orbit which could make her the first ship to reach the stars in ap proximately fifty thousand years there was no need to worry mission control had promised somehow regard less of cost endeavour would be refuelled even if it proved necessary to send tankers after her and abandon them in space once they had transferred every gramme of propellant rama was a prize worth any risk short of a suicide mission and of course it might even come to that com mander norton had no illusions on this score for the first time in a hundred years an element of total un certainty had entered human affairs uncertainty was one thing that neither scientists nor politicians could toler ate if that was the price of resolving it endeavour and her crew would be expendable chapter five first eva rama was as silent as a tomb which perhaps it was no radio signals on any frequency no vibrations that the seismographs could pick up apart from the microtremors undoubtedly caused by the suns increasing heat no elec trical currents no radioactivity it was almost ominously quiet one might have expected that even an asteroid would be noisier what did we expect norton asked himself a com mittee of welcome he was not sure whether to be dis appointed or relieved the initiative at any rate ap peared up to him his orders were to wait for twentyfour hours then to go out and explore nobody slept much that first day even the crew members not on duty spent their time monitoring the ineffectually probing instruments or simply looking out of the observation ports at the starkly geometrical landscape is this world alive they asked themselves over and over again is it dead or is it merely sleeping on the first eva norton took only one companion lieutcommander karl mercer his tough and resource ful lifesupport officer he had no intention of getting out of sight of the ship and if there was any trouble it was unlikely that a larger party would be safe as a pre caution however he had two more crew members al ready suited up standing by in the airlock the few grammes of weight that ramas combined gravitational and centrifugal fields gave them were neither help nor hindrance they had to rely entirely on their jets as soon as possible norton told himself he would string a catscradle of guide ropes between the ship and the pillboxes so that they could move around without wasting propellants the nearest pillbox was only ten metres from the air lock and nortons first concern was to check that the con tact had caused no damage to the ship endeavours hull was resting against the curving wall with a thrust of see real tons but the pressure was evenly distributed re assured he began to drift around the circular structure trying to determine its purpose norton had travelled only a few metres when he came across an interruption in the smooth apparently metallic wall at first he thought it was some peculiar decoration for it seemed to serve no useful function six radial grooves or slots were deeply recessed in the metal and lying in them were six crossed bars like the spokes of a rimless wheel with a small hub at the centre but there was no way in which the wheel could be turned as it was embedded in the wall then he noticed with growing excitement that there were deeper recesses at the ends of the spokes nicely shaped to accept a clutching hand if one stood so bracing against the wall and pulled on the spoke so smooth as silk the wheel slid out of the wall to his utter astonishment for he had been virtually certain that any moving parts would have become vacuum welded ages ago norton found himself holding a spoked wheel he might have been the captain of some old wind jammer standing at the helm of his ship he was glad that his helmet sunshade did not allow mercer to read his expression he was startled but also angry with himself perhaps he had already made his first mistake were alarms now sounding inside rama and had his thoughtless action already triggered some implacable mechanism but endeavour reported no change its sensors still de tected nothing but faint thermal crepitations and his own movements well skipper are you going to turn it norton thought once more of his instructions use your own discretion but proceed with caution if he checked every single move with mission control he would never get anywhere whats your diagnosis karl he asked mercer its obviously a manual control for an airlock prob ably an emergency backup system in case of power fail ure i cant imagine any technology however advanced that wouldnt take such precautions and it would be failsafe norton told himself it could only be operated if there was no possible danger to the system he grasped two opposing spokes of the windlass braced his feet against the ground and tested the wheel it did not budge give me a hand he asked mercer each took a spoke exerting their utmost strength they were unable to pro duce the slightest movement of course there was no reason to suppose that clocks and corkscrews on rama turned in the same direction as they did on earth lets try the other way suggested mercer this time there was no resistance the wheel rotated almost effortlessly through a full circle then very smoothly it took up the load half a metre away the curving wall of the pillbox started to move like a slowly opening clamshell a few particles of dust driven by wisps of escaping air streamed outwards like dazzling diamonds as the brilliant sunlight caught them the road to rama lay open chapter six committee it had been a serious mistake dr bose often thought to put the united planets headquarters on the moon in evitably earth tended to dominate the proceedings as it dominated the landscape beyond the dome if they had to build here perhaps they should have gone to the far side where that hypnotic disc never shed its rays but of course it was much too late to change and in any case there was no real alternative whether the col onies liked it or not earth would be the cultural and economic overlord of the solar system for centuries to come dr bose had been born on earth and had not emi grated to mars until he was thirty so he felt that he could view the political situation fairly dispassionately he knew now that he would never return to his home planet even though it was only five hours away by shut tle at he was in perfect health but he could not face the reconditioning needed to accustom him to three times the gravity he had enjoyed for most of his life he was exiled for ever from the world of his birth not being a sentimental man this had never depressed him unduly what did depress him sometimes was the need for deal ing year after year with the same familiar faces the marvels of medicine were all very well and certainly he had no desire to put back the clock but there were men around this conference table with whom he had worked for more than half a century he knew exactly what they would say and how they would vote on any given subject he wished that some day one of them would do some thing totally unexpected even something quite crazy and probably they felt exactly the same way about him the rama committee was still manageably small though doubtless that would soon be rectified his six colleagues the up representatives for mercury earth luna ganymede titan and triton were all present in the flesh they had to be electronic diplomacy was not possible over solar system distances some elder states men accustomed to the instantaneous communications which earth had long taken for granted had never re conciled themselves to the fact that radio waves took minutes or even hours to journey across the gulfs be tween the planets cant you scientists do something about it they had been heard to complain bitterly when told that facetoface conversation was impossible between earth and any of its remoter children only the moon had that barely acceptable oneandahalfsecond delay with all the political and psychological conse quences which it implied because of this fact of astro nomical life the moon and only the moon would always be a suburb of earth also present in person were three of the specialists who had been coopted to the committee professor davidson the astronomer was an old acquaintance today he did not seem his usual irascible self dr bose knew nothing of the infighting that had preceded the launch of the first probe to rama but the professors colleagues had not let him forget it dr thelma price was familiar through her numerous television appearances though she had first made her reputation fifty years ago during the archaeological ex plosion that had followed the draining of that vast mar ine museum the mediterranean dr bose could still recall the excitement of that time when the lost treasures of the greeks romans and a dozen other civilizations were restored to the light of day that was one of the few occasions when he was sorry to be living on mars the exobiologist carlisle perera was another obvious choice so was dennis solomons the science historian dr bose was slightly less happy about the presence of conrad taylor the celebrated anthropologist who bad made his reputation by uniquely combining scholarship and eroti cism in his study of puberty rites in late twentiethcen tury beverley hills no one however could possibly have disputed the right of sir lewis sands to be on the committee a man whose knowledge was matched only by his urbanity sir lewis was reputed to lose his composure only when called the arnold toynbee of his age the great historian was not present in person he stub bornly refused to leave earth even for so momentous a meeting as this his stereo image indistinguishable from reality apparently occupied the chair to dr boses right as if to complete the illusion someone had placed a glass of water in front of him dr bose considered that this sort of technological tour de force was an unnecessary gim mick but it was surprising how many undeniably great men were childishly delighted to be in two places at once sometimes this electronic miracle produced comic dis asters he had been at one diplomatic reception where somebody had tried to walk through a stereogram and discovered too late that it was the real person and it was even funnier to watch projections trying to shake hands his excellency the ambassador for mars to the united planets called his wandering thoughts to order cleared his throat and said gentlemen the committee is now in session i think i am correct in saying that this is a gathering of unique talents assembled to deal with a unique situation the directive that the secretarygen eral has given us is to evaluate that situation and to ad vise commander norton when necessary this was a miracle of oversimplification and everyone knew it unless there was a real emergency the commit tee might never be in direct contact with commander norton if indeed he ever heard of its existence for the committee was a temporary creation of the united plan ets science organization reporting through its director to the secretarygeneral it was true that the space sur vey was part of the up but on the operations not the science side in theory this should not make much differ ence there was no reason why the rama committee or anyone else for that matter should not call up com mander norton and offer helpful advice but deep space communications are expensive en deavour could be contacted only through planetcom which was an autonomous corporation famous for the strictness and efficiency of its accounting it took a long time to establish a line of credit with planetcom some where someone was working on this but at the moment planetcoms hardhearted computers did not recognize the existence of the rama committee this commander norton said sir robert mackay the ambassador for earth he has a tremendous re sponsibility what sort of person is he i can answer that said professor davidson his fingers flying over the keyboard of his memory pad he frowned at the screenful of information and started to make an instant synopsis william tsien norton born brisbane oceana educated sydney bombay houston then five years at astrograd specializing in propulsion commissioned rose through usual ranks lieutenant on the third persephone expedition distinguished himself dur ing fifteenth attempt to establish base on venus um um exemplary record dual citizenship earth and mars wife and one child in brisbane wife and two in port lowell with option on third wife asked taylor innocently no child of course snapped the professor before he caught the grin on the others face mild laughter rippled round the table though the overcrowded terrestrials looked more envious than amused after a century of de termined effort earth had still failed to get its popula tion below the target of one billion appointed commanding officer solar survey re search vessel endeavour first voyage to retrograde sat ellites of jupiter um that was a tricky one on aster oid mission when ordered to prepare for this operation managed to beat deadline the professor cleared the display and looked up at his colleagues i think we were extremely lucky considering that he was the only man available at such short notice we might have had the usual runofthemill captain he sounded as if be was referring to the typical peglegged scourge of the spaceways pistol in one hand and cutlass in the other the recordonly proves that hes competent objected the ambassador from mercury population i but growing how will be react in a wholly novel situation like this on earth sir lewis sands cleared his throat a second and a half later he did so on the moon not exactly a novel situation he reminded the her mian even though its three centuries since it last oc curred if rama is dead or unoccupied and so far all the evidence suggests that it is norton is in the position of an archaeologist discovering the ruins of an extinct culture he bowed politely to dr price who nodded in agreement obvious examples are scbliemann at troy or mouhot at angkor vat the danger is minimal though of course accident can never be completely ruled out but what about the boobytraps and trigger mechan isms these pandora people have been talking about asked dr price pandora asked the hermian ambassador quickly whats that its a crackpot movement explained sir robert with as much embarrassment as a diplomat was ever likely to show which is convinced that rama is a grave potential danger a box that shouldnt be opened you know he doubted if the hermian did know classical studies were not encouraged on mercury pandora paranoia snorted conrad taylor oh of course such things are conceivable but why should any intelligent race want to play childish tricks well even ruling out such unpleasantness sir robert continued we still have the much more ominous possi bility of an active inhabited rama then the situation is one of an encounter between two cultures at very diff erent technological levels pizzaro and the incas peary and the japanese europe and africa almost invariably the consequences have been disastrous for one or both parties im not making any recommendations im mere ly pointing out precedents thank you sir robert replied dr bose it was a mild nuisance he thought having two sirs on one small com mittee in these latter days knighthood was an honour which few englishmen escaped im sure weve all thought of these alarming possibilities but if the creat ures inside rama are er malevolent will it really make the slightest difference what we do they might ignore us if we go away what after theyve travelled billions of miles and thousands of years the argument had reached the takeoff point and was now selfsustaining dr bose sat back in his chair said very little and waited for the consensus to emerge it was just as he had predicted everyone agreed that once he had opened the first door it was inconceivable that commander norton should not open the second chapter seven two wives if his wives ever compared his videograms commander norton thought with more amusement than concern it would involve him in a lot of extra work now he could make one long gram and dupe it adding only brief per sonal messages and endearments before shooting the al most identical copies off to mars and earth of course it was highly unlikely that his wives ever would do such a thing even at the concessionary rates allowed to spacemens families it would be expensive and there would be no point in it his families were on excellent terms with each other and exchanged the usual greetings on birthdays and anniversaries yet on the whole perhaps it was just as well that the girls had never met and probably never would myrna had been born on mars and so could not tolerate the high gravity of earth and caroline hated even the twentyfive minutes of the longest possible terrestrial journey sorry im a day late with this transmission said the commander after he had finished the generalpurpose preliminaries but ive been away from the ship for the last thirty hours believe it or not dont be alarmed everything is under control going perfectly its taken us two days but were almost through the airlock complex we could have done it in a couple of hours if wed known what we do now but we took no chances sent remote cameras ahead and cycled all the locks a dozen times to make sure they wouldnt seize up behind us after wed gone through each lock is a simple revolving cylinder with a slot on one side you go in through this opening crank the cyl inder round a hundred and eighty degrees and the slot then matches up with another door so that you can step out of it or float in this case the ramans really made sure of things there are three of these cylinderlocks one after the other just in side the outer hull and below the entry pillbox i cant imagine how even one would fail unless someone blew it up with explosives but if it did there would be a second backup and then a third and thats only the beginning the final lock opens into a straight corridor almost half a kilometre long it looks clean and tidy like everything else weve seen every few metres there are small ports that probably held lights but now everything is completely black and i dont mind telling you scary there are also two parallel slots about a centimetre wide cut in the walls and run ning the whole length of the tunnel we suspect that some kind of shuttle runs inside these to tow equipment or people back and forth it would save us a lot of trouble if we could get it working i mentioned that the tunnel was half a kilometre long well from our seismic soundings we knew thats about the thickness of the shell so obviously we were almost through it and at the end of the tunnel we werent sur prised to find another of those cylindrical airlocks yes and another and another these people seem to have done everything in threes were in the final lock chamber now awaiting the ok from earth before we go through the interior of rama is only a few metres away ill be a lot happier when the suspense is over you know jerry kirchoff my exec whos got such a library of real books that he cant afford to emigrate from earth well jerry told me about a situation just like this back at the beginning of the twentyfirst no twen tieth century an archaeologist found the tomb of an egyptian king the first one that hadnt been looted by robbers his workmen took months to dig their way in chamber by chamber until they came to the final wall then they broke through the masonery and he held out a lantern and pushed his head inside he found himself looking into a whole roomful of treasure incredible stuff gold and jewels perhaps this place is also a tomb it seems more and more likely even now theres still not the slightest sound or hint of any activity well tomorrow we should know commander norton switched the record to hold what else he wondered should he say about the work before he began the separate personal messages to his families normally he never went into so much detail but these circumstances were scarcely normal this might be the last gram he would ever send to those he loved he owed it to them to explain what he was doing by the time they saw these images and heard these words he would be inside rama for better or for worse chapter eight through the hub never before had norton felt so strongly his kinship with that long dead egyptologist not since howard carter had first peered into the tomb of tutankhamen could any man have known a moment such as this yet the comparison was almost laughably ludicrous tutankhamen had been buried only yesterday not even four thousand years ago rama might be older than mankind that little tomb in the valley of the kings could have been lost in the corridors through which they had already passed yet the space that lay beyond this final seal was at least a million times greater and as for the treasure it might hold that was beyond imagina tion no one had spoken over the radio circuits for at least five minutes the welltrained team had not even re ported verbally when all the checks were complete mercer had simply given him the ok sign and waved him towards the open tunnel it was as if everyone real ized that this was a moment for history not to be spoiled by unnecessary smalltalk that suited commander nor ton for at the moment he too had nothing to say he flicked on the beam of his flashlight triggered his jets and drifted slowly down the short corridor trailing his safety line behind him only seconds later he was inside inside what all before him was total darkness not a glimmer of light was reflected back from the beam he bad expected this but he had not really believed it all the calculations had shown that the far wail was tens of kilometres away now his eyes told him that this was in deed the truth as he drifted slowly into that darkness he felt a sudden need for the reassurance of his safety line stronger than any he had ever experienced before even on his very first eva and that was ridiculous he had looked out across the lightyears and the megaparsecs without vertigo why should he be disturbed by a few cubic kilometres of emptiness he was still queasily brooding over this problem when the momentum damper at the end of the line braked him gently to a halt with a barely perceptible rebound he swept the vainlyprobing beam of the flashlight down from the nothingness ahead to examine the surface from which he had emerged he might have been hovering over the centre of a small crater which was itself a dimple in the base of a much larger one on either side rose a complex of ter races and ramps all geometrically precise and obviously artificial which extended for as far as the beam could reach about a hundred metres away he could see the exit of the other two airlock systems identical with this one and that was all there was nothing particularly ex otic or alien about the scene in fact it bore a consider able resemblance to an abandoned mine norton felt a vague sense of disappointment after all this effort there should have been some dramatic even transcendental revelation then he reminded himself that he could see only a couple of hundred metres the darkness beyond his field of view might yet contain more wonders than he cared to face he reported briefly to his anxiouslywaiting compan ions then added im sending out the flare two min utes delay here goes with all his strength he threw the little cylinder straight upwards or outwards and started to count seconds as it dwindled along the beam before he had reached the quarter minute it was out of sight when he had got to a hundred be shielded his eyes and aimed the camera he had always been good at estimating time ht was only two seconds off when the world exploded with light and this time there was no cause for disappoint ment even the millions of candlepower of the flare could not light up the whole of this enormous cavity but now he could see enough to grasp its plan and appreciate its ti tanic scale he was at one end of a hollow cylinder at least ten kilometres wide and of indefinite length from his viewpoint at the central axis he could see such a mass of detail on the curving walls surrounding him that his mind could not absorb more than a minute fraction of it he was looking at the landscape of an entire world by a single flash of lightning and he tried by a deliberate effort of will to freeze the image in his mind all round him the terraced slopes of the crater rose up until they merged into the solid wall that rimmed the sky no that impression was false he must discard the instincts both of earth and of space and reorientate him self to a new system of coordinates he was not at the lowest point of this strange inside out world but the highest from here all directions were down not up if he moved away from this central axis towards the curving wall which he must no longer think of as a wall gravity would steadily increase when he reached the inside surface of the cylinder he could stand upright on it at any point feet towards the stars and head towards the centre of the spinning drum the con cept was familiar enough since the earliest dawn of spaceflight centrifugal force had been used to simulate gravity it was only the scale of this application which was so overwhelming so shocking the largest of all space stations syncsat five was less than two hundred metres in diameter it would take some little while to grow ac customed to one a hundred times that size the tube of landscape which enclosed him was mottled with areas of light and shade that could have been for ests fields frozen lakes or towns the distance and the fading illumination of the flare made identification im possible narrow lines that could be highways canals or welltrained rivers formed a faintly visible geometrical network and far along the cylinder at the very limit of vision was a band of deeper darkness it formed a com plete circle ringing the interior of this world and nor ton suddenly recalled the myth of oceanus the sea which the ancients believed surrounded the earth here perhaps was an even stranger sea not circular but cylindrical before it became frozen in the inter stellar night did it have waves and tides and currents and fish the flare guttered and died the moment of revelation was over but norton knew that as long as he lived these images would be burned on his mind whatever discov eries the future might bring they could never erase this first impression and history could never take from him the privilege of being the first of all mankind to gaze upon the works of an alien civilization chapter nine reconnaissance we have now launched five longdelay flares down the axis of the cylinder and so have a good photocoverage of its full length all the main features are mapped though there are very few that we can identify weve given them provisional names the interior cavity is fifty kilometres long and sixteen wide the two ends are bowlshaped with rather compli cated geometries weve called ours the northern hemi sphere and are establishing our first base here at the axis radiating away from the central hub degrees apart are three ladders that are almost a kilometre long they all end at a terrace or ringshaped plateau that runs right round the bowl and leading on from that continuing the direction of the ladders are three enorm ous stairways which go all the way down to the plain if you imagine an umbrella with only three ribs equally spaced youll have a good idea of this end of rama each of those ribs is a stairway very steep near the axis and then slowly flattening out as it approaches the plain below the stairways weve called them alpha beta gamma arent continuous but break at five more circular terraces we estimate there must be between twenty and thirty thousand steps presumably they were only used for emergencies since its inconceivable that the ramans or whatever were going to call them had no better way of reaching the axis of their world the southern hemisphere looks quite different for one thing it has no stairways and no flat central hub instead theres a huge spike kilometres long jutting along the axis with six smaller ones around it the whole arrangement is very odd and we cant imagine what it means the fiftykilometrelong cylindrical section between the two bowls weve called the central plain it may seem crazy to use the word plain to describe something so obviously curved but we feel its justified it will appear flat to us when we get down there just as the interior of a bottle must seem flat to an ant crawling round inside it the most striking feature of the central plain is the tenkilometrewide dark band running completely round it at the halfway mark it looks like ice so weve christ ened it the cylindrical sea right out in the middle theres a large oval island about ten kilometres long and three wide and covered with tall structures because it reminds us of old manhattan weve called it new york yet i dont think its a city it seems more like an enorm ous factory or chemical processing plant but there are some cities or at any rate towns at least six of them if they were built for human beings they could each hold about fifty thousand people weve called them rome peking paris moscow london tokyo they are linked with highways and something that seems to be a rail system there must be enough material for centuries of re search in this frozen carcass of a world weve four thou sand square kilometres to explore and only a few weeks to do it in i wonder if well ever learn the answer to the two mysteries that have been haunting me ever since we got inside who were they and what went wrong the recording ended on earth and moon the mem bers of the rama committee relaxed then started to ex amine the maps and photographs spread in front of them though they had already studied these for many hours commander nortons voice added a dimension which no pictures could convey he had actually been there had looked with his own eyes across this extraordinary inside out world during the brief moments while its agelong night had been illuminated by the flares and he was the man who would lead any expedition to explore it dr perera i believe you have some comments to make ambassador bose wondered briefly if he should have first given the floor to professor davidson as senior scien tist and the only astronomer but the old cosmologist still seemed to be in a mild state of shock and was clearly out of his element all his professional career he had looked upon the universe as an arena for the titanic impersonal forces of gravitation magnetism radiation he had never believed that life played an important role in the scheme of things and regarded its appearance on earth mars and jupiter as an accidental aberration but now there was proof that life not only existed out side the solar system but had scaled heights far beyond anything that man had achieved or could hope to reach for centuries to come moreover the discovery of rama challenged another dogma that professor olaf had preached for years when pressed he would reluctantly admit that life probably did exist in other star systems but it was absurd he had always maintained to imagine that it could ever cross the interstellar gulfs perhaps the ramans had indeed failed if commander norton was correct in believing that their world was now a tomb but at least they had attempted the feat on a scale which indicated a high confidence in the outcome if such a thing had happened once it must surely have happened many times in this galaxy of a hundred thou sand million suns and someone somewhere would eventually succeed this was the thesis which without proof but with con siderable armwaving dr carlisle perera had been preach ing for years he was now a very happy man though also a most frustrated one rama had spectacularly confirmed his views but he could never set foot inside it or even see it with his own eyes if the devil had suddenly appeared and offered him the gift of instantaneous tele portation he would have signed the contract without bothering to look at the small print yes mr ambassador i think i have some information of interest what we have here is undoubtedly a space ark its an old idea in the astronautical literature ive been able to trace it back to the british physicist j d bernal who proposed this method of interstellar colon ization in a book published in yes two hundred years ago and the great russian pioneer tsiolkovski put forward somewhat similar proposals even earlier if you want to go from one star system to another you have a number of choices assuming that the speed of light is an absolute limit and thats still not completely settled despite anything you may have heard to the con trary there was an indignant sniff but no formal pro test from professor davidson you can make a fast trip in a small vessel or a slow journey in a giant one there seems no technical reason why spacecraft can not reach ninety per cent or more of the speed of light that would mean a travel time of five to ten years be tween neighbouring stars tedious perhaps but not impracticable especially for creatures whose life spans might be measured in centuries one can imagine voyages of this duration carried out in ships not much larger than ours but perhaps such speeds are impossible with reason able payloads remember you have to carry the fuel to slow down at the end of the voyage even if youre on a oneway trip so it may make more sense to take your time ten thousand a hundred thousand years bernal and others thought this could be done with mobile worldlets a few kilometres across carrying thou sands of passengers on journeys that would last for gen erations naturally the system would have to be rigidly closed recycling all food air and other expendables but of course thats just how the earth operates on a slightly larger scale some writers suggested that these space arks should be built in the form of concentric spheres others pro posed hollow spinning cylinders so that centrifugal force could provide artificial gravity exactly what weve found in rama professor davidson could not tolerate this sloppy talk no such thing as centrifugal force its an engineers phantom theres only inertia youre quite right of course admitted perera though it might be hard to convince a man whod just been slung off a carousel but mathematical rigour seems unneces sary hear hear interjected dr bose with some exaspera tion we all know what you mean or think we do please dont destroy our illusions well i was merely pointing out that theres nothing conceptually novel about rama though its size is start ling men have imagined such things for two hundred years now id like to address myself to another question exactly how long has rama been travelling through space we now have a very precise determination of its orbit and its velocity assuming that its made no navigational changes we can trace its position back for millions of years we expected that it would be coming from the direction of a nearby star but that isnt the case at all its more than two hundred thousand years since rama passed near any star and that particular one turns out to be an irregular variable about the most unsuit able sun you could imagine for an inhabited solar system it has a brightness range of over fifty to one any planets would be alternately baked and frozen every few years a suggestion put in dr price perhaps that explains everything maybe this was once a normal sun and be came unstable thats why the ramans had to find a new one dr perera admired the old archaeologist so he let her down lightly but what would she say he wondered if he started pointing out the instantly obvious in her own speciality we did consider that he said gently but if our pre sent theories of stellar evolution are correct this star could never have been stable could never have had life bearing planets so rama has been cruising through space for at least two hundred thousand years and per haps for more than a million now its cold and dark and apparently dead and i think i know why the ramans may have had no choice perhaps they were indeed fleeing from some disaster but they miscalculated no closed ecology can be one hundred per cent effici ent there is always waste loss some degradation of the environment and buildup of pollutants it may take bil lions of years to poison and wear out a planet but it will happen in the end the oceans will dry up the at mosphere will leak away by our standards rama is enormous yet it is still a very tiny planet my calculations based on the leakage through its hull and some reasonable guesses about the rate of biological turnover indicate that its ecology could only survive for about a thousand years at the most ill grant ten thousand that would be long enough at the speed rama is travelling for a transit between the closelypacked suns in the heart of the galaxy but not out here in the scat tered population of the spiral arms rama is a ship which exhausted its provisions before it reached its goal its a derelict drifting among the stars theres just one serious objection to this theory and ill raise it before anybody else does ramas orbit is aimed so accurately at the solar system that coincidence seems ruled out in fact id say its now heading much too close to the sun for comfort endeavour will have to break away long before perihelion to avoid overheating i dont pretend to understand this perhaps there ma be some form of automatic terminal guidance still oper ating steering rama to the nearest suitable star ages after its builders are dead and they are dead ill stake my reputation on that all the samples weve taken from the interior are absol utely sterile weve not found a single microorganism as for the talk you may have heard about suspended animation you can ignore it there are fundamental reasons why hibernation techniques will only work for a very few centuries and were dealing with time spans a thousandfold longer so the pandorans and their sympathizers have nothing to worry about for my part im sorry it would have been wonderful to have met another intelligent species but at least we have answered one ancient question we are not alone the stars will never again be the same to us chapter ten descent into darkness commander norton was sorely tempted but as captain his first duty was to his ship if anything went badly wrong on this initial probe he might have to run for it so that left his second officer lieutcommander mer cer as the obvious choice norton willingly admitted that karl was better suited for the mission the authority on lifesupport systems macer had writ ten some of the standard textbooks on the subject he had personally checked out innumerable types of equip ment often under hazardous conditions and his biofeed back control was famous at a moments notice he could cut his pulserate by fifty per cent and reduce respiration to almost zero for up to ten minutes these useful little tricks had saved his life on more than one occasion yet despite his great ability and intelligence he was almost wholly lacking in imagination to him the most dangerous experiments or missions were simply jobs that had to be done he never took unnecessary risks and had no use at all for what was commonly regarded as courage the two mottoes on his desk summed up his philos ophy of life one asked what have you forgotten the other said help stamp our bravery the fact that he was widely regarded as the bravest man in the fleet was the only thing that ever made him angry given mercer that automatically selected the next man his inseparable companion lt joe calvert it was hard to see what the two had in common the lightly built rather highly strung navigating officer was ten years younger than his stolid and imperturbable friend who certainly did not share his passionate interest in the art of the primitive cinema but no one can predict where lightning will strike and years ago mercer and calvert had established an appar ently stable liaison that was common enough much more unusual was the fact that they also shared a wife back on earth who had borne each of them a child commander norton hoped that he could meet her one day she must be a very remarkable woman the triangle had lasted for at least five years and still seemed to be an equilateral one two men were not enough for an exploring team long ago it had been found that three was the optimum for if one man was lost two might still escape where a single survivor would be doomed after a good deal of thought norton had chosen technical sergeant willard myron a mechanical genius who could make anything work or design something better if it wouldnt myron was the ideal man to identify alien pieces of equipment on a long sabbatical from his regular job as associate pro fessor at astrotech the sergeant had refused to accept a commission on the grounds that he did not wish to block the promotion of more deserving career officers no one took this explanation very seriously and it was generally agreed that will rated zero for ambition he might make it to space sergeant but would never be a full professor myron like countless ncos before him had discovered the ideal compromise between power and responsibility as they drifted through the last airlock and floated out along the weightless axis of rama lt calvert found him self as he so often did in the middle of a movie flash back he sometimes wondered if he should attempt to cure himself of this habit but he could not see that it had any disadvantages it could make even the dullest situa tions interesting and who could tell one day it might save his life he would remember what fairbanks or connery or hiroshi had done in similar circumstances this time he was about to go over the top in one of the earlytwentiethcentury wars mercer was the sergeant leading a threeman patrol on a night raid into nomans land it was not too difficult to imagine that they were at the bottom of an immense shellcrater though one that had somehow become neatly tailored into a series of ascending terraces the crater was flooded with light from three widelyspaced plasmaarcs which gave an al most shadowless illumination over the whole interior but beyond that over the rim of the most distant ter race was darkness and mystery in his minds eye calvert knew perfectly well what lay there first there was the flat circular plain over a kilo metre across trisecting it into three equal parts and looking very much like broad railroad tracks were three wide ladders their rungs recessed into the surface so that they would provide no obstruction to anything sliding over it since the arrangement was completely symmetri cal there was no reason to choose one ladder rather than another that nearest to airlock alpha had been selected purely as a matter of convenience though the rungs of the ladders were uncomfortably far apart that presented no problem even at the rim of the hub half a kilometre from the axis gravity was still barely one thirtieth of earths although they were carry ing almost a hundred kilos of equipment and lifesupport gear they would still be able to move easily handover hand commander norton and the backup team accompan ied them along the guide ropes that had been stretched from airlock alpha to the rim of the crater then beyond the range of the floodlighis the darkness of rama lay before them all that could be seen in the dancing beams of the helmet lights was the first few hundred metres of the ladder dwindling away across a flat and otherwise featureless plain and now karl mercer told himself i have to make my first decision am i going up that ladder or down it the question was not a trivial one they were still essentially in zero gravity and the brain could select any reference system it pleased by a simple effort of will mercer could convince himself that he was looking out across a horizontal plain or up the face of a vertical wall or over the edge of a sheer cliff not a few astronauts had experienced grave psychological problems by choosing the wrong coordinates when they started on a compli cated job mercer was determined to go headfirst for any other mode of locomotion would be awkward moreover this way he could more easily see what was in front of him for the first few hundred metres therefore he would im agine he was climbing upwardsd only when the increasing pull of gravity made it impossible to maintain the illu sion would he switch his mental directions one hundred and eighty degrees he grasped the first rung and gently propelled himself along the ladder movement was as effortless as swim ming along the seabed more so in fact for there was no backward drag of water it was so easy that there was a temptation to go too fast but mercer was much too ex perienced to hurry in a situation as novel as this in his earphones he could hear the regular breathing of his two companions he needed no other proof that they were in good shape and wasted no time in conver sation though he was tempted to look back he decided not to risk it until they had reached the platform at the end of the ladder the rungs were spaced a uniform half metre apart and for the first portion of the climb mercer missed the alter nate ones but he counted them carefully and at around two hundred noticed the first distinct sensations of weight the spin of rama was starting to make itself felt at rung four hundred he estimated that his apparent weight was about five kilos this was no problem but it was now getting hard to pretend that he was climbing when he was being firmly dragged upwards the five hundredth rung seemed a good place to pause he could feel the muscles in his arms responding to the unaccustomed exercise even though rama was now doing all the work and he had merely to guide him self everything ok skipper he reported were just pass ing the halfway mark joe will any problems im fine what are you stopping for joe calvert an swered same here added sergeant myron but watch out for the coriolis force its starting to build up so mercer had already noticed when he let go of the rungs he had a distinct tendency to drift off to the right he knew perfectly well that this was merely the effect of ramas spin but it seemed as if some mysterious force was gently pushing him away from the ladder perhaps it was time to start going feetfirst now that down was beginning to have a physical meaning he would run the risk of a momentary disorientation watch out im going to swing round holding firmly on to the rung he used his arms to twist himself round a hundred and eighty degrees and found himself momentarily blinded by the lights of his companions far above them and now it really was above he could see a fainter glow along the rim of the sheer cliff silhouetted against it were the figures of com mander norton and the backup team watching him in tently they seemed very small and far away and he gave them a reassuring wave he released his grip and let ramas still feeble pseudo gravity take over the drop from one rung to the next required more than two seconds on earth in the same time a man would have fallen thirty metres the rate of fall was so painfully slow that he hurried things up a trifle by pushing with his hands gliding over spans of a dozen rungs at a time and checking himself with his feet whenever he felt he was travelling too fast at rung seven hundred he came to another halt and swung the beam of his helmetlamp downwards as he had calculated the beginning of the stairway was only fifty metres below a few minutes later they were on the first step it was a strange experience after months in space to stand up right on a solid surface and to feel it pressing against ones feet their weight was still less than ten kilogrammes but that was enough to give a feeling of stability when he closed his eyes mercer could believe that he once more had a real world beneath him the ledge or platform from which the stairway des cended was about ten metres wide and curved upwards on each side until it disappeared into the darkness mer cer knew that it formed a complete circle and that if he walked along it for five kilometres he would come right back to his startingpoint having circumnavigated rama at the fractional gravity that existed here however real walking was impossible one could only bound along in giant strides and therein lay danger the stairway that swooped down into the darkness far below the range of their lights would be deceptively easy to descend but it would be essential to hold on to the tall handrail that flanked it on either side too bold a step might send an incautious traveller arching far out into space he would hit the surface again perhaps a hundred metres lower down the impact would be harmless but its consequences might not be for the spin of rama would have moved the stairway off to the left and so a falling body would hit against the smooth curve that swept in an unbroken arc to the plain almost seven kilometres below that mercer told himself would be a hell of a tobog gan ride the terminal speed even in this gravity could be several hundred kilometres an hour perhaps it would be possible to applyenough friction to check such a head long descent if so this might even be the most con venient way to reach the inner surface of rama but some very cautious experimenting would be necessary first skipper reported mercer there were no problems getting down the ladder if you agree id like to continue towards the next platform i want to time our rate of descent on the stairway norton replied without hesitation go ahead he did not need to add proceed with cau tion it did not take mercer long to make a fundamental discovery it was impossible at least at this onetwentieth ofagravity level to walk down the stairway in the nor mal manner any attempt to do so resulted in a slow motion dreamlike movement that was intolerably tedi ous the only practical way was to ignore the steps and to use the handrail to pull oneself downwards calvert had come to the same conclusion this stairway was built to walk up not down he exclaimed you can use the steps when youre moving against gravity but theyre just a nuisance in this direc tion it may not be dignified but i think the best way down is to slide along the handrail thats ridiculous protested sergeant myron i cant believe the ramans did it this way i doubt if they ever used this stairway its obviously only for emergencies they must have had some mech anical transport system to get up here a funicular per haps that would explain those long slots running down from the hub i always assumed they were drains but i suppose they could be both i wonder if it ever rained here probably said mercer but i think joe is right and to hell with dignity here we go the handrail presumably it was designed for some thing like hands was a smooth flat metal bar supported on widelyspaced pillars a metre high commander mer cer straddled it carefully gauged the braking power he could exert with his hands and let himself slide very sedately slowly picking up speed he descended into the darkness moving in the pool of light from his helmetlamp he had gone about fifty metres when he called the others to join him none would admit it but they all felt like boys again sliding down the banisters in less than two minutes they had made a kilometre descent in safety and comfort whenever they felt they were going too fast a tightened grip on the handrail provided all the braking that was necessary i hope you enjoyed yourselves commander norton called when they stepped off at the second platform climbing back wont be quite so easy thats what i want to check replied mercer who was walking experimentally back and forth getting the feel of the increased gravity its already a tenth of a gee here you really notice the difference he walked or more accurately glided to the edge of the platform and shone his helmetlight down the next section of the stairway as far as his beam could reach it appeared identical with the one above though careful examination of photos had shown that the height of the steps steadily decreased with the rising gravity the stair had apparently been designed so that the effort required to climb it was more or less constant at every point in its long curving sweep mercer glanced up towards the hub of rama now al most two kilometres above him the little glow of light and the tiny figures silhouetted against it seemed hor ribly far away for the first time he was suddenly glad that he could not see the whole length of this enormous stairway despite his steady nerves and lack of imagina tion he was not sure how he would react if he could see himself like an insect crawling up the face of a vertical saucer more than sixteen kilometres high and with the upper half overhanging above him until this moment he had regarded the darkness as a nuisance now he al most welcomed it theres no change of temperature he reported to commander norton still just below freezing but the airpressure is up as we expected around three hundred millibars even with this low oxygen content its almost breathable further down there will be no problems at all that will simplify exploration enormously what a find the first world on which we can walk without breathing gear in fact im going to take a sniff up on the hub commander norton stirred a little uneasily but mercer of all men knew exactly what he was doing he would already have made enough tests to satisfy himself mercer equalized pressure unlatched the securing clip of his helmet and opened it a crack he took a cautious breath then a deeper one the air of rama was dead and musty as if from a tomb so ancient that the last trace of physical corruption had disappeared ages ago even mercers ultrasensitive nose trained through years of testing lifesupport systems to and beyond the point of disaster could detect no re cognizable odours there was a faint metallic tang and he suddenly recalled that the first men on the moon had reported a hint of burnt gunpowder when they repres surized the lunar module mercer imagined that the moondustcontaminated cabin on eagle must have smelled rather like rama he sealed the helmet again and emptied his lungs of the alien air he had extracted no sustenance from it even a mountaineer acclimatized to the summit of ever est would die quickly here but a few kilometres further down it would be a different matter what else was there to do here he could think of nothing except the enjoyment of the gentle unaccust omed gravity but there was no point in growing used to that since they would be returning immediately to the weightlessness of the hub were coming back skipper he reported theres no reason to go further until were ready to go all the way i agree well be timing you but take it easy as he bounded up the steps three or four at a stride mercer agreed that calvert had been perfectly correct these stairs were built to be walked up not down as long as one did not look back and ignored the vertiginous steepness of the ascending curve the climb was a delight ful experience after about two hundred steps however he began to feel some twinges in his calf muscles and decided to slow down the others had done the same when he ventured a quick glance over his shoulder they were considerably further down the slope the climb was wholly uneventful merely an appar ently endless succession of steps when they stood once more on the highest platform immediately beneath the ladder they were barely winded and it had taken them only ten minutes they paused for another ten then started on the last vertical kilometre jump catch hold of a rung jump catch jump catch it was easy but so boringly repetitious that there was danger of becoming careless halfway up the ladder they rested for five minutes by this time their arms as well as their legs had begun to ache once again mercer was glad that they could see so little of the vertical face to which they were clinging it was not too difficult to pre tend that the ladder only extended just a few metres be yond their circle of light and would soon come to an end jump catch a rung jump then quite suddenly the ladder really ended they were back at the weightless world of the axis among their anxious friends the whole trip had taken under an hour and they felt a sense of modest achievement but it was much too soon to feel pleased with them selves for all their efforts they had traversed less than an eighth of that cyclopean stairway chapter eleven men women and monkeys some women commander norton had decided long ago should not be allowed aboard ship weightlessness did things to their breasts that were too damn distracting it was bad enough when they were motionless but when they started to move and sympathetic vibrations set in it was more than any warmblooded male should be asked to take he was quite sure that at least one serious space accident had been caused by acute crew distraction after the transit of a wellupholstered lady officer through the control cabin he had once mentioned this theory to surgeoncom mander laura ernst without revealing who had inspired his particular train of thought there was no need they knew each other much too well on earth years ago in a moment of mutual loneliness and depression they had once made love probably they would never repeat the experience because so much had changed for both of them yet whenever the wellbuilt surgeon oscillated into the com manders cabin he felt a fleeting echo of an old passion she knew that he felt it and everyone was happy bill she began ive checked our mountaineers and heres my verdict karl and joe are in good shape all indications normal for the work theyve done but will shows signs of exhaustion and bodyloss i wont bother about the details i dont believe hes been getting all the exercise he should and hes not the only one theres been some cheating in the centrifuge if theres any more heads will roll please pass the word yes maam but theres some excuse the men have been working very hard with their brains and fingers certainly but not with their bodies not real work in kilogrammemetres and thats what well be dealing with if were going to ex plore rama well can we yes if we proceed with caution karl and i have worked out a very conservative profile based on the assumption that we can dispense with breathing gear be low level two of course thats an incredible stroke of luck and changes the whole logistics picture i still cant get used to the idea of a world with oxygen so we only need to supply food and water and thermosuits and we re in business going down will be easy it looks as if we can slide most of the way on that very convenient banister ive got chips working on a sled with parachute brak ing even if we cant risk it for crew we can use it for stores and equipment fine that should do the trip in ten minutes otherwise it will take about an hour climbing up is harder to estimate id like to allow six hours including two onehour periods later as we get experience and develop some muscles we may be able to cut this back considerably what about psychological factors hard to assess in such a novel environment darkness may be the biggest problem ill establish searchlights on the hub besides its own lamps any party down there will always have a beam play ing on it good that should be a great help one other point should we play safe and send a party only halfway down the stair and back or should we go the whole way on the first attempt if we had plenty of time id be cautious but time is short and i can see no danger in going all the way and looking around when we get there thanks laura thats all i want to know ill get the exec working on the details and ill order all hands to the centrifuge twenty minutes a day at half a gee will that satisfy you no its point six gee down there in rama and i want a safety margin make it three quarters ouch for ten minutes ill settle for that twice a day laura youre a cruel hard woman but so be it ill break the news just before dinner that should spoil a few appetites it was the first time that commander norton had ever seen karl mercer slightly ill at ease he had spent the fifteen minutes discussing the logistics problem in his usual competent manner but something was obviously worrying him his captain who had a shrewd idea of what it was waited patiently until he brought it out skipper karl said at length are you sure you should lead this party if anything goes wrong im considerably more expendable and ive been further inside rama than anyone else even if only by fifty metres granted but its time the commander led his troops and weve decided that theres no greater risk on this trip than on the last at the first sign of trouble ill be back up that stairway fast enough to qualify for the lunar olympics he waited for any further objections but none came though karl still looked unhappy so he took pity on him and added gently and i bet joe will beat me to the top the big man relaxed and a slow grin spread across his face all the same bill i wish youd taken someone else i wanted one man whod been down before and we can t both go as for herr doctor professor sergeant myron laura says hes still two kilos overweight even shaving off that moustache didnt help whos your number three i still havent decided that depends on laura she wants to go herself who doesnt but if she turns up at the top of her own fitness list ill be very suspicious as lieutcommander mercer gathered up his papers and launched himself out of the cabin norton felt a brief stab of envy almost all the crew about eightyfive per cent by his minimum estimate had worked out some sort of emotional accommodation he had known ships where the captain had done the same but that was not his way though discipline aboard the endeavour was based very largely on the mutual respect between highly trained and intelligent men and women the com mander needed something more to underline his posi tion his responsibility was unique and demanded a cer tain degree of isolation even from his closest friends any liaison could be damaging to morale for it was almost impossible to avoid charges of favouritism for this rea son affairs spanning more than two degrees of rank were firmly discouraged but apart from this the only rule regulating shipboard sex was so long as they dont do it in the corridors and frighten the simps there were four superchimps aboard endeavour though strictly speaking the name was inaccurate be cause the ships nonhuman crew was not based on chim panzee stock in zero gravity a prehensile tail is an enormous advantage and all attempts to supply these to humans had turned into embarrassing failures after equally unsatisfactory results with the great apes the superchimpanzee corporation had turned to the monkey kingdom blackie blondie goldie and brownie had family trees whose branches included the most intelligent of the old and new world monkeys plus synthetic genes that had never existed in nature their rearing and education had probably cost as much as that of the average spaceman and they were worth it each weighed less than thirty kilos and consumed only half the food and oxygen of a human being but each could replace men for house keeping elementary cooking toolcarrying and dozens of other routine jobs that was the corporations claim based on in numerable timeandmotion studies the figure though surprising and frequently challenged appeared to be ac curate for simps were quite happy to work fifteen hours a day and did not get bored by the most menial and repeti tious tasks so they freed human beings for human work and on a spaceship that was a matter of vital importance unlike the monkeys who were their nearest relatives endeavours simps were docile obedient and uninquisi tive being cloned they were also sexless which elimi nated awkward behavioural problems carefully house trained vegetarians they were very clean and didnt smell they would have made perfect pets except that nobody could possibly have afforded them despite these advantages having simps on board in volved certain problems they had to have their own quarters inevitably labelled the monkey house their little messroom was always spotless and was well equipped with tv games equipment and programmed teaching machines to avoid accidents they were absol utely forbidden to enter the ships technical areas the entrances to all these were colourcoded in red and the simps were conditioned so that it was psychologically im possible for them to pass the visual barriers there was also a communications problem though they had an equivalent iq of sixty and could understand several hundred words of english they were unable to talk it had proved impossible to give useful vocal chords either to apes or monkeys and they therefore had to ex press themselves in sign language the basic signs were obvious and easily learned so that everyone on board ship could understand routine mes sages but the only man who could speak fluent simpish was their handler chief steward mcandrews it was a standing joke that sergeant ravi mcandrews looked rather like a simp which was hardly an insult for with their short tinted pelts and graceful movements they were very handsome animals they were also affec tionate and everyone on board had his favourite com mander nortons was the aptlynamed goldie but the warm relationship which one could so easily establish with simps created another problem often used as a powerful argument against their employment in space since they could only be trained for routine low grade tasks they were worse than useless in an emerg ency they could then be a danger to themselves and to their human companions in particular teaching them to use spacesuits had proved impossible the concepts in volved being quite beyond their understanding no one liked to talk about it but everybody knew what had to be done if a hull was breached or the order came to abandon ship it had happened only once then the simp handler had carried out his instructions more than adequately he was found with his charges killed by the same poison thereafter the job of euthing was transferred to the chief medical officer who it was felt would have less emotional involvement norton was very thankful that this responsibility at least did not fall upon the captains shoulders he had known men he would have killed with far fewer qualms than he would goldie chapter twelve the stairway of the gods in the clear cold atmosphere of rama the beam of the searchlight was completely invisible three kilometres down from the central hub the hundredmetre wide oval of light lay across a section of that colossal stairway a brilliant oasis in the surrounding darkness it was sweep ing slowly towards the curved plain still five kilometres below and in its centre moved a trio of antlike figures casting long shadows before them it had been just as they had hoped and expected a completely uneventful descent they had paused briefly at the first platform and norton had walked a few hun dred metres along the narrow curving ledge before start ing the slide down to the second level here they had discarded their oxygen gear and revelled in the strange luxury of being able to breathe without mechanical aids now they could explore in comfort freed from the great est danger that confronts a man in space and forgetting all worries about suit integrity and oxygen reserve by the time they had reached the fifth level and there was only one more section to go gravity had reached al most half its terrestrial value ramas centrifugal spin was at last exerting its real strength they were surrender ing themselves to the implacable force which rules every planet and which can exert a merciless price for the smallest slip it was still very easy to go downwards but the thought of the return up those thousands upon thou sands of steps was already beginning to prey upon their minds the stairway had long ago ceased its vertiginous downward plunge and was now flattening out towards the horizontal the gradient was now only about s in at the beginning it had been in i normal walking was now both physically and psychologically acceptable only the lowered gravity reminded them that they were not descending some great stairway on earth norton had once visited the ruins of an aztec temple and the feelings he had then experienced came echoing back to him amplified a hundred times here was the same sense of awe and mystery and the sadness of the irrevocably van ished past yet the scale here was so much greater both in time and space that the mind was unable to do it justice after a while it ceased to respond norton wondered if sooner or later he would take even rama for granted and there was another respect in which the parallel with terrestrial ruins failed completely rama was hun dreds of times older than any structure that had survived on earth even the great pyramid but everything looked absolutely new there was no sign of wear and tear norton had puzzled over this a good deal and had arrived at a tentative explanation everything that they had so far examined was part of an emergency backup system very seldom put to actual use he could not imag ine that the ramans unless they were physical fitness fanatics of the kind not uncommon on earth ever walked up and down this incredible stairway or its two identical companions completing the invisible y far above his head perhaps they had only been required during the actual construction of rama and had served no purpose since that distant day that theory would do for the moment yet it did not feel right there was some thing wrong somewhere they did not slide for the last kilometre but went down the steps two at a time in long gentle strides this way norton decided they would give more exercise to muscles that would soon have to be used and so the end of the stairway came upon them almost unawares sud denly there were no more steps only a flat plain dull grey in the now weakening beam of the hub searchlight fading away into the darkness a few hundred metres ahead norton looked back along the beam towards its source up on the axis more than eight kilometres away he knew that mercer would be watching through the telescope so he waved to him cheerfully captain here he reported over the radio everyone in fine shape no problems proceeding as planned good replied mercer well be watching there was a brief silence then a new voice cut in this is the exec on board ship really skipper this isnt good enough you know the news services have been screaming at us for the last week i dont expect deathless prose but cant you do better than that ill try norton chuckled but remember theres nothing to see yet its like well being on a huge dark ened stage with a single spotlight the first few hundred steps of the stairway rise out of it until they disappear into the darkness overhead what we can see of the plain looks perfectly flat the curvatures too small to be vis ible over this limited area and thats about it like to give any impressions well its still very cold below freezing and were glad of our thermosuits and quiet of course quieter than anything ive ever known on earth or in space where theres always some background noise here every sound is swallowed up the space around us is so enormous that there arent any echoes its weird but i hope well get used to it thanks skipper anyone else joe boris lt joe calvert never at a loss for words was happy to oblige i cant help thinking that this is the first time ever that weve been able to walk on another world breath ing its natural atmosphere though i suppose natural is hardly the word you can apply to a place like this still rama must resemble the world of its builders our own spaceships are all miniature earths two examples are damned poor statistics but does this mean that all in telligent lifeforms are oxygen eaters what weve seen of their work suggests that the ramans were humanoid though perhaps about fifty per cent taller than we are wouldnt you agree boris is joe teasing boris norton asked himself i wonder how hes going to react to all his shipmates boris rodrigo was something of an enigma the quiet dignified communications officer was popular with the rest of the crew but he never en tered fully into their activities and always seemed a little apart marching to the music of a different drummer as indeed he was being a devout member of the fifth church of christ cosmonaut norton had never been able to discover what had happened to the earlier four and he was equally in the dark about the churchs rituals and ceremonies but the main tenet of its faith was well known it believed that jesus christ was a visitor from space and had constructed an entire theology on that assumption it was perhaps not surprising that an unusually high proportion of the churchs devotees worked in space in some capacity or other invariably they were efficient conscientious and absolutely reliable they were univers ally respected and even liked especially as they made no attempt to convert others yet there was also something slightly spooky about them norton could never under stand how men with advanced scientific and technical training could possibly believe some of the things he had heard christers state as incontrovertible facts as he waited for lt rodrigo to answer joes possibly loaded question the commander had a sudden insight into his own hidden motives he had chosen boris be cause he was physically fit technically qualified and completely dependable at the same time he wondered if some part of his mind had not selected the lieutenant out of an almost mischievous curiosity how would a man with such religious beliefs react to the awesome reality of rama suppose he encountered something that con founded his theology or for that matter confirmed it but boris rodrigo with his usual caution refused to be drawn they were certainly oxygen breathers and they could be humanoid but lets wait and see with any luck we should discover what they were like there may be pic tures statues perhaps even bodies over in those towns if they are towns and the nearest is only eight kilometres away said joe calvert hopefully yes thought the commander but its also eight kilo metres back and then theres that overwhelming stair way to climb again can we take the risk a quick sortie to the town which they had named paris had been among the first of his contingency plans and now he had to make his decision they had ample food and water for a stay of twentyfour hours they would always be in full view of the backup team on the hub and any kind of accident seemed virtually impos sible on this smooth gently curving metal plain the only foreseeable danger was exhaustion when they got to paris which they could do easily enough could they do more than take a few photographs and perhaps collect some small artifacts before they had to return but even such a brief foray would be worth it there was so little time as rama hurtled sunwards towards a perihelion too dangerous for endeavour to match in any case part of the decision was not his to make up in the ship dr ernst would be watching the outputs of the biotelemetering sensors attached to his body if she turned thumbsdown that would be that laura what do you think take thirty minutes rest and a five hundred calorie energy module then you can start thanks doc interjected joe calvert now i can die happy i always wanted to see paris montmartre here we come chapter thirteen the plain of rama after those interminable stairs it was a strange luxury to walk once more on a horizontal surface directly ahead the ground was indeed completely flat to right and left at the limits of the floodlit area the rising curve could just be detected they might have been walking along a very wide shallow valley it was quite impossible to be lieve that they were really crawling along the inside of a huge cylinder and that beyond this little oasis of light the land rose up to meet no to become the sky though they all felt a sense of confidence and subdued excitement after a while the almost palpable silence of rama began to weigh heavily upon them every footstep every word vanished instantly into the unreverberant void after they had gone little more than half a kilo metre lt calvert could stand it no longer among his minor accomplishments was a talent now rare though many thought not rare enough the art of whistling with or without encouragement he could re produce the themes from most of the movies of the last two hundred years he started appropriately with heigh ho heighho tis off to work we go found that he couldnt stay down comfortably in the bass with disneys marching dwarfs and switched quickly to river kwai then he progressed more or less chronologically through half a dozen epics culminating with the theme from sid krassmans famous latetwentiethcentury napoleon it was a good try but it didnt work even as a morale builder rama needed the grandeur of bach or beet hoven or sibelius or tuan sun not the trivia of popular entertainment norton was on the point of suggesting that joe save his breath for later exertions when the young officer realized the inappropriateness of his efforts thereafter apart from an occasional consultation with the ship they marched on in silence rama had won this round on his initial traverse norton had allowed for one de tour paris lay straight ahead halfway between the foot of the stairway and the shore of the cylindrical sea but only a kilometre to the right of their track was a very prominent and rather mysterious feature which had been christened the straight valley it was a long groove or trench forty metres deep and a hundred wide with gently sloping sides it had been provisionally identified as an irrigation ditch or canal like the stairway itself it had two similar counterparts equally spaced around the curve of rama the three valleys were almost ten kilometres long and stopped abruptly just before they reached the sea which was strange if they were intended to carry water and on the other side of the sea the pattern was re peated three more tenkilometretrenches continued on to the south polar region they reached the end of the straight valley after only fifteen minutes comfortable walking and stood for a while staring thoughtfully into its depths the perfectly smooth walls sloped down at an angle of sixty degrees there were no steps or footholds filling the bottom was a sheet of flat white material that looked very much like ice a specimen could settle a good many arguments norton decided to get one with calvert and rodrigo acting as anchors and pay ing out a safety rope he rapelled slowly down the steep incline when he reached the bottom he fully expected to find the familiar slippery feel of ice underfoot but he was mistaken the friction was too great his footing was secure this material was some kind of glass or trans parent crystal when he touched it with his fingertips it was cold hard and unyielding turning his back to the searchlight and shielding his eyes from its glare norton tried to peer into the crystal line depths as one may attempt to gaze through the ice of a frozen lake but he could see nothing even when he tried the concentrated beam of his own helmetlamp he was no more successful this stuff was translucent but not transparent if it was a frozen liquid it had a melting point very much higher than water he tapped it gently with the hammer from his geology kit the tool rebounded with a dull unmusical dunk he tapped harder with no more result and was about to exert his full strength when some impulse made him de sist it seemed most unlikely that he could crack this mat erial but what if he did he would be like a vandal smashing some enormous plateglass window there would be a better opportunity later and at least he had dis covered valuable information it now seemed more un likely than ever that this was a canal it was simply a peculiar trench that stopped and started abruptly but led nowhere and if at any time it had carried liquid where were the stains the encrustations of driedup sedi ment that one would expect everything was bright and clean as if the builders had left only yesterday once again he was face to face with the fundamental mystery of rama and this time it was impossible to evade it commander norton was a reasonably imaginative man but he would never have reached his present posi tion if he had been liable to the wilder flights of fancy yet now for the first time he had a sense not exactly of foreboding but of anticipation things were not what they seemed there was something very very odd about a place that was simultaneously brand new and a million years old very thoughtfully he began to walk slowly along the length of the little valley while his companions still holding the rope that was attached to his waist followed him along the rim he did not expect to make any further discoveries but he wanted to let his curious emo tional state run its course for something else was worry ing him and it had nothing to do with the inexplicable newness of rama he had walked no more than a dozen metres when it hit him like a thunderbolt he knew this place he had been here before even on earth or some familiar planet that experience is dis quieting though it is not particularly rare most men have known it at some time or other and usually they dismiss it as the memory of a forgotten photograph a pure coincidence or if they are mystically inclined some form of telepathy from another mind or even a flashback from their own future but to recognize a spot which no other human being can possibly have seen that is quite shocking for sev eral seconds commander norton stood rooted to the smooth crystalline surface on which he had been walk ing trying to straighten out his emotions his wellordered universe had been turned upside down and he had a dizzying glimpse of those mysteries at the edge of exist ence which he had successfully ignored for most of his life then to his immense relief common sense came to the rescue the disturbing sensation of dйjаvu faded out to be replaced by a real and identifiable memory from his youth it was true he had once stood between such steeply sloping walls watching them drive into the distance until they seemed to converge at a point indefinitely far ahead but they had been covered with neatly trimmed grass and underfoot had been broken stone not smooth crys tal it had happened thirty years ago during a summer vacation in england largely because of another student he could remember her face but he had forgotten her name he had taken a course of industrial archaeology then very popular among science and engineering gradu ates they had explored abandoned coalmines and cot ton mills climbed over ruined blastfurnaces and steam engines goggled unbelievingly at primitive and still dan gerous nuclear reactors and driven priceless turbine powered antiques along restored motor roads not everything that they saw was genuine much had been lost during the centuries for men seldom bother to preserve the commonplace articles of everyday life but where it was necessary to make copies they had been re constructed with loving care and so young bill norton had found himself bowling along at an exhilarating hundred kilometres an hour while he furiously shovelled precious coal into the firebox of a locomotive that looked two hundred years old but was actually younger than he was the thirtykilometre stretch of the great western railway however was quite genuine though it had required a good deal of excavat ing to get it back into commission whistle screaming they had plunged into a hillside and raced through a smoky flamelit darkness an aston ishingly long time later they had burst out of the tunnel into a deep perfectly straight cutting between steep grassy banks the longforgotten vista was almost identi cal with the one before him now what is it skipper called lt rodrigo have you found something as norton dragged himself back to present reality some of the oppression lifted from his mind there was mystery here yes but it might not be beyond human understanding he had learned a lesson though it was not one that he could readily impart to others at all costs he must not let rama overwhelm him that way lay failure perhaps even madness no he answered theres nothing down here haul me up we head straight to paris chapter fourteen storm warning ive called this meeting of the committee said his ex cellency the ambassador of mars to the united planets because dr perera has something important to tell us he insists that we get in touch with commander norton right away using the priority channel weve been able to establish after i might say a good deal of difficulty dr pereras statement is rather technical and before we come to it i think a summary of the present position might be in order dr price has prepared one oh yes some apologies for absence sir lewis sands is unable to be with us because hes chairing a conference and dr taylor asks to be excused he was rather pleased about that last abstention the anthropologist had rapidly lost interest in rama when it became obvious that it would present little scope for him like many others he had been bitterly disappointed to find that the mobile worldlet was dead now there would be no opportunity for sensational books and viddies about raman rituals and behavioural patterns others might dig up skeletons and classify artifacts that sort of thing did not appeal to conrad taylor perhaps the only discovery that would bring him back in a hurry would be some highly explicit works of art like the notorious fres coes of thera and pompeii thelma price the archaeologist took exactly the oppo site point of view she preferred excavations and ruins uncluttered by inhabitants who might interfere with dis passionate scientific studies the bed of the mediter ranean had been ideal at least until the city planners and landscape artists had started getting in the way and rama would have been perfect except for the madden ing detail that it was a hundred million kilometres away and she would never be able to visit it in person as you all know she began commander norton has completed one traverse of almost thirty kilometres with out encountering any problems he explored the curious trench shown on your maps as the straight valley its purpose is still quite unknown but its clearly important as it runs the full length of rama except for the break at the cylindrical sea and there are two other identical structures degrees apart round the circumference of the world then the party turned left or east if we adopt the north pole convention until they reached paris as youll see from this photograph taken by a telescope camera at the hub its a group of several hundred build ings with wide streets between them now these photographs were taken by commander nortons group when they reached the site if paris is a city its a very peculiar one note that none of the build ings have windows or even doors they are all plain rectangular structures an identical thirtyfive metres high and they appear to have been extruded out of the ground there are no seams or joints look at this close up of the base of a wall theres a smooth transition into the ground my own feeling is that this place is not a residential area but a storage or supply depot in support of that theory look at this photo these narrow slots or grooves about five centimetres wide run along all the streets and theres one leading to every building going straight into the walltheres a striking resemblance to the streetcar tracks of the early twentieth century they are obviously part of some trans port system weve never considered it necessary to have public transport direct to every house it would be economically absurd people can always walk a few hundred metres but if these buildings are used for the storage of heavy materials it would make sense may i ask a question said the ambassador for earth of course sir robert commander norton couldnt get into a single build ing no when you listen to his report you can tell he was quite frustrated at one time he decided that the build ings could only be entered from underground then he discovered the grooves of the transport system and changed his mind did he try to break in there was no way he could without explosives or heavy tools and he doesnt want to do that until all other approaches have failed i have it dennis solomons suddenly interjected co cooning i beg your pardon its a technique developed a couple of hundred years ago continued the science historian another name for it is mothballing when you have something you want to preserve you seal it inside a plastic envelope and then pump in an inert gas the original use was to protect military equipment between wars it was once applied to whole ships its still widely used in museums that are short of storage space no one knows whats inside some of the hundredyearold cocoons in the smithsonian base ment patience was not one of carlisle pereras virtues he was aching to drop his bombshell and could restrain himself no longer please mr ambassador this is all very interesting but i feel my information is rather more urgent if there are no other points very well dr perera the exobiologist unlike conrad taylor had not found rama a disappointment it was true that he no longer expected to find life but sooner or later he had been quite sure some remains would be discovered of the creatures who had built this fantastic world the ex ploration had barely begun although the time available was horribly brief before endeavour would be forced to escape from her present sungrazing orbit but now if his calculations were correct mans contact with rama would be even shorter than he had feared for one detail had been overlooked because it was so large that no one had noticed it before according to our latest information perera began one party is now on its way to the cylindrical sea while commander norton has another group setting up a sup ply base at the foot of stairway alpha when thats estab lished he intends to have at least two exploratory mis sions operating at all times in this way he hopes to use his limited manpower at maximum efficiency its a good plan but there may be no time to carry it out in fact i would advise an immediate alert and a preparation for total withdrawal at twelve hours notice let me explain its surprising how few people have commented on a rather obvious anomaly about rama its now well inside the orbit of venus yet the interior is still frozen but the temperature of an object in direct sunlight at this point is about five hundred degrees the reason of course is that rama hasnt had time to warm up it must have cooled down to near absolute zero two hundred and seventy below while it was in inter stellar space now as it approaches the sun the outer hull is already almost as hot as molten lead but the inside will stay cold until the heat works its way through that kilometre of rock theres some kind of fancy dessert with a hot exterior and icecream in the middle i dont remember what its called baked alaska its a favourite at up banquets unfor tunately thank you sir robert thats the situation in rama at the moment but it wont last all these weeks the solar heat has been working its way through and we ex pect a sharp temperature rise to begin in a few hours thats not the problem by the time well have to leave anyway it will be no more than comfortably tropical then whats the difficulty i can answer in one word mr ambassador hurri canes chapter fifteen the edge of the sea there were now more than twenty men and women in side rama six of them down on the plain the rest ferry ing equipment and expendables through the airlock sys tem and down the stairway the ship itself was almost deserted with the minimum possible staff on duty the joke went around that endeavour was really being run by the four simps and that goldie had been given the rank of actingcommander for these first explorations norton had established a number of groundrules the most important dated back to the earliest days of mans spacefaring every group he had decided must contain one person with prior experi ence but not more than one in that way everybody would have an opportunity of learning as quickly as pos sible and so the first party to head for the cylindrical sea though it was led by surgeoncommander laura ernst had as its onetime veteran lt boris rodrigo just back from paris the third member sergeant pieter rousseau had been with the backup teams at the hub he was an expert on space reconnaissance instrumentation but on this trip he would have to depend on his own eyes and a small portable telescope from the foot of stairway alpha to the edge of the sea was just under fifteen kilometres or an earthequi valent of eight under the low gravity of rama laura ernst who had to prove that she lived up to her own standards set a brisk pace they stopped for thirty min utes at the midway mark and made the whole trip in a completely uneventful three hours it was also quite monotonous walking forward in the beam of the searchlight through the anechoic darkness of rama as the pool of light advanced with them it slowly elongated into a long narrow ellipse this foreshortening of the beam was the only visible sign of progress if the observers up on the hub had not given them continual distance checks they could not have guessed whether they had travelled one kilometre or five or ten they just plodded onwards through the millionyearold night over an apparently seamless metal surface but at last far ahead at the limits of the now weaken ing beam there was something new on a normal world it would have been a horizon as they approached they could see that the plain on which they were walking dame to an abrupt stop they were nearing the edge of the sea only a hundred metres said hub control better slow down that was hardly necessary yet they had already done so it was a sheer straight drop of fifty metres from the level of the plain to that of the sea if it was a sea and not another sheet of that mysterious crystalline material al though norton had impressed upon everyone the danger of taking anything for granted in rama few doubted that the sea was really made of ice but for what conceiv able reason was the cliff on the southern shore five hun dred metres high instead of the fifty here it was as if they were approaching the edge of the world their oval of light cut off abruptly ahead of them became shorter and shorter but far out on the curved screen of the sea their monstrous foreshortened shadows had appeared magnifying and exaggerating every move ment those shadows had been their companions every step of the way as they marched down the beam but now that they were broken at the edge of the cliff they no longer seemed part of them they might have been crea tures of the cylindrical sea waiting to deal with any in truders into their domain because they were now standing on the edge of a fifty metre cliff it was possible for the first time to appreciate the curvature of rama but no one had ever seen a frozen lake bent upwards into a cylindrical surface that was distinctly unsettling and the eye did its best to find some other interpretation it seemed to dr ernst who had once made a study of visual illusions that half the time she was really looking at a horizontally curving bay not a surface that soared up into the sky it required a deliber ate effort of will to accept the fantastic truth only in the line directly ahead parallel to the axis of rama was normalcy preserved in this direction alone was there agreement between vision and logic here for the next few kilometres at least rama looked flat and was flat and out there beyond their distorted shadows and the outer limit of the beam lay the island that dominated the cylindrical sea hub control dr ernst radioed please aim your beam at new york the night of rama fell suddenly upon them as the oval of light went sliding out to sea conscious of the now invisible cliff at their feet they all stepped back a few metres then as if by some magical stage transformation the towers of new york sprang into view the resemblance to oldtime manhattan was only super ficial this starborn echo of earths past possessed its own unique identity the more dr ernst stared at it the more certain she became that it was not a city at all the real new york like all of mans habitations had never been finished still less had it been designed this place however had an overall symmetry and pattern though one so complex that it eluded the mind it had been conceived and planned by some controlling intelli gence and then it had been completed like a machine devised for some specific purpose after that there was no possibility of growth or change the beam of the searchlight slowly tracked along those distant towers and domes and interlocked spheres and crisscrossed tubes sometimes there would be a brilliant reflection as some flat surface shot the light back towards them the first time this happened they were all taken by surprise it was exactly as if over there on that strange island someone was signalling to them but there was nothing that they could see here that was not already shown in greater detail on photographs taken from the hub after a few minutes they called for the light to return to them and began to walk eastwards along the edge of the cliff it had been plausibly theor ized that somewhere there must surely be a flight of steps or a ramp leading down to the sea and one crew man who was a keen sailor had raised an interesting conjecture where theres a sea sergeant ruby barhes had pre dicted there must be docks and harbours and ships you can learn everything about a culture by studying the way it builds boats her colleagues thought this a rather restricted point of view but at least it was a stimulating one dr ernst had almost given up the search and was pre paring to me a descent by rope when lt rodrigo spot ted the narrow stairway it could easily have been over looked in the shadowed darkness below the edge of the cliff for there was no guardrail or other indication of its presence and it seemed to lead nowhere it ran down the fiftymetre vertical wall at a steep angle and disappeared below the surface of the sea they scanned the flight of steps with their helmet lights could see no conceivable hazard and dr ernst got commander nortons permission to descend a minute later she was cautiously testing the surface of the sea her foot slithered almost frictionlessly back and forth the material felt exactly like ice it was ice when she struck it with her hammer a familiar pat tern of cracks radiated from the impact point and she had no difficulty in collecting as many pieces as she wished some had already melted when she held up the sample holder to the light the liquid appeared to be slightly turbid water and she took a cautious sniff is that safe rodrigo called down with a trace of anxiety believe me boris she answered if there are any pathogens around here that have slipped through my de tectors our insurance policies lapsed a week ago but boris had a point despite all the tests that had been carried out there was a very slight risk that this substance might be poisonous or might carry some un known disease in normal circumstances dr ernst would not have taken even this minuscule chance now how ever time was short and the stakes were enormous if it became necessary to quarantine endeavour that would be a very small price to pay for her cargo of knowledge its water but i wouldnt care to drink it it smells like an algae culture thats gone bad i can hardly wait to get it to the lab is the ice safe to walk on yes solid as a rock then we can get to new york can we pieter have you ever tried to walk across four kilometres of ice oh i see what you mean just imagine what stores would say if we asked for a set of skates not that many of us would know how to use them even if we had any aboard and theres another problem put in boris rodrigo do you realize that the temperature is already above freezing before long that ice is going to melt how many spacemen can swim four kilometres certainly not this one dr ernst rejoined them at the edge of the cliff and held up the small sample bottle in triumph its a long walk for a few ccs of dirty water but it may teach us more about rama than anything weve found so far lets head for home they turned towards the distant lights of the hub moving with the gentle loping strides which had proved the most comfortable means of walking under this re duced gravity often they looked back drawn by the hid den enigma of the island out there in the centre of the frozen sea and just once dr ernst thought she felt the faint sus picion of a breeze against her cheek it did not come again and she quickly forgot all about it chapter sixteen kealakekua as you know perfectly well dr perera said ambassador bose in a tone of patient resignation few of us share your knowledge of mathematical meteorology so please take pity on our ignorance with pleasure answered the exobiologist quite un abashed i can explain it best by telling you what is go ing to happen inside rama very soon the temperature is now about to rise as the solar heat pulse reaches the interior according to the latest in formation ive received its already above freezing point the cylindrical sea will soon start to thaw and unlike bodies of water on earth it will melt from the bottom upwards that may produce some odd effects but im much more concerned with the atmosphere as its heated the air inside rama will expand and will attempt to rise towards the central axis and this is the problem at ground level although its apparently stationary its actually sharing the spin of rama over eight hundred kilometres an hour as it rises towards the axis it will try to retain that speed and it wont be able to do so of course the result will be violent winds and turbulence i estimate velocities of between two and three hundred kilometres an hour incidentally very much the same thing occurs on earth the heated air at the equator which shares the earths sixteenhundredkilometresanhour spin runs into the same problem when it rises and flows north and south ah the trade winds i remember that from my geography lessons exactly sir robert rama will have trade winds with a vengeance i believe theyll last only a few hours and then spine kind of equilibrium will be restored meanwhile i should advise commander norton to evac uate as soon as possible here is the message i propose sending with a little imagination commander norton told him self he could pretend that this was an improvised night camp at the foot of some mountain in a remote region of asia or america the clutter of sleeping pads collapsible chain and tables portable power plant lighting equip ment electrosan toilets and miscellaneous scientific ap paratus would not have looked out of place on earth especially as there were men and women working here without lifesupport systems establishing camp alpha had been very hard work for everything had had to be manhandled through the chain of airlocks sledded down the slope from the hub and then retrieved and unpacked sometimes when the brak ing parachutes had failed a consignment had ended up a good kilometre away out on the plain despite this sev ual crew members had asked permission to make the ride norton had firmly forbidden it in an emergency however he might be prepared to reconsider the ban almost all this equipment would stay here for the lab our of carrying it back was unthinkable in fact impos sible there were times when commander norton felt an irrational shame at leaving so much human litter in this strangely immaculate place when they finally departed he was prepared to sacrifice some of their precious time to leave everything in good order improbable though it was perhaps millions of years hence when rama shot through some other star system it might have visitors again he would like to give them a good impression of earth meanwhile he had a rather more immediate problem during the last twentyfour hours he had received almost identical messages from both mars and earth it seemed an odd coincidence perhaps they had been commiserat ing with each other as wives who lived safely on different planets were liable to do under sufficient provocation rather pointedly they had reminded him that even though he was now a great hero he still had family re sponsibilities the commander picked up a collapsible chair and walked out of the pool of light into the darkness sur rounding the camp it was the only way he could get any privady and he could also think better away from the turmoil deliberately turning his back on the organized confusion behind him he began to speak into the re corder slung around his neck original for personal file dupes to mars and earth hello darling yes i know ive been a lousy correspond ent but i havent been aboard ship for a week apart from a skeleton crew were all camping inside rama at the foot of the stairway weve christened alpha i have three parties out now scouting the plain but weve made disappointingly slow progress because every thing has to be done on foot if only we had some means of transport id be very happy to settle for a few electric bicycles theyd be perfect for the job youve met my medical officer surgeoncommander ernst he paused uncertainly laura had met one of his wives but which better cut that out erasing the sentence he began again my mo surgeoncommander ernst led the first group to reach the cylindrical sea fifteen kilometres from here she found that it was frozen water as wed expected but you wouldnt want to drink it dr ernst says its a dilute organic soup containing traces of almost any carbon compound you care to name as well as phos phates and nitrates and dozens of metallic salts theres not the slightest sign of life not even any dead micro organisms so we still know nothing about the biochemis try of the ramans though it was probably not wildly different from ours something brushed lightly against his hair he had been too busy to get it cut and would have to do some thing about that before he next put on a spacehelmet youve seen the viddies of paris and the other towns weve explored on this side of the sea london rome moscow its impossible to believe that they were ever built for anything to live in paris looks like a giant stor age depot london is a collection of cylinders linked to gether by pipes connected to what are obviously pumping stations everything is sealed up and theres no way of finding whats inside without explosives or lasers we won t try these until there are no alternatives as for rome and moscow excuse me skipper priority from earth what now norton asked himself cant a man get a few minutes to talk to his families he took the message from the sergeant and scanned it quickly just to satisfy himself that it was not immediate then he read it again more slowly what the devil was the rama committee and why had he never heard of it he knew that all sorts of associations societies and professional groups some serious some completely crackpot had been trying to get in touch with him mission control had done a good job of protection and would not have forwarded this message unless it was considered important twohundredkilometre winds probably sudden on set well that was something to think about but it was hard to take it too seriously on this utterly calm night and it would be ridiculous to run away like frightened mice when they were just starting effective exploration commander norton lifted a hand to brush aside his hair which had somehow fallen into his eyes again then he froze the gesture uncompleted he had felt a trace of wind several times in the last hour it was so slight that he had completely ignored it after all he was the commander of a spaceship not a sailing ship until now the movement of air had not been of the slightest professional concern what would the longdead captain of that earlier endeavour have done in a situation such as this norton had asked himself that question at every mo ment of crisis in the last few years it was his secret which he had never revealed to anyone and like most of the important things in life it had come about quite by acci dent he had been captain of endeavour for several months before he realized that it was named after one of the most famous ships in history true during the last four hun dred years there had been a dozen endeavours of sea and two of space but the ancestor of them all was the ton whitby collier that captain james cook rn had sailed round the world between and with a mild interest that had quickly turned to an absorbing curiosity almost an obsession norton had begun to read everything he could find about cook he was now probably the worlds leading authority on the greatest explorer of all time and knew whole sections of the journals by heart it still seemed incredible that one man could have done so much with such primitive equipment but cook had been not only a supreme navigator but a scientist and in an age of brutal discipline a humanitarian he treated his own men with kindness which was unusual what was quite unheard of was that he behaved in ex actly the same way to the often hostile savages in the new lands he discovered it was nortons private dream which he knew he would never achieve to retrace at least one of cooks voy ages around the world he had made a limited but spectacular start which would certainly have astonished the captain when he once flew a polar orbit directly above the great barrier reef it had been early morning on a clear day and from four hundred kilometres up he had had a superb view of that deadly wall of coral marked by its line of white foam along the queensland coast he had taken just under five minutes to travel the whole two thousand kilometres of the reef in a single glance he could span weeks of perilous voyaging for that first endeavour and through the telescope he had caught a glimpse of cooktown and the estuary where the ship had been dragged ashore for repairs after her near fatal encounter with the reef a year later a visit to the hawaii deepspace tracking station had given him an even more unforgettable ex perience he had taken the hydrofoil to kealakekua bay and as he moved swiftly past the bleak volcanic cliffs he felt a depth of emotion that had surprised and even dis concerted him the guide had led his group of scientists engineers and astronauts past the glittering metal pylon that had replaced the earlier monument destroyed by the great tsunami of they had walked on for a few more yards across black slippery lava to the small plaque at the waters edge little waves were breaking over it but norton scarcely noticed them as he bent down to read the words near this spot captain james cook was killed february original tablet dedicated august by cook sesquicentennial commission replaced by tricentennial commission february that was years ago and a hundred million kilometres away but at moments like this cooks reassuring pres ence seemed very close in the secret depths of his mind he would ask well captain what is your advise it was a little game he played on occasions when there were not enough facts for sound judgement and one had to rely on intuition that had been part of cooks genius he always made the right choice until the very end at kealakekua bay the sergeant waited patiently while his commander stared silently out into the night of rama it was no longer unbroken for at two spots about four kilometres away the faint patches of light of exploring parties could be clearly seen in an emergency i can recall them within the hour norton told himself and that surely should be good enough he turned to the sergeant take this message rama committee care of spacecom appreciate your advice and will take precautions please specify meaning of phrase sudden onset respectfully norton commander en deavour he waited until the sergeant had disappeared towards the blazing lights of the camp then switched on his re corder again but the train of thought was broken and he could not get back into the mood the letter would have to wait for some other time it was not often that captain cook came to his aid when he was neglecting his duty but he suddenly re membered how rarely and briefly poor elizabeth cook had seen her husband in sixteen years of married life yet she had borne him six children and outlived them all his wives never more than ten minutes away at the speed of light had nothing to complain about chapter seventeen spring during the first nights on rama it had not been easy to sleep the darkness and the mysteries it concealed were oppressive but even more unsettling was the silence ab sence of noise is not a natural condition all human senses require some input if they are deprived of it the mind manufactures its own substitutes and so many sleepers had complained of strange noises even of voices which were obviously illusions because those awake had heard nothing surgeoncommander ernst had prescribed a very simple and effective cure during the sleeping period the camp was now lulled by gentle unobtrusive background music this night commander norton found the cure in adequate he kept straining his ears into the darkness and he knew what he was listening for but though a very faint breeze did caress his face from time to time there was no sound that could possibly be taken for that of a distant rising wind nor did either of the exploring parties report anything unusual at least around ships midnight he went to sleep there was always a man on watch at the communications console in case of any urgent messages no other precau tions seemed necessary not even a hurricane could have created the sound that did wake him and the whole camp in a single in stant it seemed that the sky was falling or that rama had split open and was tearing itself apart first there was a rending crack then a longdrawnout series of crystalline crashes like a million glasshouses being de molished it lasted for minutes though it seemed like hours it was still continuing apparently moving away into the distance when norton got to the message centre hub control whats happened just a moment skipper its over by the sea were getting the light on it eight kilometres overhead on the axis of rama the searchlight began to swing its beam out across the plain it reached the edge of the sea then started to track along it scanning around the interior of the world a quarter of the way round the cylindrical surface it stopped up there in the sky or what the mind still persisted in calling the sky something extraordinary was happening at first it seemed to norton that the sea was boiling it was no longer static and frozen in the grip of an eternal winter a huge area kilometres across was in turbulent movement and it was changing colour a broad band of white was marching across the ice suddenly a slab perhaps a quarter of a kilometre on a side began to tilt upwards like an opening door slowly and majestically it reared into the sky glittering and sparkling in the beam of the searchlight then it slid back and vanished underneath the surface while a tidal wave of foaming water raced outwards in all directions from its point of submergence not until then did commander norton fully realize what was happening the ice was breaking up all these days and weeks the sea had been thawing far down in the depths it was hard to concentrate because of the crashing roar that still filled the world and echoed round the sky but he tried to think of a reason for so dramatic a convulsion when a frozen lake or river thawed on earth it was nothing like this but of course it was obvious enough now that it had happened the sea was thawing from beneath as the solar heat seeped through the hull of rama and when ice turns into water it occupies less volume so the sea had been sinking below the upper layer of ice leaving it unsupported day by day the strain bad been building up now the band of ice that encircled the equator of rama was collapsing like a bridge that had lost its central pier it was splintering into hundreds of floating islands that wouldcrash and jostle into each other until they too melted nortons blood ran suddenly cold when he remembered the plans that were being made to reach new york by sledge the tumult was swiftly subsiding a temporary stale mate had been reached in the war between ice and water in a few hours as the temperature continued to rise the water would win and the last vestiges of ice would dis appear but in the long run ice would be the victor as rama rounded the sun and set forth once more into the interstellar night norton remembered to start breathing again then he called the party nearest the sea to his relief lieutenant rodrigo answered at once no the water hadnt reached them no tidal wave had come sloshing over the edge of the cliff so now we know he added very calmly why there is a cliff norton agreed silently but that hardly explains he thought to himself why the cliff on the southern shore is ten times higher the hub searchlight continued to scan round the world the awakened sea was steadily calming and the boiling white foam no longer raced outwards from capsiz ing icefloes in fifteen minutes the main disturbance was over but rama was no longer silent it had awakened from its sleep and ever and again there came the sound of grinding ice as one berg collided with another spring had been a little late norton told himself but winter had ended and there was that breeze again stronger than ever rama had given him enough warnings it was time to go as he neared the halfway mark commander norton once again felt gratitude to the darkness that concealed the view above and below though he knew that more than ten thousand steps still lay ahead of him and could picture the steeply ascending curve in his minds eye the fact that he could see only a small portion of it made the prospect more bearable this was his second ascent and he had learned from his mistakes on the first the great temptation was to dumb too quickly in this low gravity every step was so easy that it was very hard to adopt a slow plodding rhythm but unless one did this after the first few thou sand steps strange aches developed in the thighs and calves muscles that one never knew existed started to protest and it was necessary to take longer and longer periods of rest towards the end he had spent more time resting than climbing and even then it was not enough he had suffered painful legcramps for the next two days and would have been almost incapacitated had he not been back in the zerogravity environment of the ship so this time he had started with almost painful slow ness moving like an old man he had been the last to leave the plain and the others were strung out along the halfkilometre of stairway above him he could see their lights moving up the invisible slope ahead he felt sick at heart at the failure of his mission and even now hoped that this was only a temporary retreat when they reached the hub they could wait until any atmospheric disturbances had ceased presumably it would be a dead calm there as at the centre of a cyclone and they could wait out the expected storm in safety once again he was jumping to conclusions drawing dangerous analogies from earth the meteorology of a whole world even under steadystate conditions was a matter of enormous complexity after several centuries of study terrestrial weatherforecasting was still not abso lutely reliable and rama was not merely a completely novel system it was also undergoing rapid changes for the temperature had risen several degrees in the last few hours yet still there was no sign of the promised hurri cane though there had been a few feeble gusts from ap parently random directions they had now climbed five kilometres which in this low and steadily diminishing gravity was equivalent to less than two on earth at the third level three kilo metres from the axis they rested for an hour taking light refreshments and massaging leg muscles this was the last point at which they could breathe in comfort like old time himalayan mountaineers they had left their oxy gen supplies here and now put them on for the final as cent an hour later they had reached the top of the stairway and the beginning of the ladder ahead lay the last vertical kilometre fortunately in a gravity field only a few per cent of earths another thirtyminute rest a careful check of oxygen and they were ready for the final lap once again norton made sure that all his men were safely ahead of him spaced out at twentymetre intervals along the ladder from now on it would be a slow steady haul extremely boring the best technique was to empty the mind of all thoughts and to count the rungs as they drifted by one hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred he had just reached twelve hundred and fifty when he suddenly realized that something was wrong the light shining on the vertical surface immediately in front of his eyes was the wrong colour and it was much too bright commander norton did not even have time to check his ascent or to call a warning to his men everything happened in less than a second in a soundless concussion of light dawn burst upon rama chapter eighteen dawn the light was so brilliant that for a full minute norton had to keep his eyes clenched tightly shut then he risked opening them and stared through barelyparted lids at the wall a few centimetres in front of his face he blinked several times waited for the involuntary tears to drain away and then turned slowly to behold the dawn he could endure the sight for only a few seconds then he was forced to close his eyes again it was not the glare that was intolerable he could grow accustomed to that but the awesome spectacle of rama now seen for the first time in its entirety norton had known exactly what to expect neverthe less the sight had stunned him he was seized by a spasm of uncontrollable trembling his hands tightened round the rungs of the ladder with the violence of a drowning man clutching at a lifebelt the muscles of his forearms began to knot yet at the same time his legs already fatigued by hours of steady climbing seemed about to give way if it had not been for the low gravity he might have fallen then his training took over and he began to apply the first remedy for panic still keeping his eyes closed and trying to forget the monstrous spectacle around him he started to take deep long breaths filling his lungs with oxygen and washing the poisons of fatigue out of his sys tem presently he felt much better but he did not open his eyes until he had performed one more action it took a major effort of will to force his right hand to open he had to talk to it like a disobedient child but presently he manoeuvred it down to his waist unclipped the safety belt from his harness and hooked the buckle to the nearest rung now whatever happened he could not fall norton took several more deep breaths then still keeping his eyes closed he switched on his radio he hoped his voice sounded calm and authoritative as he called captain here is everyone ok as he checked off the names one by one and received answers even if somewhat tremulous ones from every body his own confidence and selfcontrol came swiftly back to him all his men were safe and were looking to him for leadership he was the commander once more keep your eyes closed until youre quite sure you can take it he called the view is overwhelming if anyone finds that its too much keep on climbing without look ing back remember youll soon be at zero gravity so you cant possibly fall it was hardly necessary to point out such an elementary fact to trained spacemen but norton had to remind him self of it every few seconds the thought of zerogravity was a kind of talisman protecting him from harm what ever his eyes told him rama could not drag him down to destruction on the plain eight kilometres below it became an urgent matter of pride and selfesteem that he should open his eyes once more and look at the world around him but first he had to get his body under control he let go of the ladder with both hands and hooked his left arm under a rung clenching and unclenching his fats he waited until the muscle cramps had faded away then when he felt quite comfortable he opened his eyes and slowly turned to face rama his fist impression was one of blueness the glare that filled the sky could not have been mistaken for sunlight it might have been that of an electric arc so ramas sun norton told himself must be hotter than ours that should interest the astronomers and now he understood the purpose of those mysteri ous trenches the straight valley and its five companions they were nothing less than gigantic striplights rama had six linear suns symmetrically ranged around its in terior from each a broad fan of light was aimed across the central axis to shine upon the far side of the world norton wondered if they could be switched alternately to produce a cycle of light and darkness or whether this was a planet of perpetual day too much staring at those blinding bars of light had made his eyes hurt again he was not sorry to have a good excuse to close them for a while it was not until then when he had almost recovered from this initial visual shock that he was able to devote himself to a much more serious problem who or what had switched on the lights of rama this world was sterile by the most sensitive tests that man could apply to it but now something was happen ing that could not be explained by the action of natural forces there might not be life here but there could be consciousness awareness robots might be waking after a sleep of aeons perhaps this outburst of light was an un programmed random spasm a last dying gasp of mach ines that were responding wildly to the warmth of a new sun and would soon lapse again into quiescence this time for ever yet norton could not believe such a simple explana tion bits of the jigsaw puzzle were beginning to fall into place though many were still missing the absence of all signs of wear for example the feeling of nearness as if rama had just been created these thoughts might have inspired fear even terror somehow they did nothing of the sort on the contrary norton felt a sense of exhilaration almost of delight there was far more here to discover than they had ever dared to hope wait he said to himself until the rama committee hears about this then with a calm determination he opened his eyes again and began a careful inventory of everything he saw first he had to establish some kind of reference system he was looking at the largest enclosed space ever seen by man and needed a mental map to find his way around it the feeble gravity was very little help for with an effort of will he could switch up and down in any direc tion he pleased but some directions were psychologically dangerous whenever his mind skirted these he had to vector it hastily away safest of all was to imagine that he was at the bowl shaped bottom of a gigantic well sixteen kilometres wide and fifty deep the advantage of this image was that there could be no danger of falling further nevertheless it had some serious defects he could pretend that the scattered towns and cities and the differently coloured and textured areas were all securely fixed to the towering walls the various complex structures that could be seen hanging from the dome overhead were perhaps no more disconcerting than the pendent candelabra in some great concertball on earth what was quite unacceptable was the cylindrical sea there it was halfway up the wellshaft a band of water wrapped completely round it with no visible means of support there could be no doubt that it was water it was a vivid blue flecked with brilliant sparkles from the few remaining icefloes but a vertical sea forming a complete circle twenty kilometres up in the sky was such an unsettling phenomenon that after a while he began to seek an alternative that was when his mind switched the scene through ninety degrees instantly the deep well became a long tunnel capped at either end down was obviously in the direction of the ladder and the stairway he had just as cended and now with this perspective norton was at last able to appreciate the true vision of the architects who had built this place he was clinging to the face of a curving sixteenkilo metrehigh cliff the upper half of which overhung com pletely until it merged into the arched roof of what was now the sky beneath him the ladder descended more than five hundred metres until it ended at the first ledge or terrace there the stairway began continuing almost vertically at first in this lowgravity regime then slowly becoming less and less steep until after breaking at five more platforms it reached the distant plain for the first two or three kilometres he could see the individual steps but thereafter they had merged into a continuous band the downward swoop of that immense stairway was so overwhelming that it was impossible to appreciate its true scale norton had once flown round mount everest and had been awed by its size he reminded himself that this stairway was as high as the himalayas but the com parison was meaningless and no comparison at all was possible with the other two stairways beta and gamma which slanted up into the sky and then curved far out over his head norton had now acquired enough confidence to lean back and glance up at them briefly then he tried to forget that they were there for too much thinking along those lines evoked yet a third image of rama which he was anxious to avoid at all costs this was the viewpoint that regarded it once again as a vertical cylinder or well but now he was at the top not the bottom like a fly crawling upside down on a domed ceiling with a fiftykilometre drop immedi ately below every time norton found this image creeping up on him it needed all his willpower not to cling to the ladder again in mindless panic in time he was sure all these fears would ebb the wonder and strangeness of rama would banish its ter rors at least for men who were trained to face the reali ties of space perhaps no one who had never left earth and had never seen the stars all around him could en dure these vistas but if any men could accept them nor ton told himself with grim determination it would be the captain and crew of endeavour he looked at his chronometer this pause had lasted only two minutes but it had seemed a lifetime exerting barely enough effort to overcome his inertia and the fad ing gravitational field he started to pull himself slowly up the last hundred metres of the ladder just before he entered the airlock and turned his back upon rama he made one final swift survey of the interior it had changed even in the last few minutes a mist was rising from the sea for the first few hundred metres the ghostly white columns were tilted sharply forward in the direction oframas spin then they started to dissolve in a swirl of turbulence as the uprushing air tried to jettison its excess velocity the trade winds of this cyl indrical world were beginning to etch their patterns in its sky the first tropical storm in unknown ages was about to break chapter nine teen a warning from mercury it was the first time in weeks that every member of the rama committee had made himself available professor solomons had emerged from the depths of the pacific where he had been studying mining operations along the midocean trenches and to nobodys surprise dr taylor had reappeared now that there was at least a possibility that rama held something more newsworthy than lifeless artifacts the chairman had fully expected dr carlisle perera to be even more dogmatically assertive than usual now that his prediction of a raman hurricane had been con firmed to his excellencys great surprise perera was re markably subdued and accepted the congratulations of his colleagues in a manner as near to embarrassment as he was ever likely to achieve the exobiologist in fact was deeply mortified the spectacular breakup of the cylindrical sea was a much more obvious phenomenon than the hurricane winds yet he had completely overlooked it to have remembered that hot air rises but to have forgotten that hot ice con tracts was not an achievement of which he could be very proud however he would soon get over it and revert to his normal olympian selfconfidence when the chairman offered him the floor and asked what further climatic changes he expected he was very careful to hedge his bets you must realize he explained that the meteorology of a world as strange as rama may have many other sur prises but if my calculations are correct there will be no further storms and conditions will soon be stable there will be a slow temperature rise until perihelion and beyond but that wont concern us as endeavour will have had to leave long before then so it should soon be safe to go back inside er probably we should certainly know in forty eight hours a return is imperative said the ambassador for mer cury we have to learn everything we possibly can about rama the situation has now changed completely i think we know what you mean but would you care to elaborate of course until now we have assumed that rama is lifeless or at any rate uncontrolled but we can no longer pretend that it is a derelict even if there are no lifeforms aboard it may be directed by robot mech anisms programmed to carry out some mission per haps one highly disadvantageous to us unpalatable though it may be we must consider the question of self defence there was a babble of protesting voices and the chairman had to hold up his hand to restore order let his excellency finish he pleaded whether we like the idea or not it should be considered seriously with all due respect to the ambassador said dr con rad taylor in his most disrespectful voice i think we can rule out as naпve the fear of malevolent intervention creatures as advanced as the ramans must have corres pondingly developed morals otherwise they would have destroyed themselves as we nearly did in the twentieth century ive made that quite clear in my new book ethos and cosmos i hope you received your copy yes thank you though im afraid the pressure of other matters has not allowed me to read beyond the introduc tion however im familiar with the general thesis we may have no malevolent intentions towards an antheap but if we want to build a house on the same site this is as bad as the pandora party its nothing less than interstellar xenophobia please gentlemen this is getting us nowhere mr ambassador you still have the floor the chairman glared across three hundred and eighty thousand kilometres of space at conrad taylor who reluctantly subsided like a volcano biding its tune thank you said the ambassador for mercury the danger may be unlikely but where the future of the human race is involved we can take no chances and if i may say so we hermians may be particularly con cerned we may have more cause for alarm than anyone else dr taylor snorted audibly but was quelled by another glare from the moon why mercury more than any other planet asked the chairman look at the dynamics of the situation rama is already inside our orbit it is only an assumption that it will go round the sun and head on out again into space suppose it carries out a braking manoeuvre if it does so this will be at perihelion about thirty days from now my scien tists tell rue that if the entire velocity change is carried out there rama will end up in a circular orbit only twentyfive million kilometres from the sun from here it could dominate the solar system for a long time nobody not even conrad taylor spoke a word ml the members of the committee were marshalling their thoughts about those difficult people the hermians so ably represented here by their am bassador to most people mercury was a fairly good approxi mation of hell at least it would do until something worse came along but the hermians were proud of their bizarre planet with its days longer than its years its double sunrises and sunsets its rivers of molten metal by comparison the moon and mars had been almost tri vial challenges not until men landed on venus if they even did would they encounter an environment more hostile than that of mercury and yet this world had turned out to be in many ways the key to the solar system this seemed obvious in retro spect but the space age had been almost a century old before the fact was realized now the hermians never let anyone forget it long before men reached the planet mercurys ab normal density hinted at the heavy elements it con tained even so its wealth was still a source of astonish ment and had postponed for a thousand years any fears that the key metals of human civilization would be ex hausted and these treasures were in the best possible place where the power of the sun was ten times greater than on frigid earth unlimited energy unlimited metal that was mer cury its great magnetic launchers could catapult manu factured products to any point in the solar system it could also export energy in synthetic transuranium iso topes or pure radiation it had even been proposed that hermian lasers would one day thaw out gigantic jupiter but this idea had not been well received on the other worlds a technology that could cook jupiter had too many tempting possibilities for interplanetary black mail that such a concern had ever been expressed said a good deal about the general attitude towards the her mians they were respected for their toughness and engi neering skills and admired for the way in which they had conquered so fearsome a world but they were not liked and still less were they completely trusted at the same time it was possible to appreciate their point of view the hermians it was often joked some times behaved as if the sun was their personal property they were bound to it in an intimate lovehate relation ship as the vikings had once been linked to the sea the nepalese to the himalayas the eskimos to the tundra they would be most unhappy if something came be tween them and the natural force that dominated and controlled their lives at last the chairman broke the long silence he still remembered the sun of india and shuddered to contem plate the sun of mercury so he took the hermians very seriously indeed even though he considered them un couth technological barbarians i think there is some merit in your argument mr am bassador he said slowly have you any proposals yes sir before we know what action to take we must have the facts we know the geography of rama if one can use that term but we have no idea of its capabili ties and the key to the whole problem is this does rama have a propulsion system can it change orbit id be very interested in dr pereras views ive given the subject a good deal of thought an swered the exobiologist of course rama must have been given its original impetus by some launching device but that could have been an external booster if it does have onboard propulsion weve found no trace of it cer tainly there are no rocket exhausts or anything similar anywhere on the outer shell they could be hidden true but there would seem little point in it and where are the propellant tanks the energy sources the main hull is solid weve checked that with seismic sur veys the cavities in the northern cap are all accounted for by the airlock systems that leaves the southern end of rama which com mander norton has been unable to reach owing to that tenkilometrewide band of water there are all sorts of curious mechanisms and structures up on the south pole youve seen the photographs what they are is any bodys guess but im reasonably sure of this if rama does have a propulsion system its something completely outside our present knowledge in fact it would have to be the fabu bus space drive people have been talking about for two hundred years you wouldnt rule that out certainly not if we can prove that rama has a space drive even if we learn nothing about its mode of opera tion that would be a major discovery at least wed know that such a thing is possible what is a space drive asked the ambassador for earth rather plaintively any kind of propulsion system sir robert that doesnt work on the rocket principle antigravity if it is pos sible would do very nicely at present we dont know where to look for such a drive and most scientists doubt if it exists it doesnt professor davidson interjected newton settled that you cant have action without reaction space drives are nonsense take it from me you may be right perera replied with unusual bland ness but if rama doesnt have a space drive it has no drive at all theres simply no room for a conventional propulsion system with its enormous fuel tanks its hard to imagine a whole world being pushed around said dennis solomons what would happen to the objects inside it everything would have to be bolted down most inconvenient well the acceleration would probably be very low the biggest problem would be the water in the cylindri cal sea how would you stop that from pereras voice suddenly faded away and his eyes glazed over he seemed to be in the throes of an incipient epileptic fit or even a heart attack his colleagues looked at him in alarm then he made a sudden recovery banged his fist on the table and shouted of course that ex plains everything the southern cliff now it makes sense not to rue grumbled the lunar ambassador speak ing for all the diplomats present look at this longitudinal crosssection of rama per era continued excitedly unfolding his map have you got your copies the cylindrical sea is enclosed between two cliffs which completely circle the interior of rama the one on the north is only fifty metres high the southern one on the other hand is almost half a kilo metre high why the big difference no ones been able to think of a sensible reason but suppose rama is able to propel itself accelerat ing so that the northern end is forward the water in the sea would tend to move back the level at the south would rise perhaps hundreds of metres hence the cliff lets see perera started scribbling furiously after an astonish ingly short time it could not have been more than twenty seconds he looked up in triumph knowing the height of those cliffs we can calculate the maximum acceleration rama can take if it was more than two per cent of a gravity the sea would slosh over into the southern continent a fiftieth of a gee thats not very much it is for a mass of ten million megatons and its all you need for astronomical manoeuvring thank you very much dr perera said the hermian ambassador youve given us a lot to think about mr chairman can we impress on commander norton the importance of looking at the south polar region hes doing his best the sea is the obstacle of course theyre trying to build some kind of raft so that they can at least reach new york the south pole may be even more important mean while i am going to bring these matters to the attention of the general assembly do i have your approval there were no objections not even from dr taylor but just as the committee members were about to switch out of circuit sir lewis raised his hand the old historian very seldom spoke when he did everyone listened suppose we do find that rama is active and has these capabilities there is an old saying in military affairs that capability does not imply intention how long should we wait to find what its intentions are asked the hermian when we discover them it may be far too bate it is already too late there is nothing we can do to affect rama indeed i doubt if there ever was i do not admit that sir lewis there are many things we can do if it proves necessary but the time is desper ately short rama is a cosmic egg being warmed by the fires of the sun it may hatch at any moment the chairman of the committee looked at the ambas sador for mercury in frank astonishment he bad seldom been so surprised in his diplomatic career he would never have dreamed that a hermian was capable of such a poetic flight of imagination chapter twenty book of revelation when one of his crew called him commander or worse still mister norton there was always something serious afoot he could not recall that boris rodrigo had ever before addressed him in such a fashion so this must be doubly serious even in normal times lieutcommander rodrigo was a very grave and sober person whats the problem boris he asked when the cabin door closed behind them id like permission commander to use ship priority for a direct message to earth this was unusual though not unprecedented routine signals went to the nearest planetary relay at the mo ment they were working through mercury and even though the transit time was only a matter of minutes it was often five or six hours before a message arrived at the desk of the person for whom it was intended ninetynine per cent of the time that was quite good enough but in an emergency more direct and much more expensive channels could be employed at the captains discretion you know of course that you have to give me a good reason all our available bandwidth is already clogged with data transmissions is this a personal emergency no commander it is much more important than that i want to send a message to the mother church uhuh said norton to himself how do i handle this id be glad if youll explain it was not mere curiosity that prompted nortons re quest though that was certainly present if be gave boris the priority he asked he would have to justify his action the calm blue eyes stared into his he had never known boris to lose control to be other than completely selfassured all the cosmochristers were bike this it was one of the benefits of their faith and it helped to make them good spacemen sometimes however their unques tioning certainty was just a little annoying to those un fortunates who had not been vouchsafed the revelation it concerns the purpose of rama commander i be lieve i have discovered it go on look at the situation here is a completely empty life less world yet it is suitable for human beings it has water and an atmosphere we can breathe it comes from the remote depths of space aimed precisely at the solar system something quite incredible if it was a matter of pure chance and it appears not only new it looks as if it has never been used weve all been through this dozens of times norton told himself what could boris add to it our faith has told us to expect such a visitation though we do not know exactly what form it will take the bible gives hints if this is not the second coming it may be the second judgement the story of noah des cribes the first i believe that rama is a cosmic ark sent here to save those who are worthy of salvation there was silence for quite a while in the captains cabin it was not that norton was at a loss for words rather he could think of too many questions but he was not sure which ones it would be tactful to ask finally he remarked in as mild and noncommittal a voice as he could manage thats a very interesting con cept and though i dont go along with your faith its a tantalizingly plausible one he was not being hypocriti cal or flattering stripped of its religious overtones rod rigos theory was at beast as convincing as half a dozen others he had heard suppose some catastrophe was about to befall the human race and a benevolent higher in telligence knew all about it that would explain every thing very neatly however there were still a few prob lems a couple of questions boris rama will be at peri helion in three weeks then it will round the sun and leave the solar system just as fast as it came in theres not much time for a day of judgement or for shipping across those who are er selected however thats going to be done very true so when it reaches perihelion rama will have to decelerate and go into a parking orbit probably one with aphelion at earths orbit there it might make another velocity change and rendezvous with earth this was disturbingly persuasive if rama wished to remain in the solar system it was going the right way about it the most efficient way to slow down was to get as close to the sun as possible and carry out the braking manoeuvre there if there was any truth in rodrigos theory or some variant of it it would soon be put to the test one other point boris whats controlling rama now there is no doctrine to advise on that it could be a pure robot or it could be a spirit that would explain why there are no signs of biological lifeforms the haunted asteroid why had that phrase popped up from the depths of memory then be recalled a silly story he had read years ago he thought it best not to ask boris if he had ever run into it he doubted if the others tastes ran to that sort of reading ill tell you what well do boris said norton ab ruptly making up his mind he wanted to terminate this interview before it got too difficult and thought he had found a good compromise can you sum up your ideas in less than oh a thou sand bits yes i think so well if you can make it sound like a straightforward scientific theory ill send it top priority to the rama committee then a copy can go to your church at the same time and everyone will be happy thank you commander i really appreciate it oh im not doing this to save my conscience id just bike to see what the committee makes of it even if i dont agree with you all along the line you may have hit on something important well well know at perihelion wont we yes well know at perihelion when boris rodrigo had left norton called the bridge and gave the necessary authorization he thought he had solved the problem rather neatly besides just suppose that boris was right he might have increased his chances of being among the saved chapter twentyone after the storm as they drifted along the now familiar corridor of the alpha airlock complex norton wondered if they had let impatience overcome caution they had waited aboard endeavour for fortyeight hours two precious days ready for instant departure if events should justify it but nothing had happened the instruments left in rama had detected no unusual activity frustratingly the television camera on the hub had been blinded by a fog which had reduced visibility to a few metres and bad only now started to retreat when they operated the final airlock door and floated out into the catscradle of guideropes around the hub norton was struck first by the change in the light it was no longer harshly blue but was much more mellow and gentle reminding him of a bright hazy day on earth he looked outwards along the axis of the world and could see nothing except a glowing featureless tunnel of white reaching all the way to those strange mountains at the south pole the interior of rama was completely blanketed with clouds and nowhere was a break visible in the overcast the top of the layer was quite sharply de fined it formed a smaller cylinder inside the larger one of this spinning world leaving a central core five or six kilometres wide quite clear except for a few stray wisps of cirrus the immense tube of cloud was bit from underneath by the six artificial suns of rama the locations of the three on this northern continent were dearly defined by diffuse strips of light but those on the far side of the cylindrical sea merged together into a continuous glow ing band what is happening down beneath those clouds nor ton asked himself but at least the storm which had centrifuged them into such perfect symmetry about the axis of rama had now died away unless there were some other surprises it would be safe to descend it seemed appropriate n this return visit to use the team that had made the first deep penetration into rama sergeant myron like every other member of en deavours crew now fully met surgeoncommander ernsts physical requirements he even maintained with convincing sincerity that he was never going to wear his old uniforms again as norton watched mercer calvert and myron swim ming quickly and confidently down the ladder he re minded himself how much had changed that first time they had descended in cold and darkness now they were going towards light and warmth and on all earlier visits they had been confident that rama was dead that might yet be true in a biological sense but something was stirring and boris rodrigos phrase would do as well as any other the spirit of rama was awake when they had reached the platform at the foot of the ladder and were preparing to start down the stairway mercer carried out his usual routine test of the atmo sphere there were some things that he never took for granted even when the people around him were breath ing perfectly comfortably without aids he had been known to stop for an air check before opening his helmet when asked to justify such excessive caution he had an swered because human senses arent good enough thats why you may think youre fine but you could fall flat on your face with the next deep breath he booked at his meter and said damn whats the trouble asked calvert its broken reading too high odd ive never known that to happen before ill check it on my breathing cir cuit he plugged the compact little analyser into the test point of his oxygen supply then stood in thoughtful silence for a while his companions booked at him with anxious concern anything that upset karl was to be taken very seriously indeed he unplugged the meter used it to sample the rama atmosphere again then called hub control skipper will you take an reading there was a much longer pause than the request justi fied then norton radioed back i think theres some thing wrong with my meter a slow smile spread across mercers face its up fifty per cent isnt it yes what does that mean it means that we can all take off our masks isnt that convenient im not sure replied norton echoing the sarcasm in mercers voice it seems too good to be true there was no need to say any more like all spacemen commander norton had a profound suspicion of things that were too good to be true mercer cracked his mask open a trifle and took a cau tious sniff for the first time at this altitude the air was perfectly breathable the musty dead smell had gone so had the excessive dryness which in the past had caused several respiratory complaints humidity was now an as tonishing eighty per cent doubtless the thawing of the sea was responsible for this there was a muggy feeling in the air though not an unpleasant one it was like a summer evening mercer told himself on some tropical coast the climate inside rama had improved dramatic ally during the last few days and why the increased humidity was no problem the startling rise in oxygen was much more difficult to explain as he recommenced the descent mercer began a whole series of mental calculations he had not arrived at any satisfactory result by the time they entered the cloud layer it was a dramatic experience for the transition was very abrupt at one moment they were sliding down wards in clear air gripping the smooth metal of the hand rail so that they would not gain speed too swiftly in this quarterofagravity region then suddenly they shot in to a blinding white fog and visibility dropped to a few metres mercer put on the brakes so quickly that calvert almost bumped into him and myron did bump into calvert nearly knocking him off the rail take it easy said mercer spread out so we can just see each other and dont let yourself build up speed in case i have to stop suddenly in eerie silence they continued to glide downwards through the fog calvert could just see mercer as a vague shadow ten metres ahead and when he looked back myron was at the same distance behind him in some ways this was even spookier than descending in the complete darkness of the raman night then at least the searchlight beams had shown them what lay ahead but this was like diving in poor visibility in the open sea it was impossible to tell how far they had travelled and calvert guessed they had almost reached the fourth level when mercer suddenly braked again when they had bunched together he whispered listen dont you hear something yes said myron after a minute it sounds bike the wind calvert was not so sure he turned his head back and forth trying to locate the direction of the very faint murmur that had come to them through the fog then abandoned the attempt as hopeless they continued the slide reached the fourth level and started on towards the fifth all the while the sound grew louder and more hauntingly familiar they were half way down the fourth stairway before myron called out now do you recognize it they would have identified it bong ago but it was not a sound they would ever have associated with any world except earth coming out of the fog from a source whose distance could not be guessed was the steady thunder of falling water a few minutes later the cloud ceiling ended as ab ruptly as it had begun they shot out into the blinding glare of the raman day made more brilliant by the bight reflected from the lowhanging clouds there was the familiar curving plain now made more acceptable to mind and senses because its full circle could no longer be seen it was not too difficult to pretend that they were booking along a broad valley and that the upward sweep of the sea was really an outward one they halted at the fifth and penultimate platform to report that they were through the cloud cover and to make a careful survey as far as they could tell nothing had changed down there on the plain but up here on the northern dome rama had brought forth another won der so there was the origin of the sound they had heard descending from some hidden source in the clouds three or four kilometres away was a waterfall and for long minutes they stared at it silently almost unable to be lieve their eyes logic told them that on this spinning world no falling object could move in a straight line but there was something horribly unnatural about a curving waterfall that curved sideways to end many kilometres away from the point directly below its source if galileo had been born in this world said mercer at length hed have gone crazy working out the laws of dynamics i thought i knew them calvert replied and im going crazy anyway doesnt it upset you prof why should it said sergeant myron its a perfectly straightforward demonstration of the coriolis effect i wish i could show it to some of my students mercer was staring thoughtfully at the globecircling band of the cylindrical sea have you noticed whats happened to the water he said at last why its no longer so blue id call it peagreen what does that signify perhaps the same thing that it does on earth laura called the sea an organic soup waiting to be shaken into life maybe thats exactly whats happened in a couple of days it took millions of years on earth three hundred and seventyfive million according to the latest estimate so thats where the oxygens come from ramas shot through the anerobic stage and has got to photosynthetic plants in about fortyeight hours i wonder what it will produce tomorrow chapter twentytwo to sail the cylindrical sea when they reached the foot of the stairway they had an other shock at first it appeared that something had gone through the camp overturning equipment even collect ing smaller objects and carrying them away but after a brief examination their alarm was replaced by a rather shamefaced annoyance the culprit was only the wind though they had tied down all loose objects before they left some ropes must have parted during exceptionally strong gusts it was sev eral days before they were able to retrieve all their scat tered property otherwise there seemed no major changes even the silence of rama had returned now that the ephemeral storms of spring were over and out there at the edge of the plain was a calm sea waiting for the first ship in a million years shouldnt one christen a new boat with a bottle of cham pagne even if we had any on board i wouldnt allow such a criminal waste anyway its too bate weve already launched the thing at least it does float youve won your bet jimmy ill settle when we get back to earth its got to have a name any ideas the subject of these unflattering comments was now bobbing beside the steps beading down into the cylindri cal sea it was a small raft constructed from six empty storage drums held together by a light metal framework building it assembling it at camp alpha and hauling it on demountabbe wheels across more than ten kilometres of plain had absorbed the crews entire energies for sev eral days it was a gamble that had better pay off the prize was worth the risk the enigmatic towers of new york gleaming there in the shadowless bight five kilometres away had taunted them ever since they had entered rama no one doubted that the city or what ever it might be was the real heart of this world if they did nothing else they must reach new york we still dont have a name skipper what about it norton laughed then became suddenly serious ive got one for you call it resolution why that was one of cooks ships its a good name may she live up to it there was a thoughtful silence then sergeant barnes who had been principally responsible for the design asked for three volunteers everyone present held up a hand sorry we only have four lifejackets boris jimmy pieter youve all done some sailing lets try her out no one thought it in the least peculiar that an execu tive sergeant was now taking charge of the proceedings ruby barnes had the only masters certificate aboard so that settled the matter she had navigated racing tri marans across the pacific and it did not seem likely that a few kilometres of deadcalm water could present much of a challenge to her skills ever since she had set eyes upon the sea she had been determined to make this voyage in all the thousands of years that man had had dealings with the waters of his own world no sailor had ever faced anything remotely like this in the last few days a silly little jingle had been running through her mind and she could not get rid of it to sail the cylindrical sea well that was pre cisely what she was going to do her passengers took their places on the improvised bucket seats and ruby opened the throttle the twenty kilowatt motor started to whirr the chaindrives of the reduction gear blurred and resolution surged away to the cheers of the spectators ruby had hoped to get fifteen kph with this load but would settle for anything over ten a halfkilometre course had been measured along the cliff and she made the round trip in five and a half minutes allowing for turning time this worked out at twelve kph she was quite happy with that with no power but with three energetic paddlers help ing her own more skilful blade ruby was able to get a quarter of this speed so even if the motor broke down they could get back to shore in a couple of hours the heavyduty power cells could provide enough energy to circumnavigate the world she was carrying two spares to be on the safe side and now that the fog had completely burned away even such a cautious mariner as ruby was prepared to put to sea without a compass she saluted smartly as she stepped ashore maiden voyage of resolution successfully completed sir now awaiting your instructions very good admiral when will you be ready to sail as soon as stores can be loaded aboard and the har bour master gives us clearance then we leave at dawn aye aye sir five kilometres of water does not seem very much on a map it is very different when one is in the middle of it they had been cruising for only ten minutes and the fiftymetre cliff facing the northern continent already seemed a surprising distance away yet mysteriously new york hardly appeared much closer than before but most of the time they paid little attention to the land they were still too engrossed in the wonder of the sea they no longer made the nervous jokes that had punctuated the start of the voyage this new experience was too overwhelming every time norton told himself he felt that he had grown accustomed to rama it produced some new won der as resolution hummed steadily forward it seemed that they were caught in the trough of a gigantic wave a wave which curved u on either side until it became vertical then overhung until the two flanks met in a liquid arch sixteen kilometres above their heads despite everything that reason and logic told them none of the voyagers could for long throw off the impression that at any minute those millions of tons of water would come crashing down from the sky yet despite this their main feeling was one of exhilara tion there was a sense of danger without any real dan ger unless of course the sea itself produced any more surprises that was a distinct possibility for as mercer had guessed the water was now alive every spoonful con tained thousands of spherical singlecelled microorgan isms similar to the earliest forms of plankton that had existed in the oceans of earth yet they showed puzzling differences they lacked a nucleus as well as many of the other minimum require ments of even the most primitive terrestrial lifeforms and although laura ernst now doubling as research scientist as well as ships doctor had proved that they definitely generated oxygen there were far too few of them to account for the augmentation of ramas atmo sphere they should have existed in billions not mere thousands then she discovered that their numbers were dwind ling rapidly and must have been far higher during the first hours of the raman dawn it was as if there had been a brief explosion of life recapitulating on a trillion fold swifter timescale the early history of earth now perhaps it had exhausted itself the drifting microorgan isms were disintegrating releasing their stores of chemi cals back into the sea if you have to swim for it dr ernst had warned the mariners keep your mouths closed a few drops wont matter if you spit them out right away but all those weird organometallic salts add up to a fairly poisonous package and id hate to have to work out an antidote this danger fortunately seemed very unlikely reso lution could stay afloat if any two of her buoyancy tanks were punctured when told of this joe calvert had muttered darkly remember the titanic and even if she sank the crude but efficient lifejackets would keep their heads above water although laura had been re luctant to give a firm ruling on this she did not think that a few hours immersion in the sea would be fatal but she did not recommend it after twenty minutes of steady progress new york was no longer a distant island it was becoming a real place and details which they had seen only through telescopes and photoenlargements were now revealing themselves as massive solid structures it was now strikingly appar ent that the city like so much of rama was triplicated it consisted of three identical circular complexes or super structures rising from a long oval foundation photo graphs taken from the hub also indicated that each com plex was itself divided into three equal components like a pie sliced into degree portions this would greatly simplify the task of exploration presumably they had to examine only one ninth of new york to have seen the whole of it even this would be a formidable undertak ing it would mean investigating at least a square kilo metre of buildings and machinery some of which tow ered hundreds of metres into the air the ramans it seemed had brought the art of triple redundancy to a high degree of perfection this was demonstrated in the airlock system the stairways at the hub the artificial suns and where it really mattered they had even taken the next step new york appeared to be an example of tripletriple redundancy ruby was steering resolution towards the central com plex where a flight of steps led up from the water to the very top of the wall or levee which surrounded the island there was even a convenientlyplaced mooring post to which boats could be tied when she saw this ruby be came quite excited now she would never be content un til she found one of the craft in which the ramans sailed their extraordinary sea norton was the first to step ashore he looked back at his three companions and said wait here on the boat until i get to the top of the wall when i wave pieter and boris will join me you stay at the helm ruby so that we can cast off at a moments notice if anything happens to me report to karl and follow his instructions use your best judgement but no heroics understood yes skipper good luck commander norton did not really believe in luck he never got into a situation until he had analysed all the factors involved and had secured his line of retreat but once again rama was forcing him to break some of his cherished rules almost every factor here was unknown as unknown as the pacific and the great barrier reef had been to his hero three and a half centuries ago yes he could do with all the luck that happened to be lying around the stairway was a virtual duplicate of the one down which they had descended on the other side of the sea doubtless his friends over there were looking straight across at him through their telescopes and straight was now the correct word in this one direction parallel to the axis of rama the sea was indeed completely flat it might well be the only body of water in the universe of which this was true for on all other worlds every sea or lake must follow the surface of a sphere with equal cur vature in all directions nearly at the top he reported speaking for the record and for his intently listening secondincommand five kilometres away still completely quiet radiation nor mal im holding the meter above my head just in case this wall is acting as a shield for anything and if there are any hostiles on the other side theyll shoot that first he was joking of course and yet why take any chances when it was just as easy to avoid them when he took the last step he found that the flat topped embankment was about ten metres thick on the inner side an alternating series of ramps and stairways led down to the main level of the city twenty metres below in effect he was standing on a high wall which completely surrounded new york and so was able to get a grandstand view of it it was a view almost stunning in its complexity and his first act was to make a slow panoramic scan with his cam era then he waved to his companions and radioed back across the sea no sign of any activity everything quiet come on up well start exploring chapter twentythree ny rama it was not a city it was a machine norton had come to that conclusion in ten minutes and saw no reason to change it after they had made a complete traverse of the island a city whatever the nature of its occupants surely had to provide some form of accommodation there was nothing here of that nature unless it was under ground and if that was the case where were the en trances the stairways the elevators he had not found anything that even qualified as a simple door the closest analogy he had ever seen to this place on earth was a giant chemical processing plant however there were no stockpiles of raw materials or any indica tions of a transport system to move them around nor could he imagine where the finished product would emerge still less what that product could possibly be it was all very baffling and more than a little frustrating anybody care to make a guess he said at last to all who might be listening if this is a factory what does it make and where does it get its raw materials ive a suggestion skipper said karl mercer over on the far shore suppose it uses the sea according to doc that contains just about anything you can think of it was a plausible answer and norton had already con sidered it there could well be buried pipes leading to the sea in fact there must be for any conceivable chemical plant would require large quantities of water but he had a suspicion of plausible answers they were so often wrong thats a good idea karl but what does new york do with its seawater for a long time nobody answered from ship hub or northern plain then an unexpected voice spoke thats easy skipper but youre all going to laugh at me no were not ravi go ahead sergeant ravi mcandrews chief steward and simp master was the last person on this ship who would norm ally get involved in a technical discussion his iq was modest and his scientific knowledge was minimal but he was no fool and had a natural shrewdness which everyone respected well its a factory all right skipper and maybe the sea provides the raw material after all thats how it all happened on earth though in a different way i believe new york is a factory for making ramans somebody somewhere snickered but became quickly silent and did not identify himself you know ravi said his commander at last that theory is crazy enough to be true and im not sure if i want to see it tested at least until i get back to the mainland this celestial new york was just about as wide as the island of manhattan but its geometry was totally differ ent there were few straight thoroughfares it was a maze of short concentric arcs with radial spokes linking them luckily it was impossible to lose ones bearings inside rama a single glance at the sky was enough to establish the northsouth axis of the world they paused at almost every intersection to make a panoramic scan when all these hundreds of pictures were sorted out it would be a tedious but fairly straight forward job to construct an accurate scale model of the city norton suspected that the resulting jigsaw puzzle would keep scientists busy for generations it was even harder to get used to the silence here than it had been out on the plain of rama a citymachine should make some sound yet there was not even the faintest of electric hums or the slightest whisper of mech anical motion several times norton put his ear to the ground or to the side of a building and listened in tently he could hear nothing except the pounding of his own blood the machines were sleeping they were not even tick ing over would they ever wake again and for what pur pose everything was in perfect condition as usual it was easy to believe that the closing of a single circuit in some patient hidden computer would bring all this maze back to life when at last they had reached the far side of the city they climbed to the top of the surrounding levee and looked across the southern branch of the sea for a long time norton stared at the fivehundredmetre cliff that barred them from almost half of rama and judging from their telescopic surveys the most complex and var ied half from this angle it appeared an ominous for bidding black and it was easy to think of it as a prison wall surrounding a whole continent nowhere along its entire circle was there a flight of stairways or any other means of access he wondered how the ramans reached their southern land from new york probably there was an under ground transport system running beneath the sea but they must also have aircraft as well there were many open areas here in the city that could be used for landing to discover a raman vehicle would be a major accom plishment especially if they could learn to operate it though could any conceivable powersource still be functioning after several hundred thousand years there were numerous structures that had the functional look of hangars or garages but they were all smooth and windowless as if they had been sprayed with sealant sooner or later norton had told himself grimly well be forced to use explosives and laser beams he was deter mined to put off this decision to the last possible moment his reluctance to use brute force was based partly on pride partly on fear he did not wish to behave like a technological barbarian smashing what he could not understand after all he was an uninvited visitor in this world and should act accordingly as for his fear perhaps that was too strong word apprehension might be better the ramans seemed to have planned for everything he was not anxious to dis cover the precautions they had taken to guard their property when he sailed back to the mainland it would be with empty hands chapter twentyfour dragonfly lieutenant james pak was the most junior officer on board endeavour and this was only his fourth mission into deep space he was ambitious and due for promo tion he had also committed a serious breach of regula tions no wonder therefore that he took a long time to make up his mind it would be a gamble if he lost he could be in deep trouble he could not only be risking his career he might even be risking his neck but if he succeeded he would be a hero what finally convinced him was neither of these arguments it was the certainty that if he did nothing at all he would spend the rest of his life brooding over his lost opportunity nevertheless he was still hesitant when he asked the captain for a private meeting what is it this time norton asked himself as he analy sed the uncertain expression on the young officers face he remembered his delicate interview with boris rod rigo no it wouldnt be anything like that jimmy was certainly not the religious type the only interests he had ever shown outside his work were sport and sex prefer ably combined it could hardly be the former and norton hoped it was not the latter he had encountered most of the prob lems that a commanding officer could encounter in this department except the classical one of an unscheduled birth during a mission though this situation was the subject of innumerable jokes it had never happened yet of time well jimmy what is it i have an idea commander i know how to reach the southern continent even to the south pole im listening how do you propose to do it er by flying there jimmy ive had at least five proposals to do that more if you count crazy suggestions from earth weve looked into the possibility of adapting our spacesuit pro pulsors but air drag would make them hopelessly ineffici ent theyd run out of fuel before they could go ten kilo metres i know that but i have the answer lt paks attitude was a curious mixture of complete confidence and barely suppressed nervousness norton was quite baffled what was the kid worried about surely he knew his commanding officer well enough to be certain that no reasonable proposal would be laughed out of court well go on if it works ill see your promotion is retro active that little halfpromise halfjoke didnt go down as well as he had hoped jimmy gave a rather sickly smile made several false starts then decided on an oblique ap proach to the subject you know commander that i was in the lunar olym pics last year of course sorry you didnt win it was bad equipment i know what went wrong i have friends on mars whove been working on it in secret we want to give everyone a surprise mars but i didnt know not many people do the sports still new there its only been tried in the xante sportsdome but the best aerodynamicists in the solar system are on mars if you can fly in that atmosphere you can fly anywhere now my idea was that if the martians could build a good machine with all their knowhow it would really perform on the moon where gravity is only half as strong that seems plausible but how does it help us norton was beginning to guess but he wanted to give jimmy plenty of rope well i formed a syndicate with some friends in lowell city theyve built a fully aerobatic flyer with some re finements that no one has ever seen before in lunar grav ity under the olympic dome it should create a sensa tion and win you the gold medal i hope so let me see if i follow your train of thought correctly a skybike that could enter the lunar olympics at a sixth of a gravity would be even more sensational inside rama with no gravity at all you could fly it right along the axis from the north pole to the south and back again yes easily the oneway trip would take three hours nonstop but of course you could rest whenever you wanted to as long as you kept near the axis its a brilliant idea and i congratulate you what a pity skybikes arent part of regular space survey equip ment jimmy seemed to have some difficulty in finding words he opened his mouth several times but nothing hap pened all right jimmy as a matter of morbid interest and purely off the record how did you smuggle the thing aboard er recreational stores well you werent lying and what about the weight its only twenty kilograms only still thats not as bad as i thought in fact im astonished you can build a bike for that weight some have been only fifteen but they were too fragile and usually folded up when they made a turn theres no danger of dragonfly doing that as i said shes fully aero batic dragonfly nice name so tell me just how you plan to use her then i can decide whether a promotion or a court martial is in order or both chapter twentyfive maiden flight dragonfly was certainly a good name the long tapering wings were almost invisible except when the light struck them from certain angles and was refracted into rainbow hues it was as if a soapbubble had been wrapped round a delicate tracery of aerofoil sections the envelope en dosing the little flyer was an organic film only a few molecules thick yet strong enough to control and direct the movements of a fiftykph air flow the pilot who was also the powerplant and the guid ance system sat on a tiny seat at the centre of gravity in a semireclining position to reduce air resistance control was by a single stick which could be moved backwards and forwards right and left the only instrument was a piece of weighted ribbon attached to the leading edge to show the direction of the relative wind once the flyer had been assembled at the hub jimmy pak would allow no one to touch it clumsy handling could snap one of the singlefibre structural members and those glittering wings were an almost irresistible at traction to prying fingers it was hard to believe that there was really something there as he watched jimmy climb into the contraption com mander norton began to have second thoughts if one of those wiresized struts snapped when dragonfly was on the other side of the cylindrical sea jimmy would have no way of getting back even if he was able to make a safe landing they were also breaking one of the most sacrosanct rules of space exploration a man was going alone into unknown territory beyond all possibility of help the only consolation was that he would be in full view and communication all the time they would know exactly what had happened to him if he did meet with disaster yet this opportunity was far too good to miss if one believed in fate or destiny it would be challenging the gods themselves to neglect the only chance they might ever have of reaching the far side of rama and seeing at close quarters the mysteries of the south pole jimmy knew what he was attempting far better than anyone in the crew could tell him this was precisely the sort of risk that had to be taken if it failed that was the luck of the game you couldnt win them all now listen to me carefully jimmy said surgeoncom mander ernst its very important not to overexert your self remember the oxygen level here at the axis is still very low if you feel breathless at any time stop and hyperventilate for thirty seconds but no longer jimmy nodded absentmindedly as he tested the con trols the whole rudderelevator assembly which formed a single unit on an outrigger five metres behind the rudi mentary cockpit began to twist around then the flap shaped ailerons halfway along the wing moved altern ately up and down do you want me to swing the prop asked joe calvert unable to suppress memories of twohundredyearold war movies ignition contact probably no one except jimmy knew what he was talking about but it helped to relieve the tension very slowly jimmy started to move the footpedals the flimsy broad fan of the airscrew like the wing a delicate skeleton covered with shimmering film began to turn by the time it had made a few revolutions it had disappeared completely and dragonfly was on her way she moved straight outwards from the hub moving slowly along the axis of rama when she had travelled a hundred metres jimmy stopped pedalling it was strange to see an obviously aerodynamic vehicle hanging motion less in midair this must be the first time such a thing had ever happened except possibly on a very limited scale inside one of the larger spacestations how does she handle norton called response good stability poor but i know what the trouble is no gravity well be better off a kilometre lower down now wait a minute is that safe by losing altitude jimmy would be sacrificing his main advantage as long as he stayed precisely on the axis he and dragonfly would be completely weightless he could hover effortlessly or even go to sleep if he wished but as soon as he moved away from the central line around which rama spun the pseudoweight of centrifugal force would reappear and so unless he could maintain himself at this alti tude he would continue to lose height and at the same time to gain weight it would be an accelerating process which could end in catastrophe the gravity down on the plain of rama was twice that in which dragonfly had been designed to operate jimmy might be able to make a safe landing he could certainly never take off again but he had already considered all this and he an swered confidently enough i can manage a tenth of a gee without any trouble and shell handle more easily in denser air in a slow leisurely spiral dragonfly drifted across the sky roughly following the line of stairway alpha down towards the plain from some angles the little skybike was almost invisible jimmy seemed to be sitting in mid air pedalling furiously sometimes he moved into spurts of up to thirty kilometres an hour then he would coast to a halt getting the feel of the controls before accelerating again and he was always very careful to keep a safe dist ance from the curving end of rama it was soon obvious that dragonfly handled much bet ter at lower altitudes she no longer rolled around at any angle but stabilized so that her wings were parallel to the plain seven kilometres below jimmy completed sev eral wide orbits then started to climb upwards again he finally halted a jew metres above his waiting colleagues and realized a little belatedly that he was not quite sure how to land this gossamer craft shall we throw you a rope norton asked halfseri ously no skipper ive got to work this out myself i wont have anyone to help me at the other end he sat thinking for a while then started to ease dra gonfly towards the hub with short bursts of power she quickly lost momentum between each as air drag brought her to rest again when he was only five metres away and the skybike was still barely moving jimmy abandoned ship he let himself float towards the nearest safety line in the hub webwork grasped it then swung around in time to catch the approaching bike with his hands the manoeuvre was so neatly executed that it drew a round of applause for my next act joe calvert began jimmy was quick to disclaim any credit that was messy he said but now i know how to do it ill take a stickybomb on a twentymetre line then ill be able to pull myself in wherever i want to give me your wrist jimmy ordered the doctor and blow into this bag ill want a blood sample too did you have any difficulty in breathing only at this altitude hey what do you want the blood for sugar level then i can tell how much energy youve used weve got to make sure you carry enough fuel for the mission by the way whats the endurance record for skybiking two hours twentyfive minutes three point six seconds on the moon of course a two kilometre circuit in the olympic dome and you think you can keep it up for six hours easily since i can stop for a rest at any time sky biking on the moon is at least twice as hard as it is here ok jimmy back to the lab ill give you a gonogo as soon as ive analysed these samples i dont want to raise false hopes but i think you can make it a large smile of satisfaction spread across jimmy paks ivoryhued countenance as he followed surgeoncom mander ernst to the airlock he called back to his com panions hands off please i dont want anyone put ting his fist through the wings ill see to that jimmy promised the commander dragonfly is off limits to everybody including myself chapter twentysix the voice of rama the real magnitude of his adventure did not hit jimmy pak until he reached the coast of the cylindrical sea until now he had been over known territory barring a catastrophic structural failure he could always land and walk back to base in a few hours that option no longer existed if he came down in the sea he would probably drown quite unpleasantly in its poisonous waters and even if he made a safe landing in the southern continent it might be impossible to rescue him before endeavour had to break away from ramas sunward orbit he was also acutely aware that the foreseeable disasters were the ones most unlikely to happen the totally un known region over which he was flying might produce any number of surprises suppose there were flying crea tures here who objected to his intrusion he would hate to engage in a dogfight with anything larger than a pigeon a few wellplaced pecks could destroy dragonflys aerodynamics yet if there were no hazards there would be no achievement no sense of adventure millions of men would gladly have traded places with him now he was going not only where no one had ever been before but where no one would ever go again in all of history he would be the only human being to visit the southern re gions of rama whenever he felt fear brushing against his mind he could remember that he had now grown accustomed to sitting in midair with the world wrapped around him because he had dropped two kilometres below the central axis he had acquired a definite sense of up and down the ground was only six kilometres below but the arch of the sky was ten kilometres overhead the city of london was hang ing up there near the zenith new york on the other hand was the right way up directly ahead dragonfly said hub control youre getting a little low twentytwo hundred metres from the axis thanks he replied ill gain altitude let me know when im back at twenty this was something hed have to watch there was a natural tendency to lose height and he had no instru ments to tell him exactly where he was if he got too far away from the zerogravity of the axis he might never be able to climb back to it fortunately there was a wide margin for error and there was always someone watching his progress through a telescope at the hub he was now well out over the sea pedalling along at a steady twenty kilometres an hour in five minutes he would be over new york already the island looked rather like a ship sailing for ever round and round the cylindrical sea when he reached new york he flew a circle over it stopping several times so that his little tv camera could send back steady vibrationfree images the panorama of buildings towers industrial plants power stations or whatever they were was fascinating but essentially meaningless no matter how long he stared at its com plexity he was unlikely to learn anything the camera would record far more details than he could possibly as similate and one day perhaps years hence some stu dent might find in them the key to ramas secrets after leaving new york he crossed the other half of the sea in only fifteen minutes though he was not aware of it he had been flying fast over water but as soon as he reached the south coast he unconsciously relaxed and his speed dropped by several kilometres an hour he might be in wholly alien territory but at least he was over land as soon as he had crossed the great cliff that formed the seas southern limit he panned the tv camera com pletely round the circle of the world beautiful said hub control this will keep the map makers happy how are you feeling im fine just a little fatigue but no more than i expected how far do you make me from the pole fifteen point six kilometres tell me when im at ten ill take a rest then and make sure i dont get low again ill start climbing when ive five to go twenty minutes later the world was closing in upon him he had come to the end of the cylindrical section and was entering the southern dome he had studied it for hours through the telescopes at the other end of rama and had learned its geography by heart even so that had not fully prepared him for the spectacle all around him in almost every way the southern and northern ends of rama differed completely here was no triad of stair ways no series of narrow concentric plateaux no sweep ing curve from hub to plain instead there was an im mense central spike more than five kilometres long ex tending along the axis six smaller ones half this size were equally spaced around it the whole assembly looked like a group of remarkably symmetrical stalactites hanging from the roof of a cave or inverting the point of view the spires of some cambodian temple set at the bottom of a crater linking these slender tapering towers and curving down from them to merge eventually in the cylindrical plain were flying buttresses that looked massive enough to bear the weight of a world and this perhaps was their function if they were indeed the elements of some exotic drive units as some had suggested lieutenant pak approached the central spike cautiously stopped pedalling while he was still a hundred metres away and let dragonfly drift to rest he checked the radiation level and found only ramas very low back ground there might be forces at work here which no human instruments could detect but that was another unavoidable risk what can you see hub control asked anxiously just big horn its absolutely smooth no markings and the points so sharp you could use it as a needle im almost scared to go near it he was only half joking it seemed incredible that so massive an object should taper to such a geometrically perfect point jimmy had seen collections of insects im paled upon pins and he had no desire for his own drag onfly to meet a similar fate he pedalled slowly forward until the spike had flared out to several metres in diameter then stopped again opening a small container he rather gingerly extracted a sphere about as big as a baseball and tossed it towards the spike as it drifted away it played out a barely visible thread the stickybomb hit the smoothly curving surface and did not rebound jimmy gave the thread an experi mental twitch then a harder tug like a fisherman haul ing in his catch he slowly wound dragonfly across to the tip of the appropriately christened big horn until he was able to put out his hand and make contact with it i suppose you could call this some kind of touchdown he reported to hub control it feels like glass almost frictionless and slightly warm the stickybomb worked fine now im trying the mike lets see if the suction pad holds as well plugging in the leads anything coming through there was a long pause from the hub then control said disgustedly not a damn thing except the usual thermal noises will you tap it with a piece of metal then at least well find if its hollow ok now what wed like you to fly along the spike making a com plete scan every halfkilometre and looking out for any thing unusual then if youre sure its safe you might go across to one of the little horns but only if youre cer tain you can get back to zero gee without any problems three kilometres from the axis thats slightly above lunar gravity dragonfly was designed for that ill just have to work harder jimmy this is the captain ive got second thoughts on that judging by your pictures the smaller spikes are just the same as the big one get the best coverage of them you can with the zoom lens i dont want you leaving the lowgravity region unless you see something that looks very important then well talk it over ok skipper said jimmy and perhaps there was just a trace of relief in his voice ill stay close to big horn here we go again he felt he was dropping straight downwards into a narrow valley between a group of incredibly tall and slender mountains big horn now towered a kilometre above him and the six spikes of the little horns were looming up all around the complex of buttresses and flying arches which surrounded the lower slopes was ap proaching rapidly he wondered if he could make a safe landing somewhere down there in that cyclopean archi tecture he could no longer land on big horn itself for the gravity on its widening slopes was now too power ful to be counteracted by the feeble force of the sticky bomb as he came even closer to the south pole he began to feel more and more like a sparrow flying beneath the vaulted roof of some great cathedral though no cathe dial ever built had been even one hundredth the size of this place he wondered if it was indeed a religious shrine or something remotely analogous but quickly dis missed the idea nowhere in rama had there been any trace of artistic expression everything was purely func tional perhaps the ramans felt that they already knew the ultimate secrets of the universe and were no longer haunted by the yearnings and aspirations that drove mankind that was a chilling thought quite alien to jimmys usual notveryprofound philosophy he felt an urgent need to resume contact and reported his situation back to his distant friends say again dragonfly replied hub control we cant understand you your transmission is garbled i repeat im near the base of little horn number six and am using the stickybomb to haul myself in understand only partially can you hear me yes perfectly repeat perfectly please start counting numbers one two three four got part of that give us beacon for fifteen seconds then go back to voice here it is jimmy switched on the lowpowered beacon which would locate him anywhere inside rama and counted off the seconds when he went over to voice again he asked plaintively whats happening can you hear me now presumably hub didnt because the controller then asked for fifteen seconds of tv not until jimmy had re peated the question twice did the message get through glad you can hear us ok jimmy but theres some thing very peculiar happening at your end listen over the radio he heard the familiar whistle of his own beacon played back to him for a moment it was perfectly normal then a weird distortion crept into it the thousandcycle whistle became modulated by a deep throbbing pulse so low that it was almost beneath the threshold of hearing it was a kind of bassoprofundo flutter in which each individual vibration could be heard and the modulation was itself modulated it rose and fell rose and fell with a period of about five seconds never for a moment did it occur to jimmy that there was something wrong with his radio transmitter this was from outside though what it was and what it meant was beyond his imagination hub control was not much wiser but at least it had a theory we think you must be in some kind of very intense field probably magnetic with a frequency of about ten cycles it may be strong enough to be dangerous suggest you get out right away it may only be local switch on your beacon again and well play it back to you then you can tell when youre getting clear of the interference jimmy hastily jerked the stickybomb loose and aban doned his attempt to land he swung dragonfly round in a wide circle listening as he did so to the sound that wav ered in his earphones after flying only a few metres he could tell that its intensity was falling rapidly as hub control had guessed it was extremely localized he paused for a moment at the last spot where he could hear it like a faint throbbing deep in his brain so might a primitive savage have listened in awestruck ig norance to the low humming of a giant power trans former and even the savage might have guessed that the sound he heard was merely the stray leakage from colossal energies fully controlled but biding their time whatever this sound meant jimmy was glad to be clear of it this was no place among the overwhelming architecture of the south pole for a lone man to listen to the voice of rama chapter twentyseven electric wind as jimmy turned homewards the northern end of rama seemed incredibly far away even the three giant stair ways were barely visible as a faint y etched on the dome that closed the world the band of the cylindrical sea was a wide and menacing barrier waiting to swallow him up if like icarus his fragile wings should fail but he had come all this way with no problems and though he was feeling slightly tired he now felt that he had nothing to worry about he had not even touched his food or water and had been too excited to rest on the return journey he would relax and take it easy he was also cheered by the thought that the homeward trip could be twenty kilometres shorter than the outward one for as long as he cleared the sea he could make an emergency landing anywhere in the northern continent that would be a nuisance because he would have a long walk and much worse would have to abandon dragon fly but it gave him a very comforting safety margin he was now gaining altitude climbing back towards the central spike big horns tapering needle still stretched for a kilometre ahead of him and sometimes he felt it was the axis on which this whole world turned he had almost reached the tip of big horn when he became aware of a curious sensation a feeling of forebod ing and indeed of physical as well as psychological dis comfort had come over him he suddenly recalled and this did nothing at all to help a phrase he had once come across someone is walking over your grave at first he shrugged it off and continued his steady pedalling he certainly had no intention of reporting anything as tenuous as a vague malaise to hub control but as it grew steadily worse he was tempted to do so it could not possibly be psychological if it was his mind was much more powerful than he realized forte could quite literally feel his skin beginning to crawl now seriously alarmed he stopped in midair and be gan to consider the situation what made it all the more peculiar was the fact that this depressed heavy feeling was not completely novel he had known it before but could not remember where he looked around him nothing had changed the great spike of big horn was a few hundred metres above with the other side of rama spanning the sky beyond that eight kilometres below lay the complicated patch work of the southern continent full of wonders that no other man would ever see in all the utterly alien yet now familiar landscape he could find no cause for his discom fort something was tickling the back of his hand for a moment he thought an insect had landed there and brushed it away without looking he had only halfcom pleted the swift motion when he realized what he was doing and checked himself feeling slightly foolish of course no one had ever seen an insect in rama he lifted his hand and stared at it mildly puzzled because the tickling sensation was still there it was then that he noticed that every individual hair was standing straight upright all the way up his forearm it was the same and so it was with his head when he checked with an exploring hand so that was the trouble he was in a tremendously powerful electric field the oppressed heavy sensation he had felt was that which sometimes precedes a thunder storm on earth the sudden realization of his predicament brought jimmy very near to panic never before in his life had he been in real physical danger like all spacemen he had known moments of frustration with bulky equipment and times when owing to mistakes or inexperience he had wrongly believed he was in a perilous situation but none of these episodes had lasted more than a few min utes and usually he was able to laugh at them almost at once this time there was no quick way out he felt naked and alone in a suddenly hostile sky surrounded by ti tanic forces which might discharge their furies at any moment dragonfly already fragile enough now seemed more insubstantial than the finest gossamer the first detonation of the gathering storm would blast her to fragments hub control he said urgently theres a static charge building up around me i think theres going to be a thunderstorm at any moment he had barely finished speaking when there was a flicker of light behind him by the time he had counted ten the first crackling rumble arrived three kilometres that put it back around the little horns he looked to wards them and saw that every one of the six needles seemed to be on fire brush discharges hundreds of metres long were dancing from their points as if they were giant lightning conductors what was happening back there could take place on an even larger scale near the tapering spike of big horn his best move would be to get as far as possible from this dangerous structure and to seek clear air he started to pedal again accelerating as swiftly as he could with out putting too great a strain on dragonfly at the same time he began to lose altitude even though this would mean entering the region of higher gravity he was now prepared to take such a risk eight kilo metres was much too far from the ground for his peace of mind the ominous black spike of big horn was still free of visible discharges but he did not doubt that tremendous potentials were building up there from time to time the thunder still reverberated behind him rolling round and round the circumference of the world it suddenly oc curred to jimmy how strange it was to have such a storm in a perfectly clear sky then he realized that this was not a meteorological phenomenon at all in fact it might be only a trivial leakage of energy from some hidden source deep in the southern cap of rama but why now and even more important what next he was now well past the tip of big horn and hoped that he would soon be beyond the range of any lightning discharges but now he had another problem the air was becoming turbulent and he had difficulty in controlling dragonfly a wind seemed to have sprung up from no where and if conditions became much worse the bikes fragile skeleton would be endangered he pedalled grimly on trying to smooth out the buffeting by varia tions in power and movements of his body because dragonfly was almost an extension of himself he was partly successful but he did not like the faint creaks of protest that came from the main spar nor the way in which the wings twisted with every gust and there was something else that worried him a faint rushing sound steadily growing in strength that seemed to come from the direction of big horn it soun ded like gas escaping from a valve under pressure and he wondered if it had anything to do with the turbulence which he was battling whatever its cause it gave him yet further grounds for disquiet from time to time he reported these phenomena rather briefly and breathlessly to hub control no one there could give him any advice or even suggest what might be happening but it was reassuring to hear the voices of his friends even though he was now beginning to fear that he would never see them again the turbulence was still increasing it almost felt as if he was entering a jet stream which he had once done in search of a record while flying a highaltitude glider on earth but what could possibly create a jet stream inside rama he had asked himself the right question as soon as he had formulated it he knew the answer the sound he had heard was the electric wind carrying away the tremendous ionization that must be building up around big horn charged air was spraying out along the axis of rama and more air was flowing into the low pressure region behind he looked back at that gigantic and now doubly threatening needle trying to visualize the boundaries of the gale that was blowing from it per haps the best tactic would be to fly by ear getting as far as possible away from the ominous hissing rama spared him the necessity of choice a sheet of flame burst out behind him filling the sky he had time to see it split into six ribbons of fire stretching from the tip of big horn to each of the little horns then the concussion reached him chapter twentyeight icarus jimmy pak had barely time to radio the wings buck ling im going to crash im going to crash when dragonfly started to fold up gracefully around him the left wing snapped cleanly in the middle and the outer section drifted away like a gently falling leaf the right wing put up a more complicated performance it twisted round at the root and angled back so sharply that its tip became entangled in the tail jimmy felt that he was sitting in a broken kite slowly falling down the sky yet he was not quite helpless the airscrew still worked and while he had power there was still some measure of control he had perhaps five minutes in which to use it was there any hope of reaching the sea no it was much too far away then he remembered that he was still thinking in terrestrial terms though he was a good swim mer it would be hours before he could possibly be res cued and in that time the poisonous waters would un doubtedly have killed him his only hope was to come down on land the problem of the sheer southern cliff he would think about later if there was any later he was falling very slowly here in this tenthofagrav ity zone but would soon start to accelerate as he got fur ther away from the axis however airdrag would com plicate the situation and would prevent him from build ing up too swift a rate of descent dragonfly even without power would act as a crude parachute the few kilo grammes of thrust he could still provide might make all the difference between life and death that was his only hope hub had stopped talking his friends could see exactly what was happening to him and knew that there was no way their words could help jimmy was now doing the most skilful flying of his life it was too bad he thought with grim humour that his audience was so small and could not appreciate the finer details of his performance he was going down in a wide spiral and as long as its pitch remained fairly flat his chances of survival were good his pedalling was helping to keep dragonfly air borne though he was afraid to exert maximum power in case the broken wings came completely adrift and every time he swung southwards he could appreciate the fan tastic display that rama had kindly arranged for his benefit the streamers of lightning still played from the tip of big horn down to the lesser peaks beneath but now the whole pattern was rotating the sixpronged crown of fire was turning against the spin of rama making one revo lution every few seconds jimmy felt that he was watch ing a giant electric motor in operation and perhaps that was not hopelessly far from the truth he was halfway down to the plain still orbiting in a fiat spiral when the firework display suddenly ceased he could feel the tension drain from the sky and knew with out looking that the hairs on his arms were no longer straining upright there was nothing to distract or hinder him now during the last few minutes of his fight for life now that he could be certain of the general area in which he must land he started to study it intently much of this region was a checkerboard of totally conflicting environments as if a mad landscape gardener had been given a free hand and told to exercise his imagination to the utmost the squares of the checkerboard were almost a kilometre on a side and though most of them were flat he could not be sure if they were solid their colours and textures varied so greatly he decided to wait until the last possible minute before making a decision it in deed he had any choice when there were a few hundred metres to go he made a last call to the hub ive still got some control will be down in half a minute will call you then that was optimistic and everyone knew it but he re fused to say goodbye he wanted his comrades to know that he had gone down fighting and without fear indeed he felt very little fear and this surprised him for he had never thought of himself as a particularly brave man it was almost as if he was watching the strug gles of a complete stranger and was not himself person ally involved rather he was studying an interesting problem in aerodynamics and changing various para meters to see what would happen almost the only emo tion he felt was a certain remote regret for lost oppor tunities of which the most important was the forthcom ing lunar olympics one future at least was decided dragonfly would never show her paces on the moon a hundred metres to go his ground speed seemed acceptable but how fast was he falling and here was one piece of luck the terrain was completely flat he would put forth all his strength in a final burst of power starting now the right wing having done its duty finally tore off at the roots dragonfly started to roll over and he tried to correct by throwing the weight of his body against the spin he was looking directly at the curving arch of land scape sixteen kilometres away when he hit it seemed altogether unfair and unreasonable that the sky should be so hard chapter twentynine first contact when jimmy pak returned to consciousness the first thing he became aware of was a splitting headache he almost welcomed it at least it proved that he was still alive then he tried to move and at once a wide selection of aches and pains brought themselves to his attention but as far as he could tell nothing seemed to be broken after that he risked opening his eyes but closed them at once when he found himself staring straight into the band of light along the ceiling of the world as a cure for headache that view was not recommended he was still lying there regaining his strength and won dering how soon it would be safe to open his eyes when there was a sudden crunching noise from close at hand turning his head very slowly towards the source of the sound he risked a look and almost lost consciousness again not more than five metres away a large crablike creature was apparently dining on the wreckage of poor dragonfly when jimmy recovered his wits he rolled slowly and quietly away from the monster expecting at every moment to be seized by its claws when it discov ered that more appetizing fare was available however it took not the slightest notice of him when he had in creased their mutual separation to ten metres he cauti ously propped himself up in a sitting position from this greater distance the thing did not appear quite so formidable it had a low flat body about two metres long and one wide supported on six triplejointed legs jimmy saw that he was mistaken in assuming that it had been eating dragonfly in fact he could not see any sign of a mouth the creature was actually doing a neat job of demolition using scissorlike claws to chop the sky bike into small pieces a whole row of manipulators which looked uncannily like tiny human hands then transferred the fragments to a steadily growing pile on the animals back but was it an animal though that had been jimmys first reaction now he had second thoughts there was a purposefulness about its behaviour which suggested fairly high intelligence he could see no reason why any crea ture of pure instincts should carefully collect the scat tered pieces of his skybike unless perhaps it was gath ering material for a nest keeping a wary eye on the crab which still ignored him completely jimmy struggled to his feet a few wav ering steps demonstrated that he could still walk though he was not sure if he could outdistance those six legs then he switched on his radio never doubting that it would be operating a crash that he could survive would not even have been noticed by its solidstate electronics hub control he said softly can you receive me thank god are you ok just a bit shaken take a look at this he turned his camera towards the crab just in time to record the final demolition of dragonflys wing what the devil is it and why is it chewing up your bike wish i knew its finished with dragonfly im going to back away in case it wants to start on me jimmy slowly retreated never taking his eyes off the crab it was now moving roundand round in a steadily widening spiral apparently searching for fragments it might have overlooked and so jimmy was able to get an overall view of it for the first time now that the initial shock had worn off he could appreciate that it was quite a handsome beast the name crab which he had automatically given it was perhaps a little misleading if it had not been so impossibly large he might have called it a beetle its carapace had a beaut iful metallic sheen in fact he would almost have been prepared to swear that it was metal that was an interesting idea could it be a robot and not an animal he stared at the crab intently with this thought in mind analysing all the details of its anatomy where it should have had a mouth was a collection of manipulators that reminded jimmy strongly of the multi purpose knives that are the delight of all redblooded boys there were pinchers probes rasps and even some thing that looked like a drill but none of this was de cisive on earth the insect world had matched all these tools and many more the animalorrobot question re mained in perfect balance in his mind the eyes which might have settled the matter left it even more ambiguous they were so deeply recessed in protective hoods that it was impossible to tell whether their lenses were made of crystal or jelly they were quite expressionless and of a startlingly vivid blue though they had been directed towards jimmy several times they had never shown the slightest flicker of interest in his perhaps biased opinion that decided the level of the creatures intelligence an entity robot or animal which could ignore a human being could not be very bright it had now stopped its circling and stood still for a few seconds as if listening to some inaudible message then it set off with a curious rolling gait in the general direc tion of the sea it moved in a perfectly straight line at a steady four or five kilometres an hour and had already travelled a couple of hundred metres before jimmys still slightlyshocked mind registered the fact that the last sad relics of his beloved dragonfly were being carried away from him he set off in a hot and indignant pursuit his action was not wholly illogical the crab was head ing towards the sea and if any rescue was possible it could only be from this direction moreover he wanted to discover what the creature would do with its trophy that should reveal something about its motivation and intelligence because he was still bruised and stiff it took jimmy several minutes to catch up with the purposefullymoving crab when he had done so he followed it at a respectful distance until he felt sure that it did not resent his pres ence it was then that he noticed his waterflask and emergency ration pack among the debris of dragonfly and instantly felt both hungry and thirsty there scuttling away from him at a remorseless five kilometres an hour was the only food and drink in all this half of the world whatever the risk he had to get hold of it he cautiously closed in on the crab approaching from right rear while he kept station with it he studied the complicated rhythm of its legs until he could anticipate where they would be at any moment when he was ready he muttered a quick excuse me and shot swiftly in to grab his property jimmy had never dreamed that he would one day have to exercise the skills of a pickpocket and was delighted with his success he was out again in less than a second and the crab never slackened its steady pace he dropped back a dozen metres moistened his lips from the flask and started to chew a bar of meat concen trate the little victory made him feel much happier now he could even risk thinking about his sombre future while there was life there was hope yet he could im agine no way in which he could possibly be rescued even if his colleagues crossed the sea how could he reach them half a kilometre below well find a way down somehow hub control had promised that cliff cant go right round the world without a break anywhere he had been tempted to answer why not but had thought better of it one of the strangest things about walking inside rama was that you could always see your destination here the curve of the world did not hide it revealed for some time jimmy had been aware of the crabs objective up there in the land which seemed to rise before him was a halfkilometrewide pit it was one of three in the south ern continent from the hub it had been impossible to see how deep they were all had been named after promi nent lunar craters and he was approaching copernicus the name was hardly appropriate for there were no sur rounding hills and no central peaks this copernicus was merely a deep shaft or well with perfectly vertical sides when he came close enough to look into it jimmy was able to see a pool of ominous leadengreen water at least half a kilometre below this would put it just about level with the sea and he wondered if they were connected winding down the interior of the well was a spiral ramp completely recessed into the sheer wall so that the effect was rather like that of rifling in an immense gun barrel there seemed to be a remarkable number of turns not until jimmy had traced them for several revo lutions getting more and more confused in the process did he realize that there was not one ramp but three totally independent and degrees apart in any other background than rama the whole concept would have been an impressive architectural tour de force the three ramps led straight down into the pool and disappeared beneath its opaque surface near the water line jimmy could see a group of black tunnels or caves they looked rather sinister and he wondered if they were inhabited perhaps the ramans were amphibious as the crab approached the edge of the well jimmy assumed that it was going to descend one of the ramps perhaps taking the wreckage of dragonfly to some entity who would be able to evaluate it instead the creature walked straight to the brink extended almost half its body over the gulf without any sign of hesitation though an error of a few centimetres would have been disastrous and gave a brisk shrug the fragments of dragonfly went fluttering down into the depths there were tears in jimmys eyes as he watched them go so much he thought bitterly for this creatures intelligence having disposed of the garbage the crab swung around and started to walk towards jimmy standing only about ten metres away am i going to get the same treatment he wondered he hoped the camera was not too unsteady as he showed hub control the rapidly ap proaching monster what do you advise he whispered anxiously without much hope that he would get a useful answer it was some small consolation to realize that he was making history and his mind raced through the ap proved patterns for such a meeting until now all of these had been purely theoretical he would be the first man to check them in practice dont run until youre sure its hostile hub control whispered back at him run where jimmy asked him self he thought he could outdistance the thing in a hundred metre sprint but had a sick certainty that it could wear him down over the long haul slowly jimmy held up his outstretched hands men had been arguing for two hundred years about this ges ture would every creature everywhere in the universe interpret this as see no weapons but no one could think of anything better the crab showed no reaction whatsoever nor did it slacken its pace ignoring jimmy completely it walked straight past him and headed purposefully into the south feeling extremely foolish the acting representative of homo sapiens watched his first contact stride away across the raman plain totally indifferent to his pres ence he had seldom been so humiliated in his life then jimmys sense of humour came to his rescue after all it was no great matter to have been ignored by an animated garbage truck it would have been worse if it had greeted him as a longlost brother he walked back to the rim of copernicus and stared down into its opaque waters for the first time he noticed that vague shapes some of them quite large were mov ing slowly back and forth beneath the surface presently one of them headed towards the nearest spiral ramp and something that looked like a multilegged tank started on the long ascent at the rate it was going jimmy decided it would take almost an hour to get here if it was a threat it was a very slowmoving one then he noticed a flicker of much more rapid move ment near those cavelike openings down by the water line something was travelling very swiftly along the ramp but he could not focus clearly upon it or discern any definite shape it was as if he was looking at a small whirlwind or dustdevil about the size of a man he blinked and shook his head keeping his eyes closed for several seconds when he opened them again the apparition was gone perhaps the impact had shaken him up more than he had realized this was the first time he had ever suffered from visual hallucinations he would not mention it to hub control nor would he bother to explore those ramps as he had halfthought of doing it would obviously be a waste of energy the spinning phantom he had merely imagined seeing had nothing to do with his decision nothing at all for of course jimmy did not believe in ghosts chapter thirty the flower jimmys exertions had made him thirsty and he was acutely conscious of the fact that in all this land there was no water that a man could drink with the contents of his flask he could probably survive a week but for what purpose the best brains of earth would soon be focused on his problem doubtless commander norton would be bombarded with suggestions but he could imagine no way in which he could lower himself down the face of that halfkilometre cliff even it he had a long enough rope there was nothing to which he could attach it nevertheless it was foolish and unmanly to give up without a struggle any help would have to come from the sea and while he was marching towards it he could carry on with his job as if nothing had happened no one else would ever observe and photograph the varied ter rain through which he must pass and that would guaran tee a posthumous immortality though he would have preferred many other honours that was better than noth ing he was only three kilometres from the sea as poor dragonfly could have flown but it seemed unlikely that he could reach it in a straight line some of the terrain ahead of him might prove too great an obstacle that was no problem however as there were plenty of alternative routes jimmy could see them all spread out on the great curving map that swept up and away from him on either side he had plenty of time he would start with the most interesting scenery even if it took him off his direct route about a kilometre away towards the right was a square that glittered like cut glass or a gigantic display of jewellery it was probably this thought that triggered jimmys footsteps even a doomed man might reasonably be expected to take some slight interest in a few thousand square metres of gems he was not particularly disappointed when they turned out to be quartz crystals millions of them set in a bed of sand the adjacent square of the checkerboard was rather more interesting being covered with an ap parently random pattern of hollow metal columns set very close together and ranging in height from less than one to more than five metres it was completely impass able only a tank could have crashed through that forest of tubes jimmy walked between the crystals and the columns until he came to the first crossroads the square on the right was a huge rug or tapestry made of woven wire he tried to prise a strand loose but was unable to break it on the left was a tessellation of hexagonal tiles so smoothly inlaid that there were no visible joints between them it would have appeared a continuous surface had the tiles not been coloured all the hues of the rainbow jimmy spent many minutes trying to find two adjacent tiles of the same colour to see if he could then distin guish their boundaries but he could not find a single example of such coincidence as he did a slow pan right around the crossroads he said plaintively to hub control what do you think this is i feel im trapped in a giant jigsaw puzzle or is this the raman art gallery were as baffled as you jimmy but theres never been any sign that the ramans go in for art lets wait until we have some more examples before we jump to any con clusions the two examples he found at the next crossroads were not much help one was completely blank a smooth neutral grey hard but slippery to the touch the other was a soft sponge perforated with billions upon billions of tiny holes he tested it with his foot and the whole sur face undulated sickeningly beneath him like a barely stabilized quicksand at the next crossroads he encountered something strik ingly like a ploughed field except that the furrows were a uniform metre in depth and the material of which they were made had the texture of a file or rasp but he paid little attention to this because the square adjacent to it was the most thoughtprovoking of all that he had so far met at last there was something that he could under stand and it was more than a little disturbing the entire square was surrounded by a fence so con ventional that he would not have looked at it twice had he seen it on earth there were posts apparently of metal five metres apart with six strands of wire strung taut between them beyond this fence was a second identical one and beyond that a third it was another typical example of raman redundancy whatever was penned inside this en closure would have no chance of breaking out there was no entrance no gates that could be swung open to drive in the beast or beasts that were presumably kept here instead there was a single hole like a smaller version of copernicus in the centre of the square even in different circumstances jimmy would prob ably not have hesitated but now he had nothing to lose he quickly scaled all three fences walked over to the hole and peered into it unlike copernicus this well was only fifty metres deep there were three tunnel exits at the bottom each of which looked large enough to accommodate an elephant and that was all after staring for some time jimmy decided that the only thing that made sense about the arrangement was for the floor down there to be an elevator but what it elevated he was never likely to know he could only guess that it was quite large and possibly quite dangerous during the next few hours he walked more than ten kilometres along the edge of the sea and the checker board squares had begun to blur together in his memory he had seen some that were totally enclosed in tentlike structures of wire mesh as if they were giant birdcages there were others which seemed to be pools of congealed liquid full of swirlpatterns however when he tested them gingerly they were quite solid and there was one so utterly black that he could not even see it clearly only the sense of touch told him that anything was there yet now there was a subtle modulation into something he could understand ranging one after the other to wards the south was a series of no other word would do fields he might have been walking past an experi mental farm on earth each square was a smooth expanse of carefully levelled earth the first he had ever seen in the metallic landscapes of rama the great fields were virgin lifeless waiting for crops that had never been planted jimmy wondered what their purpose could be since it was incredible that crea tures as advanced as the ramans would engage in any form of agriculture even on earth farming was no more than a popular hobby and a source of exotic luxury foods but he could swear that these were potential farms immaculately prepared he had never seen earth that looked so clean each square was covered with a great sheet of tough transparent plastic he tried to cut through it to obtain a sample but his knife would barely scratch the surface further inland were other fields and on many of them were complicated constructions of rods and wires pre sumably intended for the support of climbing plants they looked very bleak and desolate like leafless trees in the depths of winter the winter they had known must have been long and terrible indeed and these few weeks of light and warmth might be only a brief interlude be fore it came again jimmy never knew what made him stop and look more closely into the metal maze to the south unconsciously his mind must have been checking every detail around him it had noticed in this fantastically alien landscape something even more anomalous about a quarter of a kilometre away in the middle of a trellis of wires and rods glowed a single speck of colour it was so small and inconspicuous that it was almost at the limit of visibility on earth no one would have looked at it twice yet undoubtedly one of the reasons he had noticed it now was because it reminded him of earth he did not report to hub control until he was sure that there was no mistake and that wishful thinking had not deluded him not until he was only a few metres away could he be completely sure that life as he knew it had intruded into the sterile aseptic world of rama for blooming here in lonely splendour at the edge of the southern continent was a flower as he came closer it was obvious to jimmy that some thing had gone wrong there was a hole in the sheathing that presumably protected this layer of earth from con tamination by unwanted lifeforms through this break extended a green stem about as thick as a mans little finger which twined its way up through the trelliswork a metre from the ground it burst into an efflorescence of bluish leaves shaped more like feathers than the foliage of any plant known to jimmy the stem ended at eye level in what he had first taken to be a single flower now he saw with no surprise at all that it was actually three flowers tightly packed together the petals were brightly coloured tubes about five centimetres long there were at least fifty in each bloom and they glittered with such metallic blues violets and greens that they seemed more like the wings of a butter fly than anything in the vegetable kingdom jimmy knew practically nothing about botany but he was puzzled to see no trace of any structures resembling petals or sta mens he wondered if the likeness to terrestrial flowers might be a pure coincidence perhaps this was something more akin to a coral polyp in either case it would seem to imply the existence of small airborne creatures to serve either as fertilizing agents or as food it did not really matter whatever the scientific defini tion to jimmy this was a flower the strange miracle the unramanlike accident of its existence here reminded him of all that he would never see again and he was determined to possess it that would not be easy it was more than ten metres away separated from him by a latticework made of thin rods they formed a cubic pattern repeated over and over again less than forty centimetres on either side jimmy would not have been flying skybikes unless he had been slim and wiry so he knew he could crawl through the interstices of the grid but getting out again might be quite a different matter it would certainly be impossible for him to turn around so he would have to retreat backwards hub control was delighted with his discovery when he had described the flower and scanned it from every avail able angle there was no objection when he said im going after it nor did he expect there to be his life was now his own to do with as he pleased he stripped off all his clothes grasped the smooth metal rods and started to wriggle into the framework it was a tight fit he felt like a prisoner escaping through the bars of his cell when he had inserted himself com pletely into the lattice he tried backing out again just to see if there were any problems it was considerably more difficult since he now had to use his outstretched arms for pushing instead of pulling but he saw no reason why he should get helplessly trapped jimmy was a man of action and impulse not of intro spection as he squirmed uncomfortably along the nar row corridor of rods he wasted no time asking himself just why he was performing so quixotic a feat he had never been interested in flowers in his whole life yet now he was gambling his last energies to collect one it was true that this specimen was unique and of enormous scientific value but he really wanted it be cause it was his last link with the world of life and the planet of his birth yet when the flower was in his grasp he had sudden qualms perhaps it was the only flower that grew in the whole of rama was he justified in picking it if he needed any excuse he could console himself with the thought that the ramans themselves had not in cluded it in their plans it was obviously a freak growing ages too late or too soon but lie did not really require an excuse and his hesitation was only momentary he reached out grasped the stem and gave a sharp jerk the flower came away easily enough he also collected two of the leaves then started to back slowly through the lattice now that he had only one free hand progress was extremely difficult even painful and he soon had to pause to regain his breath it was then that he noticed that the feathery leaves were closing and the headless stem was slowly unwinding itself from its supports as he watched with a mixture of fascination and dismay he saw that the whole plant was steadily retreating into the ground like a mortally injured snake crawling back into its hole ive murdered something beautiful jimmy told him self but then rama had killed him he was only collect ing what was his rightful due chapter thirtyone terminal velocity commander norton had never yet lost a man and he had no intention of starting now even before jimmy had set off for the south pole he had been considering ways of rescuing him in the event of accident the problem however had turned out to be so difficult that he had found no answer all that he had managed to do was to eliminate every obvious solution how does one climb a halfkilometre vertical cliff even in reduced gravity with the right equipment and training it would be easy enough but there were no pitonguns aboard endeavour and no one could think of any other practical way of driving the necessary hundreds of spikes into that hard mirror surface he had glanced briefly at more exotic solutions some frankly crazy perhaps a simp fitted with suction pads could make the ascent but even if this scheme was practical how long would it take to manufacture and test such equipment and to train a simp to use it he doubted if a man would have the necessary strength to perform the feat then there was more advanced technology the eva propulsion units were tempting but their thrust was too small since they were designed for zerogee operation they could not possibly lift the weight of a man even against ramas modest gravity could an eva thrust be sent up on automatic control carrying only a rescue line he had tried out this idea on sergeant myron who had promptly shot it down in flames there were the engineer pointed out severe stab ility problems they might be solved but it would take a long time much longer than they could afford what about balloons there seemed a faint possibility here if they could devise an envelope and a sufficiently compact source of heat this was the only approach that norton had not dismissed when the problem suddenly ceased to be one of theory and became a matter of life and death dominating the news in all the inhabited worlds while jimmy was making his trek along the edge of the sea half the crackpots in the solar system were trying to save him at fleet headquarters all the suggestions were considered and about one in a thousand was for warded to endeavour dr carlisle perera arrived twice once via the surveys own network and once by planet com rama priority it had taken the scientist approxi mately five minutes of thought and one millisecond of computer time at first commander norton thought it was a joke in very poor taste then he saw the senders name and the attached calculations and did a quick doubletake he handed the message to karl mercer what do you think of this he asked in as noncom mittal a tone of voice as he could manage karl read it swiftly then said well im damned hes right of course are you sure he was right about the storm wasnt he we should have thought of this it makes me feel a fool you have company the next problem is how do we break it to jimmy i dont think we should until the last possible min ute thats how id prefer it if i was in his place just tell him were on the way though he could look across the full width of the cylin drical sea and knew the general direction from which resolution was coming jimmy did not spot the tiny craft until it had already passed new york it seemed incred ible that it could carry six men and whatever equip ment they had brought to rescue him when it was only a kilometre away he recognized commander norton and started waving a little later the skipper spotted him and waved back glad to see youre in good shape jimmy he radioed i promised we wouldnt leave you behind now do you believe me not quite jimmy thought until this moment he had still wondered if this was all a kindly plot to keep up his morale but the commander would not have crossed the sea just to say goodbye he must have worked out some thing ill believe you skipper he said when im down there on the deck now will you tell me how im going to make it resolution was now slowing down a hundred metres from the base of the cliff as far as jimmy could tell she carried no unusual equipment though he was not sure what he had expected to see sorry about that jimmy but we didnt want you to have too many things to worry about now that sounded ominous what the devil did he mean resolution came to a halt fifty metres out and five hundred below jimmy had almost a birdseye view of the commander as he spoke into his microphone this is it jimmy youll be perfectly safe but it will require nerve we know youve got plenty of that youre going to jump five hundred metres yes but at only half a gee so have you ever fallen two hundred and fifty on earth shut up or ill cancel your next leave you should have worked this out for yourself its just a question of terminal velocity in this atmosphere you cant reach more than ninety kilometres an hour whether you fall two hundred or two thousand metres ninetys a little high for comfort but we can trim it some more this is what youll have to do so listen carefully i will said jimmy it had better be good he did not interrupt the commander again and made no comment when norton had finished yes it made sense and was so absurdly simple that it would take a genius to think of it and perhaps someone who did not expect to do it himself jimmy had never tried highdiving or made a delayed parachute drop which would have given him some psy chological preparation for this feat one could tell a man that it was perfectly safe to walk a plank across an abyss yet even if the structural calculations were impeccable he might still be unable to do it now jimmy understood why the commander had been so evasive about the de tails of the rescue he had been given no time to brood or to think of objections i dont want to hurry you said nortons persuasive voice from half a kilometre below but the sooner the better jimmy looked at his precious souvenir the only flower in rama he wrapped it very carefully in his grimy handkerchief knotted the fabric and tossed it over the edge of the cliff it fluttered down with reassuring slowness but it also took a very long time getting smaller and smaller and smaller until he could no longer see it but then resolu tion surged forward and he knew that it had been spot ted beautiful exclaimed the commander enthusiastic ally im sure theyll name it after you ok were wait ing jimmy stripped off his shirt the only upper garment anyone ever wore in this now tropical climate and stretched it thoughtfully several times on his trek he life for the last time he looked back at the hollow world he alone had explored and the distant ominous pin nacles of the big and little horns then grasping the shirt firmly with his right hand he took a running jump as far out over the cliff as he could now there was no particular hurry he had a full twenty seconds in which to enjoy the experience but he did not waste any time as the wind strengthened around him and resolution slowly expanded in his field of view holding his shirt with both hands he stretched his arms above his head so that the rushing air filled the garment and blew it into a hollow tube as a parachute it was hardly a success the few kilo metres an hour it subtracted from his speed was useful but not vital it was doing a much more important job keeping his body vertical so that he would arrow straight into the sea he still had the impression that he was not moving at all but that the water below was rushing up towards him once he had committed himself he had no sense of fear indeed he felt a certain indignation against the skipper for keeping him in the dark did he really think that he would be scared to jump if he had to brood over it too long at the very last moment he let go of his shirt took a deep breath and grabbed his mouth and nose with his hands as he had been instructed he stiffened his body into a rigid bar and locked his feet together he would enter the water as cleanly as a falling spear it will be just the same the commander had prom ised as stepping off a diving board on earth nothing to it if you make a good entry and if i dont he had asked then youll have to go back and try again something slapped him across the feet hard but not viciously a million slimy hands were tearing at his body even though his eyes were tightly closed he could tell that darkness was falling as he arrowed down into the depths of the cylindrical sea with all his strength he started to swim upwards to wards the fading light he could not open his eyes for more than a single blink the poisonous water felt like acid when he did so he seemed to have been struggling for ages and more than once he had a nightmare fear that he had lost his orientation and was really swimming downwards then he would risk another quick glimpse and every time the light was stronger his eyes were still clenched tightly shut when he broke water he gulped a precious mouthful of air rolled over on his back and looked around resolution was heading towards him at top speed within seconds eager hands had grabbed him and drag ged him aboard did you swallow any water was the commanders anxious question i dont think so rinse out with this anyway thats fine how do you feel im not really sure ill let you know in a minute oh thanks everybody the minute was barely up when jimmy was only too sure how lie felt im going to be sick he confessed miserably his res cuers were incredulous in a dead calm on a flat sea protested sergeant barnes who seemed to regard jimmys plight as a direct reflection on her skill id hardly call it flat said the commander waving his arm around the band of water that circled the sky but dont be ashamed you may have swallowed some of that stuff get rid of it as quickly as you can jimmy was still straining unheroically and unsuccess fully when there was a sudden flicker of light in the sky behind them all eyes turned towards the south pole and jimmy instantly forgot his sickness the horns had started their firework display again there were the kilometrelong streamers of fire danc ing from the central spike to its smaller companions once again they began their stately rotation as if invis ible dancers were winding their ribbons around an elec tric maypole but now they began to accelerate moving faster and faster until they blurred into a flickering cone of light it was a spectacle more aweinspiring than any they had yet seen here and it brought with it a distant crack ling roar which added to the impression of overwhelm ing power the display lasted for about five minutes then it stopped as abruptly as if someone had turned a switch id like to know what the rama committee make of that norton muttered to no one in particular has any one here got any theories there was no time for an answer because at that mo ment hub control called in great excitement resolution are you ok did you feel that feel what we think it was an earthquake it must have hap pened the minute those fireworks stopped any damage i dont think so it wasnt really violent but it shook us up a bit we felt nothing at all but we wouldnt out here in the sea of course silly of me anyway everything seems quiet now until next time yes until the next time norton echoed the mystery of rama was steadily growing the more they discovered about it the less they understood there was a sudden shout from the helm skipper look up there in the sky norton lifted his eyes swiftly scanning the circuit of the sea he saw nothing until his gaze had almost reached the zenith and he was staring at the other side of the world my god he whispered slowly as he realized that the next time was already almost here a tidal wave was racing towards them down the eter nal curve of the cylindrical sea chapter thirtytwo the wave yet even in that moment of shock nortons first concern was for his ship endeavour he called situation report all ok skipper was the reassuring answer from the exec we felt a slight tremor but nothing that could cause any damage theres been a small change of atti tude the bridge says about point two degrees they also think the spin rate has altered slightly well have an accurate reading on that in a couple of minutes so its beginning to happen norton told himself and a lot earlier than we expected were still a long way from perihelion and the logical time for an orbit change but some kind of trim was undoubtedly taking place and there might be more shocks to come meanwhile the effects of this first one were all too ob vious up there on the curving sheet of water which seemed perpetually falling from the sky the wave was still about ten kilometres away and stretched the full width of the sea from northern to southern shore near the land it was a foaming wall of white but in deeper water it was a barely visible blue line moving much faster than the breakers on either flank the drag of the shoreward shallows was already bending it into a bow with the central portion getting further and further ahead sergeant said norton urgently this is your job what can we do sergeant barnes had brought the raft completely to rest and was studying the situation intently her expres sion norton was relieved to see showed no trace of alarm rather a certain zestful excitement like a skilled athlete about to accept a challenge i wish we had some soundings she said if were in deep water theres nothing to worry about then were all right were still four kilometres from shore i hope so but i want to study the situation she applied power again and swung resolution around until it was just under way heading directly to wards the approaching wave norton judged that the swiftly moving central portion would reach them in less than five minutes but he could also see that it presented no serious danger it was only a racing ripple a fraction of a metre high and would scarcely rock the boat the walls of foam lagging far behind it were the real menace suddenly in the very centre of the sea a line of breakers appeared the wave had clearly hit a submerged wall several kilometres in length not far below the sur face at the same time the breakers on the two flanks collapsed as they ran into deeper water antislosh plates norton told himself exactly the same as in endeavours own propellant tanks but on a thousandfold greater scale there must be a complex pattern of them all around the sea to damp out any waves as quickly as possible the only thing that matters now is are we right on top of one sergeant barnes was one jump ahead of him she brought resolution to a full stop and threw out the an chor it hit bottom at only five metres haul it up she called to her crewmates weve got to get away from here norton agreed heartily but in which direction the sergeant was headed full speed towards the wave which was now only five kilometres away for the first time he could hear the sound of its approach a distant unmistak able roar which he had never expected to hear inside rama then it changed in intensity the central portion was collapsing once more and the flanks were building up again he tried to estimate the distance between the sub merged baffles assuming that they were spaced at equal intervals if he was right there should be one more to come if they could station the raft in the deep water between them they would be perfectly safe sergeant barnes cut the motor and threw out the an chor again it went down thirty metres without hitting bottom were ok she said with a sigh of relief but ill keep the motor running now there were only the lagging walls of foam along the coast out here in the central sea it was calm again apart from the inconspicuous blue ripple still speeding towards them the sergeant was just holding resolution on course towards the disturbance ready to pour on full power at a moments notice then only two kilometres ahead of them the sea started to foam once more it humped up in whitemaned fury and now its roaring seemed to fill the world upon the sixteenkilometrehigh wave of the cylindrical sea a smaller ripple was superimposed like an avalanche thun dering down a mountain slope and that ripple was quite large enough to kill them sergeant barnes must have seen the expressions on the faces of her crewmates she shouted above the roar what are you scared about ive ridden bigger ones than this that was not quite true nor did she add that her earlier experience had been in a wellbuilt surfboat not an improvised raft but if we have to jump wait until i tell you check your lifejackets shes magnificent thought the commander obviously enjoying every minute like a viking warrior going into battle and shes probably right unless weve miscalcu lated badly the wave continued to rise curving upwards and over the slope above them probably exaggerated its height but it looked enormous an irresistible force of nature that would overwhelm everything in its path then within seconds it collapsed as if its foundations had been pulled out from underneath it it was over the submerged barrier in deep water again when it reached them a minute later resolution merely bounced up and down a few times before sergeant barnes swung the raft around and set off at top speed towards the north thanks ruby that was splendid but will we get home before it comes round for the second time probably not it will be back in about twenty minutes but it will have lost all its strength then well scarcely notice it now that the wave had passed they could relax and enjoy the voyage though no one would be completely at ease until they were back on land the disturbance had left the water swirling round in random eddies and had also stirred up a most peculiar acidic smell like crushed ants as jimmy aptly put it though unpleasant the odour caused none of the attacks of seasickness that might have been expected it was something so alien that human physiology could not respond to it a minute later the wave front hit the next underwater barrier as it climbed away from them and up the sky this time seen from the rear the spectacle was unim pressive and the voyagers felt ashamed of their previous fears they began to feel themselves masters of the cylin drical sea the shock was therefore all the greater when not more than a hundred metres away something like a slowly ro tating wheel began to rear up out of the water glittering metallic spokes five metres long emerged dripping from the sea spun for a moment in the fierce raman glare and splashed back into the water it was as if a giant starfish with tubular arms had broken the surface at first sight it was impossible to tell whether it was an animal or a machine then it flopped over and lay half awash bobbing up and down in the gentle aftermath of the wave now they could see that there were nine arms appar ently jointed radiating from a central disc two of the arms were broken snapped off at the outer joint the others ended at a complicated collection of manipula tors that reminded jimmy very strongly of the crab he had encountered the two creatures came from the same line of evolution or the same drawingboard at the middle of the disc was a small turret bearing three large eyes two were closed one open and even that appeared to be blank and unseeing no one doubted that they were watching the deaththroes of some strange monster tossed up to the surface by the submarine dis turbance that had just passed then they saw that it was not alone swimming round it and snapping at its feebly moving limbs were two small beasts like overgrown lobsters they were efficiently chopping up the monster and it did nothing to resist though its own claws seemed quite capable of dealing with the attackers once again jimmy was reminded of the crab that had demolished dragonfly he watched intently as the one sided conflict continued and quickly confirmed his im pression look skipper he whispered do you see theyre not eating it they dont even have any mouths theyre simply chopping it to pieces thats exactly what hap pened to dragonfly youre right theyre dismantling it like like a broken machine norton wrinkled his nose but no dead machine ever smelled like that then another thought struck him my god suppose they start on us ruby get us back to shore as quickly as you can resolution surged forward with reckless disregard for the life of her power cells behind them the nine spokes of the great starfish they could think of no better name for it were clipped steadily shorter and presently the weird tableau sank back into the depths of the sea there was no pursuit but they did not breathe com fortably again until resolution had drawn up to the landing stage and they had stepped thankfully ashore as he looked back across that mysterious and now suddenly sinister band of water commander norton grimly de termined that no one would ever sail it again there were too many unknowns too many dangers he looked back upon the towers and ramparts of new york and the dark cliff of the continent beyond they were safe now from inquisitive man he would not tempt the gods of rama again chapter thirtythree spider from now on norton had decreed there would always be at least three people at camp alpha and one of them would always be awake in addition all exploring parties would follow the same routine potentially dangerous creatures were on the move inside rama and though none had shown active hostility a prudent commander would take no chances as an extra safeguard there was always an observer up on the hub keeping watch through a powerful telescope from this vantage point the whole interior of rama could be surveyed and even the south pole appeared only a few hundred metres away the territory round any group of explorers was to be kept under regular ob servation in this way it was hoped to eliminate any pos sibility of surprise it was a good plan and it failed completely after the last meal of the day and just before the hour sleep period norton rodrigo calvert and laura ernst were watching the regular evening news telecast specially beamed to them from the transmitter at in ferno mercury they had been particularly interested in seeing jimmys film of the southern continent and the return across the cylindrical sea an episode which had excited all viewers scientists news commentators and members of the rama committee had given their opin ions most of them contradictory no one could agree whether the crablike creature jimmy had encountered was an animal a machine a genuine raman or some thing that fitted none of these categories they had just watched with a distinctly queasy feel ing the giant starfish being demolished by its predators when they discovered that they were no longer alone there was an intruder in the camp laura ernst noticed it first she froze in sudden shock then said dont move bill now look slowly to the right norton turned his head ten metres away was a slenderlegged tripod surmounted by a spherical body no larger than a football set around the body were three large expressionless eyes apparently giving go degrees of vision and trailing beneath it were three whiplike tendrils the creature was not quite as tall as a man and looked far too fragile to be dangerous but that did not excuse their carelessness in letting it sneak up on them unawares it reminded norton of nothing so much as a threelegged spider or daddylonglegs and he wondered how it had solved the problem never challenged by any creature on earth of tripedal locomotion what do you make of it doc he whispered turning off the voice of the tv newscaster usual raman threefold symmetry i dont see how it could hurt us though those whips might be unpleasant and they could be poisonous like a coelenterates sit tight and see what it does after regarding them impassively for several minutes the creature suddenly moved and now they could under stand why they had failed to observe its arrival it was fast and it covered the ground with such an extraordin ary spinning motion that the human eye and mind had real difficulty in following it as far as norton could judge and only a highspeed camera could settle the matter each leg in turn acted as a pivot around which the creature whirled its body and he was not sure but it also seemed to him that every few steps it reversed its direction of spin while the three whips flickered over the ground like lightning as it moved its top speed though this also was very hard to estimate was at least thirty kilometres an hour it swept swiftly round the camp examining every item of equipment delicately touching the improvised beds and chairs and tables communication gear food con tainers electrosans cameras water tanks tools there seemed to be nothing that it ignored except the four watchers clearly it was intelligent enough to draw a dis tinction between humans and their inanimate property its actions gave the unmistakable impression of an ex tremely methodical curiosity or inquisitiveness i wish i could examine it laura exclaimed in frus tration as the creature continued its swift pirouette shall we try to catch it how calvert asked reasonably enough you know the way primitive hunters bring down fast moving animals with a couple of weights whirling around at the end of a rope it doesnt even hurt them that i doubt said norton but even if it worked we cant risk it we dont know how intelligent this creature is and a trick like that could easily break its legs then we would be in real trouble from rama earth and everyone else but ive got to have a specimen you may have to be content with jimmys flower unless one of these creatures cooperates with you force is out how would you like it if something landed on earth and decided that you would make a nice specimen for dissection i dont want to dissect it said laura not at all con vincingly i only want to examine it well alien visitors might have the same attitude to wards you but you could have a very uncomfortable time before you believed them we must make no move that could possibly he regarded as threatening he was quoting from ships orders of course and laura knew it the claims of science had a lower priority than those of spacediplomacy in fact there was no need to bring in such elevated considerations it was merely a matter of good manners they were all visitors here and had never even asked permission to come inside the creature seemed to have finished its inspection it made one more highspeed circuit of the camp then shot off at a tangent towards the stairway i wonder how its going to manage the steps laura mused her question was quickly answered the spider ignored them completely and headed up the gently slop ing curve of the ramp without slackening its speed hub control said norton you may have a visitor shortly take a look at the alpha stairway section six and incidentally thanks a lot for keeping such a good watch on us it took a minute for the sarcasm to sink in then the hub observer started to make apologetic noises er i can just see something skipper now you tell me its there but what is it your guess is as good as mine norton answered as he pressed the general alert button camp alpha calling all stations weve just been visited by a creature like a threelegged spider with very thin legs about two metres high small spherical body travels very fast with a spin ning motion appears harmless but inquisitive it may sneak up on you before you notice it please acknow ledge the first reply came from london fifteen kilometres to the east nothing unusual here skipper the same distance to the west rome answered sound ing suspiciously sleepy same here skipper uh just a moment what is it i put my pen down a minute ago its gone what oh talk sense you wont believe this skipper i was making some notes you know i like writing and it doesnt disturb anybody i was using my favourite ballpoint its nearly two hundred years old well now its lying on the ground about five metres away ive got it thank good ness it isnt damaged and how do you suppose it got there er i may have dozed off for a minute its been a hard day norton sighed but refrained from comment there were so few of them and they had so little time in which to explore a world enthusiasm could not always over come exhaustion and he wondered if they were taking unnecessary risks perhaps he should not split his men up into such small groups and try to cover so much territory but he was always conscious of the swiftly passing days and the unsolved mysteries around them he was becom ing more and more certain that something was about to happen and that they would have to abandon rama even before it reached perihelion the moment of truth when any orbit change must surely take place now listen hub rome london everyone he said i want a report at every halfhour through the night we must assume that from now on we may expect visitors at any time some of them may be dangerous but at all costs we have to avoid incidents you all know the directives on this subject that was true enough it was part of their training yet perhaps none of them had ever really believed that the longtheorized physical contact with intelligent aliens would occur in their lifetimes still less that they would experience it themselves training was one thing reality another and no one could be sure that the ancient human instincts of self preservation would not take over in an emergency yet it was essential to give every entity they encountered in rama the benefit of the doubt up to the last possible minuteand even beyond commander norton did not want to be remembered by history as the man who started the first interplanetary war within a few hours there were hundreds of the spiders and they were all over the plain through the telescope it could be seen that the southern continent was also in fested with them but not it seemed the island of new york they took no further notice of the explorers and after a while the explorers took little notice of them though from time to time norton still detected a predatory gleam in his surgeoncommanders eye nothing would please her better he was sure than for one of the spiders to have an unfortunate accident and he would not put it past her to arrange such a thing in the interests of science it seemed virtually certain that the spiders could not be intelligent their bodies were far too small to contain much in the way of brains and indeed it was hard to see where they stored all the energy to move yet their be haviour was curiously purposeful and coordinated they seemed to be everywhere but they never visited the same place twice norton frequently had the impression that they were searching for something whatever it was they did not seem to have discovered it they went all the way up to the central hub still scorning the three great stairways how they managed to ascend the vertical sections even under almost zero grav ity was not clear laura theorized that they were equip ped with suction pads and then to her obvious delight she got her eagerly desired specimen hub control reported that a spider had fallen down the vertical face and was lying dead or incapacitated on the first platform lauras time up from the plain was a record that would never be beaten when she arrived at the platform she found that des pite the low velocity of impact the creature had broken all its legs its eyes were still open but it showed no reac tions to any external tests even a fresh human corpse would have been livelier laura decided as soon as she got her prize back to endeavour she started to work with her dissecting kit the spider was so fragile that it almost came to pieces without her assistance she disarticulated the legs then started on the delicate carapace which split along three great circles and opened up like a peeled orange after some moments of blank incredulity for there was nothing that she could recognize or identify she took a series of careful photographs then she picked up her scalpel where to start cutting she felt like closing her eyes and stabbing at random but that would not have been very scientific the blade went in with practically no resistance a second later surgeoncommander ernsts most unlady like yell echoed the length and breadth of endeavour it took an annoyed sergeant mcandrews a good twenty minqtes to calm down the startled simps chapter thirtyfour his excellency regrets as you are all aware gentlemen said the martian am bassador a great deal has happened since our last meet ing we have much to discuss and to decide im there fore particularly sorry that our distinguished colleague from mercury is not here that last statement was not altogether accurate dr bose was not particularly sorry that he the hermian ambassador was absent it would have been much more truthful to say that he was worried all his diplomatic instincts told him that something was happening and though his sources of information were excellent he could gather no hints as to what it might be the ambassadors letter of apology had been cour teous and entirely uncommunicative his excellency had regretted that urgent and unavoidable business had kept him from attending the meeting either in per son or by video dr bose found it very hard to think of anything more urgent or more important than ram a two of our members have statements to make would first like to call on professor davidson there was a rustle of excitement among the other scien tists on the committee most of them had felt that the astronomer with his wellknown cosmic viewpoint was not the right man to be chairman of the space advisory council he sometimes gave the impression that the activi ties of intelligent life were an unfortunate irrelevance in the majestic universe of stars and galaxies and that it was bad manners to pay too much attention to it this had not endeared him to exobiologists such as dr perera who took exactly the opposite view to them the only pur pose of the universe was the production of intelligence and they were apt to talk sneeringly about purely astro rjomical phenomena mere dead matter was one of their favourite phrases mr ambassador the scientist began i have been analysing the curious behaviour of rama during the last few days and would like to present my conclusions some of them are rather startling dr perera looked surprised then rather smug he strongly approved of anything that startled professor davidson first of all there was the remarkable series of events when that young lieutenant flew over to the southern hemisphere the electrical discharges themselves though spectacular are not important it is easy to show that they contained relatively little energy but they coin cided with a change in ramas rate of spin and its atti tude that is its orientation in space this must have involved an enormous amount of energy the discharges which nearly cost mr er pak his life were merely a minor byproduct perhaps a nuisance that had to be minimized by those giant lightning conductors at the south pole i draw two conclusions from this when a spacecraft and we must call rama a spacecraft despite its fantastic size makes a change of attitude that usually means it is about to make a change of orbit we must therefore take seriously the views of those who believe that rama may be preparing to become another planet of our sun in stead of going back to the strs if this is the case endeavour must obviously be pre pared to cast off is that what spaceships do at a mo ments notice she may be in very serious danger while she is still physically attached to rama i imagine that commander norton is already well aware of this possi bility but i think we should send him an additional warning thank you very much professor davidson yes dr solomons id like to comment on that said the science historian rama seems to have made a change of spin without us ing any jets or reaction devices this leaves only two possibilities it seems to me the first one is that it has internal gyroscopes or their equivalent they must be enormous where are they the second possibility which would turn all our physics upside down is that it has a reactionless propul sion system the socalled space drive which professor davidson doesnt believe in if this is the case rama may be able to do almost anything we will be quite unable to anticipate its behaviour even on the gross physical level the diplomats were obviously somewhat baffled by this exchange and the astronomer refused to be drawn he had gone out on enough limbs for one day ill stick to the laws of physics if you dont mind until im forced to give them up if weve not found any gyro scopes in rama we may not have looked hard enough or in the right place ambassador bose could see that dr perera was getting impatient normally the exobiologist was as happy as anyone else to engage in speculation but now for the first time he had some solid facts his longimpoverished science had become wealthy overnight very well if there are no other comments i know that dr perera has some important information thank you mr ambassador as youve all seen we have at last obtained a specimen of a raman lifeform and have observed several others at close quarters sur geoncommander ernst endeavours medical officer has sent a full report on the spiderlike creature she dis sected i must say at once that some of her results are baffling and in any other circumstances i would have refused to believe them the spider is definitely organic though its chemistry differs from ours in many respects it contains consider able quantities of light metals yet i hesitate to call it an animal for several fundamental reasons in the first place it seems to have no mouth no stom ach no gut no method of ingesting food also no air intakes no lungs no blood no reproductive system you may wonder what it has got well theres a simple musculature controlling its three legs and the three whip like tendrils or feelers theres a brain fairly complex mostly concerned with the creatures remarkably devel oped triocular vision but eighty per cent of the body consists of a honeycomb of large cells and this is what gave dr ernst such an unpleasant surprise when she started her dissection if shed been luckier she might have recognized it in time because its the one raman struc ture that does exist on earth though only in a handful of marine animals most of the spider is simply a battery very much like that found in electric cells and rays but in this case its apparently not used for defence its the creatures source of energy and that is why it has no provisions for eating and breathing it doesnt need such primitive arrangements and incidentally this means that it would be perfectly at home in a vacuum so we have a creature which to all intents and pur poses is nothing more than a mobile eye it has no organs of manipulation those tendrils are much too feeble if i had been given its specifications i would have said it was merely a reconnaissance device its behaviour certainly fits that description all the spiders ever do is to run around and look at things thats all they can do but the other animals are different the crab the star fish the sharks for want of better words can obviously manipulate their environment and appear to be special ized for various functions i assume that they are also electrically powered since like the spider they appear to have no mouths im sure youll appreciate the biological problems raised by all this could such creatures evolve naturally i really dont think so they appear to be designed like machines for specific jobs if i had to describe them i would say that they are robots biological robots some thing that has no analogy on earth if rama is a spaceship perhaps they are part of its crew as to how they are born or created thats some thing i cant tell you but i can guess that the answers over there in new york if commander norton and his men can wait long enough they may encounter increas ingly more complex creatures with unpredictable be haviour somewhere along the line they may meet the ramans themselves the real makers of this world and when that happens gentlemen there will be no doubt about it at all chapter thirtyfive special delivery commander norton was sleeping soundly when his per sonal communicator dragged him away from happy dreams he had been holidaying with his family on mars flying past the awesome snowcapped peak of nix olym pica mightiest volcano in the solar system little billie had started to say something to him now he would never know what it was the dream faded the reality was his executive officer up on the ship sorry to wake you skipper said lieutenantcom mander kirchoff triple a priority from headquarters let me have it norton answered sleepily i cant its in code commanders eyes only norton was instantly awake he had received such a message only three times in his whole career and on each occasion it had meant trouble damn he said what do we do now his exec did not bother to answer each understood the problem perfectly it was one that ships orders had never anticipated normally a commander was never more than a few minutes away from his office and the code book in his personal safe if he started now norton might get back to the ship exhausted in four or five hours that was not the way to handle a class aaa pri ority jerry he said at length whos on the switchboard no one im making the call myself recorder off by an odd breach of regulations yes norton smiled jerry was the best exec he had ever worked with he thought of everything ok you know where my key is call me back he waited as patiently as he could for the next ten minutes trying without much success to think of other problems he hated wasting mental effort it was very unlikely that he could outguess the message that was coming and he would know its contents soon enough then he would start worrying effectively when the exec called back he was obviously speaking under considerable strain its not really urgent skipper an hour wont make any difference but i prefer to avoid radio ill send it down by messenger but why oh very well i trust your judgement who will carry it through the airlocks im going myself ill call you when i reach the hub which leaves laura in charge for one hour at the most ill get right back to the ship a medical officer did not have the specialized training to be acting commander any more than a commander could be expected to do an operation in emergencies both jobs had sometimes been successfully switched but it was not recommended well one order had already been broken tonight for the record you never leave the ship have you woken laura yes shes delighted with the opportunity lucky that doctors are used to keeping secrets oh have you sent the acknowledgement of course in your name then ill be waiting now it was quite impossible to avoid anxious anticipa tions not really urgent but i prefer to avoid radio one thing was certain the commander was not going to get much more sleep this night chapter thirtysix riot watcher sergeant pieter rousseau knew why he had volunteered for this job in many ways it was a realization of a child hood dream he had become fascinated by telescopes when he was only six or seven years old and much of his youth had been spent collecting lenses of all shapes and sizes these he had mounted in cardboard tubes making instruments of everincreasing power until he was fam iliar with the moon and planets the nearer spacestations and the entire landscape within thirtykilometres of his home he had been lucky in his place of birth among the mountains of colorado in almost every direction the view was spectacular and inexhaustible he had spent hours exploring in perfect safety the peaks which every year took their toll of careless climbers though he had seen much he had imagined even more he had liked to pretend that over each crest of rock beyond the reach of his telescope were magic kingdoms full of wonderful creatures and so for years he had avoided visiting the places his lenses brought to him because he knew that the reality could not live up to the dream now on the central axis of rama he could survey marvels beyond the wildest fantasies of his youth a whole world lay spread out before him a small one it was true yet a man could spend an entire lifetime explor ing four thousand square kilometres even when it was dead and changeless but now life with all its infinite possibilities had come to rama if the biological robots were not living crea tures they were certainly very good imitations no one knew who invented the word biot it seemed to come into instant use by a kind of spontaneous gen eration from his vantage point on the hub pieter was biotwatcherinchief and he was beginning so he believed to understand some of their behaviour pat terns the spiders were mobile sensors using vision and probably touch to examine the whole interior of rama at one time there had been hundreds of them rushing around at high speed but after less than two days they had disappeared now it was quite unusual to see even one they had been replaced by a whole menagerie of much more impressive creatures it had been no minor task thinking of suitable names for them there were the window cleaners with large padded feet who were ap parently polishing their way the whole length of ramas six artificial suns their enormous shadows cast right across the diameter of the world sometimes caused tem porary eclipses on the far side the crab that had demolished dragonfly seemed to be a scavenger a relay chain of identical creatures had ap proached camp alpha and carried off all the debris that had been neatly stacked on the outskirts they would have carried off everything else if norton and mercer had not stood firm and defied them the confrontation had been anxious but brief thereafter the scavengers seemed to understand what they were allowed to touch and ar rived at regular intervals to see if their services were re quired it was a most convenient arrangement and indi cated a high degree of intelligence either on the part of the scavengers themselves or some controlling entity elsewhere garbage disposal on rama was very simple everything was thrown into the sea where it was presumably broken down into forms that could be used again the process was rapid resolution had disappeared overnight to the great annoyance of ruby barnes norton had con soled her by pointing out that it had done its job magni ficently and he would never have allowed anyone to use it again the sharks might not be as discriminating as the scavengers no astronomer discovering an unknown planet could have been happier that pieter when he spotted a new type of biot and secured a good photo of it through his telescope unfortunately it seemed that all the interest ing species were over at the south pole where they were performing mysterious tasks round the horns something that looked like a centipede with suction pads could be seen from time to time exploring big horn itself while round the lower peaks pieter had caught a glimpse of a burly creature that could have been a cross between a hippopotamus and a bulldozer and there was even a doublenecked giraffe which apparently acted as a mob ile crane presumably rama like any ship required testing checking and repairing after its immense voyage the crew was already hard at work when would the pas sengers appear biot classifying was not pieters main job his orders were to keep watch on the two or three exploring parties that were always out to see that they did not get into trouble and to warn them if anything approached he alternated every six hours with anyone else who could be spared though more than once he had been on duty for twelve hours at a stretch as a result he now knew the geography of rama better than any man who would ever live it was as familiar to him as the colorado mountains of his youth when jerry kirchoff emerged from airlock alpha pieter knew at once that something unusual was happen ing personnel transfers never occurred during the sleep ing period and it was now past midnight by mission time then pieter remembered how shorthanded they were and was shocked by a much more startling irregu larity jerry whos in charge of the ship i am said the exec coldly as he flipped open his helmet you dont think id leave the bridge while im on watch do you he reached into his suit carryall and pulled out a small can still bearing the label concentrated orange juice to make five litres youre good at this pieter the skipper is waiting for it pieter hefted the can then said i hope youve put enough mass inside it sometimes they get stuck on the first terrace well youre the expert that was true enough the hub observers had had plenty of practice sending down small items that had been forgotten or were needed in a hurry the trick was to get them safely past the lowgravity region and then to see that the coriolis effect did not carry them too far away from the camp during the eightkilometre roll downhill pieter anchored himself firmly grasped the can and hurled it down the face of the cliff he did not aim dir ectly towards camp alpha but almost thirty degrees away from it almost immediately air resistance robbed the can of its initial speed but then the pseudogravity of rama took over and it started to move downwards at a constant velocity it hit once near the base of the ladder and did a slowmotion bounce which took it clear of the first ter race its ok now said pieter like to make a bet no was the prompt reply you know the odds youre no sportsman but ill tell you now it will stop within three hundred metres of the camp that doesnt sound very close you might try it some time i once saw joe miss by a couple of kilometres the can was no longer bouncing gravity had become strong enough to glue it to the curving face of the north dome by the time it had reached the second terrace it was rolling along at twenty or thirty kilometres an hour and had reached very nearly the maximum speed that friction would allow now well have to wait said pieter seating himself at the telescope so that he could keep track of the mes senger it will be there in ten minutes ah here comes the skipper ive got used to recognizing people from this angle now hes looking up at us i believe that telescope gives you a sense of power oh it does im the only person who knows everything thats happening in rama at least i thought i did he added plaintively giving kirchoff a reproachful look if it will keep you happy the skipper found hed run out of toothpaste after that conversation languished but at last pieter said wish youd taken that bet hes only got to walk fifty metres now he sees it mission complete thanks pieter a very good job now you can go back to sleep sleep im on watch until sorry you must have been sleeping or how else could you have dreamed all this space survey hq to commander ssv endeavour pri ority aaa ciassification your eyes only no per manent record spaceguard reports ultra high speed vehicle apparently launched mercury ten to twelve days ago on rama intercept if no orbit change arrival predicted date days hours may be necessary you evacuate before then will advise further c in c norton read the message half a dozen times to mem orize the date it was hard to keep track of time inside rama he had to look at his calendar watch to see that it was now day that might leave them only one week the message was chilling not only for what it said but for what it implied the hermians had made a clandestine launch that in itself a breach of space law the conclusion was obvious their vehicle could only be a missile but why it was inconceivable well almost incon ceivable that they would risk endangering endeavour so presumably he would receive ample warning from the hermians themselves in an emergency he could leave at a few hours notice though he would do so only under extreme protest at the direct orders of the commander inchief slowly and very thoughtfully he walked across to the improvised lifesupport complex and dropped the mes sage into an electrosan the brilliant flare of laser light bursting out through the crack beneath the seatcover told him that the demands of security were satisfied it was too bad he told himself that all problems could not be dis posed of so swiftly and hygienically chapter thirtyseven missile the missile was still five million kilometres away when the glare of its plasma braking jets became clearly visible in endeavours main telescope by that time the secret was already out and norton had reluctantly ordered the sec ond and perhaps final evacuation of rama but he had no intention of leaving until events gave him no alterna tive when it had completed its braking manoeuvre the unwelcome guest from mercury was only fifty kilometres from rama and apparently carrying out a survey through its tv cameras these were clearly visible one fore and one aft as were several small omniantennas and one large directional dish aimed steadily at the dis tant star of mercury norton wondered what instructions were coming down that beam and what information was going back yet the hermians could learn nothing that they did not already know all that endeavour had discovered had been broadcast throughout the solar system this space craft which had broken all speed records to get here could only be an extension of its makers will an instru ment of their purpose that purpose would soon be known for in three hours the hermian ambassador to the united planets would be addressing the general as sembly officially the missile did not yet exist it bore no identification marks and was not radiating on any stan dard beacon frequency this was a serious breach of law but even spaceguard had not yet issued a formal protest everyone was waiting with nervous impatience to see what mercury would do next it had been three days since the missiles existence and origin had been announced all that time the her mians had remained stubbornly silent they could be very good at that when it suited them some psychologists had claimed that it was almost im possible to understand fully the mentality of anyone born and bred on mercury forever exiled from earth by its threetimesmorepowerful gravity hermians could stand on the moon and look across the narrow gap to the planet of their ancestors even of their own parents but they could never visit it and so inevitably they claimed that they did not want to the pretended to despise the soft rains the rolling fields the lakes and seas the blue skies all the things that they could know only through recordings because their planet was drenched with such solar energy that the day time temperature often reached six hundred degrees they affected a rather swaggering roughness that did not bear a moments serious examination in fact they tended to be physically weak since they could only sur vive if they were totally insulated from their environ ment even if he could have tolerated the gravity a her mian would have been quickly incapacitated by a hot day in any equatorial country on earth yet in matters that really counted they were tough the psychological pressures of that ravening star so close at hand the engineering problems of tearing into a stub born planet and wrenching from it all the necessities of life these had produced a spartan and in many ways highly admirable culture you could rely on the her mians if they promised something they would do it though the bill might be considerable it was their own joke that if the sun ever showed signs of going nova they would contract to get it under control once the fee had been settled it was a nonhermian joke that any child who showed signs of interest in art philosophy or ab stract mathematics was ploughed straight back into the hydroponic farms as far as criminals and psychopaths were concerned this was not a joke at all crime was one of the luxuries that mercury could not afford commander norton had been to mercury once had been enormously impressed like most visitors and had acquired many hermian friends he had fallen in love with a girl in port lucifer and had even contemplated signing a threeyear contract but parental disapproval of anyone from outside the orbit of venus had been too strong it was just as well triple a message from earth skipper said the bridge vice and backup text from commanderin chief ready to accept check and file text let me have the voice here it comes admiral hendrix sounded calm and matteroffact as if he was issuing a routine fleet order instead of handling a situation unique in the history of space but then he was not ten kilometres from the bomb cinc to commander endeavour this is a quick summary of the situation as we see it now you know that the general assembly meets at ioo and youll be listen ing to the proceedings it is possible that you may then have to take action immediately without consultation hence this briefing weve analysed the photos you have sent us the veh icle is a standard spaceprobe modified for highimpulse and probably laserriding for initial boost size and mass are consistent with fusion bomb in the to ooo mega ton range the hermians use up to oo megatons rou tinely in their mining operations so they would have had no difficulty in assembling such a warhead our experts also estimate that this would be the min imum size necessary to assure destruction of rama if it was detonated against the thinnest part of the shell underneath the cylindrical sea the hull would be rup tured and the spin of the body would complete its disin tegration we assume that the hermians if they are planning such an act will give you ample time to get clear for your information the gammaray flash from such a bomb could be dangerous to you up to a range of a thousand kilometres but that is not the most serious danger the fragments of rama weighing tons and spinning off at almost a thousand kilometres an hour could destroy you at an unlimited distance we therefore recommend that you proceed along the spin axis since no fragments will be thrown off in that direction ten thousand kilometres should give an adequate safety margin this message cannot be intercepted it is going by multiplepseudorandom routing so i can talk in clear english your reply may not be secure so speak with dis cretion and use code when necessary i will call you im mediately after the general assembly discussion message concluded cinc out chapter thirtyeight general assembly according to the history books though no one could really believe it there had been a time when the old united nations had members the united planets had only seven and that was sometimes bad enough in order of distance from the sun they were mercury earth luna mars ganymede titan and triton the list contained numerous omissions and ambigui ties which presumably the future would rectify critics never tired of pointing out that most of the united planets were not planets at all but satellites and how ridiculous that the four giants jupiter saturn uranus and neptune were not included but no one lived on the gas giants and quite possibly no one ever would the same might be true of the other major absentee venus even the most enthusiastic of planetary engineers agreed that it would take centuries to tame venus meanwhile the hermians kept their eyes on her and doubtless brooded over longrange plans separate representation for earth and luna had also been a bone of contention the other members argued that it put too much power in one corner of the solar system but there were more people on the moon than all the other worlds except earth itself and it was the meeting place of the up moreover earth and moon hardly ever agreed on anything so they were not likely to constitute a dangerous bloc mars held the asteroids in trust except for the icarian group and a handful with pen helions beyond saturn and thus claimed by titan one day the larger asteroids such as pallas vesta juno and ceres would be important enough to have their own am bassadors and membership of the up would then reach two figures ganymede represented not only jupiter and there fore more mass than all the rest of the solar system put together but also the remaining fifty or so jovian satel lites if one included temporary captures from the aster oid belt in the same way titan took care of saturn its rings and the other thirtyplus satellites the situation for triton was even more complicated the large moon of neptune was the outermost body in the solar system under permanent habitation as a result its ambassador wore a considerable number of hats he represented uranus and its eight moons none yet occu pied neptune and its other three satellites pluto and its solitary moon and lonely moonless persephone if there were planets beyond persephone they too would be tritons responsibility and as if that was not enough the ambassador for the outer darkness as he was some times called had been heard to ask plaintively what about comets it was generally felt that this problem could be left for the future to solve and yet in a very real sense that future was already here by some definitions rama was a comet they were the only other visitors from the interstellar deeps and many had travelled on hyperbolic orbits even closer to the sun than ramas any spacelawyer could make a very good case out of that and the hermian ambassa dor was one of the best we recognize his excellency the ambassador for mer cury as the delegates were arranged counterclockwise in order of distance from the sun the hermian was on the presidents extreme right up to the very last minute he had been interfacing with his computer now he removed the synchronizing spectacles which allowed no one else to read the message on the display screen he picked up his sheaf of notes and rose briskly to his feet mr president distinguished fellow delegates i would like to begin with a brief summary of the situation which now confronts us from some delegates that phrase a brief summary would have evoked silent groans among all listeners but everyone knew that hermians meant exactly what they said the giant spaceship or artificial asteroid which has been christened rama was detected over a year ago in the region beyond jupiter at first it was believed to be a natural body moving on a hyperbolic orbit which would take it round the sun and on to the stars when its true nature was discovered the solar survey vessel endeavour was ordered to rendezvous with it i am sure we will all congratulate commander norton and his crew for the efficient way in which they have carried out their unique assignment at first it was believed that rama was dead frozen for so many hundreds of thousands of years that there was no possibility of revival this may still be true in a strictly biological sense there seems general agreement among those who have studied the matter that no living organism of any complexity can survive more than a very few centuries of suspended animation even at ab solute zero residual quantum effects eventually erase too much cellular information to make revival possible it therefore appeared that although rama was of enormous archaeological importance it did not present any major astropolitical problems it is now obvious that this was a very naпve attitude though even from the first there were some who pointed out that rama was too precisely aimed at the sun for pure chance to be involved even so it might have been argued indeed it was argued that here was an experiment that had failed rama had reached the intended target but the control ling intelligence had not survived this view also seems very simpleminded it surely underestimates the entities we are dealing with what we failed to take into account was the possibility of nonbiological survival if we accept dr pereras very plausible theory which certainly fits all the facts the crea tures who have been observed inside rama did not exist until a short time ago their patterns or templates were stored in some central information bank and when the time was ripe they were manufactured from available raw materials presumably the metalloorganic soup of the cylindrical sea such a feat is still somewhat beyond our own ability but does not present any theoretical problems we know that solid state circuits unlike living matter can store information without loss for indefinite periods of time so rama is now in full operating condition serving the purpose of its builders whoever they may be from our point of view it does not matter if the ramans them selves have all been dead for a million years or whether they too will be recreated to join their servants at any moment with or without them their will is being done and will continue to be done rama has now given proof that its propulsion system is still operating in a few days it will be at perihelion where it would logically make any major orbit change we may therefore soon have a new planet moving through the solar space over which my government has jurisdiction or it may of course make additional changes and occupy a final orbit at any distance from the sun it could even become a satellite of a major planet such as earth we are therefore fellow delegates faced with a whole spectrum of possibilities some of them very serious in deed it is foolish to pretend that these creatures must be benevolent and will not interfere with us in any way if they come to our solar system they need something from it even if it is only scientific knowledge consider how that knowledge may be used what confronts us now is a technology hundreds perhaps thousands of years in advance of ours and a culture which may have no points of contact whatsoever we have been studying the behaviour of the biological robots the biots inside rama as shown on the films that commander norton has relayed and we have arrived at certain conclusions which we wish to pass on to you on mercury we are perhaps unlucky in having no in digenous lifeforms to observe but of course we have a complete record of terrestrial zoology and we find in it one striking parallel with rama this is the termite colony like rama it is an arti ficial world with a controlled environment like rama its functioning depends upon a whole series of specialized biological machines workers builders farmers war riors and although we do not know if rama has a queen i suggest that the island known as new york serves a similar function now it would obviously be absurd to press this anal ogy too far it breaks down at many points but i put it to you for this reason what degree of cooperation or understanding would ever be possible between human beings and termites when there is no conflict of interest we tolerate each other but when either needs the others territory or re sources no quarter is given thanks to our technology and our intelligence we can always win if we are sufficiently determined but some times it is not easy and there are those who believe that in the long run final victory may yet go to the ter mites with this in mind consider now the appalling threat that rama may i do not say must present to human civilization what steps have we taken to counter it if the worst eventuality should occur none whatsoever we have merely talked and speculated and written learned papers well my fellow delegates mercury has done more than this acting under the provisions of clause of the space treaty of which entitled us to take any steps necessary to protect the integrity of our solar space we have dispatched a highenergy nuclear device to rama we will indeed be happy if we never have to utilize it but now at least we are not helpless as we were before it may be argued that we have acted unilaterally without prior consultation we admit that but does any one here imagine with all respect mister president that we could have secured any such agreement in the time available we consider that we are acting not only for ourselves but for the whole human race all future generations may one day thank us for our foresight we recognized that it would be a tragedy even a crime to destroy an artifact as wonderful as rama if there is any way in which this can be avoided without risk to humanity we will be very happy to hear of it we have not found one and time is running out within the next few days before rama reaches peri helion the choke will have to be made we will of course give ample warning to endeavour but we would advise commander norton always to be ready to leave at an hours notice it is conceivable that rama may undergo further dramatic transformations at any moment that is all mister president fellow delegates i thank you for your attention i look forward to your coopera tion chapter thirtynine command decision well rod how do the hermians fit into your theology only too well commander replied rodrigo with a humourless smile its the ageold conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil and there are times when men have to take sides in such a conflict i thought it would be something like that norton told himself this situation must have been a shock to boris but he would not have resigned himself to passive acqui escence the cosmochristers were very energetic compe tent people indeed in some ways they were remarkably like the hermians i take it you have a plan rod yes commander its really quite simple we merely have to disable the bomb oh and how do you propose to do that with a small pair of wirecutters if this had been anyone else norton would have as sumed that they were joking but not boris rodrigo now just a minute its bristling with cameras do you suppose the hermians will just sit and watch you of course thats all they can do when the signal reaches them it will be far too late i can easily finish the job in ten minutes i see they certainly will be mad but suppose the bomb is boobytrapped so that interference sets it off that seems very unlikely what would be the purpose this bomb was built for a specific deepspace mission and it will be fitted with all sorts of safety devices to prevent detonation except on a positive command but thats a risk im prepared to take and it can be done without endangering the ship ive worked everything out im sure you have said norton the idea was fascin ating almost seductive in its appeal he particularly liked the idea of the frustrated hermians and would give a good deal to see their reactions when they realized too late what was happening to their deadly toy but there were other complications and they seemed to multiply as norton surveyed the problem he was fac ing by far the most difficult and the most crucial de cision in his entire career and that was a ridiculous understatement he was faced with the most difficult decision any commander had ever had to make the future of the entire human race might well depend upon it for just suppose the her mians were right when rodrigo had left he switched on the do not disturb sign he could not remember when he had last used it and was mildly surprised that it was working now in the heart of his crowded busy ship he was com pletely alone except for the portrait of captain james cook gazing at him down the corridors of time it was impossible to consult with earth he had already been warned that any messages might be tapped per haps by relay devices on the bomb itself that left the whole responsibility in his hands there was a story he had heard somewhere about a president of the united states was it roosevelt or perez who had a sign on his desk saying the buck stops here norton was not quite certain what a buck was but he knew when one had stopped at his desk he could do nothing and wait until the hermians ad vised him to leave how would that look in the histories of the future norton was not greatly concerned with posthumous fame or infamy yet he would not care to be remembered for ever as the accessory to a cosmic crime which it had been in his power to prevent and the plan was flawless as he had expected rodrigo had worked out every detail anticipated every possibility even the remote danger that the bomb might be triggered when tampered with if that happened endeavour could still be safe behind the shield of rama as for lieu tenant rodrigo himself he seemed to regard the possi bility of instant apotheosis with complete equanimity yet even if the bomb was successfully disabled that would be far from the end of the matter the hermians might try again unless some way could be found of stopping them but at least weeks of time would have been bought rama would be far past perihelion before another missile could possibly reach it by then hope fully the worst fears of the alarmists might have been disproved or the reverse to act or not to act that was the question never before had commander norton felt such a close kinship with the prince of denmark whatever he did the possi bilities for good and evil seemed in perfect balance he was faced with the most morally difficult of all decisions if his choice was wrong he would know very quickly but if he was correct he might never be able to prove it it was no use relying any further on logical arguments and the endless mapping of alternative futures that way one could go round and round in circles for ever the time had come to listen to his inner voices he returned the calm steady gaze across the centuries i agree with you captain he whispered the human race has to live with its conscience whatever the her mians argue survival is not everything he pressed the call button for the bridge circuit and said slowly lieutenant rodrigo id like to see you then he closed his eyes hooked his thumbs in the re straining straps of his chair and prepared to enjoy a few moments of total relaxation it might be some time before he would experience it again chapter forty saboteur the scooter had been stripped of all unnecessary equip ment it was now merely an open framework holding to gether propulsion guidance and lifesupport systems even the seat for the second pilot had been removed for every kilogramme of extra mass had to be paid for in mis sion time that was one of the reasons though not the most im portant why rodrigo had insisted on going along it was such a simple job that there was no need for any extra hands and the mass of a passenger would cost sev eral minutes of flight time now the strippeddown scooter could accelerate at over a third of a gravity it could make the trip from endeavour to the bomb in four minutes that left six to spare it should be sufficient rodrigo looked back only once when he had left the ship he saw that as planned it had lifted from the cen tral axis and was thrusting gently away across the spin ning disc of the north face by the time he reached the bomb it would have placed the thickness of rama be tween them he took his time flying over the polar plain there was no hurry here because the bombs cameras could not yet see him and he could therefore conserve fuel then he drifted over the curving rim of the world and there was the missile glittering in sunlight fiercer even than that shining cm the planet of its birth rodrigo had already punched in the guidance instruc tions he initiated the sequence the scooter spun on its gyros and came up to full thrust in a matter of seconds at first the sensation of weight seemed crushing then rodrigo adjusted to it he had after all comfortably en dured twice as much inside rama and had been born under three times as much on earth the huge curving exterior wall of the fiftykilometre cylinder was slowly falling away beneath him as the scooter aimed itself directly at the bomb yet it was im possible to judge ramas size since it was completely smooth and featureless so featureless indeed that it was difficult to tell that it was spinning one hundred seconds into the mission he was ap proaching the halfway point the bomb was still too far away to show any details but it was much brighter against the letblack sky it was strange to see no stars not even brilliant earth or dazzling venus the dark filters which protected his eyes against the deadly glare made that impossible rodrigo guessed that he was break ing a record probably no other man had ever engaged in extravehicular work so close to the sun it was lucky for him that solar activity was low at two minutes ten seconds the flipover light started flashing thrust dropped to zero and the scooter spun through degrees full thrust was back in an instant but now he was decelerating at the same mad rate of three metres per second squared rather better than that in fact since he had lost almost half his propellent mass the bomb was twentyfive kilometres away he would be there in another two minutes he had hit a top speed of fifteen hundred kilometres an hour which for a space scooter was utter insanity and probably another record but this was hardly a routine eva and he knew pre cisely what he was doing the bomb was growing and now he could see the main antenna holding steady on the invisible star of mercury along that beam the image of his approaching scooter had been flashing at the speed of light for the last three minutes there were still two to go before it reached mercury what would the hermians do when they saw him there would be consternation of course they would realize instantly that he had made a rendezvous with the bomb several minutes before they even knew he was on the way probably some standby observer would call higher authority that would take more time but even in the worst possible case even if the officer on duty had authority to detonate the bomb and pressed the button immediately it would take another five minutes for the signal to arrive though rodrigo was not gambling on it cosmo christers never gambled he was quite sure that there would be no such instantaneous reaction the hermians would hesitate to destroy a reconnaissance vehicle from endeavour even if they suspected its motives they would certainly attempt some form of communication first and that would mean more delay and there was an even better reason they would not waste a gigaton bomb on a mere scooter wasted it would be if it was detonated twenty kilometres from its target they would have to move it first oh he had plenty of time but he would still assume the very worst he would act as if the triggering impulse would arrive in the shortest possible time just five minutes as the scooter closed in across the last few hundred metres rodrigo quickly matched the details he could now see with those he had studied in the photographs taken at long range what had been only a collection of pic tures became hard metal and smooth plastic no longer abstract but a deadly reality the bomb was a cylinder about ten metres long and three in diameter by a strange coincidence almost the same proportions as rama itself it was attached to the framework of the carrier vehicle by an open latticework of short ibeams for some reason probably to do with the location of the centre of mass it was supported at right angles to the axis of the carrier so that it conveyed an appropriately sinister hammerhead impression it was indeed a hammer one powerful enough to smash a world from each end of the bomb a bundle of braided cables ran along the cylindrical side and disappeared through the latticework into the interior of the vehicle all com munication and control was here there was no antenna of any kind on the bomb itself rodrigo had only to cut those two sets of cables and there would be nothing here but harmless inert metal although this was exactly what he had expected it still seemed a little too easy he glanced at his watch it would be another thirty seconds before the hermians even if they had been watching when he rounded the edge of rama could know of his existence he had an absolutely certain five minutes for uninterrupted work and a ninetynine per cent probability of much longer than that as soon as the scooter had drifted to a complete halt rodrigo grappled it to the missile framework so that the two formed a rigid structure that took only seconds he had already chosen his tools and was out of the pilots seat at once only slightly hampered by the stiffness of his heavyinsulation suit the first thing he found himself inspecting was a small metal plate bearing the inscription department of power engineering section d sunset boulevard vulcanopolis for information apply to mr henry k jones rodrigo suspected that in a very few minutes mr jones might be rather busy the heavy wirecutters made short work of the cable as the fist strands parted rodrigo gave scarcely a thought to the fires of hell that were pent up only centi metres away if his actions triggered them he would never know he glanced again at his watch this had taken less than a minute which meant that he was on schedule now for the backup cable and then he could head for home in full view of the furious and frustrated hermians he was just beginning to work on the second cable assembly when he felt a faint vibration in the metal he was touching startled he looked back along the body of the missile the characteristic blueviolet glow of a plasma thruster in action was hovering round one of the attitude control jets the bomb was preparing to move the message from mercury was brief and devastating it arrived two minutes after rodrigo had disappeared around the edge of rama commander endeavour from mercury space control inferno west you have one hour from receipt of this message to leave vicinity of rama suggest you proceed maximum acceleration along spin axis re quest acknowledgement message ends norton read it with sheer disbelief then anger he felt a childish impulse to radio back that all his crew were inside rama and it would take hours to get everyone out but that would achieve nothing except perhaps to test the will and nerve of the hermians and why several days before perihelion had they de cided to act he wondered if the mounting pressure of public opinion was becoming too great and they decided to present the rest of the human race with a fait accom pli it seemed an unlikely explanation such sensitivity would have been uncharacteristic there was no way in which he could recall rodrigo for the scooter was now in the radio shadow of rama and would be out of contact until they were in line of sight again that would not be until the mission was com pleted or had failed he would have to wait it out there was still plenty of time a full fifty minutes meanwhile he had decided on the most effective answer to mercury he would ignore the message completely and see what the hermians did next rodrigos first sensation when the bomb started to move was not one of physical fear it was something much more devastating he believed that the universe operated ac cording to strict laws which not even god himself could disobey much less the hermians no message could travel faster than light he was five minutes ahead of any thing that mercury could do this could only be a coincidence fantastic and per haps deadly but no more than that by chance a control signal must have been sent to the bomb at about the time he was leaving endeavour while he was travelling fifty kilometres it had covered eighty million or perhaps this was only an automatic change of atti tude to counter overheating somewhere in the vehicle there were places where the skin temperature ap proached fifteen hundred degrees and rodrigo had been very careful to keep in the shadows as far as possible a second thruster started to fire checking the spin given by the first no this was not a mere thermal adjust ment the bomb was reorientating itself to point to wards useless to wonder why this was happening at this pre cise moment in time there was one thing in his favour the missile was a low acceleration device a tenth of a gee was the most that it could manage he could hang on he checked the grapples attaching the scooter to the bomb framework and rechecked the safety line on his own suit a cold anger was growing in his mind adding to his determination did this manoeuvre mean that the hermians were going to explode the bomb without warn ing giving endeavour no chance to escape that seemed incredible an act not only of brutality but of folly cal culated to turn the rest of the solar system against them and what would have made them ignore the solemn promise of their own ambassador whatever their plan they would not get away with it the second message from mercury was identical with the first and arrived ten minutes later so they had extended the deadline norton still had one hour and they had obviously waited until a reply from endeavour could have reached them before calling him again now there was another factor by this time they must have seen rodrigo and would have had several minutes in which to take action their instructions could already be on the way they could arrive at any second he should be preparing to leave at any moment the skyfilling bulk of rama might become incandescent along the edges blazing with a transient glory that would far outshine the sun when the main thrust came on rodrigo was securely anchored only twenty seconds later it cut off again he did a quick mental calculation the delta vee could not have been more than fifteen kilometres an hour the bomb would take over an hour to reach rama perhaps it was only moving in close to get a quicker reaction if so that was a wise precaution but the hermians had left it too late rodrigo glanced at his watch though by now he was almost aware of the time without having to check on mercury they would now be seeing him heading pur posefully towards the bomb and less than two kilometres away from it they could have no doubt of his inten tions and would be wondering if he had already carried them out the second set of cables went as easily as the first like any good workman rodrigo had chosen his tools well the bomb was disarmed or to be more accurate it could no longer be detonated by remote command yet there was one other possibility and he could not afford to ignore it there were no external contact fuses but there might be internal ones armed by the shock of impact the hermians still had control over their veh icles movements and could crash it into rama whenever they wished rodrigos work was not yet completely fin ished five minutes from now in that control room some where on mercury they would see him crawling back along the exterior of the missile carrying the modestly sized wirecutters that had neutralized the mightiest wea pon ever built by man he was almost tempted to wave at the camera but decided that it would seem undignified after all he was making history and millions would watch this scene in the years to come unless of course the hermians destroyed the recording in a fit of pique he would hardly blame them he reached the mounting of the longrange antenna and drifted handoverhand along it to the big dish his faithful cutters made short work of the multiplex feed system chewing up cables and laser wave guides alike when he made the last snip the antenna started to swing slowly around the unexpected movement took him by surprise until he realized that he had destroyed its auto matic lock on mercury just five minutes from now the hermians would lose all contact with their servant not only was it impotent now it was blind and deaf rodrigo climbed slowly back to the scooter released the shackles and swung it round until the forward bumpers were pressing against the missile as close as pos sible to its centre of mass he brought thrust up to full power and held it there for twenty seconds pushing against many times its own mass the scooter responded very sluggishly when rodrigo cut the thrust back to zero he took a careful reading of the bombs new velocity vector it would miss rama by a wide margin and it could be located again with precision at any future time it was after all a very valuable piece of equipment lieutenant rodrigo was a man of almost pathological honesty he would not like the hermians to accuse him of losing their property chapter fortyone hero darling began norton this nonsense has cost us more than a day but at least its given me a chance to talk to you im still in the ship and shes heading back to station at the polar axis we picked up rod an hour ago looking as if hed just come off duty after a quiet watch i suppose neither of us will ever be able to visit mercury again and im wondering if were going to be treated as heroes or villains when we get back to earth but my conscience is clear im sure we did the right thing i wonder if the ramans will ever say thank you we can stay here only two more days unlike rama we dont have a kilometrethick skin to protect us from the sun the hulls already developing dangerous hot spots and weve had to put out some local screening im sorry i didnt want to bore you with my problems so theres time for just one more trip into rama and i intend to make the most of it but dont worry im not taking any chances he stopped the recording that to say the least was stretching the truth there was danger and uncertainty about every moment inside rama no man could ever feel really at home there in the presence of forces beyond his understanding and on this final trip now that he knew they would never return and that no future operations would be jeopardized he intended to press his luck just a little further in fortyeight hours then well have completed this mission what happens then is still uncertain as you know weve used virtually all our fuel getting into this orbit im still waiting to hear if a tanker can rendezvous with us in time to get back to earth or whether well have to make planetfall at mars anyway i should be home by christmas tell junior im sorry i cant bring a baby biot theres no such animal were all fine but were very tired ive earned a long leave after all this and well make up for lost time what ever they say about me you can claim youre married to a hero how many wives have a husband who saved a world as always he listened carefully to the tape before dup ing it to make sure that it was applicable to both his families it was strange to think that he did not know which of them he would see first usually his schedule was determined at least a year in advance by the inexorable movements of the planets themselves but that was in the days before rama now nothing would ever be the same again chapter fortytwo temple of glass if we try it said karl mercer do you think the bio will stop us they may thats one of the things i want to find out why are you looking at me like that mercer gave his slow secret grin which was liable to be set off at any moment by a private joke he might or might not share with his shipmates i was wondering skipper if you think you own rama until now youve vetoed any attempt to cut into buildings why the switch have the hermians given you ideas norton laughed then suddenly checked himself it was a shrewd question and he was not sure if the obvious answers were the right ones perhaps i have been ultracautious ive tried to avoid trouble but this is our last chance if were forced to retreat we wont have lost much assuming that we retreat in good order of course but the biots have never shown hostility and except for the spiders i dont believe theres any thing here that can catch us if we do have to run for it you may run skipper but i intend to leave with dig nity and incidentally ive decided why the biots are so polite to us its a little late for a new theory here it is anyway they think were ramans they cant tell the difference between one oxyeater and an other i dont believe theyre that stupid its not a matter of stupidity theyve beep program med for their particular jobs and we simply dont come into their frame of reference perhaps youre right we may find out as soon as we start to work on london joe calvert had always enjoyed those old bankrobbery movies but he had never expected to be involved in one yet this was essentially what he was doing now the deserted streets of london seemed full of men ace though he knew that was only his guilty conscience he did not really believe that the sealed and windowless structures ranged all around them were full of watchful inhabitants waiting to emerge in angry hordes as soon as the invaders laid a hand on their property in fact he was quite certain that this whole complex like all the other towns was merely some kind of storage area yet a second fear also based on innumerable ancient crime dramas could be better grounded there might be no clanging alarm bells and screaming sirens but it was reasonable to assume that rama would have some kind of warning system how otherwise did the biots know when and where their services were needed those without goggles turn your backs ordered serg eant myron there was a smell of nitric oxides as the air itself started to burn in the beam of the laser torch and a steady sizzling as the fiery knife sliced towards secrets that had been hidden since the birth of man nothing material could resist this concentration of power and the cut proceeded smoothly at a rate of several metres a minute in a remarkably short time a section large enough to admit a man had been sliced out as the cutaway section showed no signs of moving myron tapped it gently then harder then banged on it with all his strength it fell inwards with a hollow reverberating crash once again as he had done during that very first en trance into rama norton remembered the archaeologist who had opened the old egyptian tomb he did not ex pect to see the glitter of gold in fact he had no precon ceived ideas at all as he crawled through the opening his flashlight held in front of him a greek temple made of glass that was his first im pression the building was filled with row upon row of vertical crystalline columns about a metre wide and stretching from floor to ceiling there were hundreds of them marching away into the darkness beyond the reach of his light norton walked towards the nearest column and dir ected his beam into its interior refracted as through a cylindrical lens the light fanned out on the far side to be focused and refocused getting fainter with each repeti tion in the array of pillars beyond he felt that he was in the middle of some complicated demonstration in optics very pretty said the practical mercer but what does it mean who needs a forest of glass pillars norton rapped gently on one column it sounded solid though more metallic than crystalline he was completely baffled and so followed a piece of useful advice he had heard long ago when in doubt say nothing and move on as he reached the next column which looked exactly like the first he heard an exclamation of surprise from mercer i could have sworn this pillar was empty now theres something inside it norton glanced quickly back where he said i dont see anything he followed the direction of mercers pointing finger it was aimed at nothing the column was still completely transparent you cant see it said mercer incredulously come around this side damn now ive lost it whats going on here demanded calvert it was several minutes before he got even the first approxima tion to an answer the columns were not transparent from every angle or under all illuminations as one walked around them ob jects would suddenly flash into view apparently em bedded in their depths like flies in amber and would then disappear again there were dozens of them all different they looked absolutely real and solid yet many seemed to occupy the identical volume of space holograms said calvert just like a museum on earth that was the obvious explanation and therefore nor ton viewed it with suspicion his doubts grew as he exam ined the other columns and conjured up the images stored in their interiors handtools con tainers small machines with keyboards that appeared to have been made for more than five fingers scientific in struments startlingly conventional domestic utensils in cluding knives and plates which apart from their size would not have attracted a second glance on any terres trial table they were all there with hundreds of less identifiable objects often jumbled up together in the same pillar a museum surely would have some logical arrangement some segregation of related items this seemed to be a completely random collection of hard ware they had photographed the elusive images inside a score of the crystal pillars when the sheer variety of items gave norton a clue perhaps this was not a collection but a catalogue indexed according to some arbitrary but per fectly logical system he thought of the wild juxtaposi tions that any dictionary or alphabetized list will give and tried the idea on his companions i see what you mean said mercer the ramans might be equally surprised to find us putting ah cam shafts next to cameras or books beside boots added calvert after several seconds hard thinking one could play this game for hours he decided with increasing degrees of impropriety thats the idea replied norton this may be an in dexed catalogue for d images templates solid blue prints if you like to call them that for what purpose well you know the theory about the biots the idea that they dont exist until theyre needed and then theyre created synthesized from patterns stored some where i see said mercer slowly and thoughtfully so when a raman needs a lefthanded blivet he punches out the correct code number and a copy is manufactured from the pattern in here something like that but please dont ask me about the practical details the pillars through which they had been moving had been steadily growing in size and were now more than two metres in diameter the images were correspond ingly larger it was obvious that for doubtless excellent reasons the ramans believed in sticking to a onetoone scale norton wondered how they stored anything really big if this was the case to increase their rate of coverage the four explorers had now spread out through the crystal columns and were taking photographs as quickly as they could get their cameras focused on the fleeting images this was an astonishing piece of luck norton told himself though he felt that he had earned it they could not possibly have made a better choice than this illustrated catalogue of raman artifacts and yet in another way it could hardly have been more frustrating there was nothing actually here except impalpable patterns of light and darkness these apparently solid objects did not really exist even knowing this more than once norton felt an al most irresistible urge to laser his way into one of the pil lars so that he could have something material to take back to earth it was the same impulse he told himself wryly that would prompt a monkey to grab the reflection of a banana in a mirror he was photographing what seemed to be some kind of optical device when calverts shout started him running through the pillars skipper karl will look at this joe was prone to sudden enthusiasms but what he had found was enough to justify any amount of excitement inside one of the twometre columns was an elaborate harness or uniform obviously made for a vertically standing creature much taller than a man a very nar row central metal band apparently surrounded the waist thorax or some division unknown to terrestrial zoology from this rose three slim columns tapering outwards and ending in a perfectly circular belt an impressive metre in diameter loops equally spaced along it could only be intended to go round upper limbs or arms three of them there were numerous pouches buckles bandoliers from which tools protruded pipes and electrical conductors even small black boxes that would have looked perfectly at home in an electronics lab on earth the whole arrangement was almost as complex as a spacesuit though it obviously provided only partial covering for the creature wearing it and was that creature a raman norton asked him self well probably never know but it must have been intelligent no mere animal could cope with all that sophisticated equipment about two and a half metres high said mercer thoughtfully not counting the bead whatever that was like with three arms and presumably three legs the same plan as the spiders on a much more massive scale do you suppose thats a coincidence probably not we design robots in our own image we might expect the ramans to do the same joe calvert unusually subdued was looking at the dis play with something like awe do you suppose they know were here he halfwhisp ered i doubt it said mercer weve not even reached their threshold of consciousness though the hermians cer tainly had a good try they were still standing there unable to drag them selves away when pieter called from the hub his voice full of urgent concern skipper youd better get outside what is it biots heading this way no something much more serious the lights are go ing out chapter fortythree retreat when he hastily emerged from the hole they had lasered it seemed to norton that the six suns of rama were as brilliant as ever surely he thought pieter must have made a mistake thats not like him at all but pieter had anticipated just this reaction it happened so slowly he explained apologetically that it was a long time before i noticed any difference but theres no doubt about it ive taken a meter read ing the light levels down forty per cent now as his eyes readjusted themselves after the gloom of the glass temple norton could believe him the long day of rama was drawing to its close it was still as warm as ever yet norton felt himself shivering he had known this sensation once before dur ing a beautiful summer day on earth there had been an inexplicable weakening of light as if darkness was fall ing from the air or the sun had lost its strength though there was not a cloud in the sky then he remembered a partial eclipse was in progress this is it he said grimly were going home leave all the equipment behind we wont need it again now he hoped one piece of planning was about to prove its worth he had selected london for this raid because no other town was so close to a stairway the foot of beta was only four kilometres away they set off at the steady loping trot which was the most comfortable mode of travelling at half a gravity norton set a pace which he estimated would get them to the edge of the plain without exhaustion and in the minimum of time he was acutely aware of the eight kilometres they would still have to climb when they had reached beta but he would feel much safer when they had actually started the ascent the first tremor came when they had almost reached the stairway it was very slight and instinctively norton turned towards the south expecting to see another dis play of fireworks around the horns but rama never seemed to repeat itself exactly if there were any electrical discharges above those needlesharp mountains they were too faint to be seen bridge he called did you notice that yes skipper very small shock could be another atti tude change were watching the rate gyro nothing yet just a minute positive reading can just detect it less than a microradian per second but holding so rama was beginning to turn though with almost imperceptible slowness those earlier shocks might have been a false alarm but this surely was the real thing rate increasing five microrad hello did you feel that shock we certainly did get all the ships systems opera tional we may have to leave in a hurry do you expect an orbit change already were still a long way from perihelion i dont think rama works by our textbooks nearly at beta well rest there for five minutes five minutes was utterly inadequate yet it seemed an age for there was now no doubt that the light was fail ing and failing fast though they were all equipped with flashlights the thought of darkness here was now intolerable they had grown so psychologically accustomed to the endless day that it was hard to remember the conditions under which they had first explored this world they felt an over whelming urge to escape to get out into the light of the sun a kilometre away on the other side of these cylindri cal walls hub control called norton is the searchlight oper ating we may need it in a hurry yes skipper here it comes a reassuring spark of light started to shine eight kilo metres above their heads even against the now fading day of rama it looked surprisingly feeble but it had served them before and would guide them once again if they needed it this norton was grimly aware would be the longest and most nervewracking climb they had ever done what ever happened it would be impossible to hurry if they overexerted themselves they would simply collapse some where on that vertiginous slope and would have to wait until their protesting muscles permitted them to continue by this time they must be one of the fittest crews that had ever carried out a space mission but there were lim its to what flesh and blood could do after an hours steady plodding they had reached the fourth section of the stairway about three kilometres from the plain from now on it would be much easier gravity was already down to a third of earth value al though there had been minor shocks from time to time no other unusual phenomena had occurred and there was still plenty of light they began to feel more optimis tic and even to wonder if they had left too soon one thing was certain however there was no going back they had all walked for the last time on the plain of rama it was while they were taking a tenminute rest on the fourth platform that joe calvert suddenly exclaimed whats that noise skipper noise i dont hear anything highpitched whistle dropping in frequency you must hear it your ears are younger than mine oh now i do the whistle seemed to come from everywhere soon it was loud even piercing and falling swiftly in pitch then it suddenly stopped a few seconds later it came again repeating the same sequence it had all the mournful compelling quality of a lighthouse siren sending out its warnings into the fog shrouded night there was a message here and an urgent one it was not designed for their ears but they under stood it then as if to make doubly sure it was re inforced by the lights themselves they dimmed almost to extinction then started to flash brilliant beads like ball lightning raced along the six narrow valleys that had once illuminated this world they moved from both poles towards the sea in a syn chronized hypnotic rhythm which could have only one meaning to the sea the lights were calling to the sea i and the summons was hard to resist there was not a man who did not feel a compulsion to turn back and to seek oblivion in the water of rama hub control norton called urgently can you see whats happening the voice of pieter came back to him he sounded awed and more than a little frightened yes skipper im looking across at the southern conti nent there are still scores of biots over there including some big ones cranes bulldozers lots of scavengers and theyre all rushing back to the sea faster than ive ever seen them move before there goes a crane right over the edge just like jimmy but going down a lot quicker it smashed to pieces when it hit and here come the sharks theyre tearing into it ugh its not a pleasant sight now im looking at the plain heres a bulldozer that seems to have broken down its going round and round in circles now a couple of crabs are tearing into it pulling it to pieces skipper i think youd better get back right away believe me norton said with deep feeling were com ing just as quickly as we can rama was battening down the hatches like a ship pre paring for a storm that was nortons overwhelming im pression though he could not have put it on a logical basis he no longer felt completely rational two compul sions were warring in his mind the need to escape and the desire to obey those bolts of lightning that still flashed across the sky ordering him to join the biots in their march to the sea one more section of stairway another tenminute pause to let the fatigue poisons drain from his muscles then on again another two kilometres to go but lets try not to think about that the maddening sequence of descending whistles ab ruptly ceased at the same moment the fireballs racing along the slots of the straight valleys stopped their sea ward strobing ramas six linear suns were once more continuous bands of light but they were fading fast and sometimes they flick ered as if tremendous jolts of energy were being drained from waning power sources from time to time there were slight tremors underfoot the bridge reported that rama was still swinging with imperceptible slowness like a compass needle responding to a weak magnetic field this was perhaps reassuring it was when rama stopped its swing that norton would really begin to worry all the biots had gone so pieter reported in the whole interior of rama the only movement was that of human beings crawling with painful slowness up the curving face of the north dome norton had long since overcome the vertigo he had felt on that first ascent but now a new fear was beginning to creep into his mind they were so vulnerable here on this endless climb from plain to hub suppose that when it had completed its attitude change rama started to accelerate presumably its thrust would be along the axis if it was in the northward direction that would be no problem they would be held a little more firmly against the slope which they were ascending but if it was towards the south they might be swept off into space to fall back eventually on the plain far below he tried to reassure himself with the thought that any possible acceleration would be very feeble dr pereras calculations had been most convincing rama could not possibly accelerate at more than a fiftieth of a gravity or the cylindrical sea would climb the southern cliff and flood an entire continent but perera had been in a com fortable study back on earth not with kilometres of overhanging metal apparently about to crash down upon his head and perhaps rama was designed for periodic flooding no that was ridiculous it was absurd to imagine that all these trillions of tons could suddenly start moving with sufficient acceleration to shake him loose neverthe less for all the remainder of the ascent norton never let himself get far from the security of the handrail lifetimes later the stairway ended only a few hun dred metres of vertical recessed ladder were left it was no longer necessary to climb this section since one man at the hub hauling on a cable could easily hoist another against the rapidly diminishing gravity even at the bot tom of the ladder a man weighed less than five kilos at the top practically zero so norton relaxed in the sling grasping a rung from time to time to counter the feeble coriolis force still try ing to push him off the ladder he almost forgot his knot ted muscles as he had his last view of rama it was about as bright now as a full moon on earth the overall scene was perfectly clear but he could no longer make out the finer details the south pole was now par tially obscured by a glowing mist only the peak of big horn protruded through it a small black dot seen ex actly headon the carefullymapped but still unknown continent be yond the sea was the same apparently random patchwork that it had always been it was too foreshortened and too full of complex detail to reward visual examination and norton scanned it only briefly he swept his eyes round the encircling band of the sea and noticed for the first time a regular pattern of dis turbed water as if waves were breaking over reefs set at geometrically precise intervals ramas manoeuvring was having some effect but a very slight one he was sure that sergeant barnes would have sailed forth happily under these conditions had he asked her to cross the sea in her lost resolution new york london paris moscow rome he said farewell to all the cities of the northern continent and hoped the ramans would forgive him for any damage he had done perhaps they would understand that it was all in the cause of science then suddenly he was at the hub and eager hands reached out to grab him and to hurry him through the airlocks his overstrained legs and arms were trembling so uncontrollably that he was almost unable to help him self and he was content to be handled like a halfpara lysed invalid the sky of rama contracted above him as he des cended into the central crater of the hub as the door of the inner airlock shut off the view for ever he found him self thinking how strange that night should be falling now that rama is closest to the sun chapter fortyfour space drive a hundred kilometres was an adequate safety margin norton had decided rama was now a huge black rect angle exactly broadsideon eclipsing the sun he had used this opportunity to fly endeavour completely into shadow so that the load could be taken off the ships cooling systems and some overdue maintenance could be carried out ramas protective cone of darkness might disappear at any moment and he intended to make as much use of it as he could rama was still turning it had now swung through al most fifteen degrees and it was impossible to believe that some major orbit change was not imminent on the united planets excitement had now reached a pitch of hysteria but only a faint echo of this came to endeavour physically and emotionally her crew was exhausted apart from a skeleton watch everyone had slept for twelve hours after takeoff from the north polar base on doctors orders norton himself had used electrosedation even so he had dreamed that he was climbing an infinite stairway the second day back on ship everything had almost returned to normal the exploration of rama already seemed part of another life norton started to deal with the accumulated office work and to make plans for the future but he refused the requests for interviews that had somehow managed to insinuate themselves into the survey and even spaceguard radio circuits there were no messages from mercury and the up general assembly had adjourned its session though it was ready to meet again at an hours notice norton was having his first good nights sleep thirty hours after leaving rama when he was rudely shaken back to consciousness he cursed groggily opened a bleary eye at karl mercer and then like any good com mander was instantly wide awake its stopped turning yes steady as a rock lets go to the bridge the whole ship was awake even the simps knew that something was afoot and made anxious meeping noises until sergeant mcandrews reassured them with swift handsignals yet as norton slipped into his chair and fastened the restraints round his waist he wondered if this might be yet another false alarm rama was now foreshortened into a stubby cylinder and the searing rim of the sun had peeked over one edge norton jockeyed endeavour gently back into the umbra of the artificial eclipse and saw the pearly splendour of the corona reappear across a background of the brighter stars there was one huge prominence at least half a mil lion kilometres high that had climbed so far from the sun that its upper branches looked like a tree of crimson fire so now we have to wait norton told himself the im portant thing is not to get bored to be ready to react at a moments notice to keep all the instruments aligned and recording no matter how long it takes that was strange the star field was shifting almost as if he had actuated the roll thrusters but he had touched no controls and if there had been any real movement he would have sensed it at once skipper said calvert urgently from the nay position were rolling look at the stars but im getting no in strument readings rate gyros operating perfectly normal i can see the zero jitter but were rolling several degrees a second thats impossible of course it is but look for yourself when all else failed a man had to rely on eyeball in strumentation norton could not doubt that the star field was indeed slowly rotating there went sirius across the rim of the port either the universe in a reversion of precopernican cosmology had suddenly decided to re volve around endeavour or the stars were standing still and the ship was turning the second explanation seemed rather more likely yet it involved apparently insoluble paradoxes if the ship was really turning at this rate he would have felt it literally by the seat of his pants as the old saying went and the gyros could not all have failed simultaneously and independently only one answer remained every atom of endeavour must be in the grip of some force and only a powerful gravitational field could produce this effect at least no other known field suddenly the stars vanished the blazing disc of the sun had emerged from behind the shield of rama and its glare had driven them from the sky can you get a radar reading whats the doppler norton was fully prepared to find that this too was inoperative but he was wrong rama was under way at last accelerating at the modest rate of oo gravities dr perera norton told himself would be pleased he had predicted a maximum of and endeavour was somehow caught in its wake like a piece of flotsam whirling round and round behind a speeding ship hour after hour that acceleration held constant rama was falling away from endeavour at steadily in creasing speed as its distance grew the anomalous be haviour of the ship slowly ceased the normal laws of in ertia started to operate again they could only guess at the energies in whose backlash they had been briefly caught and norton was thankful that he had stationed endeavour at a safe distance before rama had switched on its drive as to the nature of that drive one thing was now cer tain even though all else was mystery there were no jets of gas no beams of ions or plasma thrusting rama into its new orbit no one put it better than sergeantprofes sor myron when he said in shocked disbelief there goes newtons third law it was newtons third law however upon which en deavour had to depend the next day when she used her very last reserves of propellent to bend her own orbit out wards from the sun the change was slight but it would increase her perihelion distance by ten million kilometres that was the difference between running the ships cool ing system at ninetyfive per cent capacity and a certain fiery death when they had completed their own manoeuvre rama was two hundred thousand kilometres away and difficult to see against the glare of the sun but they could still obtain accurate radar measurements of its orbit and the more they observed the more puzzled they be came they checked the figures over and over again until there was no escaping from the unbelievable conclusion it looked as if all the fears of the hermians the heroics of rodrigo and the rhetoric of the general assembly had been utterly in vain what a cosmic irony said norton as he looked at his final figures if after a million years of safe guidance ramas computers had made one trifling error per haps changing the sign of an equation from plus to minus everyone had been so certain that rama would lose speed so that it could be captured by the suns gravity and thus become a new planet of the solar system it was doing just the opposite it was gaining speed and in the worst possible direc tion rama was falling ever more swiftly into the sun chapter fortyfive phoenix as the details of its new orbit became more and more clearly defined it was hard to see how rama could pos sibly escape disaster only a handful of comets had ever passed as close to the sun at perihelion it would be less than half a million kilometres above that inferno of fus ing hydrogen no solid material could withstand the temperature of such an approach the tough alloy that comprised ramas hull would start to melt at ten times that distance endeavour had now passed its own perihelion to every ones relief and was slowly increasing its distance from the sun rama was far ahead on its closer swifter orbit and already appeared well inside the outermost fringes of the corona the ship would have a grandstand view of the dramas final stage then five million kilometres from the sun and still accelerating rama started to spin its cocoon until now it had been visible under the maximum power of en deavours telescopes as a tiny bright bar suddenly it be gan to scintillate like a star seen through horizon mists it almost seemed as if it was disintegrating when he saw the image breaking up norton felt a poignant sense of grief at the loss of so much wonder then he realized that rama was still there but that it was surrounded by a shimmering haze and then it was gone in its place was a brilliant star like object showing no visible disc as if rama had sud denly contracted into a tiny ball it was some time before they realized what had hap pened rama had indeed disappeared it was now sur rounded by a perfectly reflecting sphere about a hundred kilometres in diameter all that they could now see was the reflection of the sun itself on the curved portion that was closest to them behind this protective bubble rama was presumably safe from the solar inferno as the hours passed the bubble changed its shape the image of the sun became elongated distorted the sphere was turning into an ellipsoid its long axis pointed in the direction of ramas flight it was then that the first ano malous reports started coming in from the robot observa tories which for almost two hundred years had been keeping a permanent watch on the sun something was happening to the solar magnetic field in the region around rama the millionkilometrelong lines of force that threaded the corona and drove its wisps of fiercely ionized gas at speeds which sometimes de fied even the crushing gravity of the sun were shaping themselves around that glittering ellipsoid nothing was yet visible to the eye but the orbiting instruments re ported every change in magnetic flux and ultraviolet radiation and presently even the eye could see the changes in the corona a faintlyglowing tube or tunnel a hundred thousand kilometres long had appeared high in the outer atmosphere of the sun it was slightly curved bend ing along the orbit which rama was tracing and rama itself or the protective cocoon around it was visible as a glittering head racing faster and faster down that ghostly tube through the corona for it was still gaining speed now it was moving at more than two thousand kilometres a second and there was no question of it ever remaining a captive of the sun now at last the raman strategy was obvious they had come so close to the sun merely to tap its energy at the source and to speed themselves even faster on the way to their ultimate unknown goal and presently it seemed that they were tapping more than energy no one could ever be certain of this be cause the nearest observing instruments were thirty million kilometres away but there were definite indica tions that matter was flowing from the sun into rama itself as if it was replacing the leakages and losses of ten thousand centuries in space faster and faster rama swept around the sun moving now more swiftly than any object that had ever travelled through the solar system in less than two hours its direc tion of motion had swung through more than ninety de grees and it had given a final almost contemptuous proof of its total lack of interest in all the worlds whose peace of mind it had so rudely disturbed it was dropping out of the ecliptic down into the southern sky far below the plane in which all the planets move though that surely could not be its ultimate goal it was aimed squarely at the greater magellanic cloud and the lonely gulfs beyond the milky way chapter fortysix interlude come in said commander norton absentmindedly at the quiet knock on his door some news for you bill i wanted to give it first before the crew gets into the act and anyway its my depart ment norton still seemed far away he was lying with his hands clasped under his head eyes half shut cabin light low not really drowsing but lost in some reverie or private dream he blinked once or twice and was suddenly back in his body sorry laura i dont understand whats it all about dont say youve forgotten stop teasing you wretched woman ive had a few things on my mind recently surgeoncommander ernst slid a captive chair across in its slots and sat down beside him though interplanetary crises come and go the wheels of martian bureaucracy grind steadily away but i sup pose rama helped good thing you didnt have to get permission from the hermians as well light was dawning oh port lowell has issued the permit better than that its already being acted on laura glanced at the slip of paper in her hand immediate she read probably right now your new son is being con ceived congratulations thank you i hope he hasnt minded the wait like every astronaut norton had been sterilized when he entered the service for a man who would spend years in space radiationinduced mutation was not a risk it was a certainty the spermatazoon that had just deliv ered its cargo of genes on mars two hundred million kilometres away had been frozen for thirty years await ing its moment of destiny norton wondered if he would be home in time for the birth he had earned rest relaxation such normal fam ily life as an astronaut could ever know now that the mission was essentially over he was beginning to unwind and to think once more about his own future and that of both his families yes it would be good to be home for a while and to make up for lost time in many ways this visit protested laura rather feebly was purely in a professional capacity after all these years replied norton we know each other better than that anyway youre off duty now now what are you thinking demanded surgeoncom mander ernst very much later youre not becoming sentimental i hope not about us about rama im beginning to miss it thanks very much for the compliment norton tightened his arms around her one of the nic est things about weightlessness he often thought was that you could really hold someone all night without cutting off the circulation there were those who claimed that love at one gee was so ponderous that they could no longer enjoy it its a wellknown fact laura that men unlike women have twotrack minds but seriously well more seriously i do feel a sense of loss i can understand that dont be so clinical thats not the only reason oh never mind he gave up it was not easy to explain even to himself he had succeeded beyond all reasonable expectation what his men had discovered in rama would keep scien tists busy for decades and above all he had done it without a single casualty but he had also failed one might speculate endlessly but the nature and the purpose of the ramans was still utterly unknown they had used the solar system as a refuelling stop as a booster station call it what you will and had then spurned it completely on their way to more important business they would probably never even know that the human race existed such monu mental indifference was worse than any deliberate insult when norton bad glimpsed rama for the last time a tiny star hurtling outwards beyond venus he knew that part of his life was over he was only fiftyfive but he felt he had left his youth down there on the curving plain among mysteries and wonders now receding inexorably beyond the reach of man whatever honours and achieve ments the future brought him for the rest of his life he would be haunted by a sense of anticlimax and the knowledge of opportunities missed so he told himself but even then he should have known better and on faroff earth dr carlisle perera had as yet told no one how he had woken from a restless sleep with the message from his subconscious still echoing in his brain the ramans do everything in threes
