david morrell the fifth profession to sarie daughterfriend i dont understand you said alice its dreadfully confusing thats the effect of living backwards the queen said kindly it always makes one a little giddy at first living backwards alice repeated in great astonishment i never heard of such a thing but theres one great advantage in it that ones memory works both ways im sure mine only works one way alice remarked i cant remember things before they happen its a poor sort of memory that only works backward the queen remarked lewiscarroll through the lookingglass the way of the bodyguard is resolute acceptance of death miyamotomusashi a seventeenthcentury samurai prologue pledge of allegiance the fifth profession no single historical event marks the origin of savages profession the skill to which he devoted himself has its antecedents prior to fact in the haze of myth at the start there were hunters then farmers then with something to be gained by barter prostitutes and politicians given some debate about precedence those are the first four human endeavors but as soon as something can be gained it must also be protected hence savagesthe fifthprofession although his crafts inception has not been documented two incidents illustrate its valiant traditions the comitatus when the anglosaxons invaded britain four hundred years after christ they brought with them a germanic code of absolute loyalty to a tribal chieftain in its ultimate interpretation this code required a chieftains retainers or comitatus to defend him with their honor unto death one of the most gripping instances of warriors displaying such total commitment to their lord occurred on the shore of the blackwater river near the town of maldon in essex in scandinavian pirates having raided ports along the eastern coast of britain camped on an island that during low tide was linked to the shore by a narrow causeway the local british chieftain birhtnoth led his faithful comitatus to the causeway and ordered the vikings not to cross the enemy defied him swords flashed blood soaked the causeway as the battle intensified one of birhtnoths apprentice soldiers turned cowardly and fled others supposed that the retreating figure was birhtnoth himself and fled as well only birhtnoth and his bodyguards remained a javelin struck him he yanked it out and stabbed his assailant a viking ax cut off his sword arm helpless he was slashed to pieces but although birhtnoth no longer ruled his faithful comitatus persisted to protect his corpse to avenge his death they attacked with greater valor their deaths were brutal yet joyous because the comitatus adhered to their code of loyalty the original anglosaxon document that describes their heroic defeat concludes in this manner godric often let his spear fly thrusting his slaughtershaft toward the vikings bravely he advanced among his brethren hewed and laid low till he died in the struggle he was not that godric who ran from the battle those two godrics represent the principal conflict in savages profession to protect was the mandate of the comitatus but at what point if the cause seemed hopeless if the chieftain was dead should a bodyguard protect himself whenever savage debated this moral issue he remembered akira and an incident from a quite different culture that illustrated the extreme traditions of the fifth and most noble profession the fortyseven ronin in japan the equivalent of the comitatus were the samurai these protective warriors came into prominence eleven hundred years after christ when provincial chieftains known as daimyo needed fiercely loyal bodyguards to control their domains over the centuries a central military ruler called a shogun exerted power over each daimyo nonetheless each daimyos samurai felt bonded to their local lord in against this complex background of loyalties an incident occurred that formed the basis for one of the most famous japanese legends three daimyo were summoned to the shoguns court in edo now called tokyo with orders to pledge allegiance however these daimyo had little knowledge of court manners two of the three sought help from an expert in court etiquette they bribed him with gifts and were rewarded with advice but the remaining daimyo lord asano was too innocent to bribe the etiquette instructor lord kira kira felt insulted and ridiculed asano in the shoguns presence humiliated asano had no alternative except to defend his honor he drew his sword and wounded kira to draw a sword in the shoguns presence was a grievous crime the shogun commanded asano to atone by disemboweling himself the daimyo obeyed still his death did not solve the controversy now asanos samurai were bound by the rigorous code of giri which loosely translated means the burden of obligation to avenge their masters death by destroying the man whod begun the chain of insults lord kira so compulsory was the code of giri that the shogun assumed thered be more bloodshed to end the feud he sent his warriors to surround asanos castle and demand the surrender of asanos samurai inside the castle oishi yoshio the captain of asanos samurai held council with his men some favored resisting the shoguns warriors others advocated committing ritual suicide as had their lord but oishi sensed that the majority felt their obligation had ended with their masters death as a test he offered them the option of dividing asanos wealth among them many unworthy warriors eagerly chose this option oishi paid them and urged them to leave of more than three hundred samurai only fortyseven remained with these oishi made a pact each cutting a finger and joining hands sealing the pact with their blood the fortyseven surrendered to the shoguns warriors and claimed to disavow any obligation they felt to giri and their dead lord they pretended to accept their lot as ronin masterless samurai wanderers each traveled his separate way but the shogunsuspicioussent spies to follow them to insure that the feud had ended to deceive the spies each ronin bitterly engaged in unworthy conduct some became drunkards others whoremongers one sold his wife into prostitution another killed his fatherinlaw still another arranged for his sister to become a mistress of the hated lord kira permitting their swords to rust and themselves to be spat upon all appeared to wallow in dishonor at last after two years the shoguns spies were convinced that the feud had ended the shogun removed surveillance from the ronin in the fortyseven ronin regrouped and attacked kiras castle with longrepressed rage they slaughtered their enemys unsuspecting guards tracked down and beheaded the man they so loathed then washed the head and made a pilgrimage to asanos grave placing the head on the tomb of their nowavenged master the chain of obligation had not yet ended in obeying the burden of giri the ronin had violated the shoguns command to stop their vendetta one code of honor conflicted with another only one solution was acceptable the shogun dictated the ronin obeyed in triumph they impaled their bowels with their swords drawing each blade from left to right then fiercely upward in the noble ritual of suicide called seppuku the tombs of the fortyseven ronin are revered to this day a japanese monument the comitatus the fortyseven ronin savage and akira codes and obligations honor and loyalty to protect and if duty compelled to avengeeven at the risk of death the fifth and most noble profession one return of the dead the labyrinth obeying professional habits savage directed the elevator toward the floor below the one he wanted of course an uninvited visitor would have had to stop the elevator at the secondhighest floor no matter what a computercoded card slipped into a slot on the elevators control panel was required to command the elevator to rise to the topmost level savage had been given such a card but declined to use it on principle he hated elevators their confinement was dangerous he never knew what he might find when the doors slid open not that he expected trouble on this occasion but if he made one exception in his customary methods hed eventually make others and when trouble did come along he wouldnt be primed to respond besides on this warm afternoon in athens in september he was curious about the security arrangements of the person hed agreed to meet although he was used to dealing with the rich and powerful they were mostly in politics or industry it wasnt every day he met someone not only associated with both arenas but whod also been a movie legend savage stepped to one side when the elevator stopped and the doors thunked open sensing judging he peered out saw no one relaxed and proceeded toward a door whose greek sign indicated fire exit in keeping with that sign the doors handle moved freely cautious savage entered and found himself in a stairwell his crepesoled shoes muffled his footsteps on the concrete landing the twentyseven lower levels were silent he turned toward a door on his right gripped its knob but couldnt budge it good the door was locked as it should be on the opposite side a push bar would no doubt give access to this stairwellin case of emergency but on this side unauthorized visitors were prevented from going higher savage slid two thin metal prongs into the receptacle for the keyone prong for applying leverage the other for aligning the slots that would free the bolt after seven seconds he opened the door troubled that the lock was so simple it should have taken him twice as long to pick it he crept through eased the door shut behind him and warily studied the steps leading upward there werent any closedcircuit cameras the lights were dim giving him protective shadow while he climbed toward a landing then turned toward the continuation of the steps he didnt see a guard at the top he frowned when he tried the doorit wasnt locked worse when he opened it he still didnt see a guard on nearly soundless carpeting he proceeded along a corridor glancing at numbers on doors he followed their diminishing sequence toward the number hed been given just before he reached an intersecting corridor his nostrils felt pinched by tobacco smoke with the elevators to his right he turned left into the corridor and saw them three men were bunched together in front of a door at the far end of the corridor the first had his hands in his pockets the second inhaled from a cigarette the third sipped a cup of coffee amateur hour savage thought never compromise your hands when the guards noticed savage they came to awkward attention they were built like football players their suits too tight for their bullish necks and chests theyd be intimidating to a nonprofessional but their bulk made them too conspicuous to blend with a crowd and they looked too musclebound to be able to respond instantaneously to a crisis savage slackened his strong features making them nonthreatening six feet tall he slouched his wiry frame so he looked a few inches shorter as he walked along the corridor he pretended to be impressed by the guards who braced their backs in arrogant triumph they made a show of examining his id which was fake the name he was using this month they searched him but didnt use a handheld metal detector and hence didnt find the small knife beneath his lapel yeah youre expected the first man said why didnt you use the elevator the computer card didnt work savage handed it over i had to stop on the floor below and take the stairs but the stairwell doors are locked the second man said someone from the hotel must have left them open whoever forgot to lock them his ass is grass the third man said i know what you mean i cant stand carelessness they nodded squinted flexed their shoulders and escorted him into the suite no savage thought the rule is you never abandon your post the suite had a sizable living room tastefully furnished but what savage noticed disapproving was the wall directly across from him its thick draperies parted to reveal an enormous floortoceiling window and a spectacular view of the parthenon on the acropolis though athens was usually smoggy a breeze had cleared the air making the pillared ruins brilliant in the afternoon sun savage allowed himself to admire the view but only from where hed paused just inside the room for he hated huge windows whose draperies were open they gave an enemy an unnecessary advantage inviting easy invasion with telescopes microwavebeamed listening probes and most crucial sniper bullets the potential client hed been summoned to meet wasnt present so savage assessed a door on the wall to his left a closet perhaps or a washroom or a bedroom he directed his attention toward a muffled female voice behind a door on the wall to his right and that door he was sure led to a bedroom because he didnt hear a responding voice he assumed that the woman was using a telephone she sounded insistent as if she wouldnt conclude for quite a while with disciplined patience savage glanced farther right toward the wall beside the door through which hed entered he recognized two monets and three van goghs his burly escorts looked bored when they realized that their employer wasnt present no brownie points for them no audience with their client no compliments for supposedly doing their job disappointed two of them shuffled their feet adjusted their ties and went back to their stations in the hall no doubt to drink more coffee and smoke more cigarettes the third closed the door and leaned against it crossing his arms trying to look diligent though the pressure with which he squeezed his chest made it seem that he suffered from heartburn as airconditioning whispered savage turned from the paintings toward a glassenclosed display of chinese vases the remaining bodyguard straightened the door on the right swung open a woman a legend stepped out of a bedroom her official biography put her age at fortyfive nonetheless she looked astonishingly the same as when shed last appeared in a film a decade earlier tall thin angular intense blue eyes an exquisite oval face its sensuous curves framed by shoulderlength sunbleached hair smooth tanned skin a photographers dream ten years ago at a press conference in los angeles after shed won her best actress academy award shed surprised the world by announcing her retirement her marriage one month laterto the monarch of a small but wealthy islandkingdom off the french rivierahad been equally surprising when her husbands health had declined shed taken over his business affairs doubling the tourism and casinos that accounted for his islands wealth she ruled as she had acted with what film reviewers had called a style of fire and ice intense yet controlled passionate but in charge in her love scenes shed always played the dominant role the sequence in which she finally seduced the charismatic jewel thief whose attentions shed persistently discouraged remained a classic depiction of sexual tension she knew what she wanted but she took it only when her desires didnt put her at risk and her pleasure seemed based on giving more than she took on condescending to grant the jewel thief a night hed never forget so too her island subjects courted her attention in response she waved but kept a distance until at unexpected moments her generosityto the sick the homeless the bereavedwas overwhelming it seemed that compassion to her was a weakness a fire that threatened to melt her icy control but when politically advantageous emotion could be permitted indeed allowed in excessive amounts as long as it didnt jeopardize her as long as it made her subjects love her she smiled approaching savage radiant a movie in real life for his part savage admired her artful entrance knowing that she knew exactly the impression she created she was dressed in black handcrafted sandals burgundy pleated slacks a robinseggcolored silk blouse its three top buttons open to reveal the tan on the top of her breasts its light blue no doubt chosen to emphasize the deeper blue of her eyes a cartier watch and a diamond pendant with matching earrings their glint further emphasizing her eyes as well as her sunbleached hair she paused before savage then studied the remaining bodyguard her gaze dismissive thank you the burly man left reluctant not to hear the conversation i apologize for keeping you waiting she said stepping nearer permitting savage to inhale her subtle perfume her voice was husky her handshake firm five minutes no need to apologize savage shrugged in my profession im used to waiting a great deal longer besides i had time to admire your collection he gestured toward the glassenclosed display of vases at least i assume its your collection i doubt any hotel even the georges roi ii provides its clients with priceless artworks i take them with me when i travel a touch of home do you appreciate chinese ceramics appreciate yes though i dont know anything about them however i do enjoy beauty your highness includingif youll forgive the complimentyourself its an honor to meet you as royalty or because im a former film personality former actress a flick of the eyes a nod of the head youre very kind perhaps youd feel more comfortable if we dispensed with formalities please call me by my former name joyce stone savage imitated her gracious nod miss stone your eyes are green thats not so remarkable savage said on the contrary quite remarkable a chameleons color your eyes blend with your clothes gray jacket blue shirt an inattentive observer would describe your eyes as grayish blue but not green youre perceptive and you understand the tricks of light youre adaptable its useful in my work savage turned toward the paintings superb if im not mistaken the van gogh cypresses were recently purchased at a sotheby auction an unknown buyer paid an impressive amount do you recall how much fifteen million dollars and now you know the mysterious buyer miss stone i deal with privileged information id be out of business tomorrow if i didnt keep a secret your remarks to me are confession im like a priest confession i hope that doesnt mean i cant offer you a drink as long as im not working for you but i assumed thats why youre here to discuss your problem savage said i havent been hired yet with your credentials ive already decided to hire you forgive me miss stone but i accepted your invitation to find out if i wanted you to hire me the sensuous woman studied him my my her intense gaze persisted people are usually eager to work for me i meant no offense of course not she stepped toward a sofa but if you wouldnt mind miss stone she raised her eyebrows id prefer that you used this chair over here that sofas too close to the window window or else let me close the draperies ah yes now i understand she sounded amused since i enjoy the sunlight ill sit where you suggest tell me are you always this protective of people you havent decided to work for a force of habit an intriguing habit mr im afraid ive forgotten your name savage doubted that she seemed the type who remembered everything it doesnt matter the name i provided isnt mine i normally use a pseudonym then how should i introduce you you dont if we reach an agreement never draw attention to me in public but what if i have to summon you in private savage i beg your pardon a nickname the way im identified in my business and did you acquire it when you were in the seals savage hid his surprise your former units name is an acronym correct sea air and land the us navy commandos savage subdued an impulse to frown i told you i found your credentials impressive she said your use of pseudonyms makes clear you cherish your privacy but with persistence i did learn several details about your background in case i alarm you let me emphasize that nothing i was told in any way jeopardized your anonymity still rumors travel the help you gave a certain member of the british parliamentagainst ira terrorists i believeis widely respected he asked me to thank you again for saving his life an italian financier is similarly grateful for your skillful return of his kidnapped son a west german industrialist feels that his corporation would have gone bankrupt if you hadnt discovered the rival who was stealing his formulas savage kept silent no need to be modest she said nor should you your sources are excellent one of the many advantages to marrying royalty the gratitude of the italian financier was especially compelling so i asked him how i might get in touch with you he gave me the telephone number ofi suppose in my former life id have used the termyour agent you didnt learn his name i hope i never spoke to him directly only through intermediaries good which brings me to my problem miss stone another force of habit dont be specific in this room no one can overhear us there arent any hidden microphones what makes you sure my bodyguards checked it this morning in that case i repeat dont be specific in this room my bodyguards didnt impress you they impressed me all right but not the proper way i try not to criticize another commendable habit very well then savage her smile matched the glint of her diamond earrings she leaned from her chair and touched his hand would you like to see some ruins the black rollsroyce veered from traffic to stop in an oval parking lot savage and two of the bodyguards got outthe third had remained at the hotel to watch the suite after the guards assessed the passing crowd they nodded toward the cars interior joyce stone stepped smoothly out flanked by her guards circle the area well be back in an hour she told her driver who eased the rolls back into traffic she turned amused toward savage you keep surprising me oh back at the hotel you objected to my sitting near a window but you havent said a word about my going out in public being famous doesnt mean you have to be a hermit as long as you dont advertise your schedule an accomplished driver can make it difficult for someone to follow you savage gestured toward the swarm of traffic especially in athens besides you know how to dress to match your surroundings to echo a compliment you gave me youre adaptable its a trick i learned when i was an actress one of the hardest roles to look average shed changed before they left the hotel now in place of her designer slacks and blouse she wore faded jeans and a loose gray turtleneck sweater her diamonds were gone her watch was a timex her shoes were dusty reeboks her distinctive sunbleached hair had been tucked beneath a floppy straw hat sunglasses hid her intense blue eyes though pedestrians had paused to study the rolls theyd shown little interest in the woman who got out youre playing the part successfully savage said at the moment a producer wouldnt hire you even for a walkon she curtsied mockingly i do have one suggestion he said somehow i knew you would have stop using the rolls but it gives me pleasure you cant always have what you want save the rolls for special occasions buy a highperformance but neutrallooking car of course it would have to be modified of course reinforced windows clouded glass in the rear bulletproof paneling of course dont humor me miss stone im not its just that i enjoy a man who enjoys his work enjoy i dont do this for fun my work saves lives and youve never failed savage hesitated caught by surprise he felt a rush of torturous memories the flash of a sword the gush of blood yes he said once your honesty amazes me and only once thats why im so meticulous why ill never fail again but if my truthfulness gives you doubts about me on the contrary my third movie was a failure i could have ignored it but i admitted it and learned from it i won the oscar because i tried harder although it took me seven more films a movie isnt life or death you should have seen the reviews of that third movie i was buried so will we all be buried dont be depressing savage did no one tell you the facts of life sex i learned that early death thats why a man like you exists to postpone it as long as possible yes death savage said the enemy they followed a tour group toward the western slope of the acropolis the traditional approach to the ruins since the other ridges were far too steep for convenient walkways past fir trees they reached an ancient stone entrance known as the beulé gate have you been here before several times savage said so have i still i wonder if you come for the same reason i do savage waited for her to explain ruins teach us a lesson nothingwealth fame powernothing is permanent look on my works ye mighty and despair she turned to him impressed thats from shelleys ozymandias i went to a thorough prep school but you dont give the name of the school anonymous as usual do you remember the rest of the poem savage shrugged round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away shelley understood precision if hed been japanese hed have written great haikus a bodyguard quoting poetry im not exactly a bodyguard miss stone i do more than run interference what are you then an executive protector you know except for the sand the ruins shelley describes remind me of savage gestured toward the steps they climbed the marble had been eroded by time by use by various invaders and worst of all by automobile exhaust they passed through a monument called the propylaea its precious decaying walkway protected by a wooden floor five gateways of columns grew wider and taller leading them to a path that split right and left after the cloying heat of summer septembers moderate temperature brought the start of the tourist season sightseers jostled past them some out of breath from the climb others taking photographs of monuments on either side the precinct of brauronia and the less impressive house of arrhephoroi tell your guards to walk behind us savage said ill watch ahead turning right they proceeded to the vast rectangular parthenon in a conflict between invaders had resulted in a venetian bombs igniting a turkish gunpowder magazine in the parthenon which in ancient times had been a temple devoted to the greek goddess of purity athena the explosion had destroyed a considerable part of the monument toppling pillars and much of the roof restoration was still in progress scaffolding obscured the magnificence of surviving doric columns guardrails kept visitors from further eroding the interior savage turned from the tourists approaching the precipitous southern ridge of the acropolis he leaned against a fallen pillar athens sprawled below him the earlier breeze had died despite a brilliant clear sky smog had begun to gather we can talk here without being overheard savage said miss stone the reason im not sure i want to work for you but you havent heard why i need you is that an executive protector is both a servant and a master you control your lifewhere you go and what you dobut your protector insists on how you get there and under what terms you do it a delicate balance but youve got a reputation for being willful im not sure youre prepared to take orders from someone you employ sighing she sat beside him if thats your problem then there isnt a problem i dont understand the trouble isnt mine its my sisters explain do you know about her rachel stone ten years your junior thirtyfive married a new england senator campaigning to be president widowed because of an unknown assassins bullet her association with politics and a movielegend sister made her glamorous a greek shipping magnate courted her they married last year i give you credit you do your homework no less than you their marriage is like the parthenon a ruin joyce stone rummaged through her burlap purse finding a pack of cigarettes she fumbled with a lighter youre not a gentleman she snapped because i wont light your cigarette i just explained when it comes to protection youre the servant and im the master that doesnt make sense it does if you realize i have to keep my hands free in case someone threatens you why did you ask to see me my sister wants a divorce then she doesnt need me what she needs is a lawyer her bastard husband wont allow it shes his prisoner till she changes her mind prisoner shes not in chains if thats what youre thinking but shes a prisoner all the same and shes not being tortured she managed to light her cigarette unless you count being raped morning noon and night to remind her of what shed miss he says she needs a true man he says what he needs is a bullet through his obscene brain do you carry a gun she asked exhaling smoke seldom then what good are you savage stood from the column youve made a mistake miss stone if you want an assassin no i want my sister he eased back onto the column youre talking about a retrieval whatever you want to call it if i decide to take the assignment my fee ill pay you a million dollars youre a poor negotiator i might have settled for less but thats what im offering assuming i accept ill want half in an escrow account at the start the other half when i deliver plus expenses stay in the best hotels for all i care spend as much as you want on meals a few extra thousand hardly matters you dont understand when i say expenses im thinking of as much as several hundred thousand what youre asking me to antagonize one of the most powerful men in greece whats he worth fifty billion his security will be extensive costly to breach tell me where your sister is ill do a risk analysis a week from now ill tell you if i can get her she stubbed out her cigarette and slowly turned why im not sure what you mean i get the feeling this jobs more important to you than the money why would you consider accepting my offer for a chilling instant savage had a mental image of steel glinting of blood spraying he repressed the memory avoiding her question you told your driver an hour its just about time lets go he said and when we get back to the car tell him to take an indirect route to your hotel adhering to his own advice savage used an indirect route to return to the acropolis or rather to an area immediately north of itto the plaka the principal tourist shopping district in athens he entered narrow crowded streets lined with myriad markets and shops despite the renewed bitter smog he detected the aroma of smoking shish kebob which soon gave way to the fragrance of freshly cut flowers loud vendors gesticulated toward handcrafted carpets leather goods pottery copper urns and silver bracelets he reached a labyrinth of alleys paused in an alcove satisfied himself that he wasnt under surveillance and proceeded past a tavern to a neighboring shop that sold wineskins inside the wineskins hung in bunches from hooks on rafters their leather smell strong but pleasant savage bowed to pass beneath them approaching an overweight woman behind a counter his knowledge of greek was limited he spoke in memorized phrases i need a special product a wineskin of a different type if your esteemed employer could spare a few moments to see me your name the woman asked please tell him its the opposite of gentle she nodded respectfully and turned to proceed up a stairway seconds later she came back gesturing for him to ascend passing an alcove from which a beardstubbled man with a shotgun studied him savage climbed the stairs at the top a door was open through it savage saw a roombare except for a desk behind which a muscular man in a black suit poured a clear liqueur into a glass when savage entered the man peered up in surprise as if he hadnt been notified he had a visitor can it be a ghost though greek the man spoke english savage grinned i admit ive been a stranger an ungrateful wretch who hasnt seen fit to keep in touch and maintain our friendship business kept me away this socalled business must have been truly mythic it had importance but now i make up for my absence savage set the greek equivalent of ten thousand us dollars onto the desk spreading the bills he covered the pattern of circular stains made by the glass refilled compulsively each day with ouzo a licorice scentthe aniseed in the ouzo filled the room the middleaged greek noticed savages glance toward the liqueur may i tempt you as you know i seldom drink a character flaw for which i forgive you the greek swelled his chest and chuckled deeply he showed no sign of his alcoholism indeed the ouzo like formaldehyde seemed to have preserved his body cleanshaven with glinting superbly cut black hair he sipped from his glass set it down and studied the money his swarthy skin exuded health nonetheless he looked troubled as he counted the money too generous excessive you worry me ive also arranged for a gift within an hour if you agree to supply the information i need a messenger will deliver a case of the finest ouzo truly the finest you know my preference i do indeed but ive taken the liberty of choosing a rarer variety how rare savage gave a name extremely generous a tribute to your talent savage said as you say in your countrythe man sipped from his glassyoure an officer and a gentleman exofficer savage corrected him he wouldnt have volunteered this personal detail if the greek hadnt known it already and you are a trusted informant how long has it been since i first negotiated for your services the greek concentrated six years of delight my former wives and many children thank you for your frequent patronage and theyll thank me even more when i triple the money i placed on your desk i knew it i sensed when i woke up this morning i announced to myself that today would be a special occasion but not without risks the greek set down his glass every day brings a risk are you ready for the challenge as soon as i fortify myself the greek downed the rest of his glass a name savage said as the greatest english bard said whats in a name i dont think youll like it savage pulled a bottle of the bestofthebest hardtofind ouzo from beneath the back of his jacket the greek grinned that name i like and the other stavros papadropolis the greek slammed down his glass holy mother of fuck he swiftly poured more ouzo and gulped it what lunacy prompts you to risk investigating him savage glanced around the almost bare room i assume youve been cautious as usual your vice hasnt made you neglect your daily cleaning chores i hope the greek looked hurt the day you see furniture in this room apart from my chair and desk youll know im unworthy of trust savage nodded not only did the greek keep his furniture to a minimum as well the floor had no rug there werent any pictures on the walls there wasnt even a telephone the rooms austerity made it difficult for someone to conceal a microphone nonetheless each morning the greek used two different types of sophisticated electronic scanning devices with one he checked every inch of the room for radio signals and microwaves to determine if a bug was transmitting sounds from the room however that type of scanning device could detect only an active permanently broadcasting microphone to discover a passive microphonewhich stayed dormant if there werent any sounds in the room or which could be turned off by remote control if an eavesdropper suspected a sweep was occurringthe second scanner had to be used it was called a nonlinear junction detector through an attachment that resembled the head of a portable vacuum cleaner it beamed microwaves that located the diodes in the circuits of hidden tape recorders and transmitters though this second device required more time to be employed effectively the greek always activated it even on those rare occasions when the first device revealed a microphonebecause a skillful eavesdropper always left both active and passive monitors in case a less skillful searcher would feel that his efforts had been successful and stop if he found only an active microphone with his customary humor the greek referred to this daily thorough search for bugs as fumigating forgive my inquiry savage said i meant to be careful not rude if you hadnt asked id have wondered if you were worthy of trust youre understanding as always the greek sipped his drink and gestured agreeably an obligation of friendship he pressed his palms on his desk but you still havent answered my question papadropolis im interested in his domestic arrangements not his business affairs thank zeus you had me worried the wretch has two hundred ships they earn a modest profit from transporting grain machinery and oil but he accumulated his fortune from smuggling weapons and drugs anyone who inquires about his lucrative contraband becomes fish food in the aegean he may be as protective about his family life savage said no doubt a greek would kill to protect the honor of his family even if in private he didnt care for them but business is survival its secrets are fiercely kept whereas family secrets are taken for granted to be unavoidable gossip as long as no one dares to repeat the gossip in front of the lord of the household then find me some gossip savage said specifically about papadropolis and his wife ive already heard some specifics learn more savage said where she is and how shes being treated i want to compare what you tell me with what ive been told may i ask your purpose savage shook his head ignorance is your protection and your protection as well if im unaware of what you intend i cant reveal it if someone questions me with a force i cant resist but that wont happen savage said as long as you stay careful im always careful like you i use intermediaries and often messengers between intermediaries i speak directly only to clients and those few assistants with whom i have a bond you look worried my friend six months ago something happened to me it made me doubly cautious remembering savage felt his stomach clench commendable however i note the lack of detail in your revelation savage subdued his temptation to continue revealing its a personal matter unimportant im not convinced of this socalled unimportance but i do respect your discretion just find out what i need savage walked toward the door papadropolis and his wife two days thats all the time i can give you when i return i want to learn everything the cyclades are a cluster of small aegean islands southeast of athens their name derives from the greek word kyklos or circle and refers to the ancient greek belief that the islands surrounded delos the island upon which the sun god of truth apollo was supposedly born in fact delos is not at the center but near the eastern rim of the islands a few kilometers farther east of it on the edge of the cyclades lies mykonos one of greece s main holiday areas where tourists worship their own sun god savage piloted a twoengine propellordriven cessna toward mykonos taking care to approach the island on an indirect course first heading due east from athens then easing southward above the aegean sea until he flanked the eastern rim of his destination he radioed the airport at mykonos to notify the controller that he didnt intend to land his flight was strictly for practice and pleasure he explained and if the controller would warn him which air routes to avoid savage would gratefully obey instructions the controller obliged at a distance and height of onehalf kilometer savage put the cessna on automatic pilot and began taking pictures the bausch and lomb telephoto lens on his nikon camera magnified images amazingly the photographs would be further magnified after he developed them the main thing he knew from his training was to take plenty of pictures not only of his target but of its surroundings details that seemed unimportant at the moment could too often be crucial when he later constructed his plan yes plenty of pictures he paused frequently to readjust the cessnas automatic pilot then resumed his photographic surveillance the sky was blue the weather calm the cessna seemed to glide on a silken highway his hands were rock steady except for the minor vibrations of the plane conditions were perfect for taking clear photographs his initial objective was the town of mykonos on the western side of the island the town spread around two small bays its houses projecting onto a peninsula that separated each harbor the buildings were shaped like intersecting cubes each brilliantly white here and there red domes sometimes blueidentified churches windmills lined a jetty but the design of the town not its beauty attracted savages attention in antiquity mykonos had been a frequent target of pirates to make their homes easier to protect the local population had constructed the streets in the form of a labyrinth attacking pirates had no difficulty entering the town but as they pillaged deeper into it higher up its slopes they soon discovered that the complex maze of lanes confused their sense of direction the pirates could see their ship in the harbor below them but to reach it they had to test this and that route all the while encountering ambushes set by the villagers eventually after several defeats the pirates left mykonos alone in favor of uncomplicated prey on other islands yes a labyrinth savage thought i might be able to use that continuing to circle the island all the while taking photographs he reached a deep gulf to the north perhaps a pickup site then studied a forbidding cape to the east to be attempted only in an emergency and finally reached his primary goal papadropoliss compound above anna bay on the southeastern side of the island since hed met with his greek informant two days earlier savage had been busy and to his wary satisfaction had learned a great deal hed flown to contacts in zurich and brussels the two most dependable european sources of information about blackmarket armament sales and the security systems of the men who smuggled the weapons through seemingly casual conversationsand generous gifts to friends to whom savage pretended delight when he learned that the rumors werent true about their having been killedhe discovered what hed already guessed papadropolis was controlled by his arrogance the greek billionaire was too consumed with power to hire protectors who had sufficient professional integrity to insist on giving orders to their employer savage had also learned that papadropolis was fascinated by gadgets and technology just as the shipping magnate had a passion for computers and video games so hed hired an expert in security systems to construct a web of intrusionwarning obstacles around his various european estates all savage cared about was the mykonos estate the moment he learned whod designed its defenses he knewin the same way an art historian would have recognized a renaissance stylewhat barriers he faced his longtime and trusted greek informant had verified what joyce stone had claimed the movie legends sister was being held captive on her billionaire husbands lavish summer estate on mykonos you want to divorce me bitch no woman ever walked away from me id be a joke an ungrateful wife has only one use on your back ill teach you but summer had become september the start of the tourist season in athens was the end of the tourist season on mykonos because of lowering temperatures to force her to spend an autumn and perhaps a winter on the island was papadropoliss idea of a further insult savage lowered his camera switched off the automatic pilot and gripped the cessnas controls for six months since the disaster hed almost described to his greek informant hed been in seclusion convalescing his arms legs head and back still ached from the injuries hed sustained nightmarish memories persisted in haunting him but the past could not be changed he strained to remind himself the present was all that mattered and his work he had to get back to his work to prove himself to himself he veered from mykonos heading north above the legendary winedark aegean patting his camera it was good to be on an assignment again he felt as if hed returned from the dead savage rose from the waves and crept toward the shore his black wetsuit blended with the night he crouched behind boulders stared at the murky cliff above him and turned toward the sea the speedboats pilot a british mercenary whom savage often employed had been told to hurry from the area as soon as savage dropped into the water a halfkilometer from the island the pilot hadnt used any lights in the dark with no moon and approaching storm clouds obscuring the stars a sentry couldnt have seen the boat amid the din of waves crashing onto rocks a sentry couldnt have heard it either though savage had taken the precaution of placing a soundabsorbent housing over the speedboats motor satisfied that hed reached here undetected unless the guards had night scopes savage pulled at the strong nylon cord cinched around his waist he felt resistance pulled harder and soon withdrew a small rubber raft from the water behind a rock that shielded him from the spray of the waves he unzipped the rafts waterproof compartment and took out a bulging knapsack his wetsuit had kept the frigid water from draining his body heat and giving him hypothermia as he swam with the raft toward shore now he shivered peeling off the wetsuit naked he hurriedly reached into the knapsack to put on black woolen clothes hed chosen wool because its hollow fibers had superior insulating ability even when wet his socks and cap were made of the same dark material he slipped into sturdy anklehigh shoes with crossridged soles and tied them firmly warm again he applied black camouflage grease to his face then protected his hands with dark woolen gloves that were thin enough to allow his fingers to be flexible what remained in the knapsack were the various tools he would need each wrapped in cloth to prevent their metal from clanking together he secured the knapsacks straps around his shoulders and tightened its belt the knapsack was heavy but not as heavy as the equipment hed been accustomed to carrying when he was in the seals and his strong back accepted the burden comfortably he placed his wetsuit snorkel goggles and fins into the rafts compartment zipped it shut and tied the raft securely to a rock he didnt know if hed be forced to return to this site but he wanted to have the raft here in case he needed it papadropoliss guards wouldnt notice it until the morning and by then if savage hadnt returned their discovery of the raft wouldnt matter he approached the cliff a breeze gained strength the storm clouds now completely obscuring the sky the air smelled of imminent rain good savage thought his plan depended on a storm that was why hed chosen tonight to infiltrate papadropoliss estate all the weather forecasters had agreedaround midnight the first rains of autumn would arrive but savage had to get to the top of the cliff before the storm made climbing difficult he reached up found a handhold braced the toe of one of his boots in a niche and began his ascent though two hundred feet high the cliff had multiple fissures and outcrops an experienced climber savage would not have trouble scaling it in the dark the wind increased spray from the waves stung his face and made the cliff slippery he gripped his gloved fingers tighter onto outcrops wedged his boots deeper into niches and climbed with greater deliberation halfway up he reached a fissure recalling it from the photographs hed studied knowing it would take him to the top he squirmed inside it braced his boots against each side groped up for handholds and strained higher his mental clock told him hed been climbing for almost ten minutes but all he cared about was each second of caution the fissure blocked the wind but a sudden cascade of rain replaced the spray from the waves and he fought the urge to climb faster he groped up touched nothing and exhaled realizing hed arrived at the top of the cliff the rain fell harder drenching him even so it now was welcome providing him with greater concealment in the night he crawled from the fissure scurried across the rim and crouched among bushes mud soaked his knees his stomach fluttered with nervousness as it always did at the start of a mission but it also burned with fear that despite his meticulous preparations he might fail as he had six months ago there was only one way to learn if hed recovered he inhaled concentrated on the obstacles he faced and subdued his distracting emotions scanning the stormshrouded night detecting no guards he crept from the bushes the photographs hed taken had revealed the first barrier he would come toa chain link fence around the estate from the photographs he hadnt been able to determine the height of the fence but the standard was seven feet when hed magnified the photographs hed discovered that the fence was topped by several strands of barbed wire attached to braces that projected inward and outward in the shape of a v the rain made the night so dark that savage couldnt see the fence nonetheless by studying the photographs and comparing the theoretical height of the fence with the distance between the fence and these bushes hed calculated that the barrier was twenty yards ahead the photographs hadnt shown any closedcircuit cameras mounted on the fence so he didnt worry about revealing himself to remotecontrolled nightvision lenses all the same from habit he crawled the rainsoaked ground felt mushy beneath him at the fence he stopped to remove his knapsack he took out an infrared flashlight and a pair of infrared goggles the beam from the flashlight would be invisible to unaided eyes but through the goggles savage saw a greenish glow he aimed the beam toward the fences metal posts scanning upward toward the projecting metal arms that secured the barbed wire what he looked for were vibration sensors he found none as hed expected the fence was merely a line of demarcation a barrier but not an intrusion detector it kept hikers from trespassing unintentionally its barbedwire top discouraged unskilled invaders if animalsroaming dogs for examplebanged against it thered be no alarm needlessly attracting guards savage put the flashlight and goggles into his knapsack hoisted the pack to his shoulders and resecured it as the rain gusted harder he stepped away from the fence assumed a sprinters stance and lunged his momentum carried him halfway up the fence he grabbed for the projecting metal arm at the top swung his body up onto the strands of barbed wire clutched the metal arm on the opposite side of the v swung over the second group of barbed wire and landed smoothly his knees bent on the far side of the fence his woolen clothes and gloves were ripped in many places the barbed wire had inflicted several irritating nicks on his arms and legs but his injuries were too inconsequential to concern him barbed wire was a discouragement only to amateurs staying close to the ground wiping rain from his eyes he studied the murky area before him his british mentor whod trained him to be an executive protector had been fond of saying that life was an obstacle course and a scavenger hunt well now the obstacle course would begin the island of mykonos was hilly with shallow soil and many projecting rocks papadropolis had built his estate on one of the few level peaks savages photographs had shown that a surrounding slope led up to the mansion from the mansions perspective the bottom of the slope could not be seen hence papadropolis had decided that an aesthetic barrier around his property a stone wall instead of a chain link fence would not be necessary after all if the tyrant didnt have to look at the institutionallooking fence it wouldnt offend him and metal was always more intimidating to an intruder than stone and mortar savage tried to think as his opponent did because papadropolis couldnt see this rocky slope and probably avoided its sharp incline most of the intrusion sensors would be located in this area the photographs of the estate had shown a second fence lower than the first but not enough to be jumped across the fence was halfway up the slope but what worried savage was what the photographs couldnt showburied detectors between the first fence and the second he removed his knapsack and selected a device the size of a walkman radio a batterypowered voltmeter its purpose to register electrical impulses from underground pressure sensors he couldnt risk referring to an illuminated dial on the meter the light from which might reveal him so hed chosen a device equipped with an earplug lightning flashed his earplug wailed and he froze the night became dark again at once his earplug stopped wailing causing him to relax the voltmeter had reacted to atmospheric electricity from the lightning not to buried sensors otherwise the earplug would have continued to wail even when there wasnt lightning but the flash of light though startling had been useful hed been given a glimpse of the fence a few yards ahead of him it too was chain link not topped by barbed wire however and savage understood whyanyone whod climbed the more imposing first fence would be tempted to scramble over this seemingly less protected barrier he approached it cautiously another flash of lightning revealed small metal boxes attached to the posts supporting the fence vibration detectors if someone grabbed the chain links and started to climb an alarm would warn guards in the mansion a computer monitor would reveal the site of the intrusion the guards would quickly converge on the area in theory the vibration sensors could not be defeated but savage knew that vibration sensors had to be adjusted so that a specific amount of vibration was necessary before the sensors would trigger an alarm otherwise wind gusting against the fence or a birds landing on it would needlessly alert guards after several false warnings the guards would lose faith in the sensors and fail to investigate an alarm so the only way to get beyond the fence was to use a method that seemed the most risky to cut through the links but it had to be done in a special way savage unslung his knapsack and took out wireclippers kneeling he chose a link at shoulder level and snipped it instead of fearing that hed caused an alarm instead of succumbing to second thoughts and rushing away he calmly waited forty seconds snipped another link and waited another forty seconds then snipped a third link each snip was the same as a bird landing on the fence or given the weather rain lashing against it his carefully timed assault on the fence had insufficient constancy to activate the sensors twelve minutes later savage removed a twofoot square from the fence eased his knapsack through the gap then crawled through slowly making sure he didnt touch the surrounding links he put the wireclippers into his pack and resecured the pack to his shoulders now in addition to the voltmeter he carried a miniature batterypowered microwave detector as well he again wore his infrared goggles because his photographs had revealed a further danger a line of metal posts near the top of the slope nothing linked them they appeared to be the start of a fence that would soon be completed wires eventually attached to them but savage knew better he stared through his goggles anxious to know whether infrared beams filled the gaps between the posts if his suspicion was correct if the beams existed and he passed through them hed trigger an alarm but as he crept closer to the top of the rainswept hill his goggles still did not detect infrared beams between the posts which meant the moment the thought occurred to him the earplug attached to his microwave detector began to wail he halted abruptly yes he thought microwaves hed have been disappointed if papadropolis used infrared that type of beam was too susceptible to false alarms caused by rain but microwaves provided an absolutely invisible barrier and were much less affected by weather this test meant nothing without a sufficient challenge again as lightning flashed the earplug to savages voltmeter wailed he paused in case the lightning coincided with an electrical field from a buried pressure sensor but when the wail stopped he knew that the microwave fence was his only obstacle he approached his objective the lightning had allowed him a glimpse of the nearest post the post had a slot down its right and left side for transmitting beams to and receiving beams from the next posts right and left the post was too high for him to leap over the microwaves the earth too shallow for him to dig under them still the installerfor all his clevernesshad made a mistake for this system worked best when the posts werent in a continuous line with each other but instead were staggered so the microwaves formed an overlapping pattern in such a formation the posts were protected if an intruder tried to use them to get past the system hed interfere with the microwaves however savages photographs had shown that the system was in a straight line it could be defeated savage removed a metal clamp from his knapsack and attached the clamp to the post above the slots that transmitted and received the microwaves he screwed several sections of metal together to form a threefootlong rod then inserted the rod into the clamp the rod projecting toward him next he threw his knapsack over the post gripped the rod and raised himself onto it for a heartpounding instant he almost lost his balance the rod became slippery in the rain wind pushed him but the ridges on the soles of his boots gripped the rod he managed to steady himself and dove over the top of the post avoiding the microwaves he landed in a somersault his shoulders back and hips absorbed his impact so did the rainsoaked ground he cringed from pain however still tender from the injuries hed sustained six months ago ignoring the protest in his muscles he came smoothly out of his roll and crouched to study the near crest of the slope it was haloed by faint light made misty by the rain no sign of guards in a careful rush he put the clamp and rod back into his knapsack along with the infrared goggles he no longer needed he aimed his voltmeter and microwave detector and proceeded higher at the top he lay on soggy ground and studied his target arc lights dimmed by the rain illuminated a lawn fifty yards away a sprawling white mansiona concatenation of cubes and domes that imitated the houses in the town of mykonos attracted his attention except for the arc lights on the corners of the building and a light in a far left window the mansion was dark his photographs had not been detailed enough to let him know if closedcircuit television cameras were mounted above the doors but he had to assume they were present although in this storm the cameras would relay murky images and at three am the guard who watched the monitors would not be alert as savage charged toward the mansion he saw a camera above the door hed chosenon the right farthest from the lamp in the window on the opposite side of the building the camera made him veer even farther right rushing toward the door obliquely clutching a canister that hed taken from his knapsack when he reached the door darting from the side he raised the canister and sprayed the lens of the camera the canister held pressurized water its vapor coating the cameras lens as if a gust of rain had lanced against the house the streaks of dripping liquid would impair but not eliminate the cameras murky image thus troubling the guard who watched the monitor but not compelling him to sound an alarm savage picked the doors locka good lock a dead bolt but freed in twelve seconds still he didnt dare open the door instead he removed a metal detector from his knapsack and scanned the doors perimeter metal on the upper right four feet above the doorknob made his earphone wail another intrusion detector savage understood the principle a magnet within the door kept a metal lever in the doorframe from rising toward a switch that would signal an alarm if the door was opened to defeat the alarm savage removed a powerful horseshoe magnet from his knapsack and pressed it upward against the doorframe while he gently shoved the door open his magnet replaced the magnet within the door and prevented the lever in the frame from rising toward the contact switch as he squeezed through a gap in the door he slid his magnet farther across the doorframe then eased the door shut before he removed the magnet now the doors own magnet prevented the lever from rising he was in but he didnt dare relax joyce stone had described the mansions layout having memorized the floor plan savage proceeded tensely along a dark hallway he studied an opening to his left and saw an illuminated clock on an oven the kitchen was spacious fragrant with the lingering smells of oil and garlic from the evenings meal passing a counter he entered a shadowy dining room its rectangular table long enough to seat fifteen guests on each side as well as the master and his wife at each end but papadropolis was not in residence a member of savages surveillance team had reported that papadropolis and an entourage of guards had flown on the billionaires private plane to crete this morning the tyrants departure had been an unexpected gift of the fates not only had papadropolis lessened the number of guards at the mansion but those who remained would feel a lessened sense of duty so savage hoped hed soon find out at a farther doorway he halted hearing muffled voices three men down a stairwell on his left laughter echoed upward sure savage thought theyre happy to be dry and warm he continued through the shadows entering a murky living room halfway across he heard a chair creak and ducked behind a sofa the sound came through an archway ahead holding his breath he crept nearer and saw the glow from a rainmisted light outside two barred windows each window flanked the mansions front door and in the vestibule another glowred from a cigaretterevealed a guard in an alcove on the far side of the door savage raised a pistol its projectiles werent bullets but tranquilizer darts and its front and rear sights had been tipped with infrared paint that allowed him to aim in the dark its luminous specks visible only through his goggles the weapon made a muffled spit at once savage moved as quickly as the need for silence allowed crossing the vestibule grabbing the guard as he slumped from a chair and more important grabbing the guards uzi before it clattered onto the marble floor he set the guard behind his chair and folded his legs to make sure they didnt project from the alcove with the uzi slung across his shoulder savage studied the top of a curving staircase a light up there indicated a hallway that joyce stone had described shifting his gaze from the vestibule toward the corridor above him then once more toward the vestibule he slowly ascended at the top he pressed against the left wall and peered cautiously through the archway toward the right along the illuminated corridor he couldnt see the corridors end but so far he hadnt glimpsed a guard rachel stones bedroom was in that direction however and he took for granted that a sentry would be watching her door he risked leaning farther into the archway to get a better view of the corridor still no guard at last he had to show his head his view of the hallway complete a guard in a chair at the end the man read a magazine having revealed himself gradually savage used equal care to shift back out of sight lest sudden motion attract the guard would there be a corresponding sentry at the opposite end of the corridor savage stepped softly toward the right side of the archway and peered with greater caution along the left flank of the corridor or started to a noise alerted him a gun being cocked there was a guard on the left flank of the corridor savage aimed reflexively his weapon spat the guard on the left stumbled backward his eyes already losing focus as he pawed at the dart protruding from his throat the guards knees buckled savage prayed that the mans cocked handgun wouldnt discharge when it hit the floor at the same time he pivoted into the corridor and fired at the guard on the right this guard had seen his counterpart stagger backward reacting to the commotion hed dropped what he was reading and grabbed his pistol he began to surge out of his chair savages gun spat yet again its dart struck the mans left shoulder though the man tried desperately to aim his pistol his eyes rolled upward he toppled the thick carpet had muffled the noise of the falling bodies or so savage prayed pulse hammering he hurried to the right toward the door to what joyce stone had told him was her sisters room he tested the knob it was locked he suspected that the bolt could not be freed from inside but only from this side after picking the lock he scanned the doorframe with his metal detector but found no sign of an intruder alarm urgently entered and shut the door the bedroom was luxurious but savage barely noticed its expensive furnishings as he scanned them in search of rachel stone a bedside lamp was on the bed had been slept in its rumpled covers had been thrown aside but the room was deserted savage checked beneath the bed he peered behind closed draperies finding bars on a window then searched behind a settee and a chair where the hell was she he opened a door found a bathroom and turned on the light the shower door was closed when he looked inside the stall was empty where he tried another door a closet dresses rachel stone lunged through the dresses scissors glinted savage clutched her wrist an instant before shed have stabbed his left eye bastard her angercontorted features suddenly changed to a frown of surprise noticing savages black camouflagegreased face she struggled backward who savage clamped a hand across her mouth and shook his head as he yanked the scissors from her grasp his lips formed silent words dont talk he pulled a card from his pocket the card was sealed in transparent waterproof plastic she stared at its dark handprinted message your sister sent me to get you out of here he turned the card revealing a further message this room might have hidden microphones we mustnt talk she studied the card and him subdued her suspicion and finally nodded he showed her another card get dressed were leaving now but rachel stone didnt move savage flipped the second card your sister told me to show you this to prove she sent me he held up a wedding ring its diamond enormous this time when rachel stone nodded she did so with recognition and conviction she grabbed for a dress in the closet but savage squeezed her arm to stop her shaking his head he pointed toward jeans a sweater and jogging shoes she understood with no hint of embarrassment she removed her nightgown savage tried to ignore her nakedness directing his attention toward the door through which guards might any moment charge hurry he silently pleaded his pulse hammered faster glancing again in her direction he was too preoccupied to dwell on the jeans she tugged up over smooth sensual thighs and silken bikini panties that revealed her pubic hair no savages attention was directed solely toward two otherthe most significantaspects of her appearance one rachel stone though ten years younger than her sister looked like joyce stones twin tall thin angular intense blue eyes a superb oval face its magnificent curves framed by spectacular shoulderlength hair there was one difference joyce stones hair was blond whereas rachels was auburn the difference didnt matter the resemblance between older and younger sister remained uncanny two while joyce stones face was smooth and tanned rachels was swollen and bruised in addition to repeatedly raping his wife papadropolis had beaten her making sure his fists left marks that couldnt be concealed humiliate that was the tyrants weapon subdue and dominate not any longer savage thought for the first time he felt committed not just professionally but morally to this assignment rachel stone might beprobably had beenspoiled by luxury but nothing gave anyone the right to brutalize her okay papadropolis savage thought i started this for me to prove myself but ill end this to get at you you son of a bitch his skull throbbed with anger turning from the door he saw that rachel stone was now dressed he leaned toward her ear his whisper almost soundless conscious of her perfume take the few things you absolutely need she nodded with determination and leaned close to him her words as soft as her breath ill give you anything you want just get me out of here savage headed toward the door with the grace of a dancer rachel stone rushed soundlessly down the stairs in the shadowy vestibule savage touched her arm to guide her toward the living room intending to reach the hallway near the kitchen and leave the mansion through the same door hed used to enter but she twisted away from his grasp her long lithe legs taking her quickly toward the front door savage rushed to stop her before she opened the door and triggered an alarm but she didnt reach for the door instead for a switch above it and savage understood abruptly that despite her compulsion to escape she retained sufficient presence of mind to deactivate the alarm she opened the door rain lashed beneath a balcony savage followed her onto wide white steps and gently shut the door feeling exposed by a misty arc light he turned to give her instructions she was gone racing past pillars down the steps into the storm no he ran to catch up to her christ doesnt she realize there might be guards out here she cant just scramble over a fence shell trip an alarm the rain was stronger than when hed entered the mansion and colder but though he shivered he knew that some of the moisture streaming down his face was sweat from fear he reached her about to tackle her intending to drag her toward the cover of a large statue to his left at once he changed his mind she wasnt fleeing at random rather she stayed on a concrete driveway that curved in front of the mansion constantly heading toward the right she reached a short lane that intersected with the driveway at the end of the lane a stormshrouded arc light revealed a long narrow singlestory building with six large doors of a type that opened upward the estates garage that was her destination they could hide behind it while he explained how he planned to get her past the sensors gaining speed savage flanked her his voice low but forceful follow me toward the back but she didnt obey and instead lunged toward a door on the side of the garage in view of the mansion she twisted the knob it didnt budge she sobbed jesus its locked we have to get in backout of sight she kept struggling with the doorknob come on savage said he spun toward a shout from the mansion a guard charged out the front door pistol raised scanning the storm oh shit savage thought a second man charged out savage hoped that the rain was too dense for the men to see the garage then a third man charged out and savage knew the entire guard force would soon be searching the grounds no choice he said your ideas lousy rachel but right now i cant think of anything better stand back rain drenched him as he frantically picked the lock when he opened the door rachel shoved past him reaching for a light switch he managed to shut the door just in time before the sudden illumination would have attracted the guards he faced a long row of luxury cars is it too much to hope you brought keys i can hotwire one of these cars but itll take me a minute and thanks to you we dont have that much time rachel darted toward a mercedes sedan the keys are already in them what no thief would dare to steal from my husband then why was the door locked isnt it obvious no to stop me from taking a car if i somehow got out of the house as they spoke savage ran after her toward the mercedes but she got behind the steering wheel and slammed the drivers door before he could stop her she twisted the ignition key shed predicted would be in place the cars finely tuned engine purred acrid exhaust spewed into the garage at once she pressed a button on a remote control attached to the dashboard a rumble reverberated the door ahead of the mercedes slid smoothly upward savage barely managed to open the passenger door and scramble inside before she stomped the accelerator his head snapped back he slammed the door shut an instant before it would have smashed against the garage exits frame you almost left me behind i knew youd manage but what if i hadnt rachel spun the steering wheel to the left and skidded down the lane away from the garage a brief glare from an arc light revealed her braised swollen face she pressed harder on the accelerator and spun the steering wheel again this time to the right toward the driveway that led away from the mansion before he could put on his seat belt savage was jerked in the direction of her steering what if you hadnt got into the car before i sped away rachel asked ive got the feeling youre resourceful and ive got the feeling youre a bitch my husband calls me a bitch quite a lot i apologize hey dont get sentimental on me i need a savior who kicks ass no what you need right nowsavage reached toward the controls and pressed a switchis to turn on your windshield wipers i told you youre resourceful savage glanced all around seeing guards try desperately to intercept the car they carried weapons but didnt aim them why it didnt make sense then it did theyd be glad to blow my brains out savage thought theyd get a bonus but they dont dare shoot for fear of hitting papadropoliss wife in that case the guards themselves would not be shot papadropolis would feed them to the sharks as savage stared forward lightning flashed and in the stark illumination he saw a man on the driveway ahead the man held a rifle and like the other guards he refused to raise it and fire unlike the others he held up a powerful flashlight aiming its fierce beam toward the drivers side hoping to blind rachel and force her off the road rachel jerked up a hand to shield her eyes and steered toward the man with the flashlight the guard jumped out of the way his leap so smooth that savage wondered if hed had gymnastic training landing safely on savages side of the car the guard continued to aim the glaring flashlight and that too didnt make sense the guard couldnt hope to blind rachel from the side then the logic was obvious the guard directed the flashlight not toward rachel but savage to get a good look at me so he can describe me to papadropolis and maybe someone can identify me savage quickly covered his face with his hands at the same time he slumped in case the guard decided to risk a shot at the passenger window the moment the car sped past the guard savage stared backward other guards ran down the road from the mansion every light was on in the house silhouetting the guards in the night and the rain the man whod aimed the flashlight stood with his back to the house scowling toward the mercedes the flashlight had prevented savage from seeing his opponents face but now as the man shut the beam off a further bolt of lightning revealed the guards features the glimpse was imperfect because rain streaked down the back window because savages vision had not fully recovered from the glare of the powerful flashlight because the mercedes was speeding away from the man but savage saw enough the guard was oriental his deft leap away from the carhad it been due to gymnastic training as savage had first suspected or to expertise in martial arts four seconds that was all the time savage had to study the man the lightning died the night concealed but four seconds had been enough the man was in his midthirties five feet ten inches tall trim and solid looking he wore dark slacks a matching windbreaker and turtleneck sweater his brown face was rectangular his rugged jaw and cheekbones framing his stern handsome features oriental yes but savage could be more specific the man was japanese savage knew the mans nationality as certainly as his four seconds of shocked recognition had made him shudder at the eerie resemblance the man bore to savage didnt want to think it akira no impossible but as the mercedes sped farther from the mansion savage analyzed his brief impression of the guard and the major detail about the man wasnt his wiry frame or his stark rectangular features no the major detail was the melancholy behind the intensity on the japanese sentrys face akira had been the saddest man savage had ever met it couldnt be in shock savage pivoted toward rachel she supposedly was in his custody but her hysteria controlled her youll never get through the gate just watch me she increased speed but the gates made of steel its reinforced so is this car armorplated grab the dashboard when we hit the gate the mercedesll be a tank ahead guards scrambled away the chain link gate loomed quickly with a jolting concussion the sedan crashed through the barrier savage swung to stare through the raindrenched rear window seeing headlights pursuing them he brooded with terrible certainty the man who drove the car would look impossibly like akira did i scare you rachel chuckled not at all then why do you look so pale it could be ive just seen a ghost savage had planned several ways to get rachel off the island under ideal circumstances theyd have rushed to a motorcycle that a member of savages team had hidden among rocks on a slope a halfkilometer away from there theyd have had a choice of three widely separated coves in each of which a small powerful boat was waiting to speed them to a fishing trawler that circled the island one of the contingencies savage had to worry about was the weather while hed invaded the estate the storm had been to his advantagethe harder it rained the better hed been concealed but hed hoped that the storm would lessen during the evacuation and instead it had strengthened the wind would be too powerful the sea too rough for a boat to take them to the fishing trawler which itself would be in danger and need to seek shelter of course savage never based a plan merely on the chance that the weather would improve even if the forecasts were in his favor one of his scouts had found a secluded cave in which they could hide till conditions permitted them to use a boat savage hadnt worried about dogs following their scent for papadropolis had a phobia about dogs and refused to have them on his property but even if there had been dogs the rain would have impaired their sense of smell savage took into account that guards might find the boats in the coves so hed arranged for a helicopter to be waiting on the neighboring island of delos all he had to do was signal it with a radio transmitter in his pack and the chopper would rush to pick them up at a prearranged rendezvous but suppose the weather stayed bad and the chopper couldnt fly suppose papadropoliss men were in the rendezvous area pursued savage had no opportunity to get rachel to the cave that left him with one final variation in his plan the most desperate alternative ahead the road soon forks turn left he said but thatll take us northwest toward mykonos savage nodded the village is a labyrinth well be trapped before we can hide i dont plan to hide savage stared back toward the headlights enlarging in rapid pursuit akira no it couldnt be what do you mean you dont plan to hide what will we heres the fork do what i tell you turn left when theyd crashed through the gate the concrete driveway had become a dirt road the rain had softened the dirt the heavy armorplated mercedes sank into muddy puddles tires spinning rear end fishtailing the car struggled forward at least the pursuing car will have the same trouble we do savage thought then he noticed that farther back the headlights of other cars had joined the chase the mushy road had slowed the mercedes to thirty kilometers an hour even then rachel had trouble controlling the steering wheel and keeping the car from sliding into a ditch as she obeyed instructions and took the left fork satisfied for now you drive well by the way trying to bolster my confidence it never hurts savage said but i wasnt lying my husband lies to me all the time how do i know that im not because your safety depends on me and if you couldnt control this car id insist on trading places with you compliment accepted frowning with concentration she managed to increase speed savage stared again toward the headlights behind him they werent gaining the trouble was they werent receding either my husband hired fools when they had the chance back there they werent smart enough to shoot at the tires it wouldnt have mattered i dont understand the tires on a car this heavy are reinforced they can take a shotgun blast or a bullet from a fortyfive and still support the car a gust of wind shook the car rachel almost veered off the road voice trembling she asked what happens when we get to mykonos if we get to mykonos pay attention to the moment they reached the village of ano mera at this late hour the village was dark asleep the mercedes gained speed on its rockslabbed road too soon with the village behind them the route became muddy again and rachel eased her foot off the accelerator savage exhaled rachel misinterpreted am i doing something wrong no i was worried that the guards would have phoned ahead to warn the men your husband pays to watch for strangers passing through the village toward his estate we might have faced a roadblock youve done your homework i try but theres always something the risk of an unknown threat knowledge is power ignorance finish what do you mean ignorance is death i think the headlights are gaining on us i noticed in my rearview mirror talking helps me not to be afraid if they catch us you wont be harmed until my husband returns to beat me again before he rapes me but youll be killed then why are you helping me how much did my sister pay you it doesnt matter keep your eyes on the road savage said if we get to mykonos its only eight kilometers aheadfollow my instructions exactly then you do have a plan i had several but this is the one im forced to use i repeat savage glanced toward the pursuing possibly gaining headlightsyour life depends on total obedience do everything i say when my husband gives me orders i resent it but when you give me orders im ready to follow you to hell lets hope you dont have to prove it their headlights gleamed off cubeshaped houses brilliantly white even in the rainswept darkness mykonos rachel pressed her foot harder onto the accelerator no savage said too late the sudden increased speed caused the mercedes to hydroplane on the mud the car veered sideways spun twice the steering wheel useless savages stomach twistingand crashed against a fence at the side of the road rachel rammed the gearshift into reverse tromping the accelerator again stop savage said but the worst had been done instead of easing away from the fence toward the road rachel had made the car slip sideways onto a mound of earth that snagged the cars drive shaft propping it up the tires spun not on mud but air the car was useless two people wouldnt be strong enough to push it off the mound the pursuing headlights loomed closer rachel scrambled out of the car savage rushed to join her his boots sank and slid in the mud he almost lost his balance but managed not to fall as rachel did lose her balance he caught her kept a tight grip on her arm and urged her forward the sensation was that of a nightmare racing through mud and yet staying in place but they stubbornly gained momentum before them the white cubeshaped houses enlarged as the headlights behind them magnified at once the nightmare of running in place concluded rock slabs beneath savages boots made him feel as if a cable that restrained him had snapped he and rachel shot forward the solid street providing traction the moment they entered the village savage realized that the mercedes would have been useless anyhow the street they ran along was narrow winding it forked the angles so sharp and confining that the mercedes could not have maneuvered with any speed hearing the engines of the pursuing cars savage chose the left tangent and hurried along it suddenly confronted by two more tangents dismayed he knew that no matter which direction he took thered soon be other tangents the maze of mykonos the streets arranged in a labyrinth a means of confusing pirates in antiquity of making it easy for villagers to trap marauders or for presentday hunters to trap their quarry behind him savage heard slamming car doors angry voices urgent footsteps echoing along a street he studied the tangents before him the one to the left veered upward the other down his choice was inevitable he had to keep moving toward the harbor guiding rachel he fled to the right only to discover that the street soon angled upward its taking us back to where we started savage pivoted forcing rachel to retrace her steps except for the gusting rain and the angry voices of their hunters the village was silent only the white of the houses occasional lights in windows and sporadic flashes of lightning helped savage to see his way he found a lane hed failed to notice when hed passed this way earlier the lane led downward so constricting that his shoulders brushed against the walls he emerged on a wider lane horizontal so flat that he couldnt tell which direction might eventually lead downward but clattering footsteps to his left made him nudge rachel and charge to the right this time when the lane ended there was only one exit to the right and that led upward no we have to keep aiming toward the harbor savage spun staring along the lane theyd just taken the footsteps and curses of the guards sounded closer flashlights blazed at the end of the lane one guard turned to another his beam revealing the face of the second guard the second man was the japanese even at a distance he still reminded savage disturbingly of akira the japanese grabbed the first guards arm and shoved the flashlight away from his face they rushed along the lane in savages direction they havent seen us yet but they will savages boot struck an object at the side of the lane a ladder lay against a wall half of which had a fresh coat of white he braced it against the wall rachel scurried up as savage followed he saw the flashlights checking doorways and alleys rushing closer on the roof he pulled the ladder up it scraped against the wall the flashlights aimed toward the noise savage was blinded when a beam revealed him he ducked back yanking the ladder with him hearing the distinctive muffled report of a pistol equipped with a silencer a bullet zipping past his ear an instant later he was out of sight from the lane he almost set the ladder down but quickly changed his mind rachel grab the other end awkward they strained to hurry with the ladder across the roof lurching to a stop when a gap before them revealed another lane in the distance savage saw murky lights in the rainswept harbor let go of the ladder he swung it over the gap setting the far end on the other roof propping the near end securely rachel started to crawl across but the ladders rungs were slick with rain and her knee slipped a leg falling through she dangled gasped raised her knee to the ladder and crawled again savage steadied the ladder he stared toward the gap below himno flashlights although he did hear shouts he glanced behind him toward where he and rachel had used the ladder to climb the wall no one appeared on the rim rain gusted against his eyes he squinted toward rachel managing to see her on the opposite roof flat he pulled himself along the ladder its moist rungs easing his way helping him to slide on the other roof he stood and swung the ladder toward him they struggled with it toward a farther gap between buildings moving lower into the village closer to the harbor when he crossed the next gap after rachel did savage stared behind him a flash of lightning made him flinch as a head appeared on top of a wall the head belonged to the japanese savage recalled the glint of a sword the abruptly the japanese scrambled upright another man joined him raising a pistol aiming at savage the japanese lost his balance on the rainslicked roof but the japanese had moved so gracefully at the mansion it didnt seem likely he could ever lose his balance nonetheless he fell against the man with the pistol deflecting his aim the shot went wild the man with the pistol toppled backward with a wail he plunged off the roof the japanese stared down at him then charged after savage and rachel his movements once again graceful hell have to stop savage thought he cant get past the two gaps we crossed dont kid yourself if this is akira hell find a way but you know he cant be akira frantic savage picked up the ladder as rachel assisted savage glanced again toward the japanese expecting him to halt when he reached a lane between roofs instead the japanese increased speed and leapt his nimble body arcing through the rain his arms outstretched as if gliding he landed on the opposite roof bent his knees rolled to absorb the impact and in the same smooth motion sprang to his feet continuing to race burdened with the ladder savage and rachel struggled toward another lane but this time instead of bracing the ladder across the gap savage lowered it against a wall as rachel scurried down savage turned dismayed to see the japanese leap across another gap guards shouted nearby savage scrambled down the ladder and tugged it away from the wall so the japanese couldnt use it the lane sloped down to the right he and rachel sprinted along it behind him savage heard frenzied footsteps the japanese charging toward the side of the roof hell dangle from the rim and drop savage thought maybe hell hurt himself like hell hes a cat the lane ended savage faced another horizontal street so level he couldnt decide which direction would take them closer to the harbor a light from a window reflected off water on the street heart pounding savage noticed that the water flowed toward the left he ran with rachel in that direction shouts echoed behind him footsteps charged closer flashlights blazed ahead an alley on the right led steeper downward away from the flashlights the closer he and rachel came to the harbor the more the village narrowed forming a bottleneck toward the sea savage knew hed reach fewer tangents fewer risks of making the wrong decision and heading inadvertently upward away from his objective but he had to assume that his pursuers understood where he was going theyll try to get in front of us he prayed that the guards were as baffled by the maze as he was amid the curses behind him and the blaze of flashlights on his flanks he heard a single set of pursuing footsteps the japanese as if a nightmare had been dispelled savage broke from the village from its confines and confusion his way now was clear across the beach along the dock no enemy awaited him beside him rachel breathed hoarsely stumbling on the verge of exhaustion keep trying savage urged its almost over god i hope she gasped for what this is worthsavage breathedim proud of you you did fine his compliment wasnt cynical shed obeyed him with style and strength but his encouragementno doubt the only positive words shed been told in quite a whiledid the trick she mustered her deepest resources and ran so hard she almost passed him i meant what i said she gasped ill go with you to hell the yacht one of several was moored near the end of the dock savages final option if the boats in various coves had been discovered if the fishing trawler had been forced to retreat due to hazardous weather if the helicopter couldnt take off from nearby delos and pick them up at the rendezvous site the last possibility was a yacht that a member of his team had left in the mykonos harbor savage sprang aboard released the ropes that secured it to posts raised the hatch above the engine and grabbed the ignition key taped beneath the deck he slid the key into the switch on the vessels controls swelled with triumph when the engine rumbled pushed the accelerator and felt a satisfying surge as the yacht sped away from the dock thank you rachel hugged him get down on the deck she instantly complied as the yacht churned away from the dock raising waves dwarfed by the greater waves of the storm savage scowled behind him the force of the sea made the yacht thrust up and down but despite his confused perspective savage saw a man rush along the dock the japanese beneath a light at the end of the dock his features remained as melancholy as akiras he showed other emotions as well confusion desperation anger most of all fear that didnt make sense but there wasnt any doubt the orientals strongest emotion was fear savage the voice was strained obscured by the gusting storm akira savages yell broke strangled by waves that splashed his face filling his mouth making him cough on the dock other guards rushed beside the japanese they aimed pistols toward the yacht but didnt dare fire aware of the risk of hitting their clients wife their faces were rainswept portraits of desperation the japanese shouted but i saw you the storm erased his next frantic words saw me savage yelled i saw you savage couldnt allow himself to be distracted he had to complete his mission and urged the yacht from the harbor die the japanese screamed rachel peered up from the deck you know that man savages hands cramped around the yachts controls his pounding heart made him sick he felt dizzy in the village hed predicted that the japanese would leap down from the wall like a cat yes like a cat savage thought with less than nine lives know him he told rachel as the yacht fought stormy waves to escape the harbor god help me yes the wind i cant hear you i saw him die six months ago executive protection six months ago savage had been working in the bahamas an uneventful babysitting job that involved making sure the nineyearold son of a us cosmetics manufacturer didnt get kidnapped while the family was on vacation savages research had made him conclude that since the family had never been threatened his assignment was really to be a companion to the boy while the parents abandoned him in favor of the local casinos in theory anyone could have served that function but it turned out the businessman made frequent racial slurs against the local population so savage assumed that the supposed potential kidnappers had a skin color darker than his employers in that case why hed wondered had the businessman chosen the bahamas at all why not las vegas probably because the bahamas sounded more impressive when you told your friends youd spent two weeks there savage had disapproved but hadnt shown it his job after all wasnt to like his client but instead to provide security and besides despite his aversion to his employer he enjoyed the boys companionship extremely while never allowing himself to be distracted from his duties hed taught the boy to windsurf and scuba dive with the businessmans money hed chartered a fishing boatcaptained by a bahamian native to savages rebellious delightand never baiting a hook had shown the boy the graceful majesty of leaping sailfish and marlin in short hed behaved like the father that the endearing boys actual father should have been when the boy had flown back to atlanta with his family savage had felt empty well hed thought youve got this consolation not every jobs as pleasant as this one hed remained in the bahamas for three more days swimming jogging hardening his muscles a vacation for himself but then his habitual compulsion to work had taken control hed phoned one of his several contacts a restaurateur in barcelona whod received a call from a jeweler in brussels who passed the word that if savage was available his agent would be pleased to speak with him savages agent graham barkersmythe the englishman whod trained him had his home in a renovated carriage house in an elegant brickpaved lane in new york city a halfblock from washington square as graham liked to say at midnight i can hear the junkies howl graham was fiftyeight overweight from too much champagne and caviar but in his lean youth hed been a member of the british militarys elite commando unit the special air service and after leaving the military a protective escort to several prime ministers eventually his civil servants income had been unacceptable compared to the guardians fees he could earn in the private sector america had offered the richest opportunities this was after president kennedy was shot then martin luther king then robert kennedy assassination was the major fear of anyone in power of course the secret service had cornered the market on highlevel politicians so i chose to deal with prominent businessmen theyve got the bucks and after the terrorists hit in the seventies i made a bleeding fortune despite his twenty years in america graham still retained his english accent though his vocabulary had become an intriguing mixture of american and british expressions some of the businessmen i protectedgraham pursed his lipswere no more than ruffians in brooks brothers suits an elegant front no class not like the aristocrats i used to work for but this is what i learned a protector has to repress his ill opinions about his employer if you allow disapproval to control you youll unconsciously make a mistake that might kill your client youre saying a protector should never disapprove of a client its a luxury if we worked only for those of whom we approved wed seldom work everyone has imperfections however i do adhere to minimum standards i would never help drug dealers arms merchants terrorists mobsters child molesters wife beaters or members of militant hate groups i would never be able to repress my disgust enough to protect them but unless youre confronted by unmistakable evil you dont have a right to judge your client of course you can still turn him down if the fee he offers is insufficient or the job too dangerous because were tolerant doesnt mean we have to be schmucks pragmatism adapt to circumstances graham always enjoyed these philosophical discussions and despite his heart doctors orders indulged in lighting an enormous cigar the smoke from which hovered above his bald head did you ever wonder why i accepted you as a pupil i assumed because of the training id received in the seals that training was impressive no doubt about it when you came to me i saw a strong young man accustomed to the stress of lethal conditions a commendable background promising unrefined however i might even add crude now dont look insulted im about to give you a compliment i grant that the seals are among the best commando units in the world though my own sas is of course in a class by itself grahams eyes twinkled but the military insists on strict obedience whereas an executive protector isnt a follower but a leader or more exactly a protector exists in a delicate stasis with his employer commanding yet obeying allowing the client to do what he wants but insisting on how he does it the relationship is known as symbiosis savage responded dryly im familiar with the word give and take graham said a protector requires the skills of a military specialist agreed but he also must have the talents of a diplomat and above all a mind the latteryour mindis what attracted me you left the seals because i disagreed with what happened in grenada yes the us invasion of that tiny caribbean island its been several years since you approached me but if my memory hasnt failed the date of the invasion was october twentyfive nineteen eightythree your memory never fails as a briton im instinctively precise six thousand us soldierscoordinated units of rangers marines seals and eightysecond airborne paratroopersattacked grenada their mission to rescue one thousand american medical students held captive by soviet and cuban troops supposedly held captive you sound as angry as the day you came to me you still feel the invasion wasnt justified for sure thered been trouble on the island a coup had deposed the prime minister but he was procuban and the man who replaced him was marxist different shades of red the coup caused civil unrest a hundred and forty protesters were shot by local soldiers and the former prime minister was assassinated but the american medical students stayed in their compoundnone of them was injured basically two communist politicians had fought each other for power why americans were studying medicine on a procuban island i dont know but the coup hardly threatened the balance of power in latin america what about the cuban east german north korean libyan bulgarian and soviet technical advisors on the island many of whom were actually soldiers an exaggeration of us intelligence i saw only local soldiers and cuban construction workers sure when the invasion began the cubans grabbed rifles and fought as if theyd had military training but what young man in cuba hasnt had military training and the tenthousandfoot airstrip being constructed capable of accommodating longrange bombers what i saw was less than half that long suitable for commercial flights to bring in tourists the invasion was show business the us looked impotent when iran took our embassy personnel hostage in seventynine reagan defeated carter because he vowed hed act decisively if americans were threatened again just after the grenada coup an arab terrorist drove a truckload of explosives into the us marine barracks in warravaged lebanon two hundred and thirty peacekeeping soldiers were killed in the blast what happened in lebanon was obscene but did reagan retaliate in that region no because the mideast situations too complicated so what did he do to save face he ordered american forces to attack an easy target to rescue supposed american hostages in the caribbean but the american public perceives grenada as a blow for freedom an important us victory against a communist threat in the western hemisphere because reporters were restricted from the invasion the only reports came from the military in civilian life its called lying in politics its called disinformation yes graham said disinformation exactly the word i was waiting for as i said what attracted me to you was your mind your ability to step back from your military conditioning recognize the truth and think independently why was your reaction so bitter you know that already i was part of the first team to hit the island we parachuted from a transport plane other chutes brought us rafts because we had to infiltrate the island from offshore but the navy misjudged the weather the wind was stronger than predicted at night the waves were so fierce we couldnt see the rafts a lot of usa lot of my friendsdrowned before we reached the rafts died bravely yes in the service of their country in the service of a moviestar president who sent us needlessly into combat so hed look like a hero so with disgust you refused to reenlist in the navy despite the fiftythousanddollar incentive the military offered you however a disaffected navy seal a topoftheline excommando could have asked a huge fee from mercenary recruiters i didnt want to be a mercenary no you wanted dignity you had the wisdom to understand your true vocation not a soldier but a protector graham leaned back behind his spacious mahogany desk puffing his cigar with satisfaction though corpulent he wore impeccably tailored clothes that minimized his bulk a gray pinstripe suit and vest a subdued maroon tie and a subtle blue handkerchief tucked perfectly into the chest pocket of his suitcoat the tie and the handkerchief should never match he always insisted instructing savage about the proper way to dress if a distinguished client had to be escorted to a semiformal occasion wear clothes to match your surroundings but never choose a suit thats more elegant than your clients proper dress had been only a small part of what graham taught savage about the rules of executive protection the occupation was far more complex than savage had imagined when he first came to graham in the fail of though to savages credit he had not assumed that his extensive experience with one of the finest military units in the world had been all the preparation he would need quite the contrary savages commando training had taught him the value of admitting what he didnt know of thoroughly preparing himself for a mission knowledge is power ignorance is death that was why hed come to graham in the first placeto dispel his ignorance and learn from a worldclass expert about the refinements of his newly chosen profession weapons savage required no instruction in that regard there wasnt a weaponfirearms explosives ballpoint pens or piano wirethat savage couldnt use proficiently but what about surveillance techniques savages training had been to assault not follow and bug detection savages experience with bugs was limited to diseasebearing pests in jungles not miniature microphones implanted in telephones lamps and walls and evasive driving savage had never evaded an objective hed always attacked and as far as driving was concerned he and his unit had always been transported to whichever plane or ship would take them to their target driving was something he did for fun in a rented corvette to take him from bar to bar while on leave fun graham had winced ill cure you of wanting that and conspicuous vehicles are forbidden as for bars youll drink only in moderation a distinguished wine while eating for example and never when on assignment do you smoke savage did not anymore how can you notice a threat to a principal a what a principal in the profession you claim you wish to enter a client is called a principal an appropriate word for your principal is your mainyour exclusiveconcern how can you notice a threat to your principal when youre busy fumbling to light a cigarette you think i contradict myself because i smoke a cigar i indulge myself now that ive given up protecting in favor of teaching and arranging for my students to find employment for an agents fee of course but you how can you protect a principal when your hand is compromised by a cigarette yes i can see you have a great deal to learn then teach me first you must prove youre worthy how why did you choose to be a bodyguard an executive protector a bodyguard is a thug a protector is an artist why did you choose this profession accustomed to the demeaning shouts of his navy instructors savage hadnt felt angry at grahams outburst instead hed humbly sorted through his instincts trying to verbalize his motivation to be useful graham had raised his eyebrows not an inferior response elaborate theres so much pain in the world then why not join the peace corps savage had straightened because im a soldier and now you want to become a protector a member of the comitatus ah i see youre unfamiliar with the term no matter youll soon understand for ive decided to accept you as a student return to me a week from now read the iliad and the odyssey well discuss its ethics savage hadnt questioned this seemingly irrelevant assignment he was used to obeying yes but he sensed that grahams command was not a mere test of his discipline but rather the beginning of a new kind of knowledge a skill that would make his previous trainingas superb as it was seem a minimum requirement for the greater demands of what graham eventually told him was the fifth and most noble profession after the iliad and the odyssey graham had insisted on discussing other classics that merged military and executiveprotection skills you see tradition and attitude are paramount there are rules and codes ethics and yes aesthetics in time ill teach you tactics for now youll learn a beautiful devotion to your principal but as well an unrelenting obligation to control him this relationship is unique perfectly balanced a work of art it was graham who made savage read the anglosaxon account of the loyal comitatus who fought to the death to defend their masters corpse from the ravaging vikings at the battle of maldon and it was graham who introduced savage to the remarkable japanese factbecomelegend of the fortyseven ronin who avenged their insulted dead lord by beheading their masters enemy and in victory obeyed the shoguns command to disembowel themselves codes and obligations i have an assignment for you graham said why so solemn is it dangerous actually its fairly routine except for one thing graham told him the clients japanese savage said why does that make you frown ive never worked for a japanese that intimidates you savage thought about it with most other nationalities im able to take for granted common elements of culture it makes the job easier but the japanese i dont know enough about them theyve adopted a lot of american ways clothes and music and because of the us occupation after the war they wanted to please the victors but their habit of mind the way they think thats unique and im not just talking about the difference between the orient and the west even the communist chinese to give one example think more like westerners than the japanese do i thought you said you didnt know anything about the japanese i said i didnt know enough about them that doesnt mean i havent studied them i knew one day id be asked to protect a japanese i wanted to be prepared and are you prepared ill have to think about it youre afraid savages pride made him tense of what that you can be a comitatus but not a samurai amae graham cocked his head im not familiar with the word its japanese it means the compulsion to conform to a group yes and so im puzzled omote and ura public thoughts and private thoughts a traditional japanese never reveals what he truly believes he always says what he thinks the group will accept i still dont the japanese caste system the absolute command of masters over retainers in premodern times the order was shogun to daimyo to samurai to farmer to merchant to untouchables those who butchered animals or tanned hides apart from that hierarchy the emperor existed with little power but great authority the descendant of the japanese gods that rigid system was supposedly erased by the democratic reforms of the us occupation but it still persists my compliments what as usual youve done your research keep listening savage said how am i supposed to protect a man who wants to conform to a group but wont tell me what hes thinking and who secretly believes hes better than his inferiors which in this case is me add to that the japanese habit of avoiding favors because they impose an obligation to repay those favors in greater degree and add to that the japanese habit of feeling mortally insulted whenever an underling assumes authority i still dont everything youve taught me comes down to thisa protector must be both servant and master a servant because im employed to defend a master because im obligated to insist that my employer obey my instructions a balance you said an artistry of giveandtake then tell me how im supposed to fulfill my obligation to a principal who wont reveal what hes thinking who cant stand being obligated to an underling and who wont take orders its a dilemma no doubt i agree but you still recommend i accept this assignment for purposes of education savage glared at graham and abruptly laughed you are a bastard consider it a challenge a broadening of your skills youve succeeded so farcommendably nonetheless you havent achieved your full potential ignorance is death to become the best you must learn the most and the samurai tradition offers the greatest opportunities i suggest you immerse yourself much further in the culture of your principal does the fee he offers make the effort the challenge worthwhile you wont be disappointed it more than compensates for giri graham said surprising savage by his mentors knowledge of that essential japanese word the burden of obligation to your master and to anyone who does you a favor even if the assignments uneventful my friend you wont be bored a dingy drizzle fell from a sootcolored sky it sprayed off the greasy tarmac forming a dirty mist that beaded against the dusty windows of laguardia airport savage sat in a crowded american airlines concourse and watched a dc approach an arrival dock he periodically scanned the confusion of activity around him on guard for potential danger sensing none of course an enemy skilled in surveillance would not allow himself to attract attention so savage remained alert whats the principals name hed asked graham muto kamichi the japanese put their family name first their given name last the formal term of respectsan instead of mister applied not to the family name but to the given name and came after the given name thus the principal would be addressed as kamichisan he arrives in new york tomorrow graham had added after going through immigration and customs in dallas the purpose of his visit graham had shrugged come on is he a businessman a politician what graham shook his head ura those private thoughts you so rightly noted the japanese cherish the principal prefers to keep his intentions to himself savage breathed out sharply thats exactly why im reluctant to take the job if i dont know at least the general reason for his visit how am i supposed to assess the risks he might face a politician has to fear assassination but a businessmans biggest worry is being kidnapped each risk requires a different defense of course but ive been assured that the threat potential is extremely low graham said the principal is bringing his own security one escort clearly if he were worried hed bring others what he wants you to do is be his driver and stand in for his escort when the escorts sleeping a simple assignment five days work ten thousand dollars in addition to my agents fee for a driver hes overpaying he insists on the best the escort his name is akira only one word he follows the practice i recommended to you and uses a pseudonym so an enemy cant trace his public name to his private identity thats fine but is he effective from all reports extremely equivalent to you language wont be a problem by the way both of them speak english fluently savage was only partially reassured is it too much to hope that the principals willing to confide in me enough to tell me beforehand where ill be driving hes not unreasonable and indeed you will be driving some distance graham looked amused hes authorized me to give you this sealed envelope of instructions the dc reached the concourse its engines stopped shrieking friends and relatives hurried toward the arrival door eager to meet their loved ones savage assessed and dismissed them studying observers on the sidelines still no sign of a threat he moved toward the fringe of the waiting crowd as usual it took a frustrating minute for the docking to be completed at once the empty ramp was filled with surging passengers exuberant hugs of reunion kisses of affection savage once again studied his surroundings everything seemed normal he directed his attention toward the exit ramp now came the test his principal and his escort had flown first class the extra fare meant not only bigger seats anxioustoplease attendants better meals and unlimited free cocktails which the escort should decline but the privilege of entering and leaving the jet before the standardfare customers early boarding was a plus getting quickly through a possible danger in the crowd but exiting early facing a crowd and its unstudied risks was a liability a professional escort would insist that his principal wait until most passengers left the plane avoid commotion maintain maximum order so savage felt encouraged when he saw no orientals among the rolexandgoldbracelet dressedtoimpress firstclass travelers who marched past the crowd their power briefcases clutched severely their chins thrust high many wore expensive cowboy boots and stetsons to be expected since this dc came from dallas where an earlier from japan had landed evidently the japanese passengers on the transpacific had either stayed in dallas or taken connecting flights to cities other than new york savage waited more caucasians more exuberant reunions the surge of passengers became a trickle an american airlines attendant pushed an aged woman in a wheelchair through the arrival door in theory the dc was empty in theory savage glanced behind him the waiting crowd had dispersed at the same time another crowdimpatienthad boarded several departing planes this section of the concourse was almost empty an airport custodian emptied ashtrays a young couple looked dejected because theyd been too low on a waiting list for openings due to canceled reservations no threat savage turned again toward the exit door a japanese man appeared dressed in dark slacks a dark turtleneck sweater a dark windbreaker midthirties trim but not slight no suggestion of muscles but a definite suggestion of strength wiry supple his movements smooth graceful controlled economical no needless gesture like a dancerwho knew martial arts for the tips and the sides of his hands had calluses typical of someone with karate training equally telling his hands were unencumbered no briefcase no carryon bag just a handsome japanese five feet ten inches tall with brown skin short black hair strong jaw and cheekbones that framed his rectangular face and laserlike eyes that assessed every aspect of what he approached this would be akira and savage was impressed on equal terms an enemy would be foolish to confront this man even on terms to the enemys advantage savage was so accustomed to dealing with inferior protectors that he almost smiled at the thought of working with an expert behind akira another japanese emerged from the ramp late fifties slightly stooped carrying a briefcase blue suit protruding stomach streaks of gray in his black hair sagging brown cheeks a weary executive but savage wasnt fooled the second japanese could probably straighten his shoulders and tuck in his stomach at will this man would be muto kamichi savages principal and evidently he too had martial arts training for like akira but unlike any other principal savage had ever worked for the tips and sides of kamichis hands had calluses savage had been instructed to wear a brown suit and paisley tie to identify him as kamichi and akira approached he didnt offer to shake hands the gesture would have compromised his ability to defend instead he chose the japanese custom and bowed slightly the two japanese maintained impassive expressions but their eyes flickered with surprise that this westerner was familiar with japanese etiquette savage hadnt intended to obligate them still he suddenly realized that the dictates of their culture forced them to respond though their bows were less than savages akiras just a bob of the head as he continued to survey the concourse savage gestured politely for them to follow proceeding down the concourse he watched travelers ahead while kamichi stayed behind him and akira followed no doubt glancing frequently around the moment savage had seen his principal hed raised his right hand to the outside of his suitcoat pocket and pressed a button on a batterypowered transmitter a radio signal had been sent to a receiver in a vehicle that one of savages associates had parked in the airports ramp as soon as the associate heard the beep hed drive from the ramp to rendezvous with savage the group reached the end of the concourse and descended stairs toward the commotion of the baggage area weary expassengers hefted suitcases off a conveyor belt impatient to get outside and into taxis savage assessed the harried crowd but didnt go near its risky confusion instead he gestured again this time toward a sliding door kamichi and akira went with him unconcerned about their luggage good savage thought his initial impression had been accurate these two understood correct procedure they emerged on a busy sidewalk beneath a concrete canopy beyond the drizzle persisted the temperature high for april was sixty degrees a moist breeze felt tepid savage glanced to the left toward approaching traffic reassured to see a dark blue plymouth sedan veering toward the curb a redhaired man got out came quickly around to the curb and opened the rear passenger door just before kamichi got in he handed the redhaired man several luggage receipts savage approved that the principal was experienced enough to perform this menial service rather than requiring akira to relax surveillance by reaching into his windbreaker pocket to get the receipts savage slid behind the steering wheel pressed a button that locked all the doors then fastened his seat belt meanwhile the redhaired man went for the luggage because kamichi and akira had taken a prudent length of time to get off the plane their suitcases would almost certainly be on the conveyor belt by now a safe efficient arrival one minute later the redhaired man finished placing three suitcases in the plymouths trunk and shut the lid instantly savage drove from the curb checking his rearview mirror noticing his associate walk toward a taxi savage had paid him earlier the man would take for granted that savage couldnt permit distraction by saying thanks savage himself took for granted that since the two japanese had behaved so knowledgeably about security they understood why hed chosen a car that wasnt ostentatious and wouldnt be easy to follow not that savage expected to be followed as graham had said the risk level on this assignment was low nonetheless savage never varied his basic procedure and the plymouthseemingly no different from othershad modifications bulletproof glass armor paneling reinforced suspension and a supercharged v engine as windshield wipers flapped and tires hissed along the wet pavement savage steered smoothly through traffic left the airport complex and headed west on the grand central parkway the envelope graham had given him was in his suitcoat but he didnt refer to its contents having memorized his instructions he couldnt help wondering why kamichi had rejected newarks airport in favor of laguardia the drive would have been shorter less complicated because although savages immediate route was toward manhattan his ultimate destination forced him across the northern tip of the island then west through new jersey into pennsylvania kamichis logic the purpose of the mazelike itinerary eluded him at five the drizzle stopped amid the congestion of rush hour traffic savage crossed the george washington bridge he asked his principal if hed care to enjoy some sake which having been heated was in a thermos the temperature not ideal but acceptable kamichi declined savage explained that the plymouth was equipped with a telephone if kamichisan required it again kamichi declined that was the extent of the conversation until twenty miles west on interstate where kamichi and akira exchanged remarks in japanese savage was competent in several european languages a necessity of his work but japanese was too difficult for him its complex system of suffixes and prefixes bewildering because kamichi spoke english savage wondered why his principal had chosen to exclude him from this conversation how could he do his job when he couldnt understand what the man hed pledged to protect was saying akira leaned forward at the next exit youll see a restauranthotel complex i believe you call it a howard johnsons please stop to the left of the swimming pool savage frowned for two reasons first akira had remarkably specific knowledge of the road ahead second akiras english diction was perfect the japanese language made no distinction between r and j akira though didnt say prease and howald johnsons his accent was flawless savage nodded obeying instructions steering off the highway to the left of the swimming pool where a sign said closed a balding man in a jogging suit appeared from behind a maintenance building considered the two japanese in the plymouths rear seat and held up a briefcase the briefcasemetal with a combination lockwas identical to the briefcase that kamichi had carried from the plane please akira said take my masters briefcase leave the car and exchange one briefcase for the other savage did what he was told back in the car he gave the lookalike briefcase to his employer my master thanks you akira said savage bowed his head puzzled by the exchange of briefcases its my purpose to serve arigato thank you in response to his thank you my master commends your politeness returning to interstate savage checked his rearview mirror to see if he was being followed the vehicles behind him kept shifting position good it was dark when he crossed the mountainflanked border from new jersey into pennsylvania headlights approaching in the opposite lanes allowed him to study the image of his passengers in his rearview mirror the grayhaired principal seemed asleep his slackjawed face tilted back his eyes closed or perhaps he was meditating but akira sat ramrod straight on guard like his master his face did not reveal his thoughts his features were stoic impassive akiras eyes though expressed the greatest sadness savage had ever seen to someone familiar with japanese culture savages conclusion might have seemed naive for the japanese by nature tended toward melancholy savage knew stern obligations imposed on them by complex traditional values made the japanese watchful and reserved lest they unwittingly insult someone or place themselves in anothers debt in premodern times hed read a japanese would hesitate to tell a passerby that hed dropped his walletbecause the passerby would then feel honorbound to supply a reward much greater than the value of the contents of the wallet similarly savage had read ancient accounts in which someone whod fallen from a boat and thrashed in a river in danger of drowning had been ignored by people on shorebecause to rescue the victim would be to inflict upon that victim an obligation to repay the rescuer again and again and again forever in this ephemeral earthly existence until the rescued victim was granted the gift of rescuing the rescuer or else had the privileged release from obligation by dying as the gods had intended at the river before the rescuer intervened shame and duty controlled the japanese personality devotion to honor compelled them but often also wearied them peace could be elusive fatigue of the spirit inescapable ritual suicideseppukuwas on occasion the only solution savages research made him realize that these values applied only to uncorrupted unwesternized japanese those whod refused to adapt to the cultural infection of americas military occupation after the war but akira gave the impression of being both uncorruptible and despite his knowledge of american ways an unrelenting patriot of the land of the gods even so the emotion in his eyes was more than the usual japanese melancholy his sadness was seared to the depths of his soul so dark so deep so black so profound an expanding wall of repressive ebony savage felt it the plymouth was filled with it at eleven a country road wound through nightshrouded mountains leading them to a town called medford gap kamichi and akira again exhanged comments in japanese akira leaned forward at the towns main intersection please turn left savage obeyed driving from the lights of medford gap he steered up a narrow winding road and hoped he wouldnt meet another vehicle coming down there were very few places to park on the shoulder and the spring thaw had made them muddy dense trees flanked the car the road angled higher veering sharply back and forth the plymouths headlights glinted off banks of lingering snow ten minutes later the road became level its sharp turns now gentle curves ahead above hulking trees savage saw a glow he passed through an open gate steered around a clump of boulders and entered an enormous clearing fallow gardens flanked him spotlights gleamed revealing paths benches and hedges but what attracted savages attention was the eerie building that loomed before him at first he thought it was several buildings some made of brick others of stone others of wood they varied in height five stories three four each had a different style a town house a pagoda a castle a chalet some had straight walls others were rounded chimneys turrets gables and balconies added to the weird architectural confusion but as savage drove closer he realized that all of these apparently separate designs were joined to form one enormous baffling structure my god he thought how long must it be a fifth of a mile it was huge none of the sections had doors except for one in the middle where the road led to wide wooden steps and a porch upon which a man in a uniform waited the uniform with epaulets and gold braids reminded savage of the type that bellmen wore at luxury hotels abruptly he saw a sign on the porchmedford gap mountain retreatand understood that this peculiar building was in fact a hotel as savage stopped at the bottom of the stairs the man in the uniform came down toward the car savages muscles hardened why the hell werent my instructions complete i should have been told where wed be staying this place on a mountaintop totally isolated with just akira and me to protect kamichi no explanation of why we came here no way to control who comes and goes in a building this huge its a security nightmare recalling the mysterious exchange of briefcases savage turned to kamichi to tell him that ura private thoughts might be wonderful in japan but here they gave a protector a royal pain and what the hell was going on akira intervened my master appreciates your concern he grants that your sense of obligation gives you cause to object to these apparently risky arrangements but you should understand that except for a few other guests the hotel will be empty and those guests too have escorts the road will be watched no incident is expected im not the primary escort savage said you are with respect though yes im disturbed do you agree with these arrangements akira bowed his head darting his profoundly sad eyes toward kamichi i do what my master wills as must i but for the record i dont like it the stalker savage struggled to control the yacht in the storm the heavy rain combined with the night made it almost impossible for him to see the harbors exit only periodic flashes of lightning guided him glancing urgently behind him he frowned toward the galeshrouded white buildings of mykonos and the murky arc light at the end of the villages dock the guards whod chased him and rachel from papadropoliss estate continued to stare helpless enraged toward the yacht escaping through the turbulent water afraid of shooting lest they hit their masters wife despite the gloomy distance one guard in particular attracted savages full attention handsome wiry brown skinned his eyes the saddest savage had ever seen the japanese savage the man had shouted racing to a halt at the end of the dock akira impossible the guards charged back along the dock the japanese lingered glaring toward savage then rushed to follow the guards darkness enveloped them the yacht tilted shoved by the wind waves spewed over the side lying on the deck rachel peered up you know that man a flash of lightning revealed her bruised swollen face her drenched jeans and sweater clung to her angular body savage studied the yachts illuminated controls thunder shook the overhang he felt sick but not because of the churning sea akiras image haunted him know him god help me yes the wind i cant hear you i saw him die six months ago a wave thrust his shout down his throat i still cant rachel crawled toward him grabbed the console and struggled to stand it sounded like you said i dont have time to explain savage shivered but not from the cold im not sure i can explain go below put on dry clothes a huge wave smashed against the yacht nearly toppling them secure every hatch down there make sure nothings loose to fly around strap yourself into a chair another wave slammed the yacht but what about you i cant leave the bridge do what i say go below he stared through the rainswept window above the controls straining for a glimpse of something anything he felt motion beside him glanced to the right and saw rachel disappearing below rain kept lashing the window a fierce blaze of lightning suddenly revealed that hed passed the harbors exit ahead all he saw was black angry sea thunder rattled the window night abruptly cloaked him port and starboard were meaningless bearings forward and aft had no significance in the rage of confusion around him he felt totally disoriented now what he thought where are you going he checked the console but couldnt find the yachts navigation charts he didnt dare leave the controls to search for them and suddenly realized that even if he found them he couldnt distract himself and study them with no other recourse he had to depend on his research the nearest island was delos he remembered to the south where hed arranged for a helicopter to wait in case his primary evacuation plan had failed and he and rachel needed an airlift from mykonos delos was close six miles but the island was also small only one and a half square miles he might easily miss it and risk being swamped before he reached the next southern island twentyfive miles away the alternative was to aim southwest toward an island flanking delos that island rhineia was larger than delos and only a quartermile farther it seemed the wiser choice but if i miss it unless the weather improves well sink and drown he studied the illuminated dial on the compass and swung the wheel lighting waves heading southwest through chaos the yacht tipped over a crest and plummeted toward a trough the force of the impact nearly yanked savages hands from the wheel and threw him onto the deck he resisted and straightened at the same time seeing a light pierce the dark to his right a hatch opened rachel climbed stairs from the underdeck cabin she wore a yellow slicker presumably shed obeyed savage and also put on dry clothes ignoring his own risk hed worried that the cold rain would drain her body heat and put her in danger of hypothermia her shoulderlength auburn hair clung drenched to her cheeks i told you to stay below shut up and take this she handed him a slicker in the glow from the instrument panel savage saw the determined blaze in her eyes and put on this dry shirt and sweater you stubborn i know about hypothermia savage squinted at the clothes and the slicker then peered up toward her bruised intense face all right youve got a deal no argument what a surprise well im surprised by you can you take the wheel have you piloted a yacht before just watch me she grabbed the wheel he hesitated but a bonedeep chill forced him to relinquish his grip keep the compass positioned as is our bearings southwest in a corner beneath the overhang partly sheltered from the rain and the waves he rushed to change clothes and at once felt new energy grateful to be warm and dry protected by the slicker he took the wheel and checked the compass directly on course good he planned to tell her so but a wave struck the yacht cascading over them rachel started to fall savage gripped her arm supporting her she caught her breath what did you mean i surprised you when i work for the rich theyre usually spoiled they expect me to be a servant they dont understand how much their lives depend on you hey my dignity depends on you id still be back in that prison begging my husband not to rape me again if you hadnt rescued me id still be his punching bag as lightning flashed and savage again saw the swollen bruises on rachels face he shuddered with rage i know it doesnt help to hear it but im sorry for what youve been through just get me away from him if i can savage thought he stared toward the convulsing sea my husbands men i doubt theyll chase us blindly in this storm in their place id wait till it ended then use helicopters where are we going delos or rhineia assuming the compass is accurate depending on the current and where do we go after quiet what let me listen for what all i hear is thunder no savage said thats not thunder she cocked her head and suddenly moaned oh jesus ahead something rumbled waves savage said hitting rocks the rumble intensified closer and closer a deafening roar savages hands cramped on the wheel his eyes ached straining to penetrate the dark assaulted by bomblike concussions his ears rang he urged the yacht northward away from the breakers but the force of the wind and the waves shoved the yacht sideways relentlessly toward the continuous boom he struggled to escape the yacht listed pushed by the eastwardheaving current tilting westward water gushed onto the deck im afraid well go over savage said brace yourself but rachel darted toward the underdeck cabin no he said you dont understand i saw life vests what you should have told me earlier thats the first thing we should have abruptly she emerged from the hatch handing him a flotation device strapping on her own the yacht tilted sharper deeper westward toward the boom water cascaded over the portside gunwale filling the deck listing it farther westward hang on to me savage shouted the next wave hit like a roc two time out of mind obstacle race scavenger hunt they couldnt use the athens airport that was the obvious place for papadropoliss men to look the only other international airports were salonica several hundred kilometers to the north and corfu equally far to the northwest no doubt those sites would be watched as well papadropolischronically impatientwould automatically consider the most rapid form of travel even if reaching the latter two airports was timeconsuming the subsequent option was to drive from greece but that would be an ordeal to reach safety savage akira and rachel would first have to drive north to yugoslavia a country four times as large as greece then west through the extensive mountains of northern italy and finally south through france to the island principality controlled by rachels sister off the côte dazur the best way seemed by boat even someone with papadropoliss wealth couldnt arrange to put every grecian port under surveillance though he would have his men check those near athens of course as well as the motorrail terminals in the area so savage akira and rachel drove toward patrai four hours away on the western coast of greece there they briefly considered bribing a fisherman to smuggle them across to italy but could the fisherman be trusted to violate international boundaries rather than report them to the authorities legal transportation seemed safest all the same im skeptical akira said it was nine oclock at night he stood with savage and rachel in a murky alley scanning traffic and pedestrians outside a ticket office next to a ferry on a brightly lit pier granted its faster than driving but its not as fast as flying which weve agreed isnt smart savage said that ticket office could be as risky as an airline terminal no question ill check it out they know im caucasian and possibly guess im american but i can pass for a european a japanese though theyd spot you at once ten minutes later savage came back i didnt see any surveillance that doesnt mean there isnt any savage shrugged in agreement handing akira and rachel their tickets my assumption is theyd watch the ferry as well as the ticket office or watch on the ferry akira said a limited area a captive group that works the other way around wed have a better chance of spotting them akira thought about it yes how long till we reach italy rachel asked nineteen hours what the ferry makes two stops up the coast before it cuts across the adriatic savage said the fact that its slow appeals to me papadropolis wont expect us to choose a method that takes us so long to escape we leave in fifty minutes wed better get back to the car savage and rachel drove to the pier joining a line of cars and small trucks waiting to pass through customs and onto the ferry in italy thered be customs officials as well but the greeks inspected luggage leaving the country to insure that ancient artifacts werent being smuggled out though a customs station wasnt as stringent as immigration passports would have to be shown passports savage had retrieved his from a safedeposit box in athens akira never went anywhere without his own in a waterproof pouch but rachels passport had been kept by papadropolis another way for him to exert control the usual solution to the problem would have been for rachel to go to the us embassy explain that shed lost her passport and apply for a new one but the process might take days and rachel didnt have other documents to prove she was a us citizen more to the point papadropolis would assume that shed need a passport and order the us embassy watched an alternative solution was for savage to arrange to get rachel a bogus passport the trouble was that rachels face had a multitude of bruises even cosmetics couldnt disguise them when an official compared the photograph on the passport to the woman standing before him her bruises would so nearly match those in the picture it would be obvious that the photograph had been taken less than a day ago that the passport was forged savage hadnt known about rachels bruises before he went in to rescue her but his professional habits had prompted him to establish a contingency plan in case she couldnt get her hands on her passport joyce stone had shown him photographs of her sister savage had been struck by the eerie resemblance between the two women as if they werent just sisters but twins though rachel was ten years younger so hed told joyce stone to return to her island empire and to use her authority to insist that her passport not be stamped when she arrived a messenger had then brought joyce stones passport back to savage in athens as a consequence there wasnt any evidence that joyce stone had ever left greece comparing the photograph in the passport to the younger sisters face savage had once again been struck by the eerie resemblance with two exceptions joyce stone was blond whereas rachels hair was auburn and joyce stone continued to look like a movie star whereas rachel looked like a battered wife i can take advantage of those contrasts savage had thought at the farmhouse near athens hed given rachel dye to change her hair from auburn to blond and now that he drove the car toward the customs official in the ferry depot he glanced toward rachel shaking his head in wonder the blond hair made rachel look amazingly like her sister and paradoxically the bruises contributed to the illusion making her look older the customs official searched the car no suitcases just these handbags rachel said in keeping with savages instructions passports please savage and rachel handed them over akira would soon board the ferry separately on foot so the three of them wouldnt be conspicuous together joyce stone the official glanced up from the passport staring at rachel surprised i apologize i didnt recognize im a fan of your movies but my bruises you mean they look so painful theyve ruined perfection what terrible a traffic accident near athens my deep regrets my countrymen are clumsy drivers no it was my fault thank heaven neither he nor i was seriously hurt i reimbursed the man for repairs to his car and paid his medical bills the official straightened your majesty is extremely kind even with your injuries youre as beautiful as in your movies and as noble may i ask a favor im your humble fan she reached for his hand dont tell anyone im aboard normally i appreciate the attention of admirers ive retired but i havent forgotten my responsibilities to those with memories long enough to recall my career your magnificence will always be remembered but not when i look like this people will say im ugly beautiful youre very kind rachel continued to grasp his hand but there might be photographers on board if you enjoyed my films i worshiped them then please dont destroy their memory rachel gave his hand a squeeze and released it the official stepped back obviously youre not smuggling ancient artifacts by all means instruct your driver to proceed aboard thank you rachel rewarded him with a gracious smile savage drove toward the ferry youre a better actress than your sister he murmured very very good hey i always envied my sister she said her lips barely moving she always did better but now when im scared ive got the guts to prove im better youll get no argument savage parked the car on the ferry now we wait for akira but twenty minutes later akira still hadnt joined them as the ferry left the dock stay in the car savage told rachel shoulders tensing he got out and scanned the shadowy spaces between the rows of cars the hold stank of oil and exhaust fumes the other vehicles were deserted their passengers having climbed to the upper decks to sleep or to buy refreshments and admire the moonlit water and the lights along the coast the holds metal floor vibrated from the muted rumble of the ferrys engines still no sign of akira ive changed my mind savage said get out stand next to me if anything happens run therell be security guards upstairs stay close to them rachel hurried toward him is something wrong im not sure yet savage kept scanning the hold but akira should have joined us by now unless hes being extracautious checking the passengers maybe or else he found trouble despite the surrounding cars savages spine tensed from feeling exposed he made it a rule never to try to cross an international border with a firearm true the checkpoints in many countries had lax procedures and handguns made mostly from plastic didnt register on an xray machine especially when disassembled but savages weapon had been an allmetal magnum revolver and it couldnt be taken apart except for its cylinder more though greece and italy had attempted a conciliatory attitude toward terrorists the fanatics had taken advantage of their hosts goodwill and committed further atrocities greece and italy had strengthened security at their borders accordingly savage and akira had dropped their handguns down a sewer before they reached the ferry depot but now savage dearly wished he hadnt done so footsteps echoed on metal a man emerged down a stairway savage hoped it would be akira no the man was caucasian savage felt as if arms crushed his chest abruptly he exhaled the man wore a uniform a member of the ferrys crew he studied the cars in the hold then focused on savage and rachel im sorry sir no passengers are permitted down here right my wife forgot her purse we had to come back for it the crewman waited until savage and rachel passed him as the man walked across the hold savage concentrated on the top of the stairs theres supposed to be safety in numbers isnt there rachel said trying to sound confident not succeeding so lets join the crowd and find akira just remember savage said your husbands men dont know what i look like and theyre searching for a woman whose hair is auburn not blond but i cant disguise these bruises if you lean on the railing prop your chin in your hands and study the water in the dark no one will notice your face ready she trembled for a second then nodded just hold my hand the ferry was large capable of transporting six hundred passengers above the hold a b and an a deck contained cabins and rows of reclining seats savage had rented one of the cabins but until he discovered what had happened to akira he couldnt risk using it and being trapped continuing to climb the stairs approaching the main deck he heard numerous voices a babble of accents and languages a sea breeze cooled his clammy forehead he squeezed rachels shaky hand and stepped through a hatch at once a swarm of passengers passed him bumping jostling rachel flinched savage put an arm around her guiding her away from lights toward the nightshrouded railing the moment she leaned on her elbows resting her face in her hands he pivoted toward the crowd where was akira the ferry had a promenade area that rimmed a middeck restaurant and a bar through windows savage saw passengers clustered at tables akira where the hell was akira five minutes ten savages stomach writhed but though desperate to search he didnt dare abandon rachel not even in the cabin hed rented from the mass of caucasians an oriental proceeded along the deck akira two of them he whispered approaching savage glanced toward the restaurant then turned toward the sea apparently oblivious to the japanese who passed him lead them around once again savage murmured when he turned from the railing akira had disappeared into the crowd two men followed their suitcoats too small for their muscular chests their expressions grim savage wondered if they were decoys intended to make their quarry realize he was being followed while other members of the surveillance team watched akiras reaction that was possible but the two men werent clumsy and akira wasnt the target rachel was and as long as akira ignored the men behind him they couldnt be sure theyd found the japanese they were looking for so unless they captured akira and questioned him theyd have to wait to see if akira rendezvoused with a caucasian man and woman then regardless of rachels change in hair color theyd know theyd found their targets so what do we do savage wondered play hideandseek all over the ferry pulse speeding he scanned the crowd alert for anyone who showed interest in rachel and him when akira strolled past the second time and the same two men followed at a careful distance savage concluded that they were alone but that still didnt solve the problem jesus how do we deal with them the simplest method would be to let akira keep leading them around until the promenade was deserted the passengers asleep then savage could try to stalk the stalkers incapacitate them and throw them over the side but was the surveillance pair under orders to use the ferrys seatoshore telephones to call their superiors and make reports at regular intervals even if theyd found nothing in the seals that was basic strategy if a team failed to check in at its scheduled time their commander would first conclude that the team had logistical problems and been forced to rash toward a safe location if the team persisted in not reporting the commander would then conclude that the team had been captured or else been killed maybe preventing these men from checking in would tell papadropolis where to focus his search as savage analyzed the problem a corollary disturbed him suppose theyd already made their report what if theyd told their superiors that theyd spotted a japanese who might be akira in that case papadropolis would order additional men to board the ferry tomorrow morning when it made its first stop farther up the greek coast at igoumenitsa too many unknowns but the present situation couldnt be allowed to continue something had to be done through a window savage saw akira in the restaurant sitting at a table dipping a tea bag into a cup the two men watched unobtrusively from a distant table one of the men said something the other nodded the first man got up leaving the restaurant through a door on the opposite side of the ferry savage straightened rachel lets go but where are i dont have time to explain he led her through the crowded smokefilled bar beside the restaurant peered out toward the promenade on the opposite side of the ferry and saw the man standing at a row of phones the man inserted a credit card into one of them and pressed a sequence of numbers rachel lean against this railing the same as before savage quickly walked toward the man stopped next to him and picked up a phone we dont know yet the man was saying he sensed savage beside him turned and scowled savage pretended not to notice going through the motions of making a call yes japanese the man said he fits the description but we werent given many specifics age height and build arent enough to be sure hi dear savage said to the phone he held hed pressed numbers at random and was getting a busy signal i just wanted to let you know i managed to catch the ferry out of patrai then make sure the man asked how the yeah we dock in italy tomorrow afternoon at five savage said question him the man scowled again at savage unable to speak as freely as he wanted but if it is him i thought the point was to see if he contacted his associates from what ive heard about this man the two of us wont be enough to persuade him to cooperate im looking forward to seeing you dear savage said to the phone yeah that ideas a whole lot better send more negotiators no everything went fine i saw every client on my list savage said to the phone they gave me some very large orders corfu the man sounded baffled but thats the second stop why cant they board at igoumenitsa yeah okay i see that if the teams already at corfu s dock and the airport they might as well stay in place besides theres no way for them to get off the island at this hour theyd never be able to cross the channel from corfu to igoumenitsa in time to meet the ferry i love you too dear savage said to the phone right ill see you at nine tomorrow morning the man said if anything develops in the meantime ill let you know the man hung up and returned to the restaurant savage replaced his phone and walked toward rachel in the darkness along the railing change of plans he said i dont understand she said im not sure i do either savage frowned im still working out the details at one am the promenade was almost deserted most of the passengers had gone to the sleeping areas on the lower decks though a few still remained in the bar and the restaurant one of those in the restaurant was akira hed ordered a meal and taken so long to savor every mouthful that his two watchdogs still sitting at a corner table had begun to look conspicuousand looked as if they knew they looked conspicuous any moment they might decide to find a less exposed vantage point from which to study their prey its time savage told rachel while shed been standing out of sight from the restaurant window hed periodically glanced inside for all he knew he had begun to look conspicuous yes he thought definitely time youre sure thisll work rachels voice shook no but its the only plan i can think of that doesnt exactly fill me with confidence youll do fine keep telling yourself its another chance to prove youre a better actress than your sister im too terrified to care hey impress me get in there savage smiled and nudged her she studied him returned his smile breathed deeply and entered the restaurant from the darkness at the railing savage watched the two men they glanced toward rachel and almost dropped their coffee cups in contrast akira kept eating with deliberate calm rachel sat beside him akira put down his knife and fork as if she was exactly the person hed expected to see he said something then said something else leaning toward her she responded elaborated and gestured toward the lower decks he shrugged and nodded in the background the man whod made the earlier phone call stood and left the restaurant savage was waiting in shadows when the man his eyes bright with victory veered toward the row of phones a quick glance right and left showed savage that there werent other passengers on the promenade he grabbed the mans left arm thrust his right leg upward and threw him overboard the fall was five stories the water would have felt like concrete the man was too surprised to scream savage spun toward the window remaining in darkness in the restaurant akira stood paid his bill and left with rachel on the opposite side of the ferry the watchdog hesitated seeming to wonder how soon his partner would return from making the phone call but the watchdog couldnt allow akira and rachel to get out of his sight savage knew as expected the man rose hurriedly threw money on the table and followed savage proceeded along the deserted promenade it wasnt necessary for him to get to the other side of the ferry and track the stalker after all he knew where the man was going taking his time he descended the stairs to the a deck had to take his time it was imperative that akira and rachel reach the cabin savage had rented imperative that the watchdog see them go in hear the lock shut and realize he had to rush to tell his partner where their masters wife was hiding as savage pretended to stumble drunkenly toward the bottom of the stairs he groped in his pockets apparently unable to find the key to his cabin the watchdog darted toward him frantic to return to the main deck and locate his partner savage punched him in the stomach chopped the side of his callused hand across the mans jaw and lugged the unconscious to all appearances intoxicated man along the deserted corridor knocking three times on the door of the cabin the door inched open room service savage said the cabin was small starkly furnished with a bureau a top and bottom bunk a tiny closet and a washroom designed for two occupants it provided little room for the four of them to move around while rachel locked the door akira helped savage set the unconscious man on the bottom bunk working quickly they used the mans belt to secure his hands behind his back and bound his ankles together with his tie they searched him and satisfied themselves that he hadnt risked bringing a weapon through customs hes awfully pale rachel said his jaw its so swollen the stress in her voice made savage turn he suddenly realized that this was the first time shed seen the effects of violence on someone other than herself and his breathing sounds dont worry savage said i didnt hit him hard enough to really hurt him he ought to wake up soon lets see if we can encourage him akira brought a glass of water from the bathroom and dribbled it onto the mans face the mans eyes flickered and slowly focused when he saw savage akira and rachel staring down at him he struggled to stand only to realize in panic that his hands and feet were tied lie still savage said dont be stupid and shout for help your friend isnt able to hear you wheres he fell overboard savage said you son of a bitch the man said we have a proposition akira said wed like you to enjoy a good nights sleep and in the morning make a phone call for us youre not going to kill me thats always a possibility akiras eyes expressed greater melancholy wed appreciate your cooperation so you dont join your ancestors needlessly ancestors is that some kind of japanese thing if you wish to call it that yes akiras lips formed a thin bitter smile a japanese thing what kind of phone call the ferry reaches igoumenitsa at seven tomorrow morning after it continues to corfu youll call your superiors and tell them we spotted you and your partner youll tell them we panicked and drove from the ferry at igoumenitsa were escaping eastward inland toward ioannina on route nineteen but all of us will really be on the ferry on its way to corfu the man asked precisely the reinforcements that would have boarded the ferry at corfu will then be diverted the man became suspicious and then what what happens when we get to corfu we continue toward italy our plans arent your concern i mean what the hell happens to me why should i make the call you killed my partner what stops you from killing me you have our word you wont be harmed akira said the man laughed your word hey give me a break your word means shit as soon as im no use to you im dead you cant afford to let me live to tell papadropolis where youve really gone akiras eyes blazed my word does not as you put it mean shit the man swung his head toward savage look you and i are both americans that ought to count for something damn it dont you understand my problem savage sat beside him on the bunk of course on the one hand youre worried that well kill you after you make the phone call and we dont have further use for you on the other hand youre worried that papadropolis will kill you if he discovers you helped us escape he wont care if you acted practically in order to save your life from his point of view you betrayed him hell punish you severely so youve got a problem i agree but the issue you have to face is whether you prefer to die now instead of later and have no doubt if you refuse youll join your partner in the sea akira said we do have other ways to escape the trap then for christs sake use them but what would we do with you savage asked right now papadropolis isnt our worry you are so what are you going to do about that the man darted his frightened eyes from savage toward akira back toward savage and finally stared at rachel mrs papadropolis dont let them i hate that name she said dont call me that ill never use it i never want to hear it again my last name is stone miss stone please dont let them kill me you turned pale when you found out this mana nod toward savage killed my partner youll feel worse if you let him kill me youve seen me up close youve talked to me my names paul farris im thirtyfour im a security specialist not an assassin ive got a wife and daughter we live in switzerland if you let these men murder me even if you dont see them do it youll feel guilty for the rest of your life rachels brow furrowed she swallowed nice try but we searched you before you woke up savage said we went through your wallet your names not paul farris its harold trask the only true thing in what you said is your age rachel dont get sentimental about him you think im dumb enough to carry real id when im working the man asked the people i investigate if they knew who was after them they might hunt down my wife and kid to get even its a sure bet the two of you dont use real id either convincing akira said but beside the point you still didnt solve your problem even if rachel told us not to kill you it wouldnt matter her life isnt at risk if papadropolis found her or she decided to return to him never rachel said id never go back to him her husband would beat her no doubt with increased viciousness but he wouldnt kill her he would kill us if we knew who we were and managed to catch us so to silence you would be selfdefense make up your mind savage said will you cooperate i call my superiors then you let me walk away we already promised that the man debated apparently im forced to a reasonable man akira said the mans eyes became calculating even so im getting impatient ill need an extra incentive money dont press your luck savage said rachel interrupted pay him savage turned to her frowning hes taking a risk she said my husband will be furious if he thinks this man lied thats right miss stone ill have to take my wife and daughter and disappear for a while itll be expensive if you even have a wife and daughter savage said how much a quarter million youre dreaming then make it two hundred thousand the man said ill make it fifty thousand and youll be grateful but how do i know you have it savage shook his head in disgust do you have a choice the man paled dont make me impatient savage said all right the man swallowed youve got a deal theres just one other matter youre impossible akira said no listen i need you to help me think of a way to stop papadropolis from coming for me well sleep on it savage said the least you can do is untie my feet and hands no what id like to do is gag your mouth akira said i have to go to the bathroom akira raised his hands in exasperation i dont think i can tolerate this man till tomorrow morning the look on your face rachel started laughing it was ten after seven the following morning as the ferry left the small town of igoumenitsa heading west toward the island of corfu savage akira and rachel stood tensely beside the man while he made the phone call savage kept a tight grip on his arm listening to what he told his superiors hey i know its a mess you dont need to tell me but damn it its not my fault my partner followed too close the japanese spotted him just before we docked at igoumenitsa the japanese ran it took us a while to find him by then the american and mrs papadropolis were with him they must have been sleeping in one of the cabins hey what was i going to do knock on every door and say mrs papadropolis are you in there the japanese was obviously the decoyto check if the ferry was being watched if everything looked safe theyd have continued to corfu the man stopped talking savage heard someone shouting from the other end of the phone no we couldnt stop them before they drove off the ferry the man continued more shouting from the other end hey im telling you its not my fault my partners so scared about fucking up he ran he figures papadropolis will kill him the man winced the shouts so loud he held the phone away from his ear well its his ass not mine im still on the job but its damned hard chasing them on my own i barely caught up to them before they left igoumenitsa heading east on route nineteen why didnt i phone you sooner how was i going to do that and not lose sight of them i wouldnt even be calling now if they hadnt stopped for gas im in a restaurant down the street i can see them through the window they dont realize im wait a minute shit theyre about to leave look i think theyre headed for loannina the yugoslavian borders less than an hours drive north from there tell everybody to watch the border crossings christ theyre driving away cant talk anymore ill check in later sounding breathless the man slammed down the phone savage released his arm the prisoner wiped his sweaty brow he leaned against the phone and trembled okay extremely believable akira said and now the man looked apprehensive as if savage and akira might kill him after all we relax and enjoy the cruise akira said you mean it you fulfilled your part of the bargain the man exhaled and straightened i think i got papadropolis off my back theyll be looking for my partner whom theyll never find akira said yes it seems your worries are over and ours rachel said no one will be waiting for us at corfu theyll try to intercept us on the way to yugoslavia where we have no intention of going savage turned to the man just make sure you get back to the mainland as soon as possible youll have to pretend youre chasing us phone in keep giving them false reports you bet i will if i dont rendezvous with a team at one of the border crossings they wont believe my story but by then ill have lost you exactly theres just one thing the man said oh whats that you forgot to give me my money ninety minutes later when the ferry reached corfu they watched the man drive onto the dock and disappear among traffic he might still betray us akira said i dont think so savage said rachels instincts were right about paying him he knows if he tells them where we really are well implicate him papadropolis would kill him for taking a bribe so now we cross to italy rachel asked why bother savage smiled the corfu airport wont be under surveillance now lets catch the next plane to france by tonight youll be with your sister but rachel looked troubled why savage wondered then you and i catch another plane to new york akira told savage the sadness in his eyes intensified with anger to force answers from graham to make him tell us why we saw each other die excited of course i am why wouldnt i be rachel said theyd left their car at corfus airport then taken an alitalia flight to rome where they transfered to an air france jet bound for nice midafternoon the weather was magnificent rachel had the window seat and as she spoke she peered toward corsica to the west then down toward sunlight glinting off the mediterranean but savage sensed she was motivated less by attraction to the scenery than by the need to hide her expression when she answered his question because back at the ferry you werent overjoyed when i mentioned youd be with your sister tonight savage said rachel kept her face turned toward the window you expected me to jump up and down after everything thats happened im drained shellshocked numb i still cant believe i escaped savage glanced at her hand in her lap its fingers were clenched their knuckles white rachel her fist became tighter i want you to look at me she peered closer to the window eager to see my sister naturally shes more than my sister shes my closest friend if it werent for her and you id never have gotten off mykonos my husband would have kept beating me she trembled rachel please im asking you to look at me she stiffened then slowly turned in savages direction her bruises emphasized her somber expression savage reached for her fist unclasped its fingers and encircled them with his own whats wrong i keep trying to imagine whats ahead of me my sister a happy reunion a chance to rest and heal oh for sure ill be pampered the best of everything but then what a cage is a cage gilded or not ill still be a prisoner savage waited for rachel to continue all the while conscious of akira who sat at the rear of the plane assessing the other passengers my husband wont be satisfied until he gets me back when he learns where i am hell put my sisters estate under constant watch ill never be able to leave yes and no there are ways to sneak out sneak exactly but away from my sisters estate id never feel safe wherever i went id have to use another name disguise my appearance try not to be conspicuous sneak for the rest of my life its not as bad as that it is rachel jerked her head toward the passengers across the aisle and behind her embarrassed for having raised her voice she whispered her words intense im terrified what happens to other people youve rescued savage was forced to lie anytime someone needed a protector with savages expertise he knew that their problems were only temporarily solved he didnt cancel danger he merely postponed it they get on with their lives bullshit predators dont give up savage didnt respond im right savage glanced toward the aisle hey damn it i looked at you now you look at me rachel said okay if you want my opinion your husbands too arrogant to admit defeat yes youll have to be careful oh thats just fucking swell she yanked her hand from his you wanted the truth and i sure got it the usual option is to negotiate dont talk to me like a lawyer so what do you want for the past couple days as horrible as theyve been ive never felt saferbetterthan being with you you made me feel important comforted respected you treated me like i meant everything to you you did as a client rachel said and if you deliver me to my sister youll be paid you dont know anything about me savage said i dont risk my life just for the money i do this because people need me but i cant stay forever with everyone who needs you sooner or later i have to let go your sisters waiting for you and then you forget me never savage said then take me with you what to new york i wont feel safe without you rachel three weeks from now sipping champagne at the pool on your sisters estate you wont remember me for the right kind of man im stubbornly loyal ive had this conversation before savage said many times the man who taught me graham yes he always insisted never involve yourself with a client and he was right because emotion causes mistakes and mistakes are fatal id do anything for you like follow me to hell i promised that and you survived but akira and i have our own kind of hell and we need to understand why it happened believe me youd interfere enjoy your sisters pool and think of two men trying to solve a nightmare hold still for a minute why rachel leaned toward him gripping the sides of his face savage squirmed no rachel said hold still but quiet rachel kissed him her lips barely touched his making them tingle she gradually increased pressure her mouth fully on him her tongue probed sliding darting savage didnt resist but despite his erection he didnt encourage her either she slowly pulled away rachel youre beautiful rachel looked proud savage traced a finger along her cheek she shivered i cant savage said betray the rules ill take you to your sister then akira and i will go to new york she jerked away from him i cant wait to see my sister they landed outside nice shortly after four pm savage had phoned joyce stone before he akira and rachel had flown from corfu now as they entered the airports customsimmigration area a slender man wearing an impeccably tailored gray suit stepped past other arriving passengers toward them he had an identification pin in his lapel though savage didnt know what the pins striped colors signified a uniformed guard walked behind him monsieur savage the distinguishedlooking man asked yes would the three of you come with us please akira showed no sign of tension except for a brief frown toward savage who nodded reassuringly and held rachels hand they entered a room to the side the guard shut the door the distinguishedlooking man sat behind a desk monsieur as youre aware visitors to france are required to present not only a passport but an immigration visa yes im sure youll find these in order savage placed his passport and visa on the table before the assignment knowing hed have to take rachel to france hed instructed joyce stone to obtain visas for the two of them the official glanced through the documents and this is miss stones passport savage said because rachel had been forced to use her sisters passport instead of her own and because her sister had become a french citizen it wasnt necessary to present her immigration visa the official examined the passport excellent he didnt seem at all impressed that he was theoretically talking to a woman of fame and power savage gestured toward akira my friend has his passport but im afraid he neglected to obtain a visa yes so an influential acquaintance of yours has explained to me however while you were en route that oversight was corrected the official placed a visa on the table and held out his hand for akiras passport after flipping through it he stamped all the documents and returned them have you anything to declare to customs nothing please come with me they left the office passed crowded immigration and customs checkpoints and reached an exit from the airport enjoy your stay the man said we appreciate your cooperation savage said the official shrugged your influential acquaintance was most insistent charmingly so of course when possible im pleased to accommodate her wishes she instructed me to tell you shes arranged for your transportation through that door curious savage stepped outside followed by rachel and akira in brilliant sunshine on a street with a grass divider a parking lot and a background of palm trees what he saw at the curb appalled him joyce stoneignoring savages advice in athens to use an inconspicuous carhad sent a rollsroyce and behind the steering wheel sat one of the burly escorts that savage had met at joyce stones hotel suite near the acropolis i dont like this akira said rachel tensed why this isnt the way its done savage said all thats missing is a sign on the side of the car important people inside we might as well put up a target the burly driver got out of the car squared his shoulders and grinned at savage so you actually made it hey when i heard i was sure impressed savage felt more dismayed you were told you knew wed be your passengers the boss has been biting her nails for the last three days she couldnt wait to tell me the man kept grinning shit hey everythings cool the man said no akira said it isnt the man stopped grinning who the hell are you akira ignored him turning to savage should we get another car whats wrong with this one the burly man said you wouldnt understand come on its fully loaded at the moment stereo and airconditioning arent our priorities akira said no i mean fully loaded the stream of passing cars and pedestrians leaving the airport made savage uneasy it took him a moment to register what the man had said loaded a shotgun under each front fender automatic doubleought buck flashbang ejectors under each side smoke canisters in the rear bulletproof armored fuel tank but just in case if the fuel tank gets hit by a rocket grenade a steel plate flips up in the trunk and keeps the flames from spreading inside just what i said fucking loaded with all this terrorist stuff the boss believes in precautions akira frowned at savage its possible except the cars so damned ostentatious savage said but perhaps not here in southern france i saw five equally vulgar cars drive past while we talked youve got a point im tempted savage said vulgar the burly man said this car isnt vulgar its a dream that depends on what kind of dreams you have savage said rachel fidgeted i dont like standing out here okay savage said we use it he shielded rachel while he opened the rear door and she quickly got in akira sit beside her he pivoted toward the burly escort i drive but sit in the passenger seat or walk the mans feelings looked hurt youll have to promise im not responsible thats a given what youre not responsible get in the car as savage scrambled behind the steering wheel the man scurried next to him slamming his door controls savage said where are they its just an automatic i mean the flashbangs the smoke the shotguns lift the console to the right of the gearshift savage saw clearly marked buttons he twisted the ignition key and hurried from the airport despite the airports name savages destination wasnt eastward toward nice instead he drove west on n a coastal road that curved along the côte dazur and would lead him toward antibes cap dantibes and a few kilometers later cannes among the islands off that glamorous city was joyce stones equally glamorous principality which she ruled in the name of her infirm husband yeah the burly man said just stay on this road until ive been in southern france before a year and a half ago savage had escorted an american film producer to the festival at cannes at that time terrorists had threatened to attack what they called the purveyors of imperialistic racist oppression given the tense political climate savage had approved of his principals choice to use a hotel in one of the nearby villages instead of cannes while the principal slept hed be safely away from the site of the threatened violence preparing for that assignment savage had arrived a few days early and scouted both cannes and the surrounding area learning traffic patterns major and minor streets in case he had to rush his principal away from an incident yes ive been in southern france before savage said im sure i can find the way to your boss the farther he drove from the airport at nice the more traffic dwindled most of it having turned onto a superhighway to the north that superhighway ran parallel to this road and would have taken savage to cannes sooner but he didnt intend to enter the city his instructions to joyce stone had been to have a powerboat waiting at a beach along this road a halfkilometer before he reached the city the powerboat would take them to a yacht which in turn would take them to joyce stones islandan efficient surreptitious way to deliver rachel to her sister i hate to tell you this akira said i think weve got company savage glanced toward his rearview mirror the van its been following us since we left the airport maybe its headed toward one of the resorts along this road but it keeps passing cars to stay behind us if its in a hurry it ought to pass us as well lets find out savage slowed the van reduced speed a porsche veered around both of them savage sped up so did the van savage glared toward the burly man beside him is it too much to hope you brought handguns it didnt seem necessary if we survive this im going to beat the shit out of you rachel looked terrified how did they find us your husband must have guessed your sister arranged for the rescue but he thinks we drove into yugoslavia right most of his men are searching there savage said increasing speed but he must have kept a team in southern france in case we managed to get this far the airport was being watched i didnt notice surveillance akira said not in the airport outside and when this idiot showed up in the rolls hey watch who youre calling an idiot the burly man said they activated the trap they wont be alone somewhere ahead therell be another vehicle in radio contact with them and savage glared at the burly man if you dont shut your mouth ill tell akira to strangle you savage swerved past a slowly moving truck filled with chickens the van did the same to the left down a slope savage saw antibes stretched along the sea the resort had extensive flower gardens an impressive romanesque cathedral and ancient narrow streets to the right picturesque villas dotted a hillside savage reached a curve and halfway around it pressed the accelerator the transmission changed gears sluggishly finally responding an automatic savage said i cant believe this again he glared at the burly man dont you know a standards more efficient if youre being chased yeah but an automatics smoother in stopandgo traffic and the streets in these towns are an obstacle course with a standard its a pain to keep using the gearshift savage cursed and rounded another curve now opposite the rising slope of villas a descending slope was cluttered with hotels that almost obscured the sea the pursuing van sped closer there might be another explanation akira said for their spotting us savage urged the rolls from the curve your phone call before we left corfu the incompetent man beside you admitted that your employer talked openly about the rescue hey what do you mean incompetent if you persist in speaking akira told the man perhaps i will indeed strangle you savage frowned at another curve i suspect your employers phones have been tapped akira said and i also suspect there are spies in the household i warned her savage said before i went in i told her rachels safety depended on absolute secrecy before you went afterward she felt free to reveal her concerns savage scowled toward the rearview mirror the van was closer i think youre right someone on joyce stones staff is a spy for papadropolis thats why his team was ready so what are we going to do the burly man asked what id like to do savage said is throw you out ahead akira barked savages chest constricted as a van appeared the interceptor skidded turning blocking the narrow road rachel make sure your seat belts tight the pursuing van loomed closer savage eased his left foot onto the brake kept his other foot on the accelerator and spun the steering wheel the maneuver was difficult if he pressed too hard on the brake hed lock the rear wheels he had to balance the pressure between braking and accelerating so the cars rear wheels spun while skidding the consequent tension of forces gave the car torque as savage twisted the steering wheel the car snapped around the degree pivot made the tires squeal rubber smoking savages seat belt gripped him the van that blocked the road was now behind him the pursuing van ahead savage jerked his foot off the brake and stomped the accelerator the rolls surged toward the approaching van its driver veered savage rocketed past in his rearview mirror he saw the van skid to a stop farther back the van that had blocked the road was in motion again passing the van that had stopped resuming the chase at least theyre both behind us savage said if we can get back tointoantibes we might be able to lose them his stomach turned cold when a third van emerged from a curve ahead jesus the burly man said the team had backup the van turned sideways blocking the road in his rearview mirror savage saw one of the other vans block the road behind him while the remaining van sped toward him were boxed savage said the road was too narrow for savage to veer around the obstructing vehicle now the steep upward slope was on his left the steeper downward slope on his right he tensely reached toward the buttons on the console these weapons better work the system had been invented by drug lords in south america he pressed a button a section of metal rose from above each headlight he pressed another button and felt the roils tremble from the concussion of shotguns firing mounted beneath each fender the guns sprayed doubleought buckshot through a vent above each headlight ahead the van that blocked the road jolted from the fusillades repeated impacts as the shotguns kept firing the vans windows imploded pellets punched metal causing clusters of holes threefoot circular patterns that narrowed as the rolls sped nearer the continuous shotgun blasts chewed the van to pieces savage released the button and stomped on the brake the rolls fishtailed skidding barely stopping in time to avoid smashing against the wrecked vehicle he swung to stare behind him while one of the remaining vans continued to block the road the other rushed nearer and braked men scrambled out weapons drawn rachel close your eyes cover your ears savage pressed two more buttons on the console and instantly obeyed his own directive scrunching his eyes shut squeezing his palms against his ears despite these precautions he winced chaos assaulted him the buttons hed pressed had caused flashbang devices to catapult from each side of the rolls and detonate when they hit the ground the devices were deceptively named flashbang suggested a firecracker but the blaze and the blast produced by these matchboxshaped metal objects were extreme enough to temporarily blind and deafen even one could be powerfully disorienting several dozen had awesome results in the rolls savage saw sudden fierce glares through his tightly closed eyes peristent staccato roars forced their way past the hands he pressed to his ears he heard muffled screams the hunters collapsing outside the car or perhaps the screams were inside the car possibly from himself the rolls shook his ears rang and suddenly the chaos ended out of the car savage shouted he scrambled from the drivers side and found himself enveloped by dense swirling smoke not from the flashbangs instead from pressurized canisters beneath the cars rear bumper one of the buttons hed pressed had triggered the release of their contents both the flashbangs and the smoke were designed to confuse assailants and allow potential victims to escape amid the confusion though the flashbangs could be lethal if they detonated directly beside an enemy in the smoke savage had no way to tell if any of papadropoliss men had accidentally been killed but he was sure that for the next halfminute theyd be lying on the road squirming in pain his sight impaired he felt his way hurriedly around the rolls bumped into the burly man pushed him aside and found akira guarding rachel no conversation was necessary both he and akira knew the only practical escape was down the slope toward the hotels that rimmed the sea concealed by the smoke they scurried from the road each holding rachel between them over rocks and grass they felt their way down the slope at once they emerged into eyestabbing sunlight run savage said rachel didnt need encouragement she darted ahead of them jumped from a ledge and landed on the continuation of the slope four feet below the impact threw her off balance she rolled slid on her back and pushed herself upright continuing to run savage and akira lunged after her any moment their hunters would recover from the stunning barrage to their senses theyd struggle to orient themselves emerge from the smoke see their quarry and continue pursuing rachels pace faltered savage and akira caught up to her charging lower they passed tennis courts perched on the slope players had stopped their games staring toward the smoke on the road above them several noticed savage akira and rachel race past then redirected their attention toward the smoke as the slope leveled off the hotels seemed larger taller savage paused with akira and rachel behind a maintenance building near palm trees and a swimming pool no hunters scurried down the slope but savage was dismayed to see the burly man breathing heavily stumble toward them jesus i almost lost you thanks for waiting till i caught up we didnt wait so you could join us akira said were trying to decide what to do but one choice is very clear the man wiped his sweaty face yeah quick tell me what is it we dont want you with us whichever way we go you take the opposite direction come on quit joking were in this together no akira said the top of the slope savage said akira followed savages gaze toward the hunters scurrying downward no were not in this together akira grabbed the mans neck and pressed a finger behind his left ear in pain the man sagged he groaned and squirmed struggling to release akiras grip akira pressed harder you will not follow us the mans face turned pale from the power of akiras grip okay im out of here go akira pushed him the man took a last frightened look at akira and stumbled toward the opposite hotel in the distance sirens wailed and wed better go savage said he pointed toward the hunters a quarter way down the slope then grabbed rachels arm and ran with her where rachel gasped they passed between two hotels and reached a noisy street that flanked the sea savage waved his arms toward a taxi it pulled to a stop they hurried inside savage echoed rachels question where i worked in this area a year and a half ago a man i met owes me a favor he turned to the driver and gave him directions in french were late for a party ill double your fare if you get us there in five minutes bien entendu monsieur as the driver sped toward antibes he pointed toward the smoke on the upper road quest ce que cest un accident d automobile sérieux je pense quel dommage trop de gens ne regardent pas la route cest vrai monsieur cest vrai the driver turned from savage flinched and jerked the steering wheel avoiding a truck in the backseat savage stared behind him the hunters had not yet rushed from between the hotels onto the palmlined street when they finally did they wouldnt be able to read the license plate on this taxi antibes had a population of more than sixty thousand though october was past the height of the tourist season there were still sufficient visitors to congest the narrow streets when the taxi began to move with frustrating slowness savage told the driver to stop paid him the promised bonus and left with rachel and akira they disappeared into an alley above which laundry dangled from ropes to his right savage heard waves crashing onto the beach to his left above the alley he caught a glimpse of a centuriesold towering château rachel hurried past the alleys narrow walls made even more narrow by garbage she frowned toward savage but you gave the driver an address if my husbands men question the driver theyll know where were going the address was fake savage said standard practice akira said they reached the end of the alley rachel stopped and caught her breath so everythings a lie no savage said our promise to protect you isnt as long as im worth money i told you before the money isnt important you are savage tugged her toward an opposite alley your husband has spies on your sisters island akira said if we try to take you there well face another trap and then another eventually youll be captured which means its hopeless rachel said no savage said youve got to keep trusting me they crossed a street blended with the crowd and entered another alley a year and a half ago savage said when i worked in this district i needed special additions to a car i found a man in antibes who could do the job but he didnt care how much i paid him money he said meant nothing if he couldnt buy what he wanted he needed extra benefits what kind i asked guess what he wanted he saw some movie posters my client had left in the car and took for granted i had something to do with the festival at cannes so he wanted to meet his greatest idol arnold schwarzenegger yes i said that might be possible but if it happens you wont get to talk to him except to shake his hand then one day ill come back to you and ask a favor of course he said one favor deserves another and itll be worth it he said so now youll demand the favor akira said a car and then what rachel asked force of circumstance savage said weve got our nightmare but youre our obligation so it looks like you get your wish what you tried to get me to agree to on the plane youre taking me with you rachel breathed to new york and graham akira said but i have to qualify my approval why savage asked because were no longer protecting only this woman akira said were also protecting ourselves solving our common nightmare your death and mine if this woman gets in the way youll defend her savage said but of course akira said his eyes tinged with sadness arigato for reminding me the three of us are bound but our paths conflict we dont have a choice savage said vanishing act thirtysix hours later they arrived at new york s kennedy airport during the intervening time theyd driven to marseilles and flown to paris where savage decided that rachels bruises had faded enough that with the use of cosmetics she could pose for an acceptable passport photograph she no longer dared risk attracting attention by pretending to be her sister using a trusted contact in paris savage arranged for her to obtain a complete set of firstrate counterfeit documents all in the name of susan porter if anyoneespecially an immigration officialcommented on her likeness to joyce stone rachel merely had to say thanks for the compliment as it happened she and savage passed through the checkpoints at kennedy without incident akira who stood farther back in line so he wouldnt seem to be traveling with them joined them shortly afterward i studied the crowd no one showed interest in us just as we hoped papadropolis has no way to guess where rachel went he probably figures were still in southern france trying to get onto her sisters island they walked through the noisy crowded concourse then im free rachel asked lets call it reprieved savage said i have to be honest your problems been postponed not canceled ill settle for what i can get for now its a relief not to have to keep watching behind me ahead though akira said we have to deal with graham i understand im holding you back im sorry but if it werent for the two of you i dont know how to it sounds so inadequate thanks she hugged them they took a taxi to grand central station entered on fortysecond street came out on lexington avenue and took another taxi to central park from where they walked two blocks to a hotel on a side street off fifth avenue the suite that savage had phoned ahead to reserve was spacious rachel the bedrooms yours savage said akira and i will take turns using the sofa they unpacked the travel bags theyd bought before leaving paris anybody hungry savage took their requests and ordered smokedsalmon sandwiches salads fruit and bottled water from room service for the next few hours they rested bathed and ate though theyd slept on the plane they still felt jet lag a further call to room service brought coffee and tea the stimulants helped as did a change of clothes just before five savage went to a nearby store to buy coats and gloves a tv news announcer having warned that the night would be chilly and damp they waited till nine ready savage asked not yet akira said there are still some things we need to discuss i know the answer already but the question cant be ignored would it not be better to leave rachel here we think we werent followed but we cant be totally sure savage said if we leave her unprotected she might be in danger might be an unacceptable risk i agree akira said so whats the trouble something i should have realized something i suddenly thought of your assignment to rescue rachel akira said what about it my assignment was to protect her husband i arrived on mykonos a day before you did graham negotiated my fee and graham sent you to get rachel doesnt it strike you as curious that the man who arranged for both of us to protect kamichi also arranged for both of us to go to mykonos our first assignment after we recovered from our injuries we were meant to meet savages spine froze there was no guarantee wed see each other but id have chased you just as id have chased you if our roles had been reversed savage said graham knew he could count on our sense of obligation and on my skill no matter how long it took eventually id have found you there are few men id admit this to but yes youre good enough eventually youd have found me we were meant to come facetoface savage said and confront each others nightmare a nightmare that didnt happen but why do we think it did why did graham arrange for us to meet six months ago and then meet again thats why i have to ask since we dont know what were facing should rachel be part of it we might be putting her in worse danger than she already is then what do we do stay here i have to know why i see a dead man before me so do i savage said then youre going rachel said they turned surprised and im going with you the weather forecast had been accurate a cold damp wind gusted along fifth avenue bringing tears to savages eyes he rubbed them closed the top button of his overcoat and watched the taillights of the taxi hed left recede toward greenwich village rachel stood next to him flanked by akira one more time savage said if theres any trouble run dont worry about akira and me go back to the hotel if were not in touch by noon check out leave town i gave you ten thousand dollars thatll help you get started ive told you how to contact your parents and your sister and get money without your husband being able to trace it pick a city at random begin a new life at random but how would you find me we wouldnt and no one else would either thats the point as long as you stay away from anyone or anything related to your former life your husband cant track you youll be safe it sounds sorachel shiveredlonely the alternatives worse the three of them walked down fifth avenue three blocks later near washington square they reached a lane between streets a wroughtiron gate blocked the entrance its bars topped with spikes the gate had a keyhole beneath a handle when savage twisted the handle and pushed he discovered that the gate was locked that didnt surprise him he studied the bars they were tall the many passing cars and pedestrians were bound to see two men and a woman climb over despite the myth that new yorkers minded their own business it was more than likely that someone would call the police do the honors akira on the way here theyd stopped at an east side tavern where the ownerone of savages contactshad sold them a set of lockpicks akira freed the lock as easily as if hed possessed a key from their frequent visits here both men knew that the gate was not equipped with intrusion sensors akira pushed the gate open waited for savage and rachel to follow then shoved the gate back into place in case they needed to leave here quickly he didnt relock it anyone who lived along this lane and found the gate unlocked would merely be disgusted that one of the neighbors had been irresponsible they faced the lane a century earlier stables and carriage houses had flanked it the exteriors of the buildings had been carefully modified their historical appearance preserved narrow entrances alternated with quaint double doors that had long ago provided access to barns the surface of the lane remained cobblestoned electric lights shaped like lanterns reinforced the impression that time had been suspended an exclusive expensive location the lane was wide intended for horsedrawn buggies it now permitted residents to steer cars into renovated garages lights gleamed from windows but the only lights savage cared about were those that shone from the fourth town house on his left he walked with rachel and akira toward it pausing at the entrance he pressed a button beneath an intercom the oak door was lined with steel savage knew even so he heard a bell ring faintly behind it ten seconds later he tang the bell again and ten seconds later again he waited to hear grahams voice from the intercom no response asleep savage wondered at ten pm with the lights on then he doesnt want to be interrupted or else hes gone out theres one way to tell akira said if hes home hell have wedged a bar against the door in addition to locking it the door had two deadbolt locks akira picked them in rapid succession he tested the door it opened savage hurried through hed been here so often that he knew the specifics of grahams defenses not only were the windows barred they had intrusion sensors so did the doors to grahams garage and this door as soon as its locks were freed anyone entering had to open a closet on the left and press a series of buttons on a console to prevent an alarm from shrieking throughout the neighborhood and more important to prevent the local police from sending a squad car in response to a flashing light on their precincts monitor this had to be done within fifteen seconds savage yanked the closet door open a year ago after several tries due to professional habit hed managed to catch a glimpse of the numbers graham had pressed he pressed those numbers now a red light stopped glowing no siren wailed savage leaned against the closets wall akiras silhouette filled the doorway ive checked this floor no sign of him savage had been so preoccupied he hadnt paid attention to the harsh throbbing music hed heard when he entered heavy metal the radio akira said graham must have left it on when he went out if someone tried to break in the intruder would hear the music decide the house was occupied and look for another target but why would graham bother if someone tripped a sensor the sirens would scare an intruder a lot more than the music would besides when we stood outside i barely heard the doorbell and didnt hear the music at all the radios hardly a deterrent its not like graham to go out and forget to turn it off heavy metal graham hates electric music hes strictly classical somethings wrong check the top floors ill take the basement rachel stay here as akira crept up a stairway to the left savages bowels contracted he crossed the large room that occupied this level the room was grahams office though the glassandchrome desk at the rear was the only detail that indicated its purpose otherwise it seemed a living room to the right bookshelves flanked a fireplace to the left stereo equipment filled a cabinet boston acoustics speakers on either side the source of the throbbing music in the middle a coffee tableits glass and chrome a match to grahams deskseparated two leather sofas beneath them an afghan rug covered most of the floor the border brightly waxed hardwood large pots of ferns occupied each corner the brilliant white wallsupon which hung only a few paintings all by monetreinforced the feeling of spaciousness created by the sparse furnishings a stranger could not have known as savage did that graham hid business documents in alcoves behind the bookshelves and that the stereos purpose was to assure those few clients he trusted enough to come here that the swelling cadences of beethovens glorious eroica prevented their subdued conversation from being picked up by undetected microphones while savage passed the coffee table he noticed three empty bottles of champagne approaching the desk in the rear he saw an ashtray filled with cigar butts and a tallstemmed glass the bottom of which contained a remnant of liquid to the left of the desk he reached a door and cautiously opened it shadowy steps descended to a murky basement he opened his overcoat and withdrew a pistol that the owner of the east side bar had sold him along with the lockpicks akira had bought one as well gripping the pistol with his leathergloved right hand savage pawed with his other hand found a light switch and illuminated the basement sweating he took one step down another then another he held his breath sprang to the bottom and tensely aimed three tables neat piles of wires batteries and discshaped objects covered them various sophisticated eavesdropping devices in progressive stages of assembly a furnace ready with the savage peered behind it seeing no one moisture dripped from his forehead there werent any other hiding places he climbed the stairs but he wasnt relieved when akira joined him having searched the upper floors and reporting nothing unusual savage still didnt feel at ease rachel slumped on a sofa akira holstered his pistol electric guitars kept wailing maybe were overreacting there might be a simple explanation for grahams uncharacteristic choice of music you dont sound convinced rachel pressed her hands to her ears maybe he likes to torture himself lets do ourselves a favor savage pushed a button on the stereos tuner and the heavymetal radio station became mercifully silent thank god rachel said she studied the coffee table did you notice these empty bottles akira nodded champagne graham loves it so much three bottles in one evening grahams large enough to tolerate a great deal of alcohol savage said but youre right it does seem strange ive never seen him overindulge perhaps he had company akira said theres only one glass rachel said if he did have guests and he put away their glasses why didnt he put away his own glass and the empty bottles as well and something else have you read the labels on the bottles no savage said what about them at the farmhouse outside athens when the two of you talked about graham you said he drank dom pérignon its the only brand hell accept akira said well two of these labels say dom pérignon but the third is asti spumante what savage straightened and whats that noise rachel asked savage glanced around sharply his ears had been slow to adjust to the silence after the throbbing music but now he heard a muted drone yes akira said a faint vibration whats causing it a refrigerator savage said grahams kitchens on the second floor akira said we wouldnt hear the refrigerator this far away maybe the furnace turned on savage said akira lowered his hand toward a vent no rush of air then what it seems to come fromrachel frowned passing savage this door beside the bookshelf she opened the door and lurched back as thick gray smoke enveloped her the faint drone became a rumble rachel coughed from the acrid stench of the smoke except that it wasnt smoke savage realized grahams garage savage hurried through the doorway the garage was dark but the lights in the living room managed to pierce the dense exhaust rushing past him he saw grahams cadillac its engine running a bald overweight figure slumped behind the steering wheel he rushed to lean through the cars open window and twisted the ignition key the engine stopped straining not to breathe he yanked the drivers door open clutched graham and dragged him across the garages concrete floor into the living room rachel shoved the door closed preventing more exhaust from spewing in but enough had already entered the living room that when savage finally breathed he bent over coughing akira knelt beside graham feeling for a pulse his face is deep red rachel said carbon monoxide akira listened to grahams chest his heart isnt beating savage knelt opposite akira graham between them give him mouthtomouth ill work on his heart as akira opened grahams mouth and breathed into it savage pounded grahams chest once then placed both palms over his heart applying and releasing pressure rachel call nine eleven savage blurted pressing again on grahams chest leaning back pressing once more rachel scrambled toward the phone on grahams desk she picked it up and began to press numbers no rachel akira sounded sick never mind he stared at graham and slowly stood keep trying savage said akira shook his head in despair feel how cold he is look at his legs when you set him on the floor they stayed bentas if hes still sitting in the car hes been dead for quite a while nothings going to revive him savage squinted at grahams bent knees swallowed and stopped pressing grahams chest rachel set down the phone for several seconds they didnt move jesus savages hands shook he had trouble standing akiras neck muscles were so taut they resembled ropes rachel approached trying not to look at grahams corpse savage suddenly noticed how pale she was he reached her just in time before her legs gave out he helped her toward a sofa choosing the one that allowed her to sit with her back to graham put your head between your knees i just lost my balance for a second sure i feel better now of course ill get you some water akira said no really i think im okay her color was returning for a moment there the room seemed blurry now yes she mustered strength ill be fine you dont need to worry im not going to faint i promised myself i wouldnt get in the way i wont hold you back her blue eyes glinted stubborn proud get in the way the opposite savage said if it hadnt been for you we probably wouldnt have discovered he bit his lower lip and turned toward grahams body the poor bastard i came here ready to strangle him now id hug him if he were alive god ill miss him he pressed downward with his hands as if repressing emotion so what the hell happened you mean what appears to have happened akira said exactly rachel looked confused three empty wine bottles akira said right a drunken man decides to go out for the evening he starts his car but before he can open the garage he passes out the exhaust fumes kill him a coroner will reject that explanation of course savage said i dont understand rachel said the garage was dark and the door from the living room was shut akira said even a drunk would realize that the garage wasnt open when he found himself blundering around in the dark his first instinct would be to open the outside door unless he had an automatic garagedoor opener and he figured he could press the remote control in his car while he started the engine but grahams garage actually has two doors like the stable doors theyre supposed to resemble they open out on each side and it has to be done by hand so the garage was left closed deliberately im missing something rachel said it sounds like graham committed suicide he sits here alone the stereo blaring while he smokes and drinks and broods when hes drunk enough to work up his nerve he goes out to his car doesnt bother to shut off the stereo why worry about it makes sure the living room door is closed to keep the garage sealed turns the ignition key the exhaust smells terrible but after several deep breaths his eyes feel heavy he drifts he dies no muss no fuss yeah savage said the coroner will buy it and thats the way graham would do it hes too fastidious about his appearance to put a bullet through his head all the blood would ruin his threepiece suit akira said rachel looked disturbed hed need a reason to kill himself savage said problems with his health savage shrugged the last time i saw him three weeks ago there didnt seem anything wrong overweight of course but robust as ever even if he suddenly learned he had cancer hes the type that would pamper himself till every medical option proved useless and he was terminal then he might kill himself but not before then business problems better savage said youre still confusing me rachel said it wouldnt have anything to do with money akira said graham was wealthy he invested shrewdly so it has to be a client that turned against him or a clients enemy who discovered that graham arranged an attack against him savage thought about it good itll work in his prime when graham belonged to the british commandos a challenge excited him but after he retired once he put on weight and got soft from too much champagne and caviar hed have realized that hed lost his ability to tolerate pain he trained me but his own skills were memories from his youth he once admitted to me that these days oneonone he wouldnt have a chance against a practiced opponent if he knew he was being stalked if he was certain his death would be painful he might have chosen a peaceful suicide especially if we were stalking him akira said except that when graham sent us to mykonos he had to assume wed eventually come here demanding answers and he knew us well enough to assume that no matter how angry we were wed never kill him besides the coroner isnt aware of us i dont think hes supposed to be aware of us either i agree akira said still the coroner will have to believe that someone was stalking graham or else the scenario isnt valid somewhereprobably behind those bookshelves in grahams hidden filesthe police will find evidence that graham feared for his life and knew he would suffer and chose the dignity of a selfinflicted death akira raised his eyebrows very japanese would the two of you please explain rachel asked graham didnt kill himself akira said but the way youve been talking were pretending to be the coroner savage said the verdict is suicide but the coroner doesnt know that graham would never have chosen a heavymetal radio station and the coroner doesnt know that graham would never have mixed dom pérignon with asti spumante graham was murdered he was forcedi assume by several mento drink the champagne he had in stock but two bottles werent enough so they sent a man to buy another he came back with his choice not grahams when graham passed out they put him in the car turned it on shut the living room door waited till he was dead then left but not before they played the radio to pass the time akira said again their choice of stations they probably figured the music would be a realistic touch so they didnt switch it off before they activated the alarm on the outside entrance and left almost perfect savage said the bastards ill make them pay akiras sad eyes blazed that goes without saying savage raised grahams arms while akira lifted his legs rachel opened the living room door turning from the cloud of exhaust spewing in while the two men carried the corpse to the garage they positioned the body behind the cadillacs steering wheel the poisonous fumes were still so dense that savage held his breath while making sure that graham slumped on the seat exactly as before after all as soon as grahams blood had stopped circulating gravity would have made the blood settle toward various pockets in his abdomen hips and legs causing purplishred discolorations in those areas if the corpse had discolorations in higher areas a coroner would know that the corpse had been moved the corpse had been moved but grahams body had not lain in the living room long enough for the blood to be redistributed and thus discolor the back the coroner would not become suspicious savage twisted the ignition key hearing the cadillacs engine rumble he slammed the drivers door and ran with akira into the living room the room was filled with haze savage coughed hearing rachel shut the door the windows akira said they hurried toward opposite ends of the room pressed buttons that shut off intruderdetection alarms raised panes and gulped fresh air a cold wind billowed drapes attacking the fumes gray wisps swirled toward the ceiling dispersed and flowed out the tops of the open windows in the winds subtle hiss savage listened to the muffled drone of the cadillacs engine he turned toward the living room door the garage beyond it im sorry friend but was he a friend akira asked a friend wouldnt have deceived us why did he do it anger conflicted with grief and made savage hoarse lets find out he crossed the room and tugged at the bookshelves the wall swung outward revealing further shelves metal containers grahams documents savage and akira sorted urgently through them rachel stood in the background you said you didnt think the coroner was supposed to know about you what did you mean too coincidental grahams murder our coming here to question him theyre related savage scanned pages you cant prove that yes akira said we can he sorted through another box of files graham keeps these documents for one reason onlyto explain his income to the irs if it werent for taxes his passion for secrecy would never have allowed him to keep business records of course he took the precaution of using pseudonyms for his operatives and his clients so an enemy wouldnt learn anything vital if he found these files the code for the pseudonyms is in a safedeposit box the arrangement with the bank is that both graham and his lawyer have to be present to open it so we know the code is secure but savage and i dont need the code to tell us which pseudonyms graham used for us we chose our pseudonyms ourselves in fact the names by which you know us are our pseudonyms they searched through other boxes what are you looking for rachel asked graham kept two sets of documents crossreferenced one for his operatives and the jobs they did the other for the clients who commissioned the jobs did you find them akira checked the final box no i didnt either find what rachel asked our files savage said theyre gone we dont know the pseudonym graham gave kamichi or the ones he gave your sister and your husband akira said but since our files arent here i assume the others are gone as well thats the proof i referred to whoever killed graham must have taken the files the coroner isnt supposed to be aware of us not even of our pseudonyms graham was killed to keep him from telling us why we saw each other die and heres the suicide note akira predicted wed find typed of course because graham didnt compose it left by his killers all right rachel said im convinced but how could they be sure the police would look behind these bookshelves the shelves werent closed completely wed better get out akira said the neighbor on the other side of grahams garage might wonder about the faint rumble he hears through the wall and call the police they replaced the files and arranged the metal containers in their original positions savage shut the bookshelves leaving a slight gap just as grahams killers had done akira turned on the radio guitars throbbed and wailed the rooms aired out i dont smell exhaust fumes rachel closed the windows savage glanced around is everything the way we found it we all wore gloves therell be no fingerprints okay akira went outside checked the lane and motioned for rachel to follow savage activated the intrusion alarm in the closet shut the closets door stepped outside shut the front door and waited for akira to use his lockpicks to secure the two deadbolt locks on the entrance savage held rachels arm as they walked along the lane she trembled dont forget to lock the gate behind us dont worry we wouldnt have but thanks for reminding us akira said im impressed youre learning rachel the way this is going when its finally overassuming it ever isive got a terrible feeling ill be an expert in the night they walked down fifth avenue passing streetlights approaching the shadows of washington square the cold damp wind continued gusting and again brought tears to savages eyes would the killers have left the area i assume so their work was completed akira said but was it completed if the point was to silence graham they must have guessed wed be coming here how would they know about us the only explanation i can think of say it is that graham worked with and possibly for the men who killed him savage said but why would he have helped them in the first place he didnt need money he valued loyalty why did he turn against us hey rachel said let me understand this youre saying were being watched by grahams killers she stared behind her and theyll try to kill us as well theyll follow us akira said but try to kill us i dont think so someone went to a lot of trouble to convince savage and me that we saw each other die why i dont know but were very important to somebody whoever it is will want to protect his investment savage hailed an approaching taxi they scrambled inside times square savage said for the next hour they shifted from taxi to taxi switched to a subway went back to a taxi and ended with a stroll through central park rachel was surprised to see so many joggers i thought the park wasnt safe at night they run in groups the junkies dont bother them she looked doubly surprised when she noticed that akira wasnt next to her where among the trees above the rocks going back the way we came if were being followed hell deal with them but he didnt explain what he was doing he didnt have to savage said the two of you read each others mind we know what needs to be done ten minutes later akira emerged from bushes if we were being followed theyre not foolish enough to trail us through central park at midnight the shadowy path forked this way rachel savage guided her toward the right its safe to go back to the hotel the fourth man swung his katanaits blade hissed struck kamichis waist kept speeding as if through air and sliced him in half kamichis upper and lower torso fell in opposite directions blood gushed severed organs spilled over the floor akira wailed in outrage rushing to chop the mans windpipe before the assassin could swing again too late the assassin reversed his aim both hands gripping the katana from savages agonized perspective on the floor it seemed that akira jumped backward in time to avoid the blade but the swordsman didnt swing a third time instead he watched indifferently as akiras head fell off his shoulders as blood spewed from akiras severed neck as akiras torso remained standing for three grotesque seconds before it toppled akiras head hit the floor with the thunk of a pumpkin rolled and stopped in front of savage the head rested on its stump its eyes on a level with savages the eyes were open they blinked savage screamed frantic he struggled to overcome the pain of his broken arms and legs to force them to move to raise himself from the floor hed failed to protect kamichi and assist akira but he still had an obligation to avenge their deaths before the assassins killed him he compelled his anguished limbs to respond lurched upward felt hands press against him and fought the hands became arms encircling him they pinned his own arms squeezing against his back thrusting air from his lungs no akira said savage thrashed no akira repeated abruptly savage stopped he blinked in contrast with the sweat trickling off his brow his skin felt terribly cold he shivered akira impossible hugged him fiercely no youre dead akiras face loomed inches away his sad eyes narrowed with alarm eyes that savage had just seen blink from a severed head resting upright on the floor akira again repeated this time whispering no savage slowly peered around the image of the bloodspattered hallway in the medford gap mountain retreat blurred and dissolved replaced by the tasteful furnishings in a room in a suite in a hotel off fifth avenue the room was mostly dark except for a dim light next to a chair in a comer to the left of the door to the hallway akira having slept while savage kept watch had taken his turn on guard savage breathed okay he relaxed youre sure akira kept holding him a nightmare no doubt the same as mine brace your legs savage nodded akira released his grip savage sank onto the sofa the bedroom door jerked open rachel appeared focused on savage and akira inhaled and quickly approached she wore a thighlength blue nightshirt her breasts swelled the cotton garment her urgent strides raised its hem she showed no embarrassment savage and akira paid no attention she was part of the team you screamed rachel said what happened a nightmare savage said the nightmare savage nodded then turned and peered up at akira i have it too akira said every night savage studied akira in pained confusion i thought once wed met for a second time it would finally go away i thought mine would too but it hasnt ive been trying not to talk about it savage gestured in frustration i still cant get over the certainty that i saw you killed i see you before me i hear your voice i can touch you but it makes no difference weve been together for several days yet im still sure i saw you die as i saw you die akira said every time i doubt myself i think of my six months of agony while i convalesced ive got the scars on my arms and legs to remind me savage unbuttoned his shirt and revealed two surgical scars one below his left rib cage the other near his right pelvic bone where my spleen and appendix had to be removed because theyd been ruptured by the beating i received mine were removed as well akira exposed his muscular chest and abdomen showing two scars identical to savages so we know we can prove that you both were beaten rachel said but obviously your deathsthat part of your nightmareare exactly that a nightmare dont you understand it doesnt matter savage said the fact that akiras alive doesnt change what i know i saw this is worse than déjà vu worse than the eerie feeling that ive lived through this before its more like the opposite i dont know what to call it jamais vu the sense that what i saw never happened and yet it did and what im seeing now isnt possible ive got to find out why im facing a ghost we both do akira said but grahams dead who else could explain what happened how do we find the answer where do we start why dont you rachels voice dropped yes go on savage said this is just a suggestion your suggestions have been good so far akira said its probably obvious rachel shrugged for all i know the two of you have already thought of it and dismissed it what akira asked you start where your problem started six months ago at this place you keep talking about the medford gap mountain retreat they ate a roomservice breakfast and checked out shortly after seven using evasion procedures they reached a car rental agency when it opened an hour later savage had considered asking one of his contacts to supply a car but he felt nervously convinced that the fewer people who knew he was in town the better especially now that graham was dead rachel confessed that shed had a nightmare of her own seeing graham propped behind the steering wheel of his cadillac enveloped by exhaust fumes driving into eternity but the cadillac would eventually use up its fuel she explained if a neighbor didnt hear the engines faint rumble before then it was possible that graham would sit in the car for several days bloating decomposing riddled with maggots until the stench from his garage finally made someone call the police grahams nostrils filled with maggots had climaxed her nightmare startling her awake why couldnt we have phoned the police and pretended to be a neighbor concerned about the sound in grahams garage she asked because the police have an automatic computerized trace on incoming calls in case someone reports an emergency and hangs up without giving a number if we phoned from grahams house or a pay phone it would have told the police a neighbor wasnt calling since we dont know what grahams killers are up to its better to let the scenario play out the way they intended as savage drove the rented taurus from the city rachel lapsed into brooding silence akira slept in the back attempting to recreate his previous journey savage left manhattan via the george washington bridge and entered new jersey heading along interstate twenty minutes later he started scanning the motels near the exit ramps holiday inn best western there savage said howard johnsons thats where kamichi changed briefcases it puzzled me the october day was splendidly clear the sun dispersing the chill of the night before as they left new jersey and progressed into pennsylvania cliffs rimmed interstate after half an hour the cliffs were mountains rachel began to relax ive always loved autumn the leaves turning colors the last time i drove here the trees hadnt budded yet there were patches of snow dirtcovered snow it was dusk the clouds looked like coal dust akira wake up well soon be leaving the highway savage steered toward an exit ramp he followed the directions hed memorized six months ago found his way through a maze of narrow roads and finally saw a road sign medford gap the town was small impoverished almost no traffic few pedestrians boards on many store windows akira is this the way you remember it we came here after dark except for the streetlights i saw almost nothing we turned to the left at the towns main intersection this stopstreet ahead savage braked and turned proceeding up a treelined mountain road it curved bringing him back to medford gap obviously not the main intersection he drove farther here yes this is it he turned left at a traffic light and angled up a steep winding road six months ago mud and snow on the shoulders had made him worry about descending cars he might have to avoid the road had been so narrow that he couldnt have passed approaching headlights and would have been forced to risk getting stuck in the ditch near the trees but now as before no cars descended thank god unlike earlier the dirt road was dry and firm and in daylight he could see where to swerve if a vehicle did approach he steered through a hairpin curve driving higher past isolated cabins flanked by dense forest waitll you see this rachel its the strangest building so many styles the whole things a fifth of a mile long he crested the peak veered past a rock and braked his seat belt squeezing his chest the taurus skidded he stared in disbelief ahead the road stopped beyond there was nothing except boulders and brilliantly colored trees what you took another wrong road akira said no this was the road day versus night you cant be certain try it again savage did and when hed eliminated every left road up from medford gap he stopped outside a tavern a group of men stood next to the entrance adjusting their caps spitting tobacco juice the medford gap mountain retreat how do i get there savage asked mountain retreat a gaunt man squinted never heard of the fucking thing savage drove faster unable to control his urge to flee with tunnel vision he stared at the broken line down the middle of the narrow road oblivious to the glorious orange red and yellow of the trees on the flanking towering slopes but it was there savage drove even faster akira and i both saw it we slept there we ate there we guarded kamichi along every corridor three nights three days soold akira said the wagonwheel chandeliers the ancient staircase i can still smell the must in the lobby and the smoke from the logs in the parlors fireplace but it isnt there rachel said the taurus squealed around a bend struggling with the steering wheel savage suddenly realized he was doing seventy he eased his foot from the gas pedal beyond a bare ridgea sign said beware of falling rockshe saw an abandoned service station its sign dangling its windows broken and pulled off the road stopping at the concrete slabs where fuel pumps once had stood we asked a dozen different people though savage no longer drove he continued to clutch the steering wheel none of them had the faintest idea what we were talking about he felt smothered jerking the drivers door open he lunged from the car filling his lungs with fresh air akira and rachel joined him this isnt some small hotel so far from medford gap that the locals might not have heard of it savage stared toward the bluffs beyond the service station but was too preoccupied to notice them its a major tourist attraction so close that medford gaps part of its name and we checked every road that led to the top of the mountain akira said we even drove back up the road that youre sure is the one you used six months ago rachel said we searched the trees in case thered been a fire but there wasnt any charred wreckage a halfyear isnt enough time for the forest to hide evidence of the building no savage said the forest couldnt have hidden a burntout cabin let alone a massive hotel and the fire would have been spectacular the local population couldnt possibly forget it so fast even if there had been a fire it wouldnt have destroyed the lake beside the hotel but the lakes not there either and yet were certain both the hotel and the lake were there akira said certain savage asked just as were certain we saw each other die but we didnt andakira hesitatedthe mountain retreat never existed savage exhaled nodding i feel likewhat i described last night in the hotel jamais vu nothing seems real i cant trust my senses its as if im losing my mind what happened to us akira asked and where savage scowled and why keep retracing your steps rachel said where did you go from here a hospital savage said mine was in harrisburg akira said a hundred miles south i had to be flown by helicopter harrisburg savages hands and feet became numb you never mentioned it didnt occur to me the look in your eyes dont tell me you were flown there as well did your doctor have blond hair yes and freckles and glasses and his name was hamilton shit savage said they raced toward the car whats keeping her akira asked its been only ten minutes savage had let rachel out when he couldnt find a parking space hed been driving repeatedly around the block still despite his assurance to akira savages need to protect hercoupled with his growing affection for hermade him nervous by her absence midafternoon traffic accumulated savage reached an intersection turned right and sat straighter pointing yes akira said good there she is relieved savage watched her hurry from the harrisburg public library glimpse the taurus and quickly get in he drove on i checked the phone book she said heres a photocopy of the city map and a list of the hospitals in the area but thisll take longer than you expected there are several youre sure you dont remember the name of the hospital no one ever mentioned it akira said but the name must have been stenciled on the sheets and the gowns i was groggy from demerol savage said if the name was on the sheets i didnt notice akira studied the list and read it to savage community general osteopathic hospital harrisburg hospital harrisburg state hospital osteopathic savage said isnt that something like chiropractic no osteopathic medicines a theory that most illness is caused by pressure from injured muscles and displaced bones akira said savage thought about it and shook his head lets try im sorry sir the elderly woman at the harrisburg hospital information desk said theres no dr hamilton on our staff please akira said tensely check again but i checked three times already the computer shows no reference to a dr hamilton maybe hes not on the staff akira said he might be in private practice and sends his patients here well of course thats possible the woman said behind the desk no rachel said savage and akira turned to her when i checked the phone book i looked under private physicians he isnt listed then he works for another hospital akira said they crossed the crowded lobby toward the exit what troubles me rachel said is there was no dr hamilton in the white pages either an unlisted number what kind of physician has an unlisted private number the lobbys door hissed open the overweight man behind the information desk at the harrisburg state hospital shook his head tapped more buttons on the keyboard watched the computer screen and pursed his lips nope no dr hamilton sorry but thats impossible savage said after medford gap nothings impossible akira said theres got to be an explanation savage suddenly thought of one this happened six months ago for all we know he resigned and moved to another city to work for another institution then how would we find that information rachel asked the man behind the desk youd have to talk to personnel the computer lists only current staff members and where the man gave directions to personnel but youd better hurry its almost five theyll soon be closing ill do it akira said quickly savage phone the personnel office at the other hospital akira hurried down a corridor trying not to bump into visitors savage rushed toward a row of pay phones at the side of the lobby ill meet you back here rachel said where are ive got an idea continuing toward the phones savage heard her urgently ask the man at the information desk how do i find the business office savage wondered why she wanted to know but at once all he cared about was that every phone was being used he glanced at his watch six minutes to five anxious he pulled coins from his pocket scanned the list of hospitals addresses and phone numbers rachel had given him saw a woman leave a phone and darted toward it as the call went through he glanced across the lobby rachel was gone they sat in the hospitals coffee shop staring at their styrofoam cups the personnel office has no listing for a dr hamilton in the past five years akira said the other hospital did have a dr hamilton savage said akira straightened three years ago savage said female elderly she died from a stroke akira slumped back in his chair its beginning to look as if our dr hamilton didnt exist any more than the medford gap mountain retreat did savage said and thats not all that didnt exist rachel said the two of you may think youre real but youre not what are you talking about akira asked at least as far as the harrisburg hospitals are concerned i went to the business office while they found out what i needed i went to a phone to call the other hospital and get its business office before it closed i asked for the same information what information akira asked the business office is the place that sends patients their bills earlier you told me the names youd used when you stayed in the hospital i pretended to be an insurance agent i said my company had paid for your treatment several months ago now i was getting complaints from you i asked each hospital why it was sending you notices about overdue bills the people i spoke to were quite sympathetic it was easy to solve the problem they said they checked their computers youll never guess what the computers came up blank theres no record that you stayed in either hospital savage squeezed his styrofoam cup almost breaking it then where the hell were we maybe the osteopathic hospital rachel said but when we go there during business hours tomorrow i strongly suspect well get the same answers akira said theres no such place as the medford gap mountain retreat we didnt see each other die we never met dr hamilton we werent in a harrisburg hospital what else didnt happen savage stood forcefully and walked away where are you going rachel hurried to follow joined by akira the information desk but why rachel tried to keep pace as savage stalked into the lobby weve asked everything we can think of no theres one thing we havent asked the way to the goddamn emergency ward in a brightly lit vestibule a weary nurse peered up from behind a counter yes sir may she suddenly frowned seeing the tension on savages face she shifted her troubled gaze toward rachel and akira i want to see a doctor savage said has there been an accident she stood you dont look injured is it someone else who needs i said i want to see a doctor the nurse blinked startled of course sir she stepped back nervously please wait right here she disappeared down a corridor be calm akira said im trying but its not doing any good i have to know abruptly the nurse returned accompanied by a tall man wearing hospital greens yes sir the young man slowed approaching savage cautiously im dr reynolds the senior resident on this ward is there something i need an x ray why the resident studied him are you in pain you bet im in pain but where your chest an arm everywhere what i wantwhat i need is a fullbody x ray a fullbody why would you describe your symptoms i ache from head to foot i cant bear the pain anymore i have to know whats wrong just give me the x rays but we cant just ill pay we still cantdoes your family doctor know about your pain i travel a lot i dont have a family doctor but without a diagnosis i said im willing to pay moneys not the issue we cant give x rays needlessly if your pains as severe as you indicate youd better come into the ward let me examine you your name please a young woman said savage turned toward a civilian whod replaced the nurse at the counter and the name of your insurance company i changed my mind savage said the resident frowned you dont want to be examined savage shook his head the residents suspicious gaze bothered him i thought if i askedmy friend here was right be calm but something is wrong with you youre right about that the question is whatdont worry though ill take your advice i need a family doctor the elderly physician who had a gray mustache wore suspenders and didnt mind ordering fullbody x rays for anyone willing to pay him five thousand dollars came out of a door marked technicians only instead of sending his patients to one of the hospitals hed chosen a private facility called the radiology clinic as he crossed the waiting room savage akira and rachel stood well savage asked the films are excellent we wont need to take a second set ive studied them carefully savage couldnt keep the anxiety out of his voice but what did you find you paid so handsomely to have your pictures taken why dont you come along and see for yourselves the doctor led them through the door they quickly entered a dimly lit room to the right was a counter with cupboards above and below to the left was a wall upon which a row of xray films hung from clips illuminated by fluorescent lights behind them various skeletal segments were revealed in shades of gray these are yours the doctor said gesturing to savage and these farther over are yours he told akira they leaned toward the films after thirty seconds akira shook his head and faced the doctor i dont know how to read them you asked me to determine how well your injuries had mended my response is what injuries jesus savage said i was right im not sure what you mean but im sure of this the doctor traced a pencil along bones on the various films ill save you the medical terminology this is your upper right leg your lower your left leg upper and lower right ribs left ribs various views of the skull the doctor shifted toward akiras x rays and used the pencil to draw attention to the images of his bones as well completely intact no sign of calcium deposits where the bones would have mended why would you tell me that each of you had suffered broken legs broken arms broken ribs and a fractured skull when none of those injuries obviously ever happened we thought they did akira said thoughttraumas that extensive wouldnt leave you in doubt your suffering would have been enormous it was savage said he trembled rachel gripped his arm howcould you have suffered the doctor asked if the injuries didnt occur thats a damned good question believe me i intend to find out well while youre at it find out something else the doctor said i dont like coincidence both of you claim identical injuries though they never occurred but both of you do have signs of surgeryhe gestured with his pencil toward two xray filmswhich werent the result of broken bones yes each of us had our spleen and appendix removed akira said you showed me those scars the doctor said theyre exactly as they should look if those organs were in fact removed your x rays arent detailed enough to verify my conclusion of course only further surgery would prove it but thats not my point the surgery im referring to wasnt on your chests and your lower torsos it was on your skulls what savage said of course because of the fractures akira said nothe doctor kept gesturing toward separate xray films these tiny circles one above each left ear theyre unmistakable evidence of intrusions into the left temporal lobe of each brain the doctor pivoted toward savage then akira and neither of you is aware of the surgery savage hesitated i asked you a question no savage said we werent aware thats hard to believe it wouldnt be if youd been with us for the past few days please savage swallowed bile help us how ive done what i could no where do we go who do we ask from here all i can tell youthe doctor turned to the filmsis the surgeon was a genius im merely a pennsylvania general practitioner about to retire but i havent ignored the latest medical texts and i know of nothing this sophisticated the juncture between detached skull segments and each skull itself is almost perfectly disguised the procedure was magnificent where do you go from here where money buys superstars the best neurosurgeons at the biggest institutions jamais vu the neurosurgeons name was anthony santizo he had thick dark hair swarthy skin and extremely intelligent eyes his handsome features were somewhat haggardthe consequence of fatigue savage guessed since the doctor had just completed seven hours of surgery in contrast his body was trimthe consequence of addiction to racquetball games one of which santizo had explained he was scheduled to play in an hour i know youre busy savage said were grateful you made time for us santizo raised his shoulders i normally wouldnt have but the neurosurgeon your physician spoke to in harrisburg happens to know a former classmate of mine a good friend from harvard medical school harrisburg has excellent physicians of course but the way your problem was described to me i think my friend was right to send you here here was philadelphia the hospital of the university of pennsylvania a hundred miles east of harrisburg it was quicker to get to than pennsylvania s other major university hospital twice as far to the west in pittsburgh im intrigued by mysteries santizo said sherlock holmes agatha christie the wonderful clues the delicious riddles but the brain is thegreatest mystery the key to the door to the secret of what makes us human thats why i chose my specialty a secretary entered the immaculate office bringing in cups and a pot on a tray excellent santizo said on time my herbal tea would you care for yes akira said id like some im afraid its less strong than youre used to in japan akira bowed im sure its refreshing santizo bowed in return i went to harvard with one of your countrymen ill never forget what he said to me we were both just starting our internships the long brutal hours wore me down i didnt think id survive your countryman said when youre not on duty you must find an exercise you enjoy i told him i didnt understand if im already tired why would i want to exercise you know what his answer was your fatigue is caused by your mind you must combat that fatigue by physical fatigue the latter will cancel your former that made no sense to me i told him so he responded with one word wa akira said santizo laughed yes by god you remind me of your countryman wa rachel asked assessed the word and frowned as everyone looked at her she reached selfconsciously for a cup it means balance akira said mental fatigue is neutralized by exercise santizo said how right your countryman was its tough to find time and after the days and nights i put in im usually so exhausted i hate to do it but i have to do it because racquetball makes me abetter neurosurgeon preoccupied he glanced at his watch and in fifty minutes im due at the court so show me these supposedly baffling x rays he took the oversize folder hey dont look depressed remember wa racquetball and neurosurgery sherlock holmes mmmmm santizo stood in a corner of his office glancing back and forth at two xray films of skull profiles that hed clipped onto a fluorescent screen hed been studying the films for several minutes his arms crossed listening to savages explanation of the events that had brought them here executive protectors santizo continued to assess the films it sounds like the two of you have a fascinating profession even so he turned toward savage and akira took a penlight from his shirt pocket and examined the left side of each mans head mmmmm he sat behind his desk sipped his herbal tea and thought a moment the surgeon did an excellent job state of the art mind you im referring only to the cosmetic aspects of the procedure the skillful concealment of the fact of the surgery the minimal calcification around the portion of each skull that was taken out and then replaced you see the standard method is to drill holes in the skull at the corners of the area to be removed these holes are carefully calculated so the drill doesnt enter the brain a thin very strong very sharp wire is then inserted into one of the holes and guided along the edge of the brain until the wire comes out another hole the surgeon grips each end of the wire and pulls sawing outward through the skull he repeats the process from one pair of holes to another until the segment of skull can be removed the wire is thin as i explained but nonetheless not thin enough to prevent the demarcation between the skull and the segment thats been removed and later replaced from developing obvious calcification even without that calcification the holes in the skull would be impossible to miss on an x ray in this casesantizo rubbed his chinthere arent any holes only this small circle as if a plug of bone had been removed and then replaced the demarcation between the plug and the skull is so fine that calcification is negligible im surprised the general practitioner you went to detected the evidence someone not prepared to look for it might not have seen it but if a standard technique wasnt used what was savage asked now thats the question isnt it santizo said the surgeon could have used a drill with a five millimeter bit to make a hole the same size as this plug but he wanted a technique that wouldnt leave obvious signs the only solution that occurs to me isthe plug was removed from the skull by a laser beam lasers are already being used in such delicate procedures as repairing arteries and retinas its only a matter of time before they become common procedure in other types of surgery ive experimented with them myself thats what i meantthis was state of the art theres no doubtin terms of getting in and out whoever did this was impressively skilled and knowledgeable not uniquely so i should add among the top neurosurgeons i know at least a dozen including myself who could have concealed the evidence of the procedure equally well but thats a superficial test of excellence the ultimate criterion is whether the surgeon accomplished his purpose and because were not aware of why the surgery was required i cant fully judge the quality of the work butakira hesitatedcould the surgery explain your dilemma perhaps santizo said and then again maybe not what was the term you used the opposite ofdéjà vu jamais vu savage said yes something you think youve seen but youve never seen im not familiar with the concept but i enjoy being educated ill remember the phrase you realizesantizo set down his teacupthat if it werent for these x rays id dismiss you as cranks i admit what i told you sounds bizarre savage said but we had to take the risk that you wouldnt believe us like you were pragmatists its our business to deal with facts physical problems how to get our principal safely to his or her destination how to anticipate an assassins bullet how to avoid an intercepting car but suddenly the physical facts dont match reality or our perception of it were so confused were not just nervousand its normal for us to be nervous were scared thats obvious santizo said i see it in your eyes so let me be honest my schedules so crowded the only reason i agreed to see you was that my former classmate asked me he thought id be intrigued he was right i am santizo glanced at his watch a half hour till im due for my racquetball game after that i need to make rounds meet me back here inhe calculatedtwo and a half hours ill try to arrange for a colleague to join us meanwhile i want you to go to radiology he picked up his phone more x rays to make sure the first sets are accurate savage asked no im ordering magnetic resonance images a fraillooking man with a saltandpepper beard wearing a sportcoat slightly too large for him was sitting across from santizo when they returned this is dr weinberg santizo said they all shook hands dr weinberg is a psychiatrist santizo said oh savages back became rigid against his chair does that trouble you weinberg asked pleasantly no of course not akira said we have a problem were eager to solve it by whatever means necessary savage said excellent weinberg pulled a notebook and a pen from his sportcoat you dont mind savage felt ill at ease he tried never to have his conversations documented but was forced to say make all the notes you want good weinberg scrawled several words from savages perspective they looked like the time and date your mri scans are being sent up to me santizo said i thought while we wait dr weinberg could ask you some questions savage gestured for weinberg to start jamais vuthe term is your invention im told thats right it was all i could think of to describe my confusion please elaborate savage did on occasion akira added a detail rachel listened intently weinberg scribbled so to summarize you both thought you saw each other die you failed to find the hotel where the deaths supposedly occurred and you cant find the hospital where you were treated or the physician in charge of your case correct savage said and the original traumatizing events took place six months ago yes akira said weinberg sighed for the moment he set down his pen im treating your dilemma as hypothetical treat it any way you want savage said my statement was not antagonistic i didnt say it was ill explain weinberg leaned back in his chair as a rule my patients are referred to me im given corroborating documents case histories if necessary i can interview their families their employers but in this instance i really know nothing about you i have only your word about your unusualto put it mildlybackground no way to confirm what you claim no reason to believe you for all im aware youre pathological liars desperate for attention or even reporters testing the gullibility of what the public calls shrinks santizos eyes glinted max i told you their storyand their x raysintrigue me give us a theory as an exercise in logic weinberg said purely for the sake of discussion hey what else santizo said weinberg sighed again then spread his hands the most likely explanation is that you both experienced youre suffering from a mutual delusion caused by the nearly fatal beatings you received how the x rays show we werent beaten savage said i disagree what the x rays show is that your arms legs and ribs werent broken that your skulls werent fractured as you believed that doesnt mean you werent beaten ill reconstruct what conceivably happened you both were assigned to protect a man yes he went to a conference at a rural hotel and while he was there he was killed in a graphically brutal manner with a sword that severed his torso akira nodded in the process of defending him the two of you were beaten to the point of unconsciousness weinberg said on the verge of passing out you each were tricked by your failing vision into thinking mistakenly that the other was killed inasmuch as neither of you died something caused the hallucination and the combination of pain and disorientation is a logical explanation but why would they both have the same hallucination rachel asked guilt i dont follow savage frowned if i understand correctly your profession means more to you than just a job obviously your identity is based on protecting on saving lives its a moral commitment in that respect youre comparable to devoted physicians true akira said but unlike physicians who inevitably lose patients and are consequently forced to put a shell around their emotions i gather that both of you have had remarkable success youve never lost a client your success rate has been an impressive one hundred percent except for the events in the rural hotel six months ago weinberg said for the firstthe onlytime you lost a client a major threat to your identity with no experience in dealing with failure you werent prepared for the shock a shock that was reinforced by the vividly gruesome manner of your clients death the natural reaction is guilt because you survived and your client didnt because your clients safety meant everything to you to the point where youd have sacrificed yourself to save him but it didnt turn out that way he died youre still alive so your guilt becomes unendurable your subconscious struggles to compensate it seizes on your murky impression that your fellow bodyguard died as well it insists it demands that your client couldnt possibly have been defended if both he and your counterpart were killed and you too nearly died in your heroic but demonstrably futile effort to fulfill your vocation given your similar personalities your mutual hallucinations are understandable even predictable then why cant we find the hotel savage asked because deep in your mind youre struggling to deny that your failure ever took place what better way than to convince yourselves that the hotel where your failure occurred doesnt exist or the doctor who treated you or the hospital where you recovered they do exist at least if your account is authentic but they dont exist where your urge for denial compels you to search savage and akira glanced at each other as one they shook their heads whyakira sounded skepticaldid we both know where the hotel ought to be and the doctor and the hospital thats the easiest to explain you reinforced each other what one of you said the other grasped at to perpetuate the delusion and relieve your guilt no savage said weinberg shrugged i told you this was all hypothetical why akira asked if our arms and legs werent broken were we put in casts why did we endure the agony of rebuilding our muscles for so many terrible months casts weinberg asked or were they immobilizers required to help repair ligaments detached from your arms and legs were the casts on your chests actually thick tightly wound tape that protected bruisedbut not brokenribs and possibly your bandaged skulls indeed had fractures hairlines that healed so perfectly an x ray wouldnt detect them you admit you were given demerol it affects ones sense of reality certainly rachel said and of course i wasnt there i didnt experience their pain i grant im fond of these two men weve been through a lot together but im not a fool and of the three of us im the one with the best claim to be objective my friends have not been reinforcing each others delusions well of course youve heard of the stockholm principle weinberg said people under stress tend to identify with those they depend on for their safety and of course youve heard of the ostrich principle rachel said a psychiatrist who puts his head in the sand because he cant acknowledge a problem hes never heard of before weinberg leaned forward scowled and abruptly laughed you were right he told santizo this is amusing youre sublimating max admit it she made you angry only hypothetically now santizo laughed hey of course lets write a hypothetical article about the phenomenon of being hypothetically angry whats going on savage asked santizo stopped laughing a test to determine if you were cranks i had no choice and max is wonderful a gifted man with a marvelous mind and a talent for acting i wasnt acting weinberg said what ive heard is so bewildering i want to hear more someone knocked on the door santizo pivoted come a secretary whod brought in the teacups now brought a large brown folder the mris santizo stood two minutes later he turned from the films thanks max ill take it from here youre sure yes i owe you a dinner santizo faced the mris but the problems back to me because psychiatry wont explain this savage stood next to akira and rachel studying the dusky films each had twelve images arranged in four rows and three columns they made little sense to him harder to read than the earlier singleimage x rays beautiful santizo said i couldnt ask for clearer pictures you could have fooled meakira said they look like ink blots santizo chuckled i can see where youd get that impression he studied the films again thats why to help you understand i have to begin with some basics though im afraid the basics will still sound technicalan mri scan is an advanced technique of photography based on magnetic resonance that allows us to see past your skull and into your brain it used to be that the only way we could get pictures of your brain was with a cat scan but a cat scan isnt detailed enough whereas these are the next best thing to actually opening up your skull and having a look we take so many pictures from so many different angles the combined result provides the illusion of d but what have you learned akira asked just bear with me a little longer santizo said the brain has many parts he gestured toward portions of the mris the right hemisphere the left hemisphere paradoxically the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body and vice versa our ability to think spatially comes from the right hemisphere our verbal skills from the left the hemispheres are divided into parts the frontal lobe the parietal lobe the occipital lobe the temporal lobe and these in turn contain numerous subparts the visual cortex the olfactory tract the somatic sensory area the pituitary gland et cetera what makes this awesomely complex organ work is the presence of billions of interconnecting nerves that transmit energy and information these nerves are called neurons theyre analogous to electrical wires and telephone cables but thats a simplification no analogy can truly describe them by the way have you ever had epilepsy the question was so unexpected that savage blinked epilepsy no why what makes you ask im trying to account for something santizo pointed toward a dark speck on a light portion of one of the images the speck was on the left near the middle this is a view of your brain from the rear that speck is in your mesial temporal lobethe amygdala hippocampal area its in line with the plug of bone that was taken out and then replaced in your skull savage felt as if hed swallowed ice speck jesus what a lesion thats why i asked about epilepsy an abnormality in this area sometimes causes that condition youre telling me somethings growing in my brain no santizo turned to akira then pointed toward another film theres an identical speck in the same area of your brain the coincidence leads me to conclude that whatever it is its not a growth what is it then akira asked an educated guess scar tissue from whatever was done to your brain savage listened in shock as santizo returned to his desk more basics santizo said first rule eliminate the obvious the purpose for the operation performed on each of you was not to excise a tumor that type of surgery requires a major invasion of the brain hence a major portion of the skull would have to be removed but not rachel said a fivemillimeter plug of bone correct the only reason to create so small an access to the brain would besantizo debatedto allow an electrode to be inserted why savage had trouble breathing assuming familiar but serious circumstances many reasons i mentioned epilepsy an electrode inserted into the brain can measure electrical impulses from various clusters of neurons in an epileptic different levels of the brain transmit normal and nonnormal current if we can determine the source of the nonnormal current we can operate in a specific location to try to correct the abnormality but were not epileptics savage said i was offering an example santizo said ill give you another a patient with impairments of sight or hearing or smellimpairments due to the brain and not external receptorscan sometimes have their impairments corrected if internal receptors those in the brain are stimulated by electrodes but we can see and hear and smell akira said and yet you think you saw each other die you cant find a hotel where you were beaten or a hospital where you were treated or a doctor who supervised your case someone has interfered with your brain functions specifically your ability to remember savage said or more interesting has someone caused you to remember what never happened jamais vuthe phrase you invented is fascinating to remember what never happened i didnt mean it literally i never believed i can take you down to pathology santizo said i can dissect a corpses brain and show you each component i can tell you why you see and hear why you taste touch and smell why you feel painthough the brain itself cannot feel pain but what i cant do is show you a thought and i certainly cant find a specific site in your brain that enables you to remember ive been doing research on memory for the past ten years and the more i learn the more im baffleddescribe what happens when you remember a past event savage and akira hesitated rachel gestured well its sort of like seeing a movie inside my head thats how most people describe it we experience an event and it seems as though our brain works like a camera retaining a series of images of that event the more we experience the more films we store in our brain when circumstances require when we need to review the past to understand the present we select an appropriate reel and view it on a mental screen of course we take for granted that the films are permanent records as immutable as a movie rachel nodded but a movie isnt permanent it cracks it discolors scenes can be eliminated whats more were explaining memory by means of analogy there arent films in our brain there isnt a screen we merely imagine there are and memory becomes even harder to explain when we pass from concrete events to learned abstractions when i think of the mathematical principle of pi i dont see a film in my head i somehow intuitively understand what pi signifies and when i think of an abstract word such as honor i dont see a film i just know what honor means why am i able to recall and understand these abstractions do you have an answer savages chest ached the prevailing theory is that memories are somehow encoded throughout the brain in the neurons these billions of i nervesthe theory goesnot only transmit electricity and information but also retain the information they transmit the analogy of a computer is frequently used to illustrate the process but again as with the illusion that we have a movie screen in our heads an analogy is not an explanation our memory system is infinitely more complex than any computer for one thing the neurons seem capable of transferring information from one network to another thus protecting certain memories if a portion of the brain is damaged for another there are two types of memoryshort term and long termand their relationship is paradoxical short term refers to temporary memories of recently acquired but unimportant information the telephone number of my dentist for example if i need to make an appointment i look up the number remember it long enough to call his office and immediately forget it until the next time i need an appointment and repeat the process long term refers to lasting memories of necessary information the telephone number for my home what physical mechanism causes my dentists number to be easily forgotten but not my own and why in certain types of amnesia is a patient unable to remember any recent event whether trivial or important while at the same time he can recall in vivid detail minor longforgotten events from forty years ago no one understands the process what do you believe akira asked a musical by lerner and loewe i dont gigi maurice chevalier and hermione gingold sing a wonderful song i remember it well their characters are former lovers recalling when they met we went here no we went there you wore this dress no i wore thatah yes i remember it well but they dont sure the point of the song is that old age has made them forget the trouble is im not sure the rest of us dont forget also a lot of specifics and sooner than we realize dr weinberg and i have a sentimental tradition every saturday night when max and i arent on call we and our wives see a movie and then go to dinner after the stress of the week we look forward to the distraction yesterday max fondly remembered a film the four of us had seen together but max i said i saw that movie on cable television not in a theater no max insisted the four of us saw it downtown no i told him i was at a conference that weekend you your wife and mine went to see the film without me we questioned our wives who didnt remember the circumstances we still dont know the truth of course savage said you just explained shortterm memory doesnt last but where does short term end and long term begin and how can we be sure that longterm memory truly endures the basic issue is the limitation of consciousness were capable of knowing we remember only if we remember we cant be aware of something weve forgottendescribe the future i cant the future doesnt exist savage said no more than the past though memory gives us the illusion the past does existin our minds its my opinion that our memories dont remain permanent after theyre encoded i believe our memories are constantly changing details being altered added and subtracted in effect we each create a version of the past the discrepancies are usually insignificant after all what difference does it make if max and i saw that movie together or separately but on occasion the discrepancies are critical max once had a neurotic female patient who as a child had repeatedly been abused by her father shed sublimated her nightmarish memories and imagined an idyllic youth with a gentle loving father to cure her neuroses max had to teach her to discard her false memory and recognize the horrors shed experienced false memory savage said jamais vubut ourfalse memory isnt caused by psychological problems our brain scans suggest someone surgically altered our ability to remember is that possible if you mean would i be able to do it the answer is no and im not aware of any other neurosurgeon who could do it either but is it possible yes theoretically though even if i knew how to do it i wouldnt its called psychosurgery it alters your personality and except for a few procedures an excision of brain tissue to prevent an epileptic from having seizures or a lobotomy to stop selfdestructive impulsesit isnt ethical but how in theory would you do it rachel asked santizo looked reluctant please i pride myself on being curious but sometimes against my nature ive refused to investigate intriguing cerebral phenomena when necessary ive inserted electrodes into the brains of my patients ive asked them to describe what they sensed wait akira said how could they describe the effects if their brains were exposed theyd be unconscious ah santizo said i take too much for granted i skip too many steps im too used to dealing with fellow neurosurgeons obviously you think exposing the brain is the same as exposing the heart ill emphasize a former remark the brainour sense receptordoes notitselfhave a sense receptor it doesnt feel pain using a local anesthetic to prevent the skull from transmitting pain i can remove a portion of bone and expose the great mystery inserting an electrode into the brain i can make the patient smell oranges that dont exist i can make the patient hear music from his childhood i can make him taste apples i can make him have an orgasm i can manipulate his sense receptors until hes convinced hes on a sailboat the sun on his face the wind in his hair hearing waves crash skirting australias great barrier reefa vacation he experienced years before but would he remember the illusions you caused rachel asked of course just as hed remember the true vivid event the operation so that explains what happened savage said to you and your friend not at all santizo said what ive just described is an activation of the patients memory by means of an electronic stimulation to various neurons but youhave memories of events that apparently never happened akira said so why do we remember them i told you its only a theory santizo said but if i expose the left temporal lobe of your brainand if i stimulate your neurons with electrodes if i describe in detail what youre supposed to remember perhaps show you films or even have actors dramatize the fictional eventsif i administer amphetamines to encourage the learning process and when im finished if i use the electrode to scar selected neurons to impair your memory of the operationyoull remember what never happened and forget what did happen weve been brainwashed no santizo said brainwashed is a crude expression that originated during the korean war and is used to describe the process by which a prisoner can be forced to surrender deeply held political convictions the methodology originated in the ussr based upon pavlovs theories of stimulus and response subject a prisoner to relentless pain break his spirit then offer him a reward if hell agree to denounce the country he loves well as we know a few soldiers did succumb the miracle is that more did not especially when psychosuggestive drugs are added to pavlovs theory of conditioning but if youve seen newsreels from the fifties you know that prisoners who were conditioned always looked as if theyd been conditioned gaunt features shaky hands glazed eyes their confession of war crimes wasnt convincing you two show none of those symptoms youre frightened yes but youre functional whats more no attitudinal changes seem to have occurred your identity remains intact youre still determined to protect no you havent been conditioned your problem isnt directed toward the future its not anything you might have been programmed to do its what happened to you in the past or what didnthappen and what really happened that you dont recall then why was this done to us savage asked why the only answer i can suggest the phone rang santizo picked it up hello he suddenly listened intensely his face becoming more grave ill be there at once he set down the phone an emergency im due in or right away standing he turned toward a wall of bookshelves here some standard texts youngs programs of the brain baddeleys the psychology of memory horns memory imprinting and the brain study them call my secretary tomorrow shell arrange a time for us to meet again i really have to go as santizo hurried toward the door akira surged from his chair but you started to tell us why you thought you were given false memories santizo pivoted no i cant imagine what i meant to say was the only person whod know is whoever performed the procedure they managed to get a room in a hotel near the hospital the setting sun was obscured by smog after ordering room servicefish and rice for akira steak and fries for savage and rachelthey each took a book and read in silence when their food arrived they used the distraction of what savage called refueling to talk the medical terms are difficult for me to interpret akira said my knowledge of english im embarrassed to confess has limitations no rachel said your english is perfect for what its worth these medical terms might as well be japanese to me i appreciate the compliment youre very gracious arigatoakira said that means thank you and what should i say in return whats the equivalent of youre welcome ill make it simple domo arigatoa rough translationthank youvery much exactly rachel saiddomo arigato akira smiled despite his melancholy eyes well savage said while the two of you are having a cultural exchange dont get grumpy rachel told him savage studied her admiredher and couldnt help smiling i guess thats how i sound but i thinki understand a part of this book and it scares me rachel and akira came to attention memorys more complicated than i realized not just that no ones really sure how the neurons in our brain store information but what about the implication of what it meansto be able to remember thats what scares me savages head throbbed we think of memory as a mental record of the past the trouble is the past by definition doesnt exist its a phantom of what used to be the present and it isnt just what happened a year ago last month or yesterday its twenty minutes ago its an instantago what im saying is already in the past in our memories rachel and akira waited this book has a theory that when we see an apple fall from a tree when we hear it land when we pick it up smell it and taste it were not experiencing those sensations simultaneously with the events theres a time laglets say a millionth of a secondbefore the sense impulses reach the brain by the time we register the taste of the apple what we think is the present is actually the past that lag would explain déjà vu we enter a room and feel eerily convinced weve been there before though we havent why because of the millionth of a second it takes the brain to receive a transmission from the eyes and tell us what were seeing if the two hemispheres of the brain are temporarily out of sync one side of the brain receives the transmission slightly before the other we see the room twice we think the sensation happened before because it did not in the distant past however instead a fraction of an instant before one side of the brain received what the other side later received but our problem isnt déjà vuits jamais vu akira said why are you disturbed by what you just read because i cant be sure of the present let alone the past because there is no present at least as far as my brains concerned everything it tells me is a delayed reaction that may be true rachel said but for practical purposes even with the time lag what we perceive might as well be the present youve got a big enough problem without exaggerating it am i exaggerating im scared because i thought i was struggling with false memories someone implanted in my brain six months ago but was it six months ago how do i know the operation didnt happen much more recently how can i be sure of what occurred yesterday or even this morning savage turned to rachel in france when you learned about our pseudonyms and the cover stories we had to invent you said it seemed that everything about us was a lie in a way i never imagined maybe youre right how many false memories do i have how do i know who i am how can i be sure that you and akira are what you seem suppose youre actors hired to trick me and reinforce my delusions but obviously were not akira said weve been through too much together rachels rescue the escape in the helicopter the ferry out of greece the vans that tried to intercept us in france my point is maybe none of it happened my false memories might have begun today my entire backgroundeverything about memight be a lie im not aware of did i ever meet rachels sister is graham really dead keep thinking like that akira said and youll go crazy right savage said thats what i meanim scared i feel like im seeing through a haze like the floors unsteady like im in an elevator thats falling total disorientation ive based my identity on protecting people but how can i protect myselffrom my mind rachel put an arm around him youve got to believe were not actors were all you have trust us trust you i dont even trust myself that night as savage slept fitfully assaulted by nightmares he woke abruptly from a hand that caressed his cheek startled he grabbed the hand and lunged upright on the sofa prepared to defend himself he restrained his impulse in the soft light from a lamp in a corner he saw rachels worried face beside him she was kneeling what savage scanned the room wheres akira in the hallway i asked him to leave us alone why would because i asked him she repeated her blond hair silhouetted by the dim light in the corner no why did you ask him to leave because i need to be with you that still doesnt answer my hush rachel touched his lips you think too much you ask too many questions its impossible to ask too many questions but sometimes its wiser not to ask any savage smelled her perfume i cant imagine yes she said i know three the land of the gods arts of peace and war savage drove from the motel hoping no one had seen them get into the car again akira hid on the floor in back though rachel sat next to savage her auburn hair making it safe for her to show herself she studied a road map the nearest major airport is in raleigh thats a hundred and fifty miles west no raleigh wont do savage said thered be so few japanese flying out of that airportprobably none akira would be sure to attract attention reaching a highway he headed northwest will this route take us around virginia beach rachel checked the map no problem but where are we going washington dulles international airport we can count on a lot of japanese flying in and out of there akira wont be noticed a few miles later savage pulled into a truckstop he took care to park well away from other vehicles so no one could see into the back of the taurus referring to the directory in a pay phones booth he called the tollfree numbers for several airlines though it would have been easier to phone from the motel he didnt want to leave a record of his calls were in luck he said getting back in the car i managed to get three seats on an american airlines flight what time does it leave akira asked tomorrow morning ten to eight but dulles airport must be four hundred miles away given the roundabout route were forced to take to avoid the eastern part of virginia savage said the airports security inspection takes longer on an overseas flight all our luggage is carryon thatll save time even so to pick up our tickets and guarantee were on the plane we need to be at the airport by five am at the latest can we do that rachel asked savage glanced at his watch twentyone hours to drive four hundred miles sure even if traffics bad well be in washington tonight despite his confident tone savage reflexively increased speed at once he thought better and strictly obeyed the limit they didnt dare get stopped by a traffic cop theres plenty of time then we should use it akira said you have much to learn what about savage asked i gather that neither of you has been to japan savage and rachel agreed yes akira said you have much to learn ive read books about japan savage said but i cant assume that the books were accurate or that you retain the essentials akira said and rachel apparently knows almost nothing about japan true rachel said you must be prepared soon you will enter a culture completely alien to you behavior you take for granted might be interpreted as rudeness and what you think of as an insult might be a sign of respect in the west ive taught myself to behave as a westerner to adjust to your values to accept your ways of thinking perhaps then youve concluded that the only differences between americans and japanese are the food we prefer to eat and the color of our skin not to mention our language the differences are much greater profound if you are to survive the dangers we face you must learn my ways just as i learned yours or try to learnbecause i dont have much time to teach you the cruised over the glinting pacific at forty thousand feet as savage assessed everything akira had told him he wished thered been a chance for akira to continue explaining during the long flight there was so much to know to absorb but the only seats available had been widely separated in three different sections of the plane and savage couldnt even see akira let alone talk with him not only akira but rachel savage felt nervously isolated from her his instincts as a protector made him squirm at being distanced from his principal more despite his professionals need to be objective about a client he reluctantly admitted that another need had grown within him accustomed to fearing for others hed never feared for his own safetytill now suffering a nightmare in which the dead came back to life how could he be sure of anything how could he trust his sense of reality he had to depend on something love gave him hope he glanced out his window below for many hours thered been nothing but ocean and he understood why akira had said that east of japan there was only west it was obvious why japan identified so strongly with the sun in ancient times the blazing globe that seemed to rise each day from the infinite expanse of the sea must have exerted a powerful force the land of the rising sun the symbol on the nations flag as akira had said japan is the only country whose tradition maintains its citizens are descendants of gods one deity in particular amaterasu the goddess of the sun savage felt pr amaterasu making sure they werent followed they walked for several miles by then the sun was up the streets bustling noisy crossing intersections savage had to keep reminding himself not to check for cars approaching from the left as he would have in america and most of europe but instead to glance toward the right for here as in england motorists drove on the left side of the street and thus approached from a pedestrians right at first savages impulse had been to hire a taxi but for the moment he and rachel had no destination even if they did have an immediate destination their lack of familiarity with the japanese language made it impossible for them to give directions to a driver akira had partially solved that problem by writing his instructionshow to reach the restaurant and his senseiin both english and japanese script those instructions didnt help their present circumstance however and savage and rachel felt totally lost still they had to go somewhere wandering wasnt only pointless but fatiguing their travel bags became a burden maybe we should get on a bus rachel said at least wed be able to sit she soon changed her mind every bus was crammed with no possibility of finding a place even to stand savage paused at the entrance to a subway the trains will be as crowded as the buses rachel said thats more than likely but lets have a look they descended into a claustrophobiaproducing maze travelers jostled past them almost too urgent to cast curious glances at the two caucasians among them savages bag was slammed painfully against his leg ahead he heard the echoing roar of a train emerging from a passageway he faced a deafening throngfilled cavern at least in contrast with new york subways the terminal was clean and bright a chart hung on a wall various colored lines intersecting beneath japanese ideograms savage saw english lettering its a map of the subway system rachel said with effort they deciphered the map and determined that this branch of the subway was called the chiyoda line its green path led to midtown tokyo to the east of which was a black path labeled ginza savage examined the piece of paper akira had given him the restaurants in the ginza district if we take this train and get off at one of the midtown exits maybe well be close to the rendezvous site or even more lost than we are have faith savage said isnt that what you keep telling me travelers lined up at a gate to buy tickets from a machine savage imitated them using japanese currency hed obtained at the airport when a train arrived the waiting crowd surged toward its opening doors thrusting savage and rachel inside the sway of the speeding train and the crush of passengers pressed rachels breasts against him several stops later they left the subway climbing congested stairs to the swelling din of midtown tokyo office buildings and department stores towered before them the swarm of traffic and pedestrians was overwhelming we cant keep carrying these bags rachel said they decided to find a hotel but what they found instead was a massive railway terminal inside the busy concourse there were lockers where they stored their bags and finally unencumbered they felt revitalized only nine oclock savage said were not supposed to be at the restaurant till noon then lets check out the sights rachels buoyant mood was forced savage sensed an anxious attempt to distract herself from the traumas of the night before she managed to seem carefree only until she reached an exit from the station and noticed a vending machine filled with newspapers faltering she pointed the front page of a newspaper showed a large photograph of the japanese theyd seen on television in the north carolina motel muto kamichi savage exhaled forcefully unable to repress the false memory of kamichis body being cut in half at once he corrected himself using the name the television announcer had called the antiamerican politician kunio shirai the photograph showed the grayhaired japanese haranguing an excited group of what looked like students why am i supposed to think i saw him die savage thought an eerie chill swept through him does he think he saw us die lets get out of here savage said and find someplace that isnt crowded i need a chance to think they headed west from the railway station and reached a large square called kokyo gaien beyond a moat the imperial palace glinted as savage walked with rachel along a wide gravel path toward the south of the square he struggled to arrange his thoughts its almost as if akira and i were manipulated into coming to japan i dont see how thats possible every step of the way we made our own choices from greece to southern france to america to here rachel said yet someone anticipated that wed arrive at akiras home the assault team was ready someones thinking ahead of us but how they came to a street and once again proceeded west to the left was the parliament building to the right beyond a moat the imperial gardens but savage was too distracted to pay them attention he walked for quite a while in troubled silence if two men thought theyd seen each other die and then came into contact with each other he finally said what would they do thats obvious rachel shrugged the same as you and akira did theyd be desperate to know what had really happened and if they discovered that someone they knew had arranged for them to come into contact theyd go to that person and demand an explanation rachel said logical and predictable so we went to graham and discovered that hed been murdered no answers but we needed answers where else could we look for them only one choice rachel said where you thought youd seen each other die the medford gap mountain retreat which we discovered didnt exist so is it also predictable that our next choice would have been to find out what else had never happened savage asked to go to the harrisburg hospital where we thought wed been treated for our injuries and where we each remembered the same doctor but after that your theory falls apart rachel said because no one could predict that youd decide to have x rays taken to find out if youd really been injured and for certain no one could predict that eventually youd talk to dr santizo in philadelphia they passed two institutionallooking buildings a wooded park attracted them a japanese sign at the entrance had english beneath it inner garden of the meui shrine but a surveillance team could have been waiting at the hospital savage said or more likely at medford gap where wed be easier to spot when we showed up to search for the mountain retreat in new york we made sure we hadnt been followed but after medford gap we were so distracted we might not have realized we had a tail when we left the car to go into the harrisburg hospitals the surveillance team could have planted a homing device on the car and followed us easily after that all the way to virginia beach where they killed mac to keep him from talking and tried to get you away from us now that i think of it macs death didnt only stop us from getting information we were blamed for his murder it put more pressure on us to run and when we saw kunio shirai on television we knew exactly where to run rachel said japan she shook her head theres a flaw in the logic though how could anyone be sure wed see a picture of shirai because wed be forced to check the news to learn what the police were saying about the murders if not on television then in magazines or newspapers wed eventually have found out about him i agree savage frowned but the team that killed mac works for someone different than the team that tried to kill us last night one wants us to keep searching the other wants us to stop he gestured angry bewildered ahead a wide path led them through a huge cypress gate its tall pillars joined near the top by a beam and at the very top by other beams each beam progressively wider the entire structure reminding savage of a massive japanese ideogram trees and shrubs flanked the path and directed savages troubled gaze toward a large pagoda its three stories emphasized by long low buildings to the right and left the meiji shrine the pagodas roof was flat its sides sloping down then curving up creating a link between earth and sky savage was struck by the elegance and harmony a voice speaking english startled him rachel clutched his arm nervous he pivoted and saw something so unexpected he blinked in confusion americans not a few but several dozen and though savage had arrived in japan only yesterday hed become so used to seeing crowds composed exclusively of orientals that for a moment this throng of awkward caucasians seemed as foreign to him as he and rachel felt amid the numerous japanese theyd been following toward the shrine but the voice hed heard speak english belonged to an attractive female japanese in her twenties she wore a burgundy skirt and blazer that resembled a uniform holding a clipboard with pages attached she turned her head as she walked and addressed the americans following her a tourist group savage realized the meiji shrine is one of the most popular pilgrimage sites in japan the guide explained her english diction impressive though the l and r in pilgrimage gave her trouble she paused where the path led into a courtyard the group formed a semicircle in eighteen sixtyseven she said after more than two and a half centuries in which a shogun was absolute ruler of japan an emperor again assumed power the name of his imperial highness was meijishe bowed her headand the return of authority to the emperor was called the meiji restoration one of the four greatest cultural changes in the history of japan what were the other three a man in bluecheckered pants interrupted the guide answered automatically influences from china in the fifth century the establishment of the shogunate in sixteen hundred and the united states occupation reforms after world war ii didnt macarthur make the emperor admit he wasnt a god the tour guides smile hardened yes your esteemed general required his highness to renounce his divinity she smiled even harder then gestured toward the pagoda when emperor meiji died in nineteen twelve this shrine was created in his honor the original buildings were destroyed in nineteen fortyfive this replica was constructed in nineteen fiftyeight she tactfully didnt mention that american bombing raids had been what destroyed the original buildings savage watched her lead the group across the courtyard about to follow toward the shrine he glanced reflexively behind him and noticed his stomach hardening that some americans hadnt proceeded with the group they lingered thirty yards back on the treerimmed path savage redirected his gaze toward the shrine come on lets join the group he told rachel he tried to sound casual but couldnt conceal the urgency in his voice she turned sharply toward him whats wrong just look straight ahead match my pace pretend youre so fascinated by what the tour guides saying you want to keep up with her but whats his heart cramped when i tell you dont look behind us they neared the group the spacious courtyard was bathed in sunlight savages spine felt cold all right i wont look behind me rachel said five men on the path for a moment i thought they were tourists but theyre wearing suits and they seem more interested in the shrubs along the path than they are in the shrine except for us theyre very interested in us oh god i dont know how they found us savages fingers turned numb as adrenaline forced blood toward his muscles we were careful and that subway was too damned crowded for anyone to keep us in sight then maybe they really are tourists businessmen with a few hours off trying to get over jet lag maybe theyre less interested in the shrine than they thought theyd be and wish theyd gone to a geisha house no savage said pulse hammering they reached the tour group he had to keep his voice low i recognized one of them rachel flinched youre sure as sure as i am that i saw akira beheaded and kamichi cut in half one of those men was at the medford gap mountain retreat but the medford gap mountain retreat doesnt exist i know that im telling you i remember him being there savages head throbbed his mind reeled assaulted again by jamais vu though he tried to hide it the distress in his voice made members of the tour group turn and frown at him a fiftyish woman with bluetinted hair told him shush the japanese guide hesitated peering back toward the distraction savage murmured apologies guiding rachel around the group walking anxiously toward the looming shrine false memory yes he told rachel but that doesnt change the fact that its in my head it feels real to me akira and i both remember kamichi having a conference with three men one looked italian the other spanish or maybe mexican or the third though was american and i saw him just now behind us on the path but the conference never happened i saw him one other time what at the hospital while i convalesced in harrisburg but you were never in a hospital in harrisburg how can you recognize a man you never met how could akira and i recognize kunio shirai the man we knew as kamichi you never met kamichi either savage flooded with terror he needed all his discipline the effects of all his years of training and hardship under fire to keep from panicking realitythe shrine before him seemed to waver false memory insisted that it alone was true if what i remember isnt true savage thought how can i be sure that this is they entered the shrine in a glimmering corridor that stretched to the right and left savage saw burnished doors emblazened with golden suns equipped with hinges in the middle the doors had been folded open revealing the precinct of what looked like a temple railings prevented him from going farther this way savage said urging rachel to the left disrupting the concentration of japanese who gazed toward the shrines interior in reverence of solemn artifacts that symbolized their noble heritage prior to the us occupation prior to the second world war judging the corridor ahead savage jerked his eyes furtively to the left through a doorway that led outside the five americans led by the distinguishedlooking expensively dressed man he remembered from the mountain retreat and the harrisburg hospital hurried with strained long strides across the crowded courtyard nearing the shrine the only reason they didnt break into a run savage guessed was that they knew their skin had attracted too much attention to them already a commotion here would provoke a rapid police response the jasminescented corridor veered to the right struggling to avoid further groups of meditating japanese savage and rachel zigzagged turned sideways twisted and veered desperate to reach an exit on the left they burst from the shrine into blinding sunlight faced another wide courtyard heard indignant japanese voices behind them american voices apologizing and started to run im certain savage said past the courtyard another pathlined with treesbeckoned the welldressed man the one with the mustache who seems to be their leader midfifties sandy hair eyes like a politician yes from a door in the shrine i got a look at him rachel said racing in my memory of the harrisburg hospital he came to visit me he said his name was words that were never spoken made savage shiver philip hailey as useful a name as any other anonymous waspishly american kamichi and akira what happened to their bodies they were hurried away the police werent informed so much blood that corridor of the hotel has now been remodeled who killed them damn it and why the motive for the murders relates to the conference but the purpose of the conference is not your business we expect to identify whoever was responsible consider the topic closed my purpose in coming here was to express our sympathy for your suffering and to assure you that everything possible is being done to avenge the atrocity in other words stay out of it do you have any choice think of this money as compensation weve also paid for your hospital bills incentives demonstrations of our good faith in return we count on your good faith dont disappoint us and good old phil hadnt needed to add if you dont cooperate if you dont keep away from our affairs well mix your ashes with kamichis and akiras spurred by fear savage raced harder japanese pilgrims darted to the side glaring in outrage at this violation of the shrines peaceful atmosphere rachels lowheeled shoes rapped on the concrete courtyard the treelined path seemed to widen as savage charged toward it ten yards five sweating he surged into its funnel hearing rachel exhale beside him he also heard shouts with a frantic glance backward he saw the five men led by philip hailey lunging out of the temple and across the courtyard forsyth hailey yelled stop forsyth savage tensed with shocked recognition forsyth was the alias i used in the hospital roger forsyth but i was never in that hospital i never met philip hailey so how could he know damn it forsyth stop again the objects before him seemed to shimmer as if the path the trees and bushes along it werent real but the urgent footfalls of the men in the courtyard sounded very real savage strained to run faster rachel are you okay can you keep up these shoesshe breathedwerent built for a marathon she kicked off the shoes and sprinted next to him her long strides billowing her loose cotton skirt forsyth hailey yelled doyle for gods sake stop doyle in virginia beach thats what mac said my name was savage thought robert doyle and thats who the bartender told the police killed mac ahead the path curved toward the right but just before the curve another path intersected with it savage slowed he couldnt know what lay beyond the curve perhaps a barrier staring desperately to the right he saw that the intersecting path formed a straight line for quite a distance it was almost deserted well be in the open easy targets he spun toward the left and saw that this side of the intersecting path had several tangents along the way tugging rachels hand he sprinted toward the left as hailey and his men rushed closer doyle savage almost drew the beretta from beneath his jacket but so far hailey and his men hadnt shown any weapons despite their evident determination to stop savage from continuing to search for answershad they been responsible for the attack on akiras home last nightthey werent foolish enough to start shooting and cause the japanese pilgrims to panic and the shrines attendants to alert the authorities hailey and his men have to kill us in private quietly or theyll never get out of the park before the police block off the exits savage thought if theres shooting every caucasian in the area even blocks away will be questioned racing past bushes savage saw another path to his right and twenty yards farther one on his left but the path to his left would lead back toward the shrine for a startling instant savage was reminded of the maze in mykonos through which he and rachel had fled her husbands men a labyrinth assessing the path to his right he saw that it too had many tangents thick shrubs and trees flanked them come on he told rachel veering right doyle another intersection which way savage wondered to the rightother paths straight aheada sharp angle that also led right to the leftnothing dead end a barrier of trees and bushes cant get trapped savage thought and almost charged straight ahead before he realized that hailey would think as he did have to keep moving cant get cornered but why should the trees and bushes be a trap abruptly savage corrected his direction and dodged to the left pulling rachel with him the path was short the dead end threatened spotting a gap between shrubs savage gripped rachel and urged her through it stooping squirming after her he squeezed past trees crawled under branches struggled up a slope snaked around boulders and crouched in a thicket his shoes sinking into a deep moist unpleasant mulch bushes surrounded them the park was a perfect blend of artifice and chaos the meticulously tended paths in contrast with the formlessness of nature a wilderness in downtown tokyo canopied by leaves tickled by ferns savage inhaled the mulchs loamy fragrance and drew his beretta rachels breasts heaved sweat trickling off her forehead her eyes wide with apprehension he motioned for her not to speak she nodded rapidly emphatically ready with the pistol he stared down the slope the woods so thick he couldnt see the path the cloying leaves buffered sound hurried footsteps urgent breathing frustrated curses seemed to come from far away but savages hunters couldnt have been more than twenty yards below which fucking way how do i know where they must have gone over here no there they wouldnt choose a trap this other path heads toward that other path which heads toward the western exit damn it give me the radio christ the labored voice belonged to hailey savage realized but with frightening clarity he remembered the voice not from the shouts that had chased him out of the shrine instead from the cultivated threatening ohsoconfident imperious aristocrat whod tried to bribe him in the hospital and implied a death sentence if savage didnt back off false memory yes but it made no difference i didnt back off you son of a bitch savage thought and if its death you want to talk aboutsavage clutched the beretta lets debate below him past the dense tangle of trees and shrubs he heard hailey say beta this is alpha hailey evidently spoke to the radio hed told one of his men to give him weve lost them instruct all units block all exits from the park in the distance sirens wailed the distinctive alternating highlow blares of police cars approaching had the disturbance at the shrine been sufficient for attendants to phone the authorities christ hailey said beta fall back avoid all contact with the sirens reached a crescendo their wail diminishing wait hailey said the wails receded farther fainter beta disregard fallback order maintain surveillance on exits assume camouflage status out his tone changed less loud as if he addressed the men beside him lets go which way a man on the path asked how the hell do i know split up check all the paths maybe theyve doubled back one thing were sure ofthey cant get out and theyre bound to attract attention footsteps scurried from the area veering down various lanes what if theyre in the woods a receding voice said hope to god theyre not haileys voice diminished a hundred and eighty acres wed need fucking tonto and rin tin tin to find them no theyll feel trapped theyll want to get out of here as quick as they can before we block off the exits a breeze rustled branches birds sang this section of the park became silent savage exhaled softly slowly and lowered his beretta when he turned toward rachel hunkered behind him in the bushes he saw her open her mouth to speak quickly he put a hand to her lips and forcefully shook his head he pointed toward the unseen path below and shrugged as if to indicate that one of the men might have stayed behind she flicked her eyes in acknowledgment he removed his hand and eased his hips to the ground straining to be quiet sweat trickled down his face the shadows of trees cooled his brow but fear still churned his stomach how long will they search he thought besides the men who chased us how many others does hailey have who is he why am i a threat to him how did he find us the nagging questions made savages temples throb forsyth he called me forsyth then doyle but why both names and why last names why didnt he call me roger or bob because a first name is used for a friend but a last names for someone you hate or yes or what or control during seal special warfare training the instructors always chose our last names and always made them sound as if they were calling us shitheads but this isnt the seals hailey looks like a corporate executive or a politician and for whatever reasons he sure wants me out of the way savage frowned suddenly hearing voices on a path he didnt understand what they were saying suspected that the bushes muffled their words then realized that the words were japanese the speakers didnt sound frantic or angry but rather seemed entranced by the gardens he relaxed his tight grip on his handgun a further glance toward rachel forced him to smile she was tugging at her cotton top trying to fan the sweat that had trickled onto her breasts he averted his gaze from the dark stains that emphasized her nipples pulled his own damp shirt from his chest flicked a bug off his arm and pretended disgust it did the trick her blue eyes brightened tension slowly draining from her but at once she seemed to remember something scrunched her forehead and pointed toward her rolex watch savage knew what she meant it was almost eleven oclock they were due to be at the restaurant in the ginza district at noon ready for akiras phone call if akira had a chance to phone maybe the police hadnt believed his story about defending himself against the three intruders maybe theyd taken akira to headquarters for intensive questioning maybe but maybe not if akira phoned the restaurant at the scheduled time and savage and rachel werent there hed phone again at six pm as theyd agreed that was the point of a backup planto allow for contigencies but what if we cant get out of here by six savage thought the next contact time was nine in the morning and if that didnt work if savage and rachel still couldnt get away from hailey by then akira would assume the worst he might go to ground the only chance for contact was the further backup plan of savages phoning akiras home but eko didnt speak english her sole instructions were to answer moshi moshi helloif akira was safe and haia rude tone of yesif akira was threatened and wanted savage to run christ we didnt plan enough savage thought were professionals but were used to protecting others not ourselves we need protectors as it is trying to defend ourselves were too involved weve got fools for clients and we screwed up we assumed that akira would be the only one in danger but now get control savage told himself youre safe for the moment and even if its impossible to get to the restaurant by noon six pm is a long way off yes thats what worries me he thought anything can happen if hailey and his men are stubbornand savage assumed that they would bewe wont get out of here till dark and then we cant just walk out well have to go over a wall and in a city of twelve million japanese with only a few thousand americans living here well attract as much attention well be as conspicuous as godzilla shit savage mustered the strength to subdue his increasing distress and turned yet again to rachel leaves on her skirt dust on her cheeks dangling strands of auburn hair despite all those imperfections she looked as beautiful as spirited angular sharply featured and glowing as only rachel could look i love you savage wished he could take the risk of telling her instead of violating silence he leaned close and gently kissed the tip of her nose tasting her dusty sweatsalty skin she closed her eyes shuddered reopened her lids blinked nervously and stroked his hair remember savage told himself until this is over shes your principal not your lover and akiras waiting maybe and haileys men are out there certainly so what are you going to do move savage gripped rachels elbows kissed her and turned her pointing toward the thickets beyond them she mouthed silent words it took him a moment before he realized what shed silently told him a familiar refrain was ill follow you to hell they squirmed through the mulch through the forest the park had frequent low hills on occasion thickets gave way to stretches of waisthigh ferns which savage and rachel avoided anxious not to crush the ferns and leave a path in case haileys men managed to follow them staying among the trees savage took his bearings from the passage of the sun imitating its movement heading westward he worried that when they reached a path a sentry would see them rushing across it but this section of the park was evidently extremely remote for they never did reach a path though the temperature felt like low sixties comparable to october weather in new england he and rachel sweated from exertion their dusty clothes snagged on branches rachels skirt tore worse because shed been forced to kick off her shoes to be able to outrun hailey and his men from the shrine her feetdespite the mulchbecame scratched and bloody savage took off his shoes and gave her his socks hed have let her have the shoes as well but they were much too big for her and would have added blisters to her scratches as it was without socks he developed blisters sometimes where the mulch was too deep he carried her their progress slowed by one pm they slumped to the ground exhausted this parks enormous rachel said and the japanese claim theyve run out of space not that im complaining she massaged her feet hailey would have caught us by now if it werent for she cocked her head do i hear traffic savage focused his attention the dense trees around them buffered sound but beyond it did seem a rush of energy made him stand ill check he made his way through the mulch and trees smiled at what he saw and quickly came back theres a wall about fifty yards ahead weve reached a street thank god at once she looked troubled but now what haileys men are probably still looking for us theyll assume theres a chance well go over a wall whoever hailey is his reinforcements have to be limited theyd need to be widely spaced to watch every section of the wall around the park but youre rightas soon as one of them saw us hed radio for the others to converge with your feet hurt we couldnt outrun them savage thought about it lets follow the wall with no basis for choosing one direction instead of another he arbitrarily decided on north the wall was high enough to conceal them low enough for them to climb over if they needed to as they moved along it weaving past bushes rachel limping savage imagined akiras unease if hed been able to call the restaurant at noon failing to make contact what would akira fear had gone wrong how would he react what would he do until the next scheduled call at six the wall angled east then north again after sixty yards savage heard japanese voices tensed crouched peered beneath low concealing branches and saw an eastwest path traffic was louder to the left a gap in the wall formed an exit from the park cars and pedestrians swarming past beyond it savage scanned the exhausthazed street and squirmed backward through shrubs until he and rachel could talk without being overheard overhanging boughs cloaked them with shadows i didnt see any americans he said not that it matters they wouldnt be in the open for all we know theyre directly behind the wall at each side of the exit or in a van across the street or in other words nothings changed we still cant get out of here savage hesitated yes then what do we wait for dark rachels eyes widened then well miss akiras next call at the restaurant if we try to leave now the odds are against us haileys men wed be stopped wed never reach the restaurant savage said i dont know why hailey wants us so bad but id sooner depend on akiras patience than on haileys losing patience i feel so is this the way you normally live normally if you can call it that ive been with you for less than two weeks and already i feel like ive been through several wars how do you stand it right now after having fallen in love with yousavage swallowedim beginning to wonder what i wish what makes me want to keep going is tell me its foolish to think about a beach near cancun id like to take off your swimsuit id like to make love in the surf in the moonlight dont stop describe the feel of the waves i cant what i mean is i dont dare make love to me dont dare distract myself savage said my love for you could make me so careless it kills you at the moment how long did you say we had to wait till dark then theres plenty of time when i close my eyes i can hear the surf she reached for him and she was right when he closed his eyes as they tenderly languidly embraced savage could hear the surf rachel slept while savage watched over her the shadows thickened near sunset she wakened beautiful despite puffy aftersleep now its your turn she said no i have to sleep she said youre no good to me if youre exhausted her blue eyes twinkled but suppose haileys men rachel gently removed the beretta from his hand and savagerecalling last nightwas well aware that she could use it at the same time he was also aware of the trauma she repressed her hand shook on the pistols grip with determination she held the gun firmly youre sure he asked how else will we get to cancun if something makes you afraid ill wake you provided theres time and the target isnt obvious savage squinted youre thinking ill lose control again shoot keep shooting and maybe for no reason no savage said im thinking you dont deserve to belong in my world to hell with your world i want to belong with you put your head down she said he resisted do it she said on my lap if youre tired youll make mistakes dont fight me there yes there thats right oh yes that feels so good she shivered right there its after six weve missed akiras next call hell be nervous yes but hell call again at nine tomorrow unless he has problems in the meantime we should never have separated there wasnt an option rachel said the way you talk about him the bond between you it almost makes me jealous savage chuckled remember where my head is just close your eyes and keep it there i doubt ill sleep you might if you think about that beach near cancun imagine the rhythm of the waves on the shore even if you dont sleep relaxing will do you good r and r is that what you call it so youre ready for what well be facing as soon as its dark ill wake you rachel said thats a promise believe me i want to get out of here rachels teeth chatteredless from fear than cold savage sensed in the dark as the temperature kept dropping he draped his jacket around her shoulders and guided her farther along the wall hed decided that trying to leave through a path from the park was possibly more dangerous during the night than in daylight haileys hidden men would have a safer chance of killing them and escaping under cover of the neon confusion of tokyo s nightlife reversing their earlier direction savage led rachel southward reached a western jog in the wall and followed its angle unseen branches tugged at his shirt and threatened his eyes if not for the halo of dense traffic opposite the wall he couldnt have found his way horns blared engines roared enough savage said haileys pissing me off this spots as good as any if we go much farther well circle the park screw it lets go savage raised his arms to grip the top of the wall pulled himself up so his eyes showed just above the wall and warily studied the street below him headlights surged past a japanese man and woman strolled beneath him along a sidewalk otherwise there were few pedestrians savage dropped back onto the ground i didnt see anything to make me change my mind are you ready as ill ever be she mustered resolve better give me a boost savage put his arms around her legs and lifted feeling her skirt and thighs against his cheek a moment later she squirmed upward out of his grasp as soon as she reached the crest inching over he hurriedly climbed after her together they dangled from the opposite side heart pounding savage landed first and helped her down so her stockinged feet wouldnt be injured if her full weight struck the concrete checking both ways along the sidewalk savage barked quickly cross the street a man had appeared from shadows a hundred yards to his left headlights revealed the mans face a caucasian he blurted something to a radio in his hand and raced toward savage and rachel fumbling for an object beneath his suitcoat do it savage said cross the street but the blazing cars formed a constantly moving barrier we cant stay here to savages right opposite the caucasian running toward them another caucasian appeared racing to flank them well be now savage said he grabbed rachels hand saw a slight break in traffic and darted off the sidewalk headlights streaked toward them brakes squealed savage kept running he still gripped rachels hand although she no longer needed urging in the next lane another speeding car made rachel curse she surged in front of him horns shrilled the stench of exhaust flared savages nostrils his stride lengthened they reached the streets divider wind from rushing cars flapped rachels skirt breathing hard savage glanced behind him and saw the two caucasians rushing along the sidewalk assessing traffic they searched for a break between cars so they could sprint across the street savage waved at drivers in the opposite lanes warning them that he and rachel were about to race across a toyota slowed savage took the chance and bolted rachel charging next to him they dodged another car and reached the far sidewalk storefronts gleamed pedestrians gaped an alley beckoned as savage ducked into it he glanced again behind him seeing the two caucasians bolt from the sidewalk at the same time he sensed an object looming toward him pivoting startled he saw a van veer out of traffic it aimed toward the alley he turned to run but not before the vans windshield starred holes stitched it glass imploding bullet holes the van hit the curb with a jolt it heaved above the sidewalk walloped down veered kept surging and smashed through a storefront to the left of the alley metal scraped glass shattered despite the explosive impact savage thought he heard screams from within the van for certain he heard pedestrians scream and shouts from the men across the street several cars skidded to a stop rachel trembled frozen with shock run savage said he tugged her the compulsion of fear canceled her stunned paralysis she raced past garbage cans along the dark alley but what if the alleys a trap savage suddenly thought suppose haileys men are in here no they cant be everywhere who shot at the van who was driving the van dismay racked savages mind confusion threatened his sanity someone wants to stop us someone else wants us to search who why what the hell are we going to do they reached the next street an approaching taxi made savages chest contract he flagged it down shoved rachel inside and scrambled after her saying ginza hoping the driver would understand that they wanted to go to that district the driver wearing a cap and white gloves frowned at the disheveled appearance of his harried caucasian passengers he seemed uncertain whether he wanted savage and rachel to be his customers but savage held up several thousandyen bills the driver nodded pulled away expertly merging with speeding traffic savage heard the increasing wail of sirenswith no doubt where they were headed straining not to show his tension he could only hope that the driver wouldnt decide that his passengers had something to do with the sirens the taxi turned a corner police cars swiftly approached in an opposite lane their sirens louder flashers blazing then the cruisers were gone and though the taxis driver glanced after them he didnt stop savage touched rachels hand her fingers trembled amid dense traffic that somehow kept flowing they finally reached the ginza district akira had explained that ginza meant silver place and referred to the fact that several hundred years ago the national mint had been located here since then the area had developed into tokyo s major shopping center with seemingly endless stores bars and restaurants the closest equivalent savage could imagine was new york s times square before the junkies hookers and porno shops had contaminated its glamour neon savage had never seen so much of it everywhere he looked brilliant lights turned the night into day an awesome combination of electrified colors some constantly blazed others pulsed or flashed messages in a row along buildings like a massive radiant ticker tape the glare of congested headlights added to the spectacle welldressed pedestrians crowded the exciting streets savage had no intention of showing the driver akiras note which in japanese provided directions to the restaurant where akira was supposed to call the authorities might question all taxi drivers whod picked up caucasians and savage wanted to keep the rendezvous site beyond suspicion besides he and rachel werent due there again until akiras next scheduled call at nine tomorrow morning but savage had other motives that compelled him to reach this district for one thing the comparatively few caucasians in the city tended toward the ginza s glittering nightlife and he and rachel needed desperately to blend in for another they needed fresh clothes but having been followed so expertly they didnt dare return to the railway station where theyd left their travel bags in a locker a surveillance team might be waiting on the chance that savage and rachel would retrace their steps and attempt to retrieve their belongings arigato savage told the taxi driver pointing toward the curb the whitegloved man pulled over counted the money savage gave him and nodded with satisfaction with a flick of a frontseat lever he opened the door in back savage and rachel got out as the taxi drove away savage became more aware of the blazing lights around him the din of traffic and music from bars overwhelmed him exhaust fumes assaulted his lungs pungent cooking odors drifted from restaurants wanting to rush he and rachel were forced to match the pace of the crowd so they wouldnt attract attention but despite their efforts to look calm they did attract attention japanese pedestrians kept staring at them because caucasians are unusual even in the ginza district savage wondered or because our faces are dirty our clothes torn rachels limp and the socks on her feet didnt help savage led her toward gleaming storefronts weve got to find he halted abruptly before an electronics shop stunned by the image on television sets in the window no sound came through the glass not that it mattered the words that matched the startling scenes would have been incomprehensible to him the text in japanese but he didnt need an interpreter to make him understand the dismaying significance of what he watched heart sinking again he saw a ghost muto kamichi kunio shirai the man hed seen sliced in half at the nonexistent medford gap mountain retreat harangued thousands of japanese protestors holding up antiamerican signs outside the gates of a us air force base american soldiers stood nervously on guard beyond the fence the news report was similar to the tv footage savage had watched three days ago in america and the photographs hed seen this morning on the front page of newspapers in vending machines at central station with two important differences the earlier protests had been outside us civilian buildings and the demonstrators numerous to begin withhad increased dramatically not only in size but intensity the grimeyed faces of american officials appeared on the array of television screens savage recognized the us secretary of state haggard his brow furrowed being interviewed by dan rather the image shifted to the presidents press secretary tensely answering questions from reporters at once kamichishiraiwas back on the screens inciting the protestors whatever his name the grayhaired slackjowled slightly overweight midfiftyish man who resembled a weary executive projected an unexpected charisma when he stepped in front of a crowd his commanding eyes and powerful gestures transformed him into a spellbinding zealot with every jab of his karatecallused hands the crowd reacted with greater fervor their expressions distorted with outrage this new demonstration must have happened today while haileys men trapped us in the park savage said he turned toward rachel her pallor made him frown are you all right she shrugged impatient as if the blood that soaked her socks hardly mattered whats going on what caused this some incident we dont know about savage shook his head i think kamichihe quickly addedshirai doesnt need an incident i think the point is america americain japan but america and japan are friends not if you believe those demonstrators savage sensed movement behind him and nervously pivoted japanese pedestrians crowded toward the television screens lets get out of here he said im awfully selfconscious they squirmed through the thickening crowd savages veins chilled his contracting muscles stopped aching only when he reached the comparative openness of the normally congested sidewalk but all of a sudden rachel said why the demonstrations are larger more dangerous catalyzed by kamichi shirai i cant get used to calling him that savage said the man i drove to pennsylvania to a hotel that doesnt exist in my reality i drove him there to me the hotel does exist but all rightsavages mind whirled seized by jamais vulets call him shirai hes the cause of the demonstrations i dont know why i cant imagine the source of his power but he akira and i are somehow connected a sudden thought made savage face her the former emperor hirohito died in january of eightynine rachel kept walking yes and after japan s defeat in world war two macarthur insisted on a new japanese constitution even before that when japan surrendered in fortyfive america insisted that hirohito go on the radio and not only announce the unconditional surrender but renounce his divinity and publicly tell his people that he was human not a god i remember reading about it rachel said the announcement shocked japan and helped macarthur reconstruct the country but one of the strictest articles in the new constitution was that church and state had to be separated by law religion and politics were totally severed whats that got to do with hirohitos death his funeral in violation of the constitution but with no objection from america political and religious rites were combined because of japan s economic power every important nation sent its highest representatives a whos who of international government and all of them stood passively under wooden shelters in a pouring rain while a japanese honor guard escorted hirohitos coffin into a shrine where behind a screen shinto rites traditional japanese religious funereal rites were performed and no outsider said wait a minute this is illegal this is how the pacific war got started they respected a great mans death rachel said or they almost shit their pants in fear that if they objected to the shinto rites japan would get so angry it would cut off their credit hell japan finances most of america s budget deficit no country would dare object if japan reverted to its former constitution as long as japan has the moneyand the powerits government can do what it wants thats where your argument falls apart rachel said japan s government is responsible while moderates rule it but what if kamichishirai takes command suppose the old ways come back and a radical party assumes control did you know that japan supposed to be nonmilitaryspends more on defense than any nato country except america and theyre suspicious of south korea and china s always worried them and savage realized he was talking too loud japanese pedestrians frowned at him rachel kept limping come on weve got to do something about your feet a brightly lit sportswear shop attracted savages gaze he and rachel stepped inside there were almost no customers when two clerksa young man and womanbowed in greeting they looked puzzled by rachels stockinged feet savage and rachel bowed quickly in return and proceeded through the store in addition to athletic clothes there were jeans tshirts and nylon jackets rachel made a stack in her arms and looked questioningly at the female clerk who seemed to understand that rachel wanted to know if there was a changing room the clerk pointed toward a cubicle in the back where a drape functioned as a door adding thick white running socks and a pair of reeboks to her pile rachel disappeared behind the drape in the meantime savage chose a pair of brown socks to replace the pair hed given rachel his pants were filthy his shirt soiled with sweat he picked up replacements as soon as rachel came out of the cubicle wearing stonewashed jeans a burgundy top and a blue nylon jacket that matched the cobalt of her eyes savage went in to change glancing periodically through a corner of the drape to make sure no one who looked threatening entered the store while rachel was unprotected eight minutes later they paid and left the store carrying their dirty clothes in a bag which they dumped in a trash container a few blocks away these shoes make all the difference rachel sighed it feels so good not to be limping not to mention we dont look like we slept in a ditch savage wore khaki slacks a yellow shirt and tan windbreaker the combination made his chameleon green eyes seem tinged with brown hed combed his hair in the changing room as had rachel a few smudges on our faces all in all though not bad in fact you look lovely blarney but i never turn down a compliment the bonus is now that weve changed clothes itll be harder for witnesses at the park to identify us if the police decide to pick us up savage studied her with admiration you are catching on given the right teacher and the proper motivation feari learn damned fast she wrinkled her brow that van at the park it seemed to veer out of traffic and aim toward the alley toward us hailey must have had vehicles circling the park so his men could radio to them if we were spotted our bad luck that the van was nearby our bad luck the unlucky ones were in the van rachel said the windshield starred as the van headed toward us did i see bullet holes savage pursed his lips and nodded someone was determined to stop haileys men from catching us but who and how did they know where wed be for that matter how were haileys men able to follow us through the subway we were careful i kept checking behind us while we walked from the railway station but then all at once they showed up at the park its like theyre thinking the same as us or even ahead of us you said earlier rachel brooded a lot of what weve done is predictable given the problems we need to solve but that park had nothing to do with our problems we just happened to go there yes savage said weve been intercepted too many times i dont understand how they keep doing it my godrachel turnedi just thought of something weve been assuming that haileys the one who wants to stop us right but what if weve got it turned around what if hailey wants to protect us what if the team in the van belonged to whoever wants to kill us and it was haileys men who shot out the windshield so wed keep searching for a moment savage had trouble understanding the twist in assumptions bewildering abruptly he felt pressure behind his ears something seemed to snap in his brain his vision paled his mind attacked by unsettling contradictions nothing seemed sure everything was false jamais vu fought with reality but something had to be true there had to be a solution he couldnt bear no three weeks ago his single burden had been to prove himself again now total confusion he wavered rachel grabbed his arm her eyes wide she steadied him you turned pale i think for a moment there im all right now no feel dizzy i feel a little off balance myself we havent eaten since yesterday she pointed here this restaurant we need to sit down rest get something in our stomachs and try to clear our heads now instead of savage guiding rachel she guided him and he felt so helpless he didnt resist the waitresswearing white makeup a kimono and sandalspresented them with a menu when savage opened it he again felt disoriented the items on the menu werent printed horizontally as in the west but vertically the contrast reinforcing his sense that everything was inverted his mind off balance mercifully english script appeared beside japanese ideograms still savage was so unfamiliar with unamericanized japanese food that all he could do was point toward a column on the left the restaurants recommendation for a dinner for two sake the waitress asked with a bow savage shook his throbbing head alcohol was the last thing he needed tea he asked doubting hed communicate hai tea she said with a smile and left her short steps emphasized by her tight kimono which in addition emphasized her hips and thighs in the background at the restaurants frenetic cocktail lounge a japanese countrywestern singer delivered a flawless version of hank williamss im so lonesome i could cry savage wondered if the singer understood the words or had expertly memorized them the midnight train is if were in trouble and we thought only akira would be in trouble savage shook his head i know i hate to imagine whats happened to him today rachel reached across the table but theres nothing we can do to help him not right now i told you rest the food will be here soon youve got to try to relax you realize how turned around this is me taking care of you rachel asked i love it i dont like feeling out of control youll have plenty of chance to exert control to do what you do best and soon but thank heaven not right now cant you hear the whippoorwill the restaurant was filled with cigarette smoke and the permeating aroma of sauces savage and rachel sat on cushions at a low table with a cavity beneath it that allowed them to dangle their legs an architectural concession to longlegged foreigners who wanted to sit according to japanese tradition but without discomfort kamichi shirai weve got to meet him savage said akira and i have to learn if he saw us die as we saw him die in his place if i were leading demonstrations against us air force bases id have protection that even you couldnt breach rachel said it wont be easy to meet him and since youre american i doubt you can simply call him up and arrange an appointment oh well talk to him all right savage said bet on it the waitress brought warm damp napkins then their meal arrived a clear soup with bits of onions and mushrooms seasoned with grated ginger yams in a mixture of soy sauce and sweet wine rice with curry sauce and boiled fish with teriyaki vegetables the various sauces accented each other superbly savage hadnt realized how hungry he was though the portions were more than ample he ate everything so ravenous he was hampered only slightly by his awkwardness with chopsticks but throughout he kept thinking about akira and how in the eighteen hours theyd been separated so much had changed that their arrangements for getting in touch with each other no longer seemed adequate i cant wait till nine tomorrow morning savage said he gulped the last of his tea left a generous tip with payment for the bill and stood i saw a pay phone in the lobby what are you calling akira the phone was in a corner away from the restaurants entrance and the coatcheck area partially sheltered by a screen that depicted brilliant sunflowers savage put coins in the phone and dialed the number akira had given him the phone rang four times savage waited his fingers cramping around the phone a fifth ring a woman suddenly answered eko savage couldnt fail to recognize her voice hai in response to her curt tone savages knees weakened hed just heard the signal that akira was in trouble that savage was supposed to leave japan as quickly as possible heart racing he desperately wanted to question her to find out what had happened but akira had emphasizedeko didnt speak english i cant just break contact savage thought i have to think of a way to communicate theres got to be a he heard a rattle on the phone another voice spoke abruptly a mans voice in japanese savages heart pounded faster as he listened dismayed unable to identify the speaker or to understand his furtive statements with equal abruptness the voice switched to english doyle forsyth damn it whatever you call yourself listen buddy if you know whats good for you if you want to save your ass youd better savage acted without thinking reflexively in shock he slammed down the phone his knees kept shaking madness in the background from the raucous bar the japanese countrywestern singer reprised hank williamss song so lonesome i could die who was it rachel asked they skirted the crowd on the neonblazing street heat from the massive walls of lights felt like sunlamps savages stomach churned he feared hed vomit the enormous meal hed eaten i never heard the voice before i cant judge his japanese accent but his english was perfect i thinkamerican no way to know whose side hes on he was angry impatient threatening i didnt dare stay on the line if the call was traced theyd know to search the ginza district one things sure akira wouldnt have permitted strangers in his home and eko wouldnt have answered hai without a reason the police dont have americans on their staff and how did he know to call me forsyth and doyle akira wouldnt have told them willingly savage knew how effective certain chemicals were in making reluctant informants cooperate i have to assume akiras in trouble but i dont know how to help him a siren made him flinch turning primed to run he saw an ambulance wail past he exhaled we cant keep walking the streets rachel said but where would we feel safe to spend the night theres no way i could sleep rachel said im so uptight i two choices find someplace to hide wait till morning and go to the restaurant hoping akira will call at nine but the restaurant might be a trap so whats the second choice rachel asked skip plans i told akira that even if eko gave me the warning signal over the phone i wouldnt leave japan i want answers surprised by the growl in his voice savage unfolded the note of directions akira had given him a wise and holy man akira said his sensei the man he wanted to talk to well lets see just how wise this holy man is in contrast with the glare of the ginza district this section of tokyo was shadowy oppressive a few streetlights and occasional lamps in narrow windows did little to dispel the gloom after paying the taxi driver savage got out with rachel and felt conspicuous despite the darkness his shoulder blades tensed this might not have been such a good idea rachel said savage studied the murky street the murmur of distant traffic emphasized the silence though the sidewalk seemed deserted even in the darkness savage detected numerous alleys and alcoves in any of which hidden eyes might be watching predators waiting to the taxis gone i dont see any others its too late to change our minds swell how can we be sure the driver even brought us to where we wanted to go rachel asked abraham believed by virtue of the absurd savage said reminding rachel of her favorite quotation at this point we have to trust swell rachel said again making the word sound like an expletive savage parted his hands a gesture of futility by the book the way to do this is to leave the taxi several blocks away and approach the area cautiously trying to get a sense of whether theres a trap he glanced around but tokyo has very few street names without the drivers help im not sure i could have found this place even from a few blocks away the place he referred to was a fivestory dingy concrete building without windows it looked like a warehouse out of place among the numerous tinywindowed apartment complexes along the street though those structures too looked dingy the building was dark i cant believe anyone lives here rachel said theres been a mistake just one way to learn yet again savage scanned the dark street he placed his hand on the beretta beneath his windbreaker and approached the front door it was steel savage looked but couldnt find a button for a doorbell or an intercom he didnt see a lock he tried the doorknob it turned apparently no one cares if strangers go in savage said he couldnt subdue the puzzlement in his voice stay close hey if i was any closer id be in your underwear savage almost grinned but her joke didnt ease his tension he pushed the heavy door open and frowned at a dimly lit corridor quickly he said tugging rachel in before their silhouettes made them easy targets as quickly he shut the door behind them and noticed that there wasnt a lock on this side either more puzzled he scanned the corridor it ended ten feet before him no doors on either side a staircase led up what kind of rachel started to ask but savage put a finger to his lips and she became silent he knew what shed meant to say though and nodded with understanding hed never seen a warehouse or an apartment building with a layout like this no sign on the wall to give directions or indicate where they were no mailboxes with names and buzzers no further door with a security system that prevented access to the core of the building the stairway was concrete as savage and rachel ascended warily their shoes scraped faintly echoing the next floor was also dimly lit the corridor short without doors a further staircase leading upward again they climbed savages nervousness increasing why werent akiras instructions complete he thought how the hell can i find where someone lives when there arent any doors or names on at once he realized that akiras instructions were complete the absence of doors eliminated the possibility of making a mistake there was only one continuing direction upwardand after an identically barren third floor and fourth floor there was only one destination the fifth floor where the staircase ended like the others this corridor was short but at its end a steel door beckoned savage hesitated his hand on the pistol beneath his jacket the door seemed larger the closer he came again as with the door through which he and rachel had entered the building savage couldnt find a doorbell or an intercom and this door too had no lock rachels eyes narrowed communicating bewilderment and apprehension savage squeezed her arm to reassure her then reached for the doorknob pulse hammering he changed his mind and decided that this doorseemingly unprotectedlooked too much like the entrance to someones apartment for him to just walk in holding his breath he raised his knuckles and rapped the steel door responded with muted thunks savage knocked again this time harder now the steel door reverberated a hollow echo beyond it five seconds ten seconds fifteen nothing no ones home savage thought or theres no apartment beyond the door or akiras sensei is too asleep to hear me or akiras sensei would be the best no professional sleeps that deeply screw it savage turned the doorknob pushed the door open and entered though rachel clutched the back of his jacket savage ignored her finding himself confronted by muted lights in a massive chamber no not muted lights the recessed bulbs beneath ledges that framed the ceiling glowed so dimly that muted wouldnt describe them twilight false dawn even those descriptions werent adequate the illumination was vaguer than candles but just sufficient to reveal an enormous dojo countless tatami mats on the floor with subtly reflecting polished cypress wood on the beams and panels of the burnished walls and ceiling like moonglow with deep dark spaces between each isolated recessed barely perceptible light savage felt overwhelmed awestruck as if he entered a temple the dojo though in semidarkness exuded an aura of sanctity of solemnity it was redolent of the sweat and pain the discipline and humility the mysticism of the oriental martial arts mind and body soul and sinew combined as one a sacred place and as savage inhaled its holy fragrance stepping forward metal slid against polished metal not a scrape not a grating sound not a rasp but a smooth oiled slippery hiss that made savages scalp prickle not one hiss but many all around him the dark walls seem to come alive to swell and give birth gleaming objects appeared reflecting the dim widely separated bulbs that rimmed the ceiling long curved glinting blades apparently hung in midair then the walls gave birth again shadows emerging assuming the shapes of men dressed totally in black with hoods and masks that covered their faces theyd been perfectly camouflaged against the walls and each gripped a sword hed drawn from a scabbard where savage stood a third of the way into the dojo he pivoted and saw that he was flanked on every side his spine froze he drew his beretta rachel moaned glancing toward the open door savage frantically wondered how he could concentrate on fighting to get rachel out and at the same time not be distracted by the need to keep rachel from getting hurt the beretta held fifteen rounds but there were certainly more than fifteen opponents the shots would be deafening however the muzzle flashes a distraction the swordsmen might hesitate for a couple of seconds enough time for us to get through the door and start scrambling down the stairs he thought but while he thought the door was slammed shut swordsmen stepped in front of it savages stomach sank in desperation he aimed toward the men who blocked the door lights blazed searing blinding the murky dojo suddenly as bright as the sun savage jerked a hand toward his eyes frantic to shield them from the stabbing rays in that instant his only warning was a swift subtle brush of air an unseen swordsman lunging toward him the beretta was yanked from savages grasp powerful fingers paralyzed nerves in his hand preventing him from firing distraught savage blinked fighting to focus his eyes to erase the whitehot image of multiple suns temporarily imprinted on his vision at last his pupils adjusted to the glare he lowered his hand his chest cramping cold despite the heat of the lights and studied his captors he understood now that their masks had not only helped to camouflage them in the shadows but that the eyeslits in the masks had guarded the swordsmens vision from the sudden disorienting glare rachel moaned again but savage was forced to ignore her distress to focus his attention every instinct on his captors without a weapon he couldnt hope to fight them with any chance of escaping he and rachel would be sliced to pieces but the man who yanked the pistol away could have cut me in half while i was blinded savage thought instead he stepped back to the wall his sword raised like the others does that mean theyre not sure what to do with us whether to kill us or as if on commandbut without any perceptible signal passing among themthey abruptly stepped forward the dojo seemed to shrink then they lowered their swords tips aimed toward savage and rachel and the dojo shrank even more another step forward each of the numerous footfalls almost silent on the tatami mats just a faint sibilance as if the woven reeds exhaled from the weight upon them savage pivoted slowly tensely judging the room searching for exits for the slightest sign of weakness on any flank but even if i do see a possible exit a corridor anything he thought theres no way i can get rachel past those swords without a weapon the masked hooded figures stepped forward yet again blades pointing gleaming their presence more constricting and as savage kept pivoting his eyes narrowed fiercely toward the wall opposite the one through which he and rachel had entered at the same time another undetectable signal seemed to pass eerily around the room and the swordsmen stopped their relentless advance the dojovirtually silent to begin withbecame as silent as the dead except for rachels repeated moans the swordsmen whod proceeded from the wall at the far end of the dojo shifted to the right and left leaving a gap through which a man whod been hidden behind them stepped forward he too gripped a sword and was dressed in black complete with a hood and mask unlike the others he was short gaunt as opposed to lithe his tentative footsteps suggesting fragility he pulled off his hood and removed his mask revealing the almost bald skull and wrinkled features of an elderly japanese his gray mustache and darkyetglowing eyes the only features that prevented his face from looking mummified but savage had the nervetingling impression that the tentative footsteps were actually the product of stealth that his fragility was deceptive that this old man could be more adept and dangerous than any of the others scowling at savage and rachel the old man gestured with his sword as if he intended to slash he suddenly darted each stride as fast as an eyeblink but he didnt slash toward savage rachel savage lunged in front of her prepared to sweep with his arms hoping to deflect the blade to duck under it and chop the brittlelooking bones of the old mans throat he didnt stop to consider what the blade would do to him if he failed he didnt matter rachel did savages gesture was reflexive his instincts making it impossible for him to do anything else but fulfill his professions mandateto protect in a blur he braced himself straining to prepare for the greater blur of the old mans lunge the flashing edge of the speeding blade so fast that savage could barely see it he parried with his arm though he knew before he began knew in his soul his attempt was futile but i cant just give up i cant let the sword hit rachel he imagined the blade flicking through his forearm the stub of his hand and wrist flipping through the air his arteries pulsing crimson but he didnt flinch as he misjudged the old mans timing and parried too soon his arm exposed as his soul had predicted he stared defiantly and the blade stopped with startling abruptness as if an invisible force had blocked it the swords polished gleaming edge hovered rigidly against the sleeve of savages jacket with fearintensified vision everything magnified before him and he saw severed threads on his sleeve jesus savage exhaled adrenaline flooding through him volcanic heat erupting upward toward his chest the old man squinted at him jerked his chin down a curt nod and barked an incomprehensible question but not to savage instead to someone behind him though how savage knew this he wasnt surebecause the old mans searing eyes as searing as the spotlights never wavered from savages defiant gaze hai someone answered in the background and savages heart swelled for he recognized the voice akira savage had never spoken anyones name more intensely or with greater confusion hai akira answered again and appeared through the gap in the swordsmen like them he wore black clothing almost like pajamas but the material rugged un like them he had no hood and mask his handsome rectangular face seeming all the more rectangular because his short black hair was combed straight from left to right the part in his hair severe had a somberness that made savage frown the melancholy in akiras eyes had become more deep more brooding more profound whats going on savage asked akira pursed his lips his cheek muscles hardening when he opened his mouth to respond however the old man interrupted barking another incomprehensible question to akira akira replied with equal unintelligibility the old man and akira exchanged two further remarks quick intense bursts that savage found impossible to interpret not just the words but the emotion that charged them hai this time the old man not akira used that ambiguous affirmative he jerked his chin down again another curt nod and raised his sword from the severed threads on savages sleeve the blade gleamed nearly impossible to track as with impressive speed the old man slid the sword into a scabbard tucked under a knotted black belt made of canvas the blade hissed in to the hilt akira came forward his expression controlled except for his melancholy his public self severely in charge of his private self stopping beside the old man he bowed to savage and rachel all day savage had felt hollow incomplete without akira but he hadnt realized how much he felt incomplete until now at last rejoined with his friend in america savage would have given in to impulse and reached for akiras hand perhaps in less public circumstances have clasped his shoulders to show affection but he resisted his western urge because akira was obviously behaving according to the expectations of those around him savage conformed to japanese protocol and bowed in return as did rachel its good to see you again savage said trying to imply strong emotion without embarrassing akira in front of the others by displaying it and to find that youre safe and i you akira swallowed hestitating i wondered if wed ever meet again because eko gave me the signal to run that akira said and other reasons the cryptic remark invited questions but savage restrained them he needed to learn what had happened to akira and to tell akira what had happened to them but other immediate questions insisted you still havent answered me savage gestured toward the swordsmen whats going on the old man barked again in japanese his voice deep and raspy permit me to introduce my sensei akira said sawakawa taro savage bowed repeating the name adding the obligatory term of respect tarosensei he expected another curt nod in response surprised when the old man braced his shoulders and imitated savages bow hes impressed by your bravery akira explained because we came in here savage shrugged in selfdeprecation considering what almost happened i was stupid not brave no akira said he means your attempt to protect your principal from his sword that savage raised his eyebrows but you know the rules it wasnt something i thought about i just responded to training and did it exactly akira said for tarosensei bravery means instinctive obedience to duty regardless of the consequence and thats all that saved us akira shook his head you were never in danger or at least only briefly while you entered after the door was slammed shut and tarosensei recognized you from my description he knew you werent a threat what you mean those men stalking toward us the son of a bitch was testing me taros aged voice rasped neither a son of a bitch nor a bastard savage gaped skin shrinking in astonishment you disappoint me the old man said though a foot and a half shorter than savage he seemed to tower i expected more never assume that because a stranger addresses you in his native language he doesnt understand your own taro glared savages face burned i apologize i was foolish and rude and more important careless taro said unprofessional i was about to compliment whoever trained you now blame the student not the teacher savage said with distress he remembered grahams corpse behind the steering wheel of his cadillac acrid exhaust fumes filling his garage while he drove for all eternity the fault is mine nothing excuses my behavior i beg your forgiveness tarosensei the old mans glare persisted then slowly dimmed perhaps you redeem yourself you learned from your instructor to admit mistakes in this case savage said with regard to information about your country my instructor was akira but again blame the student not the teacher he warned me to be careful not to give offense ill try harder to behave like a japanese by all means taro said try but success will elude your grasp no outsider no gaijin can ever truly understand and hence behave like a japanese i dont discourage easily taros wrinkled lips tightened possibly in a smile he addressed akira in japanese akira replied taro turned to savage im told youre a serious man what we call sincere a word that should not be confused to mean your strange western custom of pretending that your public thoughts and private thoughts are identical the old man debated i may have been hasty your offense is forgiven i invite you to accept my humble hospitality perhaps you and your principal would care to enjoy some tea yes very much savage said fear has a habit of making my mouth dry he gestured toward taros sword and did his best to make his eyes crinkle trying to sound respectful humble and ironic all at once hai taro inflected the word so it seemed a laugh pleasehe bowedcome as taro led savage rachel and akira toward the swordsmen at the rear of the dojo the old man motioned subtly with his hand instantly in unison the hooded figures sheathed their blades the combined slippery sound the highpitched metallic ssss of polished steel against steel again made savages skin prickle tarosensei a question savage said im troubled but please understand i mean no offense in asking you have my permission the old man said when we entered after you recognized that we werent enemies savage hesitated i can understand why you wanted to test us you needed to know how wed react when apparently threatened to determine if you could depend on us outsiders gaijin but even so savage frowned there was no guarantee i wouldnt panic suppose id lost my nerve and started shooting even though i didnt have an escape plan and hence would have wasted ammunition that i might have needed later many of these men would have died your question is wise taro said but the test had controls oh in what way im sure these men are superbly skilled their swords unbelievably fast but not as fast as a bullet if youd raised your weapon taro didnt need to complete his sentence as savage approached the rear of the dojo he saw two men concealed behind the row of swordsmen and each man held a tautly strung bamboo bow a fiercely barbed arrow strung ready at any instant to be fired yes savage thought if id seemed about to shoot id never have had a chance to pull the trigger in a rush another question insisted but he forced himself not to ask cold sweat trickled down his back would the archers have shot to disable his gun arm or to kill tarosenseis building is selfsufficient akira explained they sat crosslegged on cushions at a low cypress table the small room had latticed paperthin walls with exquisite penandink drawings hanging upon them it reminded savage of akiras home in an obvious display of deference taro dismissed a servant and poured tea into small thin beautifully painted ceramic cups each depicting a colorful scene from nature a waterfall a blossoming cherry tree with a minimum of brush strokes akira continued explaining the fifth floor of course is the dojo on the other floors there are dormitories a shrine a library a cooking and eating area a shooting range everything that tarosenseis students need to attempt to perfect their spirits minds and bodies to make them as one akira paused to pick up his cup placing his left hand under it using his right hand to support the cup on one side he sipped the tea and savored it perfect tamsensei savage watched akira carefully and imitated the way he gripped the cup prior to their leaving america akira had explained the protocol of the tea ceremony its sanctified tradition dated as far back as the fourteenth century influenced by zen buddhism the ritualistic sharing of tea was intended to produce a condition of purity tranquillity and harmony known in japanese as wabi when strictly performed the ceremony took several hours and incorporated a minimum of three locations and servings accompanied by various foods the teamaster prepared each serving adding tea to hot water and whipping it with a bamboo whisk conversation was limited to gentle soothing topics the participants felt freed from time and the turmoil of the outside world on this occasion the ceremony had been starkly abbreviated of necessity but respect for the ritual still applied noting the solemnity of akira and his sensei savage quelled his urgent questions and raised the gleaming cup to his lips inhaling the fragrance of the steaming tea sipping the clear delicately flavored liquid my spirit feels comforted taro sensei savage bowed this quenches the thirst in my soul rachel added arigato tarosensei taro chuckled my notinadequate studenthe indicated akirataught you well akiras brown face became tinged with a blushing red he lowered his eyes in humility its rare to meet a civilized gaijin taro smiled and lowered his cup akira mentioned a library in this building most sensei would never allow their students to read thought interferes with action words contaminate reflex but ignorance is itself an enemy facts can be a weapon i would never permit my students to read works of fantasy novelshe gestured with disparagementthough poetry is another matter and i encourage my students to expand their spirits by composing haiku and studying such classic examples as those by the incomparable matsuo basho but books of information are mostly what my students read history in particular that of japan and america manuals of weaponry both ancient and modern the principles of locks intrusion detectors electronic surveillance equipment and various other tools of their craft also languages i require each of my students to be skilled in three apart from japanese and one of those languages must be english savage glanced surreptitiously at akira at last understanding how his counterpart had acquired so impressive a fluency in english but why the emphasis on english savage wondered because english was pervasive throughout the world or because of america s victory in world war two why did akiras expression become more melancholy as taro emphasized that his students had to be expert in america s history and language taro stopped talking and sipped his tea akira kept a close watch on his sensei apparently concluding that taro did not intend to say anything further for the moment that it would not be rude to break the silence he resumed his explanation when i was ten akira said my father sent me to tarosensei to study martial arts until i completed high school i came here five times a week for twohour sessions at home i religiously practiced what i had been taught most male teenagers in japan supplement their high school classes with intensive private tutoring in order to devote themselves to preparing for university entrance examinations these occur in february and march and are known as examination hell to fail to be accepted by a university and especially tokyo university is a great humiliation but as my studies with tarosensei became more demanding and intriguing i realized that i had no interest in applying to a university or rather that he and this institution would be my university despite my unworthiness tarosensei graciously accepted me for greater instruction on my nineteenth birthday i came here with a few belongings and never stepped outside for the next four years savage tightened his grip on his cup turning to rachel he saw that the surprise on her face was as strong as what he felt four years she was too amazed to blink a moderate amount of time considering the objective akira shrugged to attempt to become a samurai in our corrupt and honorless twentieth century the only option for a japanese devoted to the noble traditions of his nation committed to becoming a samurai is to join the fifth profession to make himself the modern equivalent of a samurai an executive protector because nowjust as thena samurai without a master is a warrior without a purpose a frustrated wanderer a directionless unfulfilled ronin savage gripped his frail teacup harder afraid hed break it but controlled by greater surprise and all those men in the dojo are tarosenseis advanced students many are about to graduate after the privilege of having studied with my master for almost four years akira replied you might compare them to monks or hermits except for grocers and other merchants who bring necessary goods no outsider is permitted to enter but the outside door was unlocked savage said and so was the door to the dojo in fact i didnt even see a lock anyone could walk in akira shook his head each door has a hidden bolt electronically activated although tonight the bolts were left open in case my enemies managed to follow me here an enticement so they could be subdued and questioned the stairway of course is a trap once the doors are sealed savage pursed his lips and nodded taro inhaled softly akira turned to him aware that his master intended to speak although my students retreat from the world taro said i do not wish them to be ignorant of it by means of newspapers magazines and television broadcasts theyre instructed in contemporary events but in these sequestered surroundings theyre trained to study the present with the same detachment that they do the past they stand apart watchers not participants because only by being objective can a protector be effective the essence of a samurai is to be neutral without expectations maintaining a stillness at his core taro considered his words bobbed his wizened head and sipped his tea the signal that others could speak my apologies tarosensei but another potentially indelicate question occurs to me savage said taro nodded in permission akira mentioned the corrupt age in which we live savage said in that case few young meneven japanese would be willing to shut themselves away and commit themselves to such arduous training yes few but sufficient taro said the way of the samurai is by definition limited to the most determined you yourself as ive been told committed yourself to the severest branch of america s armed forcesthe seals savage stiffened he strained not to frown at akira what else had akira revealed about him mustering discipline not to look troubled he replied but i wasnt shut off from the world and the military paid for my instruction this school four years of isolation surely few candidates could afford the financial expense of taro chuckled indeed and you warned me your question is indelicate americans do say what they think his goodhumored tone barely hid his disapproval he sobered none of my students bears any financial expense in coming here the only criteria for acceptance are ability and determination their equipment meals and lodging everything they require is given to them then how can you afford savage held his breath unable to bring himself to complete his further indelicate question taro didnt help but merely studied him the silence lengthened akira broke it with your permission tamsensei a flick of the eyes signified yes my master is also my agent akira said as he is for every student with strength and discipline enough to complete the course tarosensei arranges for my employment continues to advise me and receives a portion of everything i earnfor the rest of my life savage felt jolted thoughts raced through his mind if taro was akiras agent taro must have information about kunio shirai the man savage knew as muto kamichi and saw cut in half at the medford gap mountain retreat akira had said he worked with an american agent when assigned to america graham but graham had not been the primary agent taro was taro might have the answers savage needed but kamichishiraiwas never at the mountain retreat no more than we were savage thought he winced lancing crushing spinning and twisting jamais vu yet again assaulted his mind if we never met kamichi we couldnt have been hired to protect him savage thought so taro might know nothing about him but someone set this up someone arranged for akira and me to imagine we were hired who when at what point did jamais vu intersect with reality this much was sure savage knew akira had held back information in emphasizing that his agent was graham hed deliberately avoided drawing attention to taro was akira an enemy savages former terrible suspicion flooded through him chilling his soul his sense of reality had been so jeopardized that he feared he couldnt trust anyone even rachel no ive got to trust if i cant depend on rachel nothing matters again he realized the dilemma of trying to protect himself as well as rachel in trying to be his own principal he needed a protector who wasnt involved and at the moment that luxury wasnt possible im afraid i will be rude savage said i know that conversation over tea is supposed to be soothing but im too upset to obey the rules akira what the hell happened since we last saw you the question hung in the room akira whod been sipping tea gave no indication hed heard it he took another sip closed his eyes seemed to savor the taste then set down his cup and looked at savage the police arrived quickly akira sounded oddly detached as if what he described had happened to someoneelse one car then two then three as word of the situations gravity spread the coroner arrived police photographers a forensic team senior police officials at one point i counted twentytwo investigators in my home they listened to my account they made me repeat it several times their questions became more detailed their expressions more grave id rehearsed my story before they arrived id made necessary adjustments so the crime scene would be consistent with the robbery attempt i described and the murderous reaction of the intruders when they were discovered but this isnt america where multiple killings seem an everyday occurrence here violent crime involving handguns is rare the investigators were grim and methodical in my favor although id fired and killed with one of the intruders pistols id also used a sword in defending my home and thatas i anticipatedevoked tradition making me seem heroic as noon approached i was still being questioned i anticipated your concern if i didnt phone the restaurant on schedule so i asked permission to excuse myself and make a call to break an appointment imagine my concern when i learned that you werent at the restaurant to receive my call i hid my feelings and answered more questions by midafternoon the bodies had been removed eko mustered strength despite her grief and accompanied churis body to the morgue to make arrangements for his funeral in the meantime the investigators decided they wanted me to go with them to headquarters and dictate a formal statement on the street the police cars had attracted a swarm of reporters without making it seem i had something to hide i tried not to face their cameras but at least one man took my picture akiras voice became somber and savage knew why a protector had to be anonymous if a photograph was published akiras ability to defend a principal would be jeopardized because an assailant might be able to recognize and attack him before attacking the primary target in this case the potential complications were even more serious a newspaper photo of akira would draw the attention of his and savages hunters and possibly hinder their search it couldnt be helped savage said at headquarters while i dictated my statement the police checked my background id told them i was a security specialist several major corporations id worked for gave the police a positive assessment of me but i sensed that the police checked other sources whoever they spoke to the police soon treated me differently with deference i didnt understand their reaction but i certainly didnt argue when they told me i could leave but not to go far they made clear theyd want to talk to me again and after that rachel asked selfconscious her voice strained the first time shed spoken in several minutes an enemy wouldnt have had any trouble following the police car that drove me to headquarters akira said it turned out the police were so inexplicably deferential that they offered to drive me back to my home i politely declined pleading the need to walk and clear my head puzzled i found a side entrance from the building and tried to blend with the crowd on the street but i soon discovered i had company japanese skilled though not skilled enough for the next two hours i tried to elude them six oclock loomed quickly i managed to use a pay phone to call the restaurant on schedule knowing how distressed youd be if i didnt report but again you werent at the restaurant something was obviously wrong what happened to you soon savage said finish your story akira stared at his teacup seeking shelter in a public place a bar that wasnt so crowded that i wouldnt see my pursuers coming in i noticed a news report on a television behind the counter kunio shirai another demonstration he shook his head in dismay but this one was larger more intense almost a riot outside a us air force base whatever shirais trying to do hes turned up the pressure dramatically we saw the same report rachels forehead was knotted and somehow were connected with him savage said or with the man we knew as muto kamichi whom we never met but saw cut in half at the nonexistent medford gap mountain retreat the veins in akiras temples throbbed madness his eyes blazed i knew i had only one optionto seek safety with my mentor he glanced toward taro i didnt dare return to my home but i couldnt ignore my responsibility to eko on the chance that shed come back from being with churi at the morgue and arranging his funeral i used the phone in the bar to call my home and felt startled when she answered hai the warning signal to run i quickly asked her why strangers she blurted gaijin guns someone yanked the phone from her hand an american spoke japanese we want to help you he said come back i slammed down the phone before they could trace the call americans with guns in my home and they claim they want to help not likely the police would have posted guards to restrict reporters from the crime scene how did americans get inside akira glared his emotions finally showing if i could get to eko and rescue her we called her as well savage said at eleven tonight she gave us the warning signal before an american grabbed the phone they need her theyll question her but she knows nothing theyll scare her but shes valuable as a hostage i dont think theyll hurt her dont think isnt good enough akira snapped shes like a mother to me taro raised his wrinkled hands motioning for silence he spoke to akira in japanese akira responded his melancholy tinged with relief eyes bright he turned to savage my sensei has vowed to rescue her his most advanced students will leave a few weeks early tonight will be their graduation and ekos release i bet savage thought those guys upstairs looked as if there wasnt any obstacle they couldnt overcome whoevers in akiras house they wont know what hit them savage bowed to taro for my friend i thank you taro frowned you call akira a friend weve been through a lot together but the friendship is impossible taro said why because im a gaijin call it respect i like this man taro smiled enigmatically and i as you put it like you but we will never be friends your loss savage shrugged taro raised his head in confusion akira interrupted speaking solemnly to taro taro nodded yes an irreverent attempt to be humorous so american amusing but another reason that well never be friends then lets put it this way im a fellow protector a good one and i ask for professional courtesy savage didnt give taro a chance to react pivoting quickly toward akira he asked and then you came here where i waited in case my enemies arrived i couldnt imagine why you hadnt gone to the restaurant as we agreed i feared that you still wouldnt be there when i called again in the morning just as we feared for you after eko gave us the warning signal what happened savage focused his thoughts trying as best he could to restrain emotion to summarize objectively what theyd been through the chase at the meiji shrine the escape from the gardens the attack on the street but we dont know if haileys men were in the van or if they shot at the van rachels voice dropped plummeting toward despair more questions the answers keep getting farther away and maybe thats the point akira said to keep us confused off balance the obstacle race and the scavenger hunt savage said akira looked puzzled that was grahams view of life it fits while we search we try to elude whoever wants to stop us but we dont know which group is which akira said he repeated a word hed used earlier madness i may be able to help you taro said with regard to kunio shirai it took a moment before savage registered what taro had said chest contracting he stared in surprise at the deceptively frail old man before i explain i sense he told savage that you need to be assured i have no acquaintance with the name by which you knew him or falsely remember that you knew him in america jamais vu i believe you call it savage frowned straightened tensed no need to be alarmed my excellent studenttaro gestured toward akiraearlier described to me the impossible events at the nonexistent mountain retreat you saw each other die you saw a man called muto kamichi whom youve learned to call kunio shirai cut in half but none of it happened jamais vu indeed as good a description as any im a buddhist i believe that the world is illusory but i also believe that earthquakes tidal waves and volcanic eruptions are real so i force myself to distinguish between illusion and truth kunio shirai is real but at no time did i arrange for my excellent student to accompany himunder any nameto america ive never met the man ive never dealt with him through intermediaries i beg you to accept my word on this savage squinted felt his shoulders relax and nodded trapped in a sickening wavering assault on his consciousness he repeated to himself rachels favorite quotation abraham believed by virtue of the absurd very well taro said and turned to akira a great deal has happened in the six months since i last saw you in japan or at least in the undercurrents of japan the old mans eyes changed their pupils expanding as if he concentrated on an object far away in secret a small force has been gaining power even longer ago than six months it began in january of nineteen eightynine with the death of our esteemed emperor hirohito and with the forbidden shinto rites involved in his funeral savage felt rachel flinch beside him and recalled their conversation in the ginza district about this same subject taros eyes abruptly contracted as he shifted his attention from the imaginary distant object and steadied them laserlike on savage religion and politics the postwar constitution demanded their separation insisting that never again would gods will be used to control this nations government but words on a document imposed by a gaijin victor dont cancel tradition or suppress a nations soul in private the old ways are bound to persist in pockets among absolute patriots one of whom is kunio shirai his ancestors descend from the zenith of japanese culture the beginning of the tokugawa shogunate in sixteen hundred wealthy determined disgusted by our present corrupt condition he wants the ancient ways to return others share his vision powerful others they believe in the gods they believe that japan is the land of the gods that every japanese is descended from gods they believe in amaterasu the name eerily evocative made savage tingle he strained to remember when hed heard it beforeand suddenly recalled that akira had mentioned it on the way to dulles airport while he tried to teach savage and rachel about japan prior to flying here amaterasu savage nodded yes the goddess of the sun the ancestress of every emperor the ultimate mother of every japanese from the beginning of time taro cocked his ancient head he clearly hadnt expected savage to recognize the name few gaijin would i compliment you on your knowledge of our culture the credit belongs to akira hes as excellent a teacher as he was your student amaterasu what about her the old man spoke with reverence she symbolizes the greatness of japan our purity and dignity before our glorious ways were contaminated kunio shirai has chosen her as the image of his purpose the source of his inspiration in public he calls his movement the traditional japanese party in private however he and his staunchest followers refer to their group as the force of amaterasu savage straightened sharply what are we talking about imperialism is shirai trying to recreate what happened in the nineteen thirties a mix of religion patriotism and might to justify trying to dominate the pacific rim and no taro said the opposite he wants japan to become secluded the statement was so astonishing that savage leaned forward trying to repress the force in his voice that goes against everything that japan has accomplished since the end of the american occupation taro gestured in agreement the economic miracle japan has become the most financially powerful nation on earth what it failed to do militarily in the thirties and forties it achieved industrially in the seventies and eighties it subdues other countries economically we bombed hawaii in nineteen fortyone but failed to capture it now were buying it and huge chunks of mainland america and other nations as well but at a cost beyond money a terrible penalty the increasing destruction of our culture i still dont savage squeezed his thighs frustrated what does shirai want i mentioned that his ancestors date back to sixteen hundred the beginning of the tokugawa shogunate did akira explain what happened then taro asked only briefly there was too much to know too little time for him to you tell me i hope you appreciate the value of history i was trained to believe its imperative to learn from mistakes if thats what you mean savage said not only mistakes but successes taro braced his shoulders despite his frail body he seemed to grow in stature his eyes again assumed a faraway gaze history during the middle ages japan was inundated by foreign cultures the chinese the koreans the portuguese the english the spanish the dutch to be sure not all of these influences were bad the chinese gave us buddhism and confucianism for example as well as a system of writing and an administrative system on the negative side the portuguese introduced firearms which quickly spread throughout japan and almost destroyed bushido the ancient noble way of the warrior and the sword the spaniards introduced christianity which attempted to displace the gods to deny that japanese were divinely descended from amaterasu in sixteen hundred tokugawa iyeyasu defeated various japanese warlords and gained control of japan he and his descendants returned japan to the japanese one by one he banned foreigners the english the spanish the portuguese all were expelled the only exception was a small dutch trading post on a southwestern island near nagasaki christianity was exterminated travel to foreign countries was forbidden ships capable of reaching the asian mainland were destroyed only small fishing boats their designs restricting them to hugging the coast were allowed to be built and the consequence taro smiled for more than two hundred years japan was shut off from the rest of the world we experiencedenjoyedcontinuous peace and the greatest blossoming of japanese culture paradise at once the old mans face darkened but all of that ended in eighteen fiftythree when your countryman commodore perry anchored his squadron of american warships in yokohama bay they are still known by their bleak prophetic color perrys black ships he demanded that japan reopen its borders to foreign trade soon the shogunate fell the emperor formerly kept in seclusion in kyoto was moved to edo which soon changed its name to tokyo where the emperor became the figurehead ruler for politicians eager to exercise power its called the meiji restoration i believe in the emperor but because of that restoration the gaijin contamination resumed increased worsened taro paused assessing the effect on his audience rachel breathed and kunio shirai wants to return japan to the quarantine established in the tokugawa shogunate its easy to understand his intention taro replied as a tribe we no longer abide by the ancient ways our young people disrespect their elders and treat tradition with irreverence abominations surround us western clothes western music western food hamburgers fried chicken heavy metal taro pursed his lips in disgust eventually japan like a sponge will absorb the worst of other cultures and moneynot amaterasuwill be our only god you sound like you agree with shirai savage said with his motive not his method this building the four years of isolation that each of my students submits to they are my version of the tokugawa quarantine i despise what i see outside these walls youve joined him taro squinted as a samurai a protector i must be objective i follow events i dont create them my destiny is to be distant to serve present masters without involvement and without judgment the tokugawa shogunate insisted on that relationship between retainer and principal but i hope he succeeds he probably wont however the thrust of history moves stronger forward than backward shirai can use his wealth his influence and power to bribe to coerce and entice multitudes of demonstrators but on television ive seen the faces the eyes of those demonstrators theyre not devoted to the glory of their past theyre consumed by hate for outsiders in the present for those who dont belong to the tribe make no mistake pride controls them longrepressed anger because america won the pacific war because atomic bombs were dropped on our cities chilled savage noticed that akiras eyes had become more melancholy in despair with compassion savage recalled that akiras father had lost his first wife and his parents and his brothers and sisters because of the abomb that hit hiroshima and the fathers second wife akiras mother had died from cancer caused by radiation from the blast taros brittle voice rasped make no error whenever you speak to a japanese no matter his reserve and feigned politeness he remembers the bombs called fat man and little boy and this longrepressed rage is the power behind the multitudes shirai has gathered he wants retreat a return to the glorious sacred past but they want a toolongpostponed attack to the landofgods destiny domination itll never happen savage said flatly not under present circumstances greed insists and if shirai misjudges the multitudes he incites will outreach his control land possessions money thats what they want not peace and balance not harmony shirai was right to protest america s presence in japan away with you all of you but in the vacuum of your absence the force of amaterasu could become not a blessing but a curse savages muscles felt drained sitting crosslegged on the cushions at the low cypress table he leaned back on his hips and tried to diffuse his tension how do you know this his voice was strained a whisper i seclude myself but my many former students remain in contact and they have reliable sources kunio shirai for motives i admire has the potential to cause a disaster aggression not consolidation all i want is peace but if shirai pushes harder if he finds a way to attract even larger and more zealous followers savage spun toward akira does what happened or didnt happen at the medford gap mountain retreat have something to do with this akira raised his increasingly melancholy eyes tarosensei referred to seclusion at my fathers home which i maintain i preserve a piece of the past though im seldom there to enjoy it i wish now i had enjoyed it because after everything thats happened i no longer believe in protecting others i want to protect myself to retreat like tarosensei like the tokugawa shogunate then i guess wed damned well better talk to shirai savage said im tired of being manipulated he glanced toward rachel and put an arm around her and im tired he added of being a follower a servant a watchdog a shield its time i took care of what i want again he glanced with undisguised love toward rachel in that case youll lose your soul taro said the way of the protector the fifth profession is the noblest enough savage said all i want to do is akira what do you say are you ready to help me finish this black ships what are they shouting savage asked the seething crowd roared louder some jerking placards others shaking their fists their furious movements reminded savage of a roiling river it was ten am despite smog the sun was blinding and savage raised a hand to shield his eyes from the glare as he studied the enormous mob that filled the street for blocks their fury directed toward the us embassy how many savage thought he found it impossible to count an estimate perhaps as many as twenty thousand demonstrators they chanted rhythmically repeating the same brief slogan with greater intensity until the dinamplified echoing off buildingsmade savages temples throb theyre shouting black ships akira said in a moment the translation became needless the demonstrators changing to english from last nights conversation with taro savage understood the reference black ships the armada that america s commodore perry had anchored in yokohama bay in as a symbol of the demonstrators antipathy to america s presence in japan the image was fraught with emotion succinct effective but lest the message nonetheless fail to make its point the mob chanted something new america out gaijin out epilogue the key to the maze fortunes hostage what seemed an eternity ago when savage had met rachels sister joyce stone in athens and gone with her to the parthenon hed quoted from shelleys ozymandias to describe the lesson of those ruins look on my works ye mighty and despair round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away joyce stone had understood nothingwealth fame poweris permanent indeed take nothing for granted the future confronts interprets and more often than not mocks the past history false memory disinformation these issues as much as his nightmare haunted savage the paradox of the relentlessness of the deceit and treachery of time the truths of shelleys poem soon became evident after the discovery of the massacre at kunio shirais mountain retreat the japanese news media inundated its readers viewers and listeners with reports and speculations for seemingly endless weeks intrigued as much as baffled the nation demanded increasingly more details one item that attracted obsessive attention was the discovery of a diary that shirai had kept as hed said to savage and akira he intended to create a legend convinced that the nation would talk about it for a thousand years of course in his diary shirai did not reveal the lie at the core of the legend instead he attempted to bolster the legend by comparing himself to great historical figures to japanese heroes whod so boldly altered the course of their nations history that theyd achieved the magnificence of myth shirais intention had evidently been to release the diary shortly before or after his death so his followers could revere his written legacy just as they worshiped his kami the hero whom shirai most identified with was oshio heihachiro a political activist in the nineteenth century outraged by the poverty of the lower classes oshio had organized a revolt so committed to his cause that hed sold his belongings to buy swords and firearms for starving farmers in his rebels sacked and burned rich estates the city of osaka was soon in flames however the authorities managed to defeat the revolt oshios followers were executed but only after being tortured oshio himself was caught and avoided dishonor by committing seppuku shirais decision to compare himself with this particular hero seemed puzzling at first and shirai admitted as much in his diary after all oshios rebellion though brave had ended in defeat but shirai went on to explain that the cause for which oshio sacrificed his life had consequences of which shirai greatly approved after commodore perrys black ships anchored in yokohama bay in a new generation of rebels protested america s demand that japan lift its cultural quarantine and allow foreigners to import mechandise to become a satellite of the west inspired by oshios principles these new rebels reaffirmed the cultural purity of the tokugawa shogunate they insisted on the mystical uniqueness of their nation their godordained nihonjinron their divine japaneseness bequeathed to them by the sun goddess amaterasu warriors masterless samurai who called themselves shishi swore to expel all intruding foreigners and in some cases slaughtered western settlers shirai emphasized deceitfully in his diary that he didnt advocate bloodshed but rather an overwhelming political movement in which the force of amaterasu would accomplish the dream of oshios later followers expel the barbarians and return japan to japan when put in this context oshio did seem the proper hero for shirai to emulate but there were ironic disturbing implications that shirai either didnt recognize or didnt want to admit for his diary abruptly changed topic and described its authors patriotic zeal in conceiving organizing and unleashing the force of amaterasu which his diary took for granted would be successful the implications that shirais diary ignored were that oshios later followers had taken their dead leaders principlesfeed the poorto such an extreme that expel the barbarians and keep japan pure became synonymous with revere the emperor since the tokugawa shogunate had insisted on keeping the emperor in the background in kyoto far from the shoguns center of power in what is now called tokyo but the zealots who unwittingly perverted oshios intentions so identified their japaneseness with the former sanctity of the imperial institution that they insisted on reinstating it on bringing the emperor from kyoto to the shoguns capital and on reaffirming him as a symbol of the greatness of japan thus in the meiji restoration occurred after more than two and a half centuries the tokugawa shogunate fell and calculating bureaucrats realized that they could benefit financially and politically from this amazing shift in power secluding surrounding and above all controlling the emperor and his attitudes they embraced what they saw as the lucrative pronationalistic consequences of commodore perrys black ships in the words of masayoshi hotta whod seen the future in four years after the black ships arrived i am therefore convinced that our policy should be to stake everything on the present opportunity to conclude friendly alliances to send ships to foreign countries everywhere and conduct trade to copy the foreigners where they are at their best and so repair our shortcomings to foster our national strength and complete our armaments and so gradually subject the foreigners to our influence until in the end all the countries of the world know the blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged throughout the globe shiraiattempting to change historyhad been blind to it akira though had recognized the truth as hed told savage en route to their destiny at shirais mountaintop retreat we can try to learn from history but its impossible to reverse its trend in other words we move forward savage thought relentlessly we can try to build on the past but the presenta wedge between then and soonmakes all the difference contributes new factors guarantees that soon will be different from then we can never go back he sadly concluded recalling the innocent happiness of his youth and the night his father shot himself but what does that say about ambition hope and especially love are they pointless doomed to fail because the present emerges is programmed by but at a certain point is divorced from the past and the future is by definition a change controlled by unanticipated circumstances jamais vu déjà vu false memory disinformation for months i relived a past that wasnt true he thought i then confronted a present that seemed to replay the past but with a difference yes savage swallowed akira died dear god how much i miss him but his death was not an exact replication of my nightmare he was beheaded yes and his head struck the floor rolled toward me and blinked how much i miss him but before his body toppled his lifeless hands gave me the sword it wasnt the same it wasnt the past so maybe we can reverse change alter correct whats behind us but in that case the past was a lie it never happened it was all a damned trick played on our memory isnt everything remember what you read in the book dr santizo gave you memory isnt a year ago a month ago a day ago its a second ago as the past becomes the present about to change to the future im trapped in my mind in my momentary perceptions the past cant be proved the futures a mystery i exist forever now until im dead so what about hope and love what about rachel what about tomorrow will my dreams collapse my hopes fall apart my love dissolve i dont think so because rachel knows the truth shes told me often enough abraham believed by virtue of the absurd the alternative is unacceptable as long as i act with good will and i know therell be pain disasters as long as i struggle forward with good will despite the disasters despite the pain with the help of god by virtue of the absurd i wont be fortunes hostage a complicity of lies now savages nightmare was twofold a hideous double exposure akira being killed not once but twice kamichi dying twice as well sprawled paralyzed in a pool of blood seeing akiras severed skull the melancholy tearbeaded eyes blinking savage screamed and struggled upright but hands restrained him a soothing voice reassured him for a moment savage wondered if he were back in the hotel in philadelphia where akira had calmed him after savage wakened screaming from his nightmare hope abruptly changed to fear because savage groggily realized that if he were still in philadelphia then the final disastrous confrontation with shirai had not occurred the present was the past and the horror of the future had yet to be endured this terrifying murky thought made savage want to scream once more the gentle hands the soothing voice continued to reassure him at once savage recognized that the voice belonged to rachel that he sat weakly on a futon that bandages encased his skull that a cast weighed down his right arm that tape bound his chest he shuddered recalling the hospital in harrisburg where hed never been the casts that had imprisoned his body though his arms and legs had not been broken the blondhaired doctor whod never existed you mustnt excite yourself rachel said dont move dont try to stand she eased him gently back onto the futon you have to rest she leaned down and kissed his beardstubbled cheek youre safe i promise ill protect you try to stay quiet sleep as the mist in savages mind began to clear he realized the irony of the change in circumstance rachel protecting him though confused he almost grinned but his head felt as if a spike had been driven through it and he closed his eyes in pain where am i at taros rachel said surprised savage looked at her he struggled to speak but how did the two men who stayed with you when you followed shirai brought you here i still dont how they say that you and akira told them to wait at the bottom of the mountain while you went up to investigate savage nodded despite the pain in his head two hours later they heard shots rachel said handguns automatic weapons they claim it sounded like a war shortly after two cars sped down the lane from the mountain and raced away savage inhaled fighting to concentrate and then his voice cracked save your strength ill do the talking are you thirsty would you like a yes he managed to say through parched scabbed lips she set a glass of water beside his head and placed a bent straw between his lips weak he sucked water over his dry swollen tongue he had trouble swallowing but kept sucking the water she took the glass away youll get sick if you drink too quickly she studied him then continued the two men decided to investigate savage closed his eyes again are you sleepy we can talk about this later no savage breathed i want to have to know they assumed that the men in the cars had done the shooting so because it would have taken them too long to go up the mountain on foot taros students risked driving their motorcycles up the lane with his good hand savage gestured weakly for her to keep going near the top they hid their bikes and snuck through the forest rachel said they found a huge building or rather all kinds of different buildings weirdly joined together it reminded me of the way you described the medford gap mountain retreat she hesitated there were bodies all over the lawn the memory made savage grimace then the cars came back and the two men hid the men from the cars went into the building taros students waited then followed cautiously they found more bodies yes savage said so many his nostrils flared retaining the coppery stench of the blood everywhere they heard more shots on an upper floor they didnt know what theyd be facing only two men they had to go up warily by the time they reached the third floor they found it littered with corpses rachel bit her lip akira had been beheaded shirai had been cut in half and three men with wooden swords were about to crack your skull apart taros students grabbed guns from the floor and shot the three men before they could kill you savages concentration wavered he fought to keep his mind from swirling desperate to know the rest but you still havent told me how did i get here one of taros students drove his motorcycle to a nearby village where theyd hidden your car he brought the car back put you and akira in it and drove you to taros while the other student followed on his motorcycle taro ordered them to return to the mountain to retrieve the remaining motorcycle and to arrange the bodies so it seemed as if some of shirais men tried to kill him while others tried to defend him according to the newspapers the authorities believe the deception though no one can explain what caused the rebellion savages consciousness began to fade taro took care of you rachel said cleaned your wounds set your arm did whatever he could it would have been too risky have attracted too much attention to take you to a hospital but if you hadnt wakened soon id have insisted on taking you to a doctor savage grasped her hand his mind dimmed turning gray dont leave me never he drifted sank and reendured his nightmare or rather both of them one on top of the other the next time he wakened he felt stronger more alert though his body still ached and his skull throbbed rachel sat beside him holding his hand thirsty yes and hungry she beamed i have to leave you for a moment theres someone who wants to say hello as rachel left savage expected that shed bring in taro instead to his delight he saw eko come in her aged face strained with grief for churi but her eyes aglow with the pleasure of serving of bringing savage a tray upon which he soon discovered were a cup of tea and a bowl of broth rachel stood next to her the women exchanged glances more meaningful than words with a gesture rachel invited eko to sit on the futon and spoon broth into savages mouth occasionally rachel helped by giving savage a sip of tea so taros men finally rescued you savage told eko the warmth of the broth and tea making him sigh at once he remembered that eko didnt speak english rachel explained i dont understand what the problems were in accomplishing the rescue but the night you followed shirai to the mountain taros students arrived with eko akiraemotion prevented savage from speaking for a momentwould have been overjoyed immensely grateful at least one good thing came out of this god i miss him i still cant believe hes does she know akiras dead she helped prepare his body for the funeral rites i wish i knew how to tell her im sorry savage said she understands and she feels sorry for you for your grief arigato close to tears savage touched ekos arm she bowed her head taros students came back with someone else rachel said what who its complicated when youre strong enough you can see for yourself im strong enough now with effort he managed to sit youre sure rachel asked im worried about now savage said help me to stand too many questions havent been answered if this is who i think it is please rachel help me it took both rachel and eko to raise him to his feet and steady him each woman supporting him he shuffled toward the sliding panel light hurt his eyes he faced a room in which cushions surrounded a low cypress table taro sat legs crossed on one side and on the other savage glared at the welldressed fiftyish sandyhaired man he knew as philip hailey but hailey looked haggard unshaven his suit wrinkled his tie tugged open his shirts top button undone haileys hands trembled worse than savages did and his eyes no longer were coldly calculating ah savage said and sank to a pillow another closing of a circle who are you you know me as philip hailey yes and you were in my nightmare at the nonexistent medford gap mountain retreat and you chased me at the meiji shrine and kamichishiraitold me youre my contact that you and i work for the cia answer my question who the hell are you savages anger exhausted him he wavered rachel steadied him if you dont remember for security reasons its best that we dont use real names doyle dont call me that you bastard doyle might be my name but i dont identify with it okay ill call you roger forsyth since thats your agency pseudonym no damn it youll call me by my other pseudonym the one i used when i worked with graham say it savage right because believe me thats how i feel what happened to me for christs sake who did what to my mind hailey tugged at his collar hands trembling he opened the second button on his shirt i dont have clearance to tell you wrong youve got the best clearance there is my permission or else ill break your fucking arms and legs and savage reached for a knife on the table or maybe ill cut off your fingers and then haileys face turned pale he raised his arms pathetically okay all right jesus savage be cool i know youve been through a lot i know youre upset but upset you son of a bitch i want to kill you talk tell me everything dont stop it was allhaileys chest heaveda miscalculation see it started with maybe youre not aware of the militarys been working on what they call bravery pills what the problem is no matter how well you program a soldier he cant help being afraid during combat i mean its natural if someone shoots at you the brain sends a crisis signal to your adrenal gland and you get terrified you tremble you want to run its a biological instinct sure maybe a seal like you conditioned to the max can control the reflex but your basic soldier he suffers a fightorflight response and if he runs well the ball games over so the military figured maybe theres a chemical if a soldier takes a pill before an anticipated battle the chemical cancels the crisis signal that triggers adrenaline the soldier feels no emotion just his conditioning and he fights by god he fights the thing is hailey said when they tested the drug it worked fine during a crisis but afterward the soldiers memory the stress of what hed been through caught up to him he fell apart he suffered posttrauma stress disorder eventually he was useless haunted yes savage said haunted im an expert in that in being haunted he aimed the knife toward haileys arm i told you savage be cool im telling you what you want to know then do it so the military decided that the bravery pill worked fine memory was the problem then they got to thinking about posttrauma stress disorder and they figured they could solve two problems at once relieve the agony of vets from vietnam who couldnt stand remembering what theyd been through and at the same time guarantee that the bravery pill would work if something else removed the memory of the horrors that the bravery pill had forced them to think was normal psychosurgery savages voice dropped yes hailey said exactly so the military experimented on removing traumatic memories it turned out to be easier than they expected the techniques existed neurosurgeons treating epileptics sometimes insert electrodes into the brain stimulate this and that section and manage to find the neurons that cause the epilepsy the surgeons then cauterize the neurons and the epileptics are cured but they have memory loss a tradeoff for the patients benefit what the military decided was to experiment with the same technique to remove the memories of combat that gave soldiers posttrauma stress disorder a brilliant concept sure savage said tempted to plunge the knife into haileys heart but somebody realized that the soldiers had a gap in their minds a vacuum in their memories theyd always be confused by the sense that something important had happened to them that they couldnt remember that confusion would impair their ability to fight again so why not as long as the surgeons are in there find a way to insert a memory a false one something peaceful calming drugs combined with films and electrode stimulation did the trick yeah savage said what a trick then somebody else thought what if the memory we insert isnt just peaceful but motivates the patient to do what we want to program him into doing i get the idea savage said stroking the knife against haileys arm now talk about me where do i come in japan hailey fidgeted staring at the knife they screwed us at pearl harbor but we beat them we stomped them we nuked them twice and then we spent seven years teaching them not to screw with us again but they are not militarily financially theyre buying our country they dump their merchandise onto our markets they own our treasury bills they control our trade deficit theyre responsible for our national debt taros wizened face turned red with fury he glared unforgivably insulted just get to the point savage said a group of us in the agency not the agency itself hailey said its too damned cautious but a group of us decided to correct the situation we knew about shirai for quite a while hes been trying to undermine the status quo in japan last years influencebuying scandal the recruit corporation giving top politicians bribes in the form of undervalued stocks that would soon be worth a fortune shirai was behind that through intermediaries he controlled recruit and through the newspapers he owned he leaked the information politicians fell party leaders former party leaders one prime minister and then another the system verged on collapse and shirai intended to step in to use his wealth and power to take control but he needed an incident a symbolic catalyzing sensation so outrageous that it would attract sufficient followers to unite the nation and achieve his goals inward though not outward a rejection of the world japan for itself and my group within the agency loved it so you decidedsavage clutched the knifethat youd help him why not shirais goals coincided with ours if japan turned inward if the country established a cultural quarantine and refused to deal with outsiders america wouldnt be smothered with japanese merchandise wed have a chance to correct our trade deficit wed reduce hell maybe eliminate our national debt wed balance our budget jesus man the possibilities you were prepared to help a surely you realized that shirai was crazy hailey shrugged everythings relative we preferred to think of him as idealistic savage cursed the agencys been watching shirai for quite a while hailey said one of his lieutenants was on our payroll he kept us uptodate on what shirai was doing and we sent information through the lieutenantscandals involving bureaucrats and politiciansthat helped shirai continue disrupting the japanese establishment shirai knew nothing about our help of course and then we waited to see if our investment would pay off that still has nothing to do with me well yes hailey said and wiped sweat off his cheek im afraid it does i didnt find out till recently but some of the men in our group formed their own group were conservatives proud of it but these other guys he swallowed nervously theyre the kind that thinks oliver norths the best thing since microwave popcorn and they had what north would have called a neat idea they figured why not go all the way why not give shirai a chance to stage an incident that would be so sensational hed gain all the support he needed what if it seemed that america felt so threatened by shirais antiamerican attitude that we sent an assassin to shut him up a cia operative the attempt would fail the operative would be killed shirai would reveal the assassins link with the agency and japan would be incensed if tens of thousands of japanese demonstrated because we lost a nuclear weapon eighty miles off their coast how many hundreds of thousands perhaps even millions would demonstrate against an assassination attempt engineered by america but thats those guys are as nuts as shirai was what in hell made them think it would help america if japan turned against us dont you see if japan rejected us if relations between our countries were severed japanese imports would stop wed have won the economic war hailey said yeah and suppose japan then sided with the chinese or the soviets no it wouldnt happen that way because japan doesnt get along with the chinese and the soviets the japanesechinese feud goes back hundreds of years and the japanese are angry that the soviets wont give up a string of northern islands that used to belong to japan until after the second world war shirai would turn antiamerican sentiment into universal antiforeign sentiment and wed be back in business savage shook his head absolute madness the splinter group in the agency arranged for shirais lieutenant to promote the idea and shirai loved it mind you shirai still didnt know that americans were suggesting it or that the nutso group in the agency believed that america would gain a lot more than shirai would now hailey said this is where you come in illegal or not its one thing to tell an operative to assassinate someone its quite another to order him to go on a suicide mission no one would do it what the splinter group needed was an operative who wouldnt know what he faced and better yet wouldnt even know he worked for the agency so he wouldnt have second thoughts contact his control and back out and you werearemy control hailey sweated more profusely we recruited you when you were in the seals in nineteen eightythree you pretended to be outraged by america s invasion of grenada politically motivated pointless and needless you said fellow seals died so a moviestar president could bolster his image you said you got drunk you made speeches in bars you fought with your best friend mac yes hailey said he was part of the plan sworn to secrecy the two of you trashed a bar mac swore in public if he ever saw you again hed kill you you left the seals and became an executive protector trained by graham he was also part of the plan with your cover established an american who hated his governments policies no one would suspect that you actually worked for the agency and that every powerful client you protected was actually a target a means of obtaining information a protector pledged to be loyal has access to a lot of dirty secrets the information you gave us helped us put pressure on a lot of important people sickened savage turned to rachel you suggested that as a possibility remember after mac was killed but i didnt want to believe it he glanced back at hailey so for all these years ive beenbile stung his throata blackmailer hey its not that bad savage dont be hard on yourself you saved a lot of lives youre a talented protector that doesnt change the fact that i pledged allegiance to my clients and then betrayed them savage growled not all of them most were legitimate assignments to maintain your cover but some clients yes you betrayed them youve got to believe me savage they deserved to be betrayed savage stared at the glinting knife in his hand he almost slammed its point through the table and you were my contact thats how the splinter group learned about me your background was perfect a man with superior military skills and with protection abilities that enabled you to understand and bypass security systems an operative in deep cover who wouldnt be missed by the agency if you dropped out of sight for a while and one other item a crucial detail about your past what detail now heres where we pause for a moment savage tell me what detail no first its deal time hailey said im not telling you all this for fun the guys who brought me here would just as soon kill me as let me go im walking a narrow line my price for telling you that crucial detail about your past is my freedom youre so concerned about honor okay i want your word i want you to swear that if i tell you i walk out of here and this is your incentivethe informations about your father savage clutched the knife so hard his knuckles whitened what about my father you wont like it savage he shot himself if thats your filthy secret i already know it yes he shot himself hailey said the question is why my father helped organize the bay of pigs invasion when it failed the government needed a fallguy my father god bless him incredibly loyal he agreed so he took the heat and resigned but humiliation ate his soul the agency meant everything to him away from it he had no purpose he started drinking the booze intensified his emptiness he blew his brains out yes and no what are you talking about a deal hailey said i want to walk out of here and what im selling is the truth about your fathers suicide the truth my fathers dead what other truth can there be plenty let me walk out of here and youll find out maybe i dont want to know maybe if i killed you right now hailey shook his head youd regret it forever youd always want to know the secret and ill be honest with you the truth will tear you apart but thats why youll want to know savage glared you in horror he remembered the night hed found his fathers body a towel placed beneath his fathers head to minimize the spatter of blood and brains you have my word not just yours i want this mans word hailey pointed toward taro he has no obligation to me and after all im a gaijin i doubt hed feel remorse or bound by your word if he killed me savage slowly turned directing his gaze toward the bald wrinkled sterneyed japanese tarosensei struggling to choose the proper words savage bowed tarosensei i ask a formal favor of you akira explained the significance of such a request im willing to put myself in eternal debt to you i accept the obligation of giri i ask you with respect i beg you to spare this mans life if he tells me what i need to know taro squinted assessing i ask you this savage said in devotion to akiras memory taro squinted harder staring from savage to hailey then back again for akira the old man asked hai he bowed in grief all right hailey its a deal you have our word savage said hailey debated ive worked for the agency too long im not used to acts of faith tell me okay ill trust you your father committed suicide yes but not for the reasons you think it had nothing to do with the bay of pigs what your father savage was in charge of the agencys attempts to assassinate castro he kept trying and trying and every plan failed but castro found out what the agency was doing he warned the united states to leave him alone but your father under orders kept trying so castro decided enough was enough and arranged for president kennedy to be shot in dallas your father killed himself because of grief because he was responsible for kennedys death oh jesus savages strength failed he slumped falling backward rachel supported him i told you you wouldnt like it hailey said but thats the truth and i expect you to fulfill your bargain i promised savage could barely speak youll walk out of here and thats the piece of your background that made you an ideal candidate for the assassin whod fail to kill shirai like father like son shirai could not only implicate the united states in an attempt against him but he could link that attempt all the way back to the kennedy assassination and the us attempts against castro shirai would dredge up garbage from the past and convince his nation to call us a pack of killers oh you were perfect savage and all that needed to be done was erase crucial portions of your memory so you didnt know you were cia and then implant a hideous nightmare that compelled you to track down shirai what about akira savage exhaled with grief how did he fit in shirai needed to compromise the japanese establishment as much as he did america so why not use a japanese intelligence operative who also had executive protection as a cover if the two of you thought each other had died and if you both discovered you were still alive youd each want to know what caused your nightmare certain choices were predictablethat youd go to the medford gap retreat and discover it didnt exist that youd go to the harrisburg hospital and discover youd never been there et cetera et cetera but as soon as shirai made his move and it was publicized on television in the newspapers youd recognize the principal you saw cut in half and youd run to him to find out what he knew about your nightmare but some things werent predictable savage said my decision to go to virginia to talk to mac exactly after you were conditioned it happened in japan by the way at shirais estate before the casts were put on your arms and legs a location transmitter was inserted in a cap that was put on one of your teeth that site was chosen because you and akira like many people already had a dental cap on an x ray the replaced caps wouldnt attract attention and because of those location transmitters shirais men knew aboutcould follow youeverywhere in case they had to nudge you in the right direction but seeing mac in virginia was not the right direction yes hailey said shirais men feared mac would tell you too much and erase your conditioning they had to kill him and try to grab rachel because she was the reason akira and i came together but after that she didnt belong in the plan unfortunately thats true what about the man and woman i thought were my parents the ones in baltimore hailey asked window dressing further confusion shirais intention with prodding from the splinter group in the agency who used shirais lieutenant was to so confuse you that when you saw shirai on television or in the newspaper youd race to get in touch with him of course the alternate plan would have been to abduct akira and you drug you take you to shirais estate and kill you while shirais men sacrificed their lives for their leaders ambitions mind you that plan has the merit of simplicity hailey shrugged but it wouldnt have been convincing because you and akira had to leave a trail in greece in southern france in america most of all in japan you had to leave evidencethe stamps on fake passports you carried not to mention the conversations you had with taxi drivers hotel clerks and immigration officialsthat showed your determination to get to shirai and grahams death savage trembled the agency had nothing to do with that after graham arranged for both you and akira to be on papadropoliss estate shirais men decided he was a liability they killed him attempting to make it appear a suicide but graham knew what he was doing when he sent akira and me to mykonos his ultimate loyalty was to the agency not to us savage you ask too many questions dont dig too deep he was your friend yes but he was also a professional he obeyed his masters why else would he have traveled back and forth from maryland to massachusetts to nurse you and akira back to health he loved you savage and he loved akira but he loved his professionnot protection but espionagemore nauseous savage leaned back against rachel welcoming her warmth youre right i ask too many questions despite his multiple painful injuries he managed to straighten but i do have one more question ask it youre entitled we made a bargain but after that im out of here okay savage said he struggled to stand rachelever dependable rachelhelped him wavering upright with rachels arms around him savage glowered down at hailey okay heres my question at the meiji shrine did you try to stop me or urge me forward hell man i wanted to stop you the plan was out of control and the van was it yours you said just one question damn it answer me yes it was ours who shot the driver shirais men the transmitter in the cap on your tooth they were able to follow you and they didnt want us stopping you and what about thats two more questions hailey said dont tell me youre breaking your bargain im almost finished savages knees sank rachel held him up what about who invaded akiras home and tried to kill us who ordered man your guess is as good as mine no savage said my guess is better you did you ordered the assassins to take us out because the plan was out of control because youd discovered what the assholes in that splinter group were up to and you felt it had to be stopped so you made the choice to have us terminated and when that didnt work you followed us to the meiji shrine to try to kill us there youre my enemy the same as those jerks the difference is apparently i once trusted you apparently you were my friend hey savage business and friendship as much as id like it sometimes fury canceled weakness anger canceled pain with every force he could muster savage used his good armand it felt so wonderfulto punch hailey squarely in the face teeth snapped haileys nose crunched blood flew hailey lurched backward groaning sprawling i ought to savage grabbed him jerking him upward kill you giri hailey muttered through swollen lips and broken teeth you gave your word taro said and stood so did i a formal favor an eternal obligation taro restrained the knife in savages hand obey it or youre worthless you have no honor trembling seething sobbing savage gradually lowered the knife something has to mean something get out of here now he told hailey before i change my mind because of you my friend is dead you hailey ran clutching his broken face yanking a panel open disappearing his footsteps dwindling you did the proper thing taro said then why do i feel like hell because he might come after you let him savage said im better for a gaijin youre a noble man but are you savage spun our business isnt finished i refuse to believe that you werent aware that akira belonged to japanese intelligence the old man nodded thats correct and you knew what shirai was trying to do you knew that akira and i were supposed to die for japan giri savage said thank god for giri for the solemn promise i made you if you allowed that bastard to leave i swore id be eternally in your debt otherwise youd try to kill me taro chuckled yes fueled by ultimate rage savage overcame his weakness pressed a paralyzing nerve in taros neck and tickled the point of his knife against taros jugular vein your problem is you re arrogant even a gaijin can be a worthy opponent savagesan you have my respect and your word that therell be no recriminations giri yes taros face became more wizened giri friendship loyalty obligation what else is there to believe in love savage lowered the knife what did you do with akiras body it was cremated the urn with his ashes is in my room but japanese intelligence cant know about his death the investigation would be disastrous to us all may i have them savage asked akiras ashes yes if his interment must be a secret eko and i know what to do with them taro studied him and bowed festival for the dead before akira had brought savage and rachel to japan as hed explained the complexities of his divinely born nation hed referred to a summer ritual known as the feast of lanterns and otherwise called the festival for the dead during three days involving incense prayers and funereal meals traditional japanese obeyed the shinto custom of revering one might almost say worshipingthe dead savage complied though this was autumn not summer but he didnt think akira would mind after three days of scrupulous devotion he and rachel embraced each other in the garden at the rear of akiras home night surrounded them but a glow reflected off their faces for savage had placed a lantern on the gardens pool throughout the afternoon hed drained water from the pool removing the assassins blood that tainted it hed refilled the pool and drained it and refilled it again and drained it again and cleaned it again determined to purify it to exorcise its desecration at last hed been satisfied that the ritual would not be corrupted he lit a match and set fire to the lanterns paper god i miss him savage said the flames reflected off his face yes rachel said so do i his eyes were so sad because he belonged in another time commodore perrys black ships savage said akira was a samurai he belonged in a time before samurais were outlawed before america corrupted akiras nation you knowhe turned to rachel and kissed herbefore he died he called me savage choked on emotion he gagged on his tears he called me oh jesus rachel held him tell me his friend and he was your friend rachel said but do you understand the effort the sacrifice it took him to say that all his life hed hated americans because of hiroshima nagasaki yokohama bay perrys black ships akira belonged in another century when japan was pure its always been pure rachel said and it always will be because if akira if hes typical this nation is great because it understands honor but hes dead because of honor savage kissed her the flames of the lantern blazing higher what i wonder is america our civil war we made a myth of the south before the war the magnificent mansions the dignity of the lifestyle except for the slaves rachel said thats what i mean savage said myth sometimes for some people myth hides ugliness and becomes its own reality like disinformation like memory but memorys a lie above all jesus thats what ive learned now is what matters the lantern flamed brighter not love not the future rachel asked dont i hope but not the past akira would have hated the past savage said the tokugawa shogunate from everything ive learned it was fascist an oppressive system of control shogun to daimyo to samurai to akira would have desperately craved the present and what do you crave rachel asked you the lantern flared to its brightest sadly its flames diminished in greece after we rescued you savage said i asked akira if we could be friends but he refused because of his background he was conditioned and you were a gaijin but you love him rachel said yes should i be jealous no savage said our love was different can i be a substitute no savage straightened youre unique ill always worship you always i know what you want to say dont presume rachel frowned abraham believed by virtue of the absurd now rachel smiled you did know so what are we going to do savage asked hailey didnt admit it but your husband was a part of this what rachel paled yes savage said akira and i both sent to mykonos both sent to meet each other during your rescue japan for japan thats fine but japan needs oil and that means ships and i think your husband made a deal to guarantee those ships thats why akira and i were sent to mykonos because your husbands estate was convenient since he was involved in the conspiracy so he beat me and raped me for political reasons from everything i learned i think he did it oh rachel said she clutched him because he liked it a bonus in the midst of business so i think savage said what i might have to kill him otherwise savage said hell keep chasing us rachel shook her head in fury what savage asked no more killing too much too damned much hes a very proud man so are we proud rachel said then whats the answer you mentioned a beach near cancun where id like to make love to me in fact id like to do that right now in spite of your grief she asked because of it in memory of in celebration of life thats all we have not the past not the future my past i discovered was a lie but i prefer the lie to the truth and the future faith and thats absurd and dont i love it and dont i love you savage said the lanterns flare sank extinguished by water ill remember you akira your kami in the wind and the rain savage said they turned and saw eko who bowed savage and rachel bowed as well and turned toward the carefully raked and groomed sand of the zen buddhist garden which akiras father had spent years arranging and which akira had persisting in attempting to perfect after his fathers death neither man had achieved his obsession but as savage scanned the meticulous design that hed labored to recreate after the assassins had despoiled it he grinned with melancholy sensing that his eyes were as sad as akiras for akiras ashes had been scattered and raked among the sand one with nature i know im sure savage said hes at peace and what about us rachel asked will you what will you marry me jesus savage im already married and the bastards chasing me trust me we dont need a legal ceremony just a private one you and me right now damned right he kissed her i promise to love to honor and cherish you sounds wonderful and a final promise he kissed her again whats that to protect david morrell
