the frozen turkey bowling chapter one get over it a lot of people are dead you bitch you killed me you suck tommy had just awakened for the first time as a vampire he was nineteen thin and had spent his entire life between states of amazement and confusion i wanted us to be together jody pale pretty long red hair hanging in her face cute swoop of a nose in search of a lost spray of freckles a big lipsticksmeared grin shed only been undead herself for a couple of months and was still learning to be spooky yeah thats why you spent the night with him tommy pointed across the loft to the lifesized bronze statue of a man in a tattered suit inside the bronze shell was the ancient vampire who had turned jody another bronze of jody stood next to him when the two of them had gone out at sunrise into the sleep of the dead tommy had taken them to the sculptors who lived on the ground floor of his building and had the vampires bronzed hed thought it would give him time to think of what to do and keep jody from running off with the old vampire tommys mistake had been drilling ear holes in jodys sculpture so she could hear him somehow during the night before the bronzing the old vampire had taught her to turn to mist and shed streamed out of the ear holes into the room andwellhere they were dead in love and angry i needed to know about what i am tommy who else was going to tell me if not him yeah but you should have asked me before you did this tommy said you shouldnt just kill a guy without asking its inconsiderate tommy was from indiana and his mother had raised him to have good manners and to be considerate of other peoples feelings you had sex with me while i was unconscious jody said thats not the same tommy said i was just being friendly like when you put a quarter in someone elses parking meter when they arent thereyou know they appreciate it later even if they dont thank you personally yeah wait until you go out in your jammies and wake up all sticky in a cheerleader outfit and see how grateful you are you know tommy when im out technically im dead guess what that makes you welluhyeah but youre not even human youre just some foul dead thing tommy immediately regretted saying it it was hurtful and mean and although jody was indeed dead he didnt find her foul at allin fact he was pretty sure he was in love with her he was just a little embarrassed about the whole necrophiliacheerleader thing back in the midwest people didnt mention that sort of thing unless a dog dug up a pompom in some guys backyard and the police eventually discovered the whole human pyramid buried under the swing set jody sniffled completely for effect actually she was relieved that tommy was now on the defensive well welcome to the foul dead thing club mr flood yeah you drank my blood tommy said a lot damn she should have pretended to cry you let me again being considerate tommy said he stood up and shrugged you just let me because of the sex thats not true it was because you needed me he was lying it was because of the sex yes i did jody said i still do she held her arms out to him i really do he walked into her arms and held her she felt amazing to him even more amazing than she had before it was as if his nerves had been dialed up to eleven okay it was because of the sex great she thought in control once again she kissed his neck how do you feel about it now maybe in a minute im starving he let go of her and stormed across the loft to the kitchen where he pulled a burrito out of the freezer threw it into the microwave and hit the button all in one smooth motion you dont want to eat that jody said nonsense it smells great its like every little bean and pork piece is sending out its own delicious miasma of flavor vapor tommy used words like miasma because he wanted to be a writer thats why hed come to san francisco in the first placeto take life in big bites and write about it oh and to find a girlfriend put the burrito down and back away tommy jody said i dont want you to get hurt ha thats cute he took a big bite and grinned at her as he chewed five minutes later because she felt responsible jody was helping him clean bits of masticated burrito off the kitchen wall and the front of the refrigerator its like every bean was storming the gates of repressive digestion to escape yeah well being refried will do that to you jody said stroking his hair you okay im starving i need to eat not so much eat jody said oh my god its the hunger i feel like my insides are caving in on themselves you should have told me about this she knew how he feltactually she had felt worse when it happened to her at least he knew what was happening to him yeah sweetie were going to have to make a few adjustments well what do i do what did you do i mostly fed off of you remember you should have thought this through before you killed me im fucked were fucked together like romeo and juliet only we get to be in a sequel very literary tommy oh thats a comfort i cant believe you just killed me like that and turned you into a superbeing thank you very much oh crap theres burrito spooge all over my new sneakers you can see in the dark now jody said cheerfully wanna try it ill get naked you can look at me in the dark naked youll like it jody im starving over here she couldnt believe that he didnt respond to the naked persuasion what kind of monster had she created okay ill find you a bug or something a bug a bug im not eating a bug i said thered have to be some adjustments tommy had been dealing with more than a few adjustments since hed come west from his hometown of incontinence indiananot the least of which had been finding a girlfriend who while smart sexy and quickwitted drank his blood and tended to fall unconscious at the exact moment of sunrise hed always suspected that she might have just picked him because he worked nights and could walk around during the day especially since shed once said i need someone who works nights and can walk around during the day but now that he was a vampire he could close the door on that insecurity and open another onto a whole new world of insecurities hed never even considered before the appropriate age for a vampire is four hundred years oldhe should be a worldweary and sophisticated creature his human anxieties long since overcome or evolved into macabre perversions the problem with a nineteenyearold vampire is that he drags all of his adolescent insecurities into the dark with him im really pale tommy said staring at himself in the bathroom mirror theyd figured out early on that vampires do indeed cast a reflection in a mirror just like they could tolerate proximity to crucifixes and garlic tommy had run experiments on jody while she slept including many involving cheerleader outfits and personal lubricants and not just winter in indiana pale im like pale like you yeah said jody i thought you liked the pale sure it looks good on you but i look ill keep looking jody said she was leaning against the door frame dressed in tight black jeans and a half shirt her hair tied back and streaming down her back like a flaccid red comet tail she was trying not to appear too amused somethings missing tommy said something besides color uhhuh jody grinned my skin cleared up i dont have a single zit ding ding ding jody onomatopeed signaling that tommy had hit on the correct answer if i had known my skin would clear up id have asked you to change me a long time ago i didnt know how to a long time ago jody said thats not all take off your shoes i dont understand i just take off your shoes tommy sat on the edge of the tub and took off his sneakers and socks what look at your toes theyre straight my little toe isnt bent anymore its like ive never worn shoes youre perfect jody said she remembered finding out this condition of vampirism and being both delighted and horrified because now she felt that shed always need to lose five poundsfive pounds that were preserved for eternity tommy pulled up the leg of his jeans and studied his shin the scar where i hit myself with a hatchet its gone and it always will be jody said youll always be perfect just like you are now my split ends even went away ill always be the same yes just like i am now as far as i know jody said but i was going to start working out i was going to be buff i was going to have abs of steel no you werent i was i was going to be an awesome hunk of muscular manmeat no you werent you wanted to be a writer you were going to have little stick arms and get winded when you hit the backspace key more than three times consecutively youre in great shape from working in the grocery store wait until you see how you can run you really think im in great shape yes i thought i made that clear tommy flexed his chest in the mirror which showed not at all through his flannel shirt he unbuttoned his shirt and tried it again with little effect then shrugged what about the writer thing will my brain always be like this i mean will i get any smarter or is that stuck in time too well yeah but thats because youre a man not because youre a vampire you spiteful harpy i think ive made my point jody said jody had put on a red leather jacket even though she could no longer feel discomfort from the cold fog coming in off the bay she liked the way it looked with her black jeans and a lowcut black lace camisole shed rescued from a nordstrom rack store before some slut got hold of it come on tommy we need to go find something for you to eat before we run out of night i know but i have something i have to do give me a minute he was in the bathroom again this time with the door shut jody heard the zipper of his jeans go down then a slightly breathless manscream the bathroom door flew open and tommy his pants and underwear around his ankles bunnyhopped in two great leaps across the bedroom look at this whats happening to me look at this he was pointing furiously to his penis its like im some radioactive mutant freak jody went to him and grabbed his handsheld him steady looked him in the eyes tommy calm down its just your foreskin i dont have a foreskin im circumcised not anymore jody said evidently when you turned it grew back just like your toes straightened and your scars all went away oh you dont find it creepy then no its fine you want to touch it thanks maybe later oh sorry i freaked didnt realize iuhi still feel like i have to finish what i was going to do thats fine jody said youre fine you go finish up ill wait youre sure you dont want to give it a quick fondle if i do can we get out of here probably not well then back in the bathroom you go she spun him around and gave him a gentle shove he bunnyhopped his newly recovered foreskin back into the bathroom and closed the door jody shuddered at the sound of the door closing she hadnt thought about whether or not tommy would retain his incessant horniness after he turned she had just wanted a companion who could understand what she was what she felt what the world looked like through vampire eyes if it turned out that he was going to be nineteen forever she might end up having to kill him for real chapter two the last poop so that was it yep never again nope not ever nope i feel like i should save them or something would you just flush and come out of there chapter three i am poor and my cat is huge jody walked a step or two behind tommy just watching him as they made their way up third street toward market she was watching his reaction to his new senses giving him some room to look around whispering hints about what he was experiencing shed gone through this herself only a couple of months ago and shed done it without a guide i can see the heat coming off the streetlamps tommy said looking up and spinning as he walked every window in every building is a different color try to just look at one thing at a time tommy dont let it overwhelm you jody was waiting for him to comment on the aura that each person was giving off not a heat aura more of a life force so far theyd only seen healthy red and pink onesnot what she was looking for whats that noise like running water tommy asked thats the sewers running under the street all that stuff will fade after a whileyoull still hear it but you wont notice it unless you focus its like a thousand people are talking in my head he looked around at the few pedestrians who were out on the street televisions and radios too jody said try to focus on one thing let the rest fall back tommy stopped looked up at an apartment window four floors up theres a guy up there having phone sex figures youd zero in on that jody said she focused on the window yes she could hear the guy panting and giving instructions to someone on the phone evidently he felt the caller was a dirty little slut and therefore needed to apply varieties of hot salsa to her body jody tried to hear the voice on the other end of the phone but it was too faintthe guy must have been wearing a headset what a freak tommy said shhhh jody said tommy close your eyes and listen forget the salsa guy dont look tommy closed his eyes and stood in the middle of the sidewalk what jody leaned against a no parking sign and smiled whats just to the right of you how do i know i was looking up i know focus listen two feet from your right hand what is it this is dumb just listen listen to the shape of the sound coming from your right okay tommy squinted showing he was concentrating a couple of androgynous students dressed in black with severe hair probably from the academy of art on the next block walked by and barely gave them a look until tommy said i can hear a box a rectangle acid noob said one of the students who sounded like it might be a guy i remember my first trip said the other who was probably a girl i wandered into the mens room at the metreon and thought i was in a marcel duchamp installation jody waited for them to pass then asked yes a rectangle solid hollow what she was a little giddy now bouncing on the balls of her feet this was better than buying shoes its hollow tommy tilted his head its a newspaper machine he opened his eyes looked at the newspaper box then at jody his face lit up like a toddler who has just discovered chocolate for the first time she ran into his arms and kissed him i have so much to show you why didnt you tell me tommy asked how could i do you have words for what youre hearing for what youre seeing tommy let her go and looked around took a deep breath through his nose as if checking the bouquet of a wine no i dont know how to say these things see thats why i had to share this with you tommy nodded but looked a little forlorn this part is good but the other part what other part the foul dead blooddrinking part im still starving dont whine tommy nobody likes a whiner hungry he said she knew how he felt she was feeling some of it herself but she didnt know how to solve the feeding problem tommy had always been her goto blood guy now they were going to have to hunt she could do it she had done it but she didnt want to do it come on well figure this out dont pout lets go watch people on market street youll like it she took his hand and dragged him up the street toward market where rivers of tourists shoppers and freaks were flowing up and down the streets and sidewalks rivers of blood everyone smells like whiz and feet tommy said standing on the sidewalk in front of a walgreens drugstore it was still early in the evening and the convention crowd from the hotels was flowing down the sidewalks like a great migrating herd looking for dinner or a watering hole out on the edges hustlers homeless and hangerson worked their angles playing the secret path of eye contact to the pocket while the herd defended itself by paying rapt attention to their companions their cell phones or a spot on the sidewalk twelve feet ahead feet and pee tommy continued you get used to it jody said is there a clean pair of underwear anywhere on this street tommy shouted you people are disgusting would you settle down jody said people are looking they think youre crazy which makes me different how she looked up the streetfor the three blocks she could see there were about three people per block shouting at passersby wildeyed and angry and obviously bat shit she nodded he had a point but then she snatched his shirt collar and pulled his ear down to lip level the difference is that you arent living anymore and its not a good idea to attract attention to yourself which is why you chose to wear that delightful ensemble from the skankwear collection at hoesnthangs you said you liked it jody had become a little more provocative in her dress since becoming a vampirebut she saw it more as an expression of confidence not a means to attract attention was it a predator thing a power thing i diddo like it but every guy who passes is staring at your cleavage i can hear their heartbeats go up did you have to turn to mist to get into those jeans you did didnt you a tap on tommys shoulder a young man in a white shortsleeved dress shirt and a black tie had sidled up to him holding out a pamphlet you sound troubled brother maybe this will help the pamphlet proclaimed rejoice on the cover in big green letters jody covered her mouth and turned away so the guy wouldnt see her giggling what tommy said turning on the guy what what what cant you see im trying to discuss my girlfriendsuhwell those tommy gestured to jodys shoulder which was now where those had just been show him jody tommy said jody shook her head and started to walk away her shoulders shaking with laughter theres a message here said the tie guy it can bring you comfortand joy yeah well i was trying to show you some examples of that but there she goes with them but this is a joy that goes beyond physical yeah like youd know tommy said cupping his nose and mouth as if covering a sneeze listen id love to discuss this with you buddy but right now you have to go home and wash your ass you smell like youre smuggling a stockyard back there tommy turned and strode after jody leaving the tie guy blushing and crumpling his pamphlet its not funny tommy said jody was trying so hard not to laugh she snorted yes it is cant they see were damned youd think they could tell at least you we are damned arent we no idea jody said she hadnt really thought about it didnt cover that in your advanced vampire course with the old guy forgot to ask no problem tommy said with no effort at all to suppress sarcasm minor detail anything else you might have forgotten to ask i thought id have more time for followup jody said i didnt realize that the man i love was going to bronze us that first night yeahwellokay sorry wheres the trust jody said you killed me tommy said oh there you go again please folks i need a dollar said a voice from the left jody looked down to see a guy sitting against the granite wall of a closed bank he was dirty beyond age or race sort of grimy to the point of shine and on his lap was an enormous longhaired cat there was a cup on the sidewalk in front of him and beside it a handprinted sign that read i am poor and my cat is huge tommy who was still fairly new to the city and hadnt learned to look past this sort of thing stopped and started digging in his pocket that is sure a huge cat yeah he eats a lot its all i can do to keep him fed jody nudged tommy trying to get him back into the pedestrian flow she liked that he was a nice guy but it could really be irritating sometimes especially when she was trying to teach him the profundities of being a creature of the night mostly fur though right tommy asked mister this cat weighs thirtyfive pounds tommy whistled and handed the guy a dollar can i touch him sure the guy said he doesnt care tommy knelt down and poked the cat gently then looked up at jody this is a huge cat she smiled huge lets go touch him tommy said no thanks so tommy said to the cat guy why dont you give him to a shelter or something then how am i supposed to make a living you could print up a sign that says im poor and i lost my huge cat that would work on me you may not be the best sample said the cat guy look tommy said standing now and digging into his pocket ill buy the cat ill give you uh forty the cat guy shook his head sixty furious head shaking tommy untangled bills from a wad hed pulled out of his pocket one hundred no and thirty two no and thirtyseven cents no and a paper clip no thats a great offer tommy insisted thats like four bucks a pound no well screw you then tommy said i dont feel sorry for you and your huge cat you cant have your dollar back fine tommy said fine said the cat guy tommy took jody by the arm and started to walk away thats a huge cat he said why were you trying to buy it were not supposed to have pets in the loft duh tommy said dinner yuck its a stopgap tommy said you know that the masai of kenya drink the blood of their cattle with no apparent ill effect to the cow well im sure it violates our lease if we get a cow thats it whats it a lease tommy swung her around and brought her back to the cat guy i want to rent the cat tommy said you could use a break and i want to show the huge cat to my aunt who is an invalid and cant come down here no one night one hundred and thirtytwo dollars and thirtyseven cents the cat guy raised an eyebrow the grime over that eye cracked a little one fifty i dont have one fifty you know that then i want to see the redheads hooters tommy looked at jody then back at the cat guy then back at jody no jody said calmly no tommy said indignantly how dare you suggest it one hooter countered the cat guy tommy looked at jody she gave him the wide greeneyed expression that she would have described as i will slap you so far into next week that it will take a team of surgeons just to get wednesday out of your ass no way tommy said the redheads hooters are not on the table he grinned looked back at jody then looked away really fast the cat guy shrugged ill need some kind of security deposit like your drivers license sure tommy said and a credit card no jody said pulling her jacket closed and zipping it up to her neck nothing kinky said the cat guy ill know going to show him to my aunt and ill have him back tomorrow this time deal said the cat guy his name is chet you first tommy said they stood in the great room of their loft on either side of the futon where the huge cat a crossbreed between a persian a dust mop and possibly a water buffalo was actively shedding tommy had decided that he was going to be very cool about the whole blooddrinking thing despite the fact that he was so amped he felt as if he could run up and down the walls in fact he wasnt sure that he couldnt run up and down the walls that was part of what was freaking him out still since coming to san francisco a couple of months ago he had spent entirely too much time overreacting and he wasnt going to do it nownot in front of his girlfriend not at all if he could help it you should go first jody said youve never fed before but you gave the old vampire some of your blood tommy said you need it it was true she had given the vampire her blood to help heal him from the damage tommy and his friends had caused by blowing up his yacht and so forth but he hoped she would say no again no no no after you jody said with a very bad french accent i insist well if you insist tommy leapt to the futon and bent over the huge cat he wasnt sure how he was supposed to go about this but he could see the healthy red life aura around chet and he could hear his little kitty heart pounding there was a crackling noise inside of his head like someone was popping bubble wrap in his ear canal and then there was pressure on the roof of his mouth painful pressure and more crackling he felt something give and two sharp points poking his lower lip he pushed back from the cat and grinned at jody who yelped and jumped back a step fangth tommy said yes i can see that jody said whyd you jump do they look thupid you startled me is all jody said looking away from him like he was an arc welder or a total eclipse and full eye contact might blind her she waved him on go go go be careful not too hard right tommy said he grinned again and she shied away tommy turned back braced the cat who seemed much less freaked by this process than the two vampires in the room and bit thuppt thuppt ack tommy stood up and started brushing at his tongue to remove cat hair yuck hold still jody said going to him and brushing the loose damp cat hair away from his face she went to the kitchen counter and came back with a glass of water and a paper towel which she used to wipe at tommys tongue just use the water to rinse dont swallow it you wont be able to keep it down im not going to thwollow it my mouf is full of cat hair once he had rinsed jody picked the last of the hairs from his mouth and in doing so she pricked one of her fingers on tommys right fang ouch she pulled her finger away and put it in her mouth oh jeez tommy said he pulled her finger out of her mouth and put it in his his eyes rolled back in his head and he moaned through his nose oh i dont think so jody said she grabbed his hand and bit into his forearm attaching herself to him like a remora to a shark tommy growled flipped her around and threw her facedown on the futon his arm still in her mouth she flipped her hair to the side and he sank his teeth into her neck she screamed but the shriek was muted bubbling out on tommys bloody forearm chet the huge cat hissed and bolted across the room through the bedroom door to wedge himself under the bed as the sounds of straining leather tearing denim and screaming predators filled the loft the irony that it sounded like a huge catfight was completely lost on the huge cat chapter four red and white and dead all over rapoc stuffing and chicken feathers lay in great fluffy drifts across the room along with the shreds of their clothing the futon cover pieces of a fuzzy muppetskin rug and the crushed remains of a couple of cheapass pier paper lanterns sparks crackled from the bare wires over the breakfast bar where the pendulum light fixtures used to hang the loft looked as if someone had thrown a hand grenade into the middle of a teddybear orgy and the only survivors had had their fur blown off well that was different jody said still a little breathless she was lying across the coffee table looking out the window at a streetlight from an upsidedown angle naked except for one sleeve of her red leather jacket she was smeared with blood from head to toe and even as tommy watched the scratches and fang marks on her skin were healing over if id known tommy said panting id have grown a foreskin a long time ago he lay across the room where she had thrown him sprawled on a pile of books and kindling that had once been a bookshelf also smeared with blood and covered in scratcheswearing only a sock as he pulled a pencilsized splinter of bookcase out of his thigh tommy thought that he might have been a little hasty about yelling at jody for turning him into a vampire although he couldnt really remember much of it he was pretty sure hed just had the most amazing sex ever apparently what he had read about vampire sex being all about drinking the blood and nothing elseit was just another myth like the changing into a bat and the inability to cross running water did you know that was going to happen tommy asked i had no idea jody said still on the coffee table and looking more to tommy every minute like a murder victim except that she was talking and smiling i was going to make you buy me dinner and take me to a movie first tommy chucked the bloody bookcase splinter at her i dont mean did you know we were going to do it i mean did you know that it was going to be like that how would i know that i thought maybe the night you spent with the old vampire jody sat up i didnt do him tommy i just spent the night with him trying to find out about how to be a vampire and his name is elijah oh so now youre on a firstname basis oh for the love of god tommy would you stop thinking youre taking what was an amazing experience and sucking all the life out of it tommy fidgeted on his pile of rubble and started to pout but winced when he tried to push out his lower lip and it caught on his fangs she was right hed always been like that always overthinking overanalyzing sorry he said you have to just be part of the world now jody said softly you cant put everything into categories separate yourself from experience by putting words on it like the song says let it be sorry tommy said again he tried to push the thoughts out of his head closed his eyes and listened to his heartbeat and jodys heartbeat coming from across the room its okay jody said sex like that does sort of beg for a postmortem tommy smiled his eyes still closed so to speak jody stood up and crossed the room to where he was sitting she offered him her hand to help him up careful the back of your head is kind of stuck in the dry wall tommy turned his head and heard plaster cracking im still starving she pulled him to his feet im feeling a little drained myself my bad tommy said he could remember now her blood pulsing into him at the same time that his was pulsing into her he rubbed a place on his shoulder where the punctures from her fangs hadnt quite healed yet she kissed the spot he was rubbing youll heal faster when youve had fresh blood tommy felt an ache like a sudden cramp in his stomach i really need to eat jody led him into the bedroom where chet the huge cat was cowering in the corner hiding unsuccessfully behind the wicker hamper wait jody said she padded back out into the great room and came back a few seconds later wearing what was left of her red leather jacket really more of a vest now and her panties which she had to hold together on one side where theyd been torn off sorry she said im not comfortable being naked in front of strangers tommy nodded hes not a stranger jody hes dinner uhhuh jody said nodding and shaking her head at the same time making her appear like a bloodstained bobblehead doll you go youre new me dont you know some superanimal hypnotism to call him to you nope go get him ill wait tommy looked at her on top of the blood that streaked and smeared her pale skin there were gobs of futon stuffing stuck to her here and there as well as white chicken feathers in her hair from one of the exploded cushions he had feathers and cat hair stuck to his chest and legs were going to have to shave him first you know jody nodded not looking away from the huge cat maybe a shower first good idea tommy put his arm around her but just washing no sex why we already lost the cleaning deposit those shower doors are glass okay but can i wash your no she said she took his hand and dragged him into the bathroom it turned out that superhuman vampire strength came in handy when shaving a thirtyfivepound cat after a couple of false starts which had them chasing chet the huge shavingcreamcovered cat around the loft they discovered the value of duct tape as a grooming tool because of the tape they werent able to shave his feet when they were finished chet looked like a bigeyed potbellied protohuman in furlined ducttape space bootsthe feline love child of golem and doddy the house elf im not sure we needed to shave all of him tommy said sitting on the bed next to jody as they considered the bound and shaven chet on the floor before them he looks creepy pretty creepy jody said youd better drink your wounds arent healing all her scratches bruises and love bites were completely healed and except for a fleck of shaving cream here and there in her hair she was as good as new how tommy asked how do i know where to bite him try the neck jody said but sort of feel around for a vein with your tongue before you bite and dont bite hard she was trying to sound confident in her instructions but she was in unexplored territory as much as he was she was enjoying teaching tommy about the particulars of vampirism just as she enjoyed teaching him how to do grownup human things like how to get the power and phone turned on in the loftit made her feel sophisticated and in charge and after a series of boyfriends for whom she had been little more than an accoutrement whose lifestyles she had affected from heavymetal anarchists to financialdistrict yuppies she liked being the pacesetter for a change still when it came to teaching him about feeding on animals she couldnt have been winging it more if she really could turn into a bat the only time shed ever considered drinking animal blood was when tommy had brought her two large live snapping turtles from chinatown she hadnt been able to bring herself to even try biting into the armored reptiles tommy had named them scott and zelda which hadnt helped now zelda was functioning as a lawn ornament in pacific heights and scott was encased in bronze and standing next to the old vampire in the great room the biker sculptors downstairs had bronzed them which is what had given tommy the idea to bronze jody and the old vampire in the first place are you sure this is okay tommy said bending over chet the huge shaved cat i mean you said that we were only supposed to hunt the sick and the weakthe black auras chets aura is shiny and pink its different with animals she had no idea if it was different with animals shed eaten a moth once wholesnatched it out of the air and downed it before she could think about it she realized now that there were a lot more questions she should have asked elijah when she had had the chance besides youre not going to kill him right tommy said he put his mouth on chets kitty neck like thith jody had to turn away to keep from laughing yeah that looks good he tathes like thaving cream just go jody said kay tommy bit and started to moan almost immediately not a moan of pleasure but the moan of someone who has his tongue stuck on the icecube tray in the freezer chet seemed strangely calm not even struggling against his kitty bonds maybe there was something to the vampires power over his victims jody thought okay thats enough jody said tommy shook his head while still feeding on the huge shaved cat tommy let off you need to leave some nuih tommy said stop sucking the huge cat tommy jody said sternly im not kidding she was kidding a little bit tommy was breathing hard now and a little color had come into his skin jody looked around for something to get his attention she spotted a vase of flowers on the nightstand she pulled out the flowers and tossed the water on tommy and the huge cat he kept feeding the cat shuddered but otherwise remained immobile okay then jody said it was a heavy stoneware vase something tommy had picked up to hold some apology flowers hed brought her from the grocery store where he worked hed been good that way sometimes bringing home apology flowers before hed even done anything to apologize for really you couldnt ask for more than that from a guywhich is why jody slowed to half speed as she brought the vase around in a wide arc that ended with it smacking tommy in the forehead and knocking him back about six feet chet the huge shaved cat yowled miraculously the vase did not break thanks tommy said wiping the blood from his mouth there was a crescentmoonshaped dent in his forehead that was rapidly filling in healing sure jody said staring at the vase great vase she thought elegant fragile porcelain was all well and good for the collectors case or the tea party but for the girl who finds herself in need of a vessel that can deliver a wallop jody was suddenly sold on the sturdy value of stoneware tastes like cat breath tommy said pointing to chet the punctures from tommys fangs had already healed is it supposed to jody shrugged whats cat breath taste like like tuna casserole left out in the sun for a week being from the midwest tommy thought everyone knew what tuna casserole tasted like having been born and raised in carmel california jody knew it only as something eaten by the extinct people on nick at nite i think im going to pass jody said she was hungry but not catbreath hungry she wasnt sure what she was going to do about feeding she couldnt very well try to live off tommy anymore and regardless of the rush and the sense that she was serving natures cause by taking only the weak and the sick she didnt like the idea of preying on humansstrangers anyway she needed time to think to figure out what their new life was going to be like things had been happening too quickly since tommy and his friends had taken down the old vampire she said we should get chet back to his owner tonight if we can you dont want to lose your drivers licensewe may need a valid id to rent a new place a new place we have to move tommy i told inspectors rivera and cavuto that i would leave town you dont think theyll check there had been two homicide detectives who had followed the trail of bodies to the old vampire and ultimately the discovery of jodys delicate condition shed promised them that shed take the old vampire and leave town if theyd let her go oh yeah tommy said that means i cant go back to work at the safeway either he wasnt stupid she knew he wasnt stupid so why was he so slow to see the obvious no i dont think that would be a good idea jody said since youre going to pass out cold at sunrise just the way i do yeah thatd be embarrassing tommy said especially when sunlight hits you and you burst into flames yeah theres got to be company policy against that jody screamed in frustration jeez kidding tommy said cringing she sighed realizing that hed been goofing on her get dressed cat breath we dont want to run out of dark were going to need some help out in the great room the vampire elijah ben sapir was trying to figure out exactly what was going on around him he knew he had been constrainedbound inside a vessel and whatever held him was immovable hed even turned to mist which relieved his anxiety somewhatthere was an ethereal mindset that accompanied the form it took concentration to not let yourself just float off in a dazebut the bronze shell was airtight he could hear them talking but their comments told him little except that his fledgling had betrayed him he smiled to himself what a foolishly human mistake to let hope triumph over reason he should have known better it would be days before the hunger was on him again and even then without any movement he could last indefinitely without blood he could live a very very long time constrained like this he realizedit was his sanity that would suffer he decided to stay in mist formdrift as in a dream at night sleep like the dead during the day this way he would wait and when the time came and it would come if nothing else living for eight hundred years had taught him patience he would make his move chapter five the emperor of san francisco two in the morning normally the emperor of san francisco would have been tucked in behind a dumpster with the royal guard snuggled around him for warmth snoring like a congested bulldozer but tonight he had been undone by the generosity of a starbucks froth slave in union square who had donated a bucketsized holiday spice mochaccino to the cause of royal comfort thus leaving the emperor and his two companions jangled wandering the wee hours on a nearly deserted market street waiting for breakfast time to roll around like crack with cinnamon said the emperor he was a great boiler tank of a man an ambling meat locomotive in a wool overcoat his face a firebox of intensity framed with a gray tempest of hair and beard such as are found only on gods and lunatics bummer the smaller of the troops a boston terrier snorted and tossed his head hed lapped up some of the rich coffee broth himself and felt ready to tear ass out of any rodent or pastrami sandwich that might cross his path lazarus normally the calmer of the two a golden retriever pranced and leapt at the emperors side as if it might start raining ducks any minutea recurring nightmare among retrievers steady gents the emperor chided lets us use this inopportune alertness to inspect a less frantic city than we find in the day and determine where we might be of service the emperor believed that the first duty of any leader was to serve the weakest of his people and he made an effort to pay attention to the city around him lest someone fall through the cracks and be lost clearly he was a loon calm good fellows he said but calm was not coming the smell of cat was tall in the air and the men were jacked on java lazarus barked once and bolted down the sidewalk followed closely by his bugeyed brotherinarms the two descending on a dark figure that lay curled up around a cardboard sign on the traffic island at battery street beneath a massive bronze statue that depicted four muscular men working a metal press it had always looked to the emperor like four guys molesting a stapler bummer and lazarus sniffed the man beneath the statue sure that he had to have a cat concealed among his rags somewhere when a cold nose hit a hand the emperor saw the man move and breathed a sigh of relief with a closer look the emperor recognized him as william with the huge cat they knew each other to nod hello but because of racial tensions between their respective canine and feline companions the two had never become friends the emperor knelt on the mans cardboard sign and jostled him william wake up william groaned and an empty johnny walker black bottle slid out of his overcoat dead drunk perhaps said the emperor but fortunately not dead bummer whimpered where was the cat the emperor propped william up against the concrete base of the statue william groaned hes gone gone gone gone the emperor picked up the empty scotch bottle and sniffed it yes it had recently held scotch william was this full william grabbed the cardboard sign off the sidewalk and propped it in his lap gone he said the sign read i am poor and someone stole my huge cat my deepest sympathies said the emperor he was about to ask william how he had managed to procure a fifth of topshelf scotch when he heard a long feline yowl echo down the street and looked up to see a huge shaved cat in a red sweater heading their way he managed to catch hold of bummer and lazaruss collars before they darted after the cat and dragged them away from william the huge cat leapt into williams lap and the two commenced a drunken reunion embrace that involved quantities of purring baby talk and drool enough that the emperor had to fight down a little nausea at the sight of it even the royal hounds had to look away the two realizing instinctively that a maudlin and shaved thirtyfivepound cat in a red sweater was clearly above their pay grade there was just no doggy protocol for it and presently they began to turn in circles on the sidewalk as if looking for a good place to feign a nap william i believe someone has shaved your cat said the emperor that would be me said tommy flood as he came around the side of the traffic island scaring the bejeezus out of everyone there a pale and delicate hand reached out from behind the island grabbed the collar of tommys coat and snatched him back around the corner as if he were a rag doll tommy called the emperor the big man stalked around the concrete art bunker bummer and lazarus had headed back down the street toward the waterfront as if they had just seen a particularly fetching porterhouse steak hopping around down there that needed to be investigated the emperor found his friend c thomas flood held tight in the clutches of his girlfriend jody stroud the vampire who had her hand pressed tightly over tommys mouth and was furiously giving him noogies with the knuckle of her other hand there was a hollow popping each time she connected and muted cries from tommy jody i must insist that you unhand the young man insisted the emperor and she did tommy twisted out of her grasp ow tommy said rubbing his head sorry jody said couldnt be helped i thought you were going to leave the city with that fiend said the emperor he had been there with the royal hounds and tommys crew from the safeway when theyd done battle with the old vampire at the st francis yacht club well yes of course he left already and im going to join him jody said just like i promised inspector rivera but i wanted to make sure that tommy was going to be all right before i left the emperor liked jody and had been a little disappointed when he found that she was a bloodsucking fiend but she was a pleasant girl nonetheless and had always been generous with treats for the men despite bummers dropping into yapping fits in her presence well then i suppose that will have to do said the emperor it appears that our young writer does require some adult supervision before being set loose on the city hey i do okay tommy said you shaved the cat said the emperor raising a wild eyebrow that looked like a gray squirrel with a mohawk iuh we were testing him out to see if i should get a cat to keep me company after jody leaves he looked at jody who nodded enthusiastically while trying to look wideeyed and sincere and and tommy continued i was chewing some bubble gum you know the kind that you can blow really big bubbles withwell long story short before i knew it chet had lunged at one of my bubbles and was completely covered with bubble gum jody quit nodding and just stared at him so you shaved him the emperor added now it was tommys turn to nod and look sincere regrettably jody was nodding again too regrettably she echoed i see said the emperor they certainly seemed sincere well the sweater was considerate my idea jody said you know so he doesnt get chilled its actually my sweater tommy washed it and put it in the dryer so its a little too small for me and dont think it was easy getting a cat that size into a sweater tommy said it was like trying to dress a ball of razor wire im cut to ribbons he pushed his sleeves up to expose his forearms which were distinctly not cut to ribbons they were in fact unmarked if a little pale well good show then the emperor said backing away the men and i will be on our way then do you guys need anything your majesty jody asked no no we have been most fortunate this evening most fortunate indeed well take care then jody said even as the emperor backed around the corner and headed up the street she can be deceptively pleasant for a blooddrinking agent of evil the emperor thought bummer and lazarus were almost out of sight four blocks ahead they had known the rascals the emperor was disgusted with himself leaving william there like that at the mercy of the fiends there was no telling what they might do the two of them but he felt fear chilling his spine and he couldnt make himself turn around perhaps they wouldnt hurt poor william after all they had been sweet children in life both of them and even in her current state jody had shown a certain quality of mercy by waiting until now to turn tommy still he had a city he was responsible for and he could not shirk that responsibility it was a long walk to the marina safeway but he had to reach it before the night crew left as knavish as they might be they were the only people in his city who actually had experience hunting vampires bite him tommy said he was standing over the huge cat guy who had passed out again under the statue jody shook her head and shuddered hes filthy dont tell me you cant smell that since shed become a vampire shed only experienced nausea when she tried to eat real food but she was nauseated now despite the hunger grating in her core here ill clean off a spot tommy fished a tissue out of his coat pocket licked it and cleaned a spot on williams neck there go for it yuck i bit the cat tommy said you said yourself that you were starving but hes hammered jody said she was taking little steps in place like a little kid who has to pee bite him quit saying bite him i dont think of it like that how do you think of it i dont really think of it its sort of an animal thing oh i see tommy said bite him before some cops come along and take him away and you miss your chance ewww jody said kneeling beside william chet the huge cat looked up at her from williams lap then put his head down and closed his eyes blood loss had mellowed him jody pushed williams head aside and reared back with her mouth open wide as her fangs extended she closed her eyes and bit see how easy that was tommy said jody glared at him without letting go her breath rasping through her nose as she fed she thought i should have hit him harder when i had the chance finally when she felt shed taken enough to sustain her but not enough to hurt the huge cat guy she pulled away sat down and looked up at tommy youve got a little tommy gestured to the corner of her mouth she wiped her mouth with her hand came away with a little lipstick and a little blood she looked at williams neck its was sort of a dirtgray color with a white spot rimmed in lipstick the punctures from her fangs had already healed but the lipstick sort of stood out like a target she reached over and wiped the lipstick off with her palm then wiped her palm off on the huge cats sweater chet purred william snored jody climbed to her feet how was it tommy asked how do you think it was it was necessary well i mean when you used to bite me it was kind of a sexual thing oh right jody snapped i planned all this because i wanted to fuck the huge cat guy she was feeling a little lightheaded for some reason sorry we should get him off of market street tommy said before he gets robbed or arrested hes got to have some of the money left that much alcohol would have killed him the hell do you care writer boy you shaved and ate his cat or was that a sexual thing she was definitely feeling lightheaded that was a mutual oh bullshit bite him see how sexual it is get a taste of that downhome human hemoglobin goodness tommy dont be a wuss jody said well he was being a wuss tommy stepped back youre drunk and youre being a wuss jody said wuss wuss wuss help me take his feet theres a sheltered alcove over by the federal reserve building across the street he can sleep it off there jody bent to take the guys feet but they seemed to move as she reached for them and when she corrected she missed and fell forward catching herself so that she was on all fours with her ass in the air yeah that worked tommy said how about you take chet and ill carry the huge cat guy whadever mr wussyman jody said maybe she was a little tipsy in the old days prevampire days shed tried to stay away from alcohol because it turned out that she was sort of an obnoxious drunk or thats what her exfriends had told her tommy picked up chet the huge cat who squirmed as he held him out to jody take him you are not the head vampire here jody said fine tommy said he slung chet under his arm and in a single movement scooped up the huge cat guy and threw him over his shoulder with the other arm careful crossing the street tommy called back to her as he crossed ha jody said i am a finely tuned predator i am a superbeing i and at that point she bounced her forehead off a light pole with a dull twang and was suddenly lying on her back looking at the streetlights above her which kept going out of focus the bastards ill be back to get you tommy called hes so sweet jody thought chapter six do animals get the blues clint was the only one of the animals still left at the marina safeway he was tall with a wild mop of dark hair and thick hornrimmed glasses that were held together with medical tape and he had a look of deep panic on his face hed been trying to keep the store together for nearly a week with only a couple of stock boys from the day crew and a porter from a temp service even gustavo the mexican porter with five kids had taken off with the animals but now a huge order had come in on the truck and he knew he needed professionals he dialed tommys number for the fifth time that night it was four in the morning but tommy was their leaderand perhaps the best frozenturkey bowler the world had ever known he knew what it meant to be an animal he would be awake the machine beeped clint said dude theyre all gone i need your help its just me some temps and the lord tonight clint had been recently reborn after five years in a druginduced haze he swore that the lord would forever be on his night crew the guys took off for vegas call me no just bring your box cutter and come to work im buried once they had been nine strong the animals nine men all under the age of twentyfive left alone in a grocery store for eight hours with only tommy to supervise them theyd been given their name by the day manager who had come in one morning to find them drunk hanging from the giant safeway letters on the front of store pelting one another with marshmallows tommy had recruited them to fight the old vampire theyd found the vampire sleeping inside a vault on his yacht and they had also found his art collection after selling it for ten cents on the dollar each of them had netted a hundred thousand dollars tommy went home with jody clint went home to pray for the vampires soul simon had been killed the rest of the animals headed for vegas clint hung up the phone then sat down hard in the managers chair it was too much responsibility the weight of it would drive him over the edge even now he could hear dogs barking in his head front door the temp night porter called over the half wall of the office clint stood up to see the emperor and his dogs at the double electric doors he grabbed the keys disarmed the alarm and opened the door the boston terrier shot by him heading for the beefjerky display your majesty clint said youre out of breath the big man held his chest as he panted gather the troops young man c thomas flood has been turned to a bloodsucking fiend gather your weapons we must charge again into the breach its just me and noobs clint said did you say that tommys a vampire indeed i saw him not two hours ago as pale as death well thats not good your talent for stating the obvious is unprecedented young man come in clint stepped away from the door we are going to need to pray on this well theres a start said the emperor then i need to call tommy and tell him to never mind about coming to work clint said splendid said the emperor without a hint of sarcasm i believe weve achieved a new level of doomed youve always been good to me jody said well i try tommy said he was going up the narrow stairway to their loft she was slung over his shoulder her forehead bounced off his belt with every step she seemed so light tommy was still amazed at his newfound strength hed carried her ten blocks already and he wasnt even feeling it well he was a little tired of listening to her but physically he wasnt fatigued at all i can be such a bitch sometimes thats not true tommy said yes it was yes it is yes it is yes i am i am a total bitch sometimes tommy stopped at the top of the steps and dug in his pocket for his keys well maybe a little but so i am a bitch youre saying im a bitch oh my god is the sun never going to come up listen youre lucky to have me you wuss yes i am tommy said you are he swung her over to her feet then caught her before she went over backwards into the wall she had a big goofy smile on her face sometime during the evening blood had dripped down the front of her blouse and there was some smeared on her lip she looked a little like shed been punched out tommy tried to rub away the blood with his thumb the cloud of alcohol breath she let go on him made him wince i love you tommy she fell into his arms right back at you jody im sorry i gave you noogies im still learning to harness my powers you know thats okay and called you a wuss no problem she licked the side of his neck nipped at him lets make love before the sun comes up tommy looked over her shoulder at the destruction they had wrought on the loft the last time theyd done it and he said something he never thought he would hear coming out of his own mouth i think ive had enough for tonight maybe we should just lock down you think im fat dont you no youre perfect its because im fat she pushed him away and stumbled into the bedroom then tripped and tumbled facefirst into the shredded remains of their bed and old she added although it was only through his acute vampire hearing that tommy understood this since she was speaking directly into the mattress fat and old she said youre going to get whiplash from those mood swings red tommy said quietly as he climbed into bed with his clothes on then he lay there beside her thinking about all that they had to do about how they were going to have to find a place and move without going out during the day and beyond that just exactly how were they going to survive and stay hidden the emperor could tell tommy could tell he could tell and as much as he liked the emperor it wasnt a good sign and so even as he worried and listened to his girlfriend yell at him c thomas flood became the first vampire in history to actually pray for the sun to come up a few minutes later his prayers were answered and the two of them went out since becoming a vampire jody had always hated the way consciousness came on at dusk like the streetlights coming on there was no groggy twilight between sleep and wakefulness just bam welcome to the night heres your todo list not tonight tonight she got her twilight her grogginess and a headache as well she sat upright in bed so fast she nearly somersaulted off the end then when her head didnt seem to follow her she lay back down with such force that her pillow exploded sending out a snowstorm of feathers to whirl around the room she moaned and tommy came bounding into the room hey he said ouch jody said grabbing her forehead with both hands as if to hold her brains in thats new huh vampire hangover tommy waved some feathers out of the air in front of him i feel like death warmed over jody said cute ill bet youre missing coffee right now and aspirin ive fed off of you when youd been drinking why did it affect me now i think maybe the huge cat guy had a little more in his blood than i did anyway i have a theory about that we can test it later when you feel better but right now we have a ton of stuff we have to do weve got to figure out the move clint called me from the store last night wanting me to work then he called back all freaked out saying i shouldnt come in tommy played the message for her twice he knows jody said yeah but how does he know doesnt matter he knows fuck little bit softer now jody said holding her hair like it was hurting her too loud jody nodded you know for your notebook tommy vampire senses when youre hungover not so good really that bad your breath is nauseating me from across the room yeah we need toothpaste theres someone at the door jody covered her ears she could hear sneakers scraping the sidewalk from all the way downstairs there is the door buzzer sounded yep she said tommy ran to the front windows and looked down to the street theres a humvee limo out there thats about a block long youd better answer it jody said maybe we should just hide pretend we re not home no you need to get it jody said she could hear the shuffling at the door the rock and roll playing in the limo the bong bubbling lines being chopped on a cd case and a male voice repeating the phrase sweet blue titties over and over like a mantra she grabbed the pillow from tommys side of the bed and pulled it over her head answer it tommy its the fucking animals dude said lash jefferson a wiry black man with a newly shaved scalp wearing mirror shades he pulled tommy out of his doorway and hugged him furiouslycrazed backslamming goodtoseeyou guy hugs we are so fucked dude lash continued tommy pushed away trying to reconcile that he was glad to see his friend with the fact that lash smelled like a beerbar urinal filled with mackerel i thought you guys went to vegas tommy said yeah yeah we did everyones in the limo its just that i need to talk to you can we go inside no tommy almost said that jody was sleeping which had been his excuse for keeping the animals out of his loft in the past but jody was supposed to have left town step in the stairway ive got something happening upstairs lash nodded and looked over the top of his shades and bounced his eyebrows his eyes were bloodshot and glazed over tommy could hear his heart racing coke or fear he guessed both maybe look dude lash said first thing we need to borrow some money what you guys have over a hundred grand each from the art we sold yeah we did we had a big weekend tommy figured in his head you guys blew over six hundred grand in whatfour days no lash said no not all of it were not completely broke then why do you need to borrow money just twenty grand or so to get us through to tomorrow lash said luckily i almost have my mba and have mad business skills otherwise wed have been broke yesterday tommy nodded twenty grand was about six months salary for him at the safeway hed been a little intimidated by lashs almostmba up until now now he was just worried that lash would be able to tell he had changed he said so like you were saying youre fucked we were doing fine only down like ten grand each until we met blue lash looked at the ceiling wistfully like it was a distant memory he was trying to conjure instead of something that had happened a couple of nights ago blue you know that group they have in vegas the blue men yeah the guys who paint themselves blue and pound on pipes and stuff tommy was lost yeah lash said well it turns out there are blue women too or at least theres one and dude shes sucking us dry in the back seat of the limo blue held barrys face between her boobs snugly enough to keep him under control but not so snug that he couldnt breathe while the other animals had drunk smoked and fucked themselves into a zombielike stuporand now lay sprawled about the glittery interior of the limobarry had opted to do two hits of xtc a line of coke and a bong load of sticky skunk weed which had put his brain into some sort of redundant tribal loop that had him kneeling naked before her chanting sweet blue titties for the last twenty minutes she just couldnt take it anymore so she had grabbed his curlfringed bald head and pulled his face into her cleavage just to shut him up mercifully he had gone quiet because she really didnt want to suffocate him as long as he still had money it takes a meandering road of wrong turns to take a girl from being the milkyskinned cheddar princess of fond du lac wisconsin to a bluedyed call girl turning tricks at downtown casinos in vegas but blue would be damned if shed add yet another wrong turn by smothering a golden goose between her proportionally improbable silicon joy orbs the animals were her way out and if she had to stay in character as an alien pleasure unit or a blueberry muffin to keep them on the hook she would blue was a method hooker early in her adventures after shed left cocktailing due to a propensity for spilling drinks and before shed begun stripping where her lack of balance was mitigated by the presence of a sturdy pole she had a short career acting in lowbudget porn she befriended a promising actress named lotta vulva who gave her a book on the stanislavski method if you can find your sense memory lotta said it will keep you from barfing on the actors directors hate that the method had served blue well since then as it allowed her to calculate betting odds or figure her checkbook while her character was performing acts that she herself would have found unpleasant or outright disgusting how much better to reside in her sense memory of the budding cheddar princess coaxing the hearty wholemilk goodness from the udders of a holstein than to face the harshly lit reality of her actions after six months blue was driven out of the film business by a defect one director called not enough tits to fill a shot glass which no amount of method was able to remedy she returned to cocktailing albeit at a strip club where she seldom had to carry more than one tendollar beer at a time until she saved enough money for breastaugmentation surgery and made her way to the pole she danced her way through her twenties before she was driven off the stage by younger more gravityresistant girls and because she had skipped personal typing class in high school and had therefore besmirched her permanent record she landed in the employ of an outcall escort service i feel like im doing dominos delivery blow jobs blue told her roommate satisfaction in twenty minutes or less or your money back and the agency is taking most of the money ill never get out of this business at this rate you need a gimmick said her roommate a cocktail waitress at the venetian like those blue men guys in the show i swear theyd just be a bunch of frat boys beating on garbage cans if they werent painted blue and so it began the fallen cheddar princess of fond du lac found some semipermanent skin dye opened creditcard deposit accounts had some pictures taken placed ads in all the free sleaze rags around the city and blue was born it wasnt as if she wouldnt have been able to make a living without the gimmickmost guys will shag a snake if you hold it steady for them but it turned out they would pay a lot for the exotica of a blue woman she worked as much as she could handle and her savings had climbed to the point where she could actually see the possibility of an exit but about that same time she realized that by going blue she had opted out of the pipe dream of every hooker stripper and telemarketer the rich guy who would take her away from it all the whale who would drop a fortune on her to become his personal pet there would be no big score for the blue chick or so she thought until the animals called her in for a combination strip show and fuckfest where they got the money didnt matter what mattered was that they had a lot of it and it appeared that they would keep giving it to her until it was all gone she had nearly half a million dollars in her makeup case and bluethe character bluecould put up with a lot of attention from the animals while she hid in the back of her mind and formulated an investment strategy the tall skinny one drew had opened the hotelroom door and said hi we discussed it and agreed that when we were kids we all really wanted to bone a smurf i get that a lot said blue we just wanted to bone a smurf lash said understandably said tommy shes really nice lash said important quality in a ho said tommy but now we cant seem to quit so you want me to do whathold an intervention no youre our leader we look to you for other things so we want you to give us money so we can keep partying and pay our rents and stuff and when all of my money is gone then i can intervene sure if you feel you have to said lash hows your credit lash are you high of course right of course what was i thinking tommy was relaxing now about lash noticing that he was a vampire clearly the former stewards of safeway night stock in addition to being wasted had gone collectively out of their minds lash i dont almost have an mba like you but isnt there sort of some business principle that youre violating i mean isnt there a class about not spending your rent money on hookers or something step off flood lash said you hooked up with a vampire she was cute tommy said an important quality in a vampire lash said looking over the top of his shades she had sex with me tommy countered he wanted to say that she was nice but lash had already used nice for his blue hooker i think ive made my point lash said give me your money you havent made your point you completely havent made your point tommy reared back as if to punch lash in the chest as the animals did to one another all the time but remembered that now he might crush some of the animals ribs instead he said dont make me cave in your skinny chest beeyotch your redheaded vampire kung fu is no match for the fearsome blue booty kung fu lash made a howling chicken noise and waved his hands around as he fell back into a fighting stance then went right back onto his ass on the steps he laughed until he choked then coughed and said seriously dude if you dont give us money were going to be totally broke in about six hours i did the math you could go back to work tommy said clint called here last night theyre buried at the store they need night stockers no lash said pulling down his sunglasses yes tommy said then were not fired evidently not tommy said thats it we could go back to work thats what well tell her we have to go back to work why didnt you just tell her to go away before she did you all the way here from vegas we didnt want to be rude oh right well then off you go lash pushed to his feet and steadied himself on the banister long enough to look tommy in the eye you okay you look pale im heartbroken and shit tommy said he hated it but lashs bloodshot eyes peering over the sunglasses had actually given him a twinge of hunger right lash went through the security door tommy watched him as he paused at the rear door of the limo and turned back you need some blue nooky to cheer you up lash asked our treat no im good tommy said all for one and whatnot lash said appreciate it tommy shrugged heartbroken okay lash threw open the limos door and two of the animals drew and troy lee rolled out onto the pavement followed by a great storm cloud of pot smoke fuck dude did you know there was a door there said drew the scruffy thin one look said troy lee the asian guy who actually did know kung fu hey look its fearless leader go to work tommy said its only seven you guys can get sobered up and be completely ready for your shift at eleven not a chance tommy thought yeah we can do it lash said peeking into the limo hey barry climb off motherfucker im up next then its jeffs turn i put it on the board blue dont let him do that to your ear baby you wont hear for a month tommy closed the security door and sat down hard on the steps hiding his face in his hands to try to make it all go away the animals had been his friends his crew they had taken him in when he was alone in the city made him their leader and if he got the tone of clints second message right in about four hours when they got to the store they were going to turn on him chapter seven the list while jody showered tommy made a list feed laundry new apartment toothpaste sweet monkey love windex dispose of vampire minion what

list i think the pale thing is giving me away at seven in the evening three days before christmas union square was awash in shoppers there was a santas village set up in the raised square with a line of children and parents that wound five hundred deep through a labyrinth of red velvet cattle gates around the square the street performers who would normally have knocked off around five lined the granite steps up to the square a juggler here a sleightofhand guy there a halfdozen robots people painted silver and gold who would move in machinejerk rhythm for the drop of a coin or a billand even a couple of human statues jodys favorite was a gold guy in a business suit who stood motionless for hours on end as if hed been frozen in midstep on the way to work there was a small hole in his briefcase into which people stuffed bills and dropped coins after photographing him or trying to make him flinch this guy used to freak me out tommy whispered but now i can see him breathing and the aura thing i watched him for a whole lunch hour one time and he never moved jody said in the summer you know he has to be suffering in that painted suit suddenly she shuddered at the thought of elijah the old vampire still encased in bronze back at the loft yes he had killed her technically but in a way hed just opened a door for her a door that no matter how bizarre was immediate vital and passionate and yes hed done it for his amusement hed said but also because he was lonely she wound her arm into tommys and kissed him on the cheek what was that for because youre here she said whats first on the list christmas presents skip down sweet monkey love yeah well do it in the santas workshop window at macys really no not really okay then we need liquor jody snatched the list out of his

considering that im homeless and you guys shaved my cat you were pretty hammered last night yeah but i feel great today thats how it used to affect me tommy said remember kind of energizing jody waved tommy away you didnt get lightheaded or anything jody asked i was a little hungover when i woke up but i was fine after a couple of cups of coffee fuck jody spat then she held her head calm tommy said patting her shoulder dr flood will make it all better maybe jody growled just loud enough for tommy to hear ya know said william when there was a break in the pedestrian traffic and he didnt have to concentrate on looking pathetic im flush for cash but since youre in the christmas spirit id still go for a look at reds hooters bite me dirtbag jody said as she rolled up on william honey tommy caught the back of her newly purchased red leather jacket just in case theyd never know if his idea was going to work if jody snapped the bums neck i will not be sexually harassed by the entree something you ate isnt agreeing with you tommy grinned at her when she looked back at him but the fire went out of her eyes you can just cross sweet monkey love right off your list jody said jeez what a bitch said william her time of the month tommy quickly wrapped his arms around jody lifted her off her feet and carried her a few steps around the corner even as she squirmed let me go im not going to hurt him good much thats what i thought tommy said still holding her tight why dont you head over to the walgreens and ill finish up with the huge cat guy a family of christmas shoppers smiled as they passed them thinking they were young lovers indulging in a public display of affection the father whispered get a room under his breath to his wife which a normal person wouldnt have heard count your lucky stars buddy we almost did it in the santas workshop window hot sweaty elf sexin front of the kids the kids would have liked that huh the father hurried his family on down the street nice jody said way to stay under the radar well you know i like to stay sharp tommy said because he was nineteen and had only started having sex regularly since he met jody he still thought he had some sort of secret knowledge that was unavailable to other people how can they possibly be thinking about anything else he thought in the private part of his mind ill bet it smells like peppermint tommy said what elf sex would you please put me down okay but dont hurt the huge cat guy im fine ill meet you at the drugstore in five minutes this had better work five minutes tommy said cinnamon maybe it smells like cinnamon the pale couple stalked the aisles of the walgreens having a great time dismissing the crass accoutrements of bourgeois american life and generally scoffing at all the conventions of traditional culture they were elite after all special chosenif you willif only by the nature of their heightened sensitivities and superior sensibilities they both claimed the ability to look past the façade put on by most people and see the very depths of the human soul strange then that they didnt see it coming when the skinny guy in a flannel shirt popped around the corner in front of them lets ask these guys flannel said they look like heroin addicts jared white wolf and abby normal backpedaled from the eyeliner display where theyd been looking for something hypoallergenic abbys eyes had been watering all night causing her makeup to run and giving her more of a sadclownoflife look than she was going for jared hid behind abby just a little which was awkward since he was nearly a foot taller than she the guy in flannel was joined by a beautiful pale redhead carrying an armload of toiletries what amazing hair abby thought looking at the long red tresses id give anything for hair like that tommy leave these poor people alone said the redhead no wait flannel turned to abby and smiled do you guys know where they keep the syringes abby looked at jared who looked at the guy in flannel well you cant just buy them jared said he was fiddling with the leather straps on his bondage pants looking coy abby slapped his hand you need a prescription to buy syringes abby said do you really think i look like a heroin addict jared threw his bangs out of his face dramatically his head was shaved except for his bangs which reached to his chin specifically so he could throw them out of his face dramatically i was like thinking that maybe i should bulk up you know eat and stuff but well thanks said flannel shirt the redhead moved off down the aisle i was going to try some heroin but if you cant buy needles well there you go see you guys nice shirt by the way abby looked down at her tshirt black of course with the image of a poet taken from a nineteenthcentury etching like you even know who it is she walks in beauty like the night quoted the flannelshirt guy he winked at her then grinned byrons a hero of mine see ya he turned and started to walk away abby reached out and snagged his sleeve hey there are needle exchange programs all over town theyre listed in the bay guardian thanks said flannel he turned and abby grabbed him again were going to be at the glas kat theres a goth club tonight fivehundred block of fourth street i know a dealer there you know for your heroin the flannelshirt guy nodded and looked at byrons picture on her shirt again then at her face fucksocks hes so looking at my streaking eye makeup thanks milady said flannel shirt and he was gone off over the dark moors of the tampon aisle what was that about whined jared hes so so happy days jared white wolf spent a lot of time watching nick at nite when he wasnt brooding or fussing with his appearance abby walked into the flap of jareds black duster and pounded his slight chest with her palms didnt you see didnt you see what you acting like a complete ho he had fangs abby said well so do i jared said reaching into his pocket and pulling out a pair of perfect dentistryquality vampire fangs duh everybody does yeah but his grew i saw them lets go abby said pulling jared white wolf by his great batwing lapels i have to change into something hot before we go to the club wait i want to get some halls my throat is raw from all the cloves we smoked last night hurry the buckles of abbys black platform boots jangled as she dragged her friend past the lipsticks and hair products before he could get interested okay said jared but if i dont meet a cute guy tonight you have to stay up all night and hold me while i cry you should try black lipstick sometime tommy said to jody as they approached their building their arms loaded with packages he was still thinking about the kids at the drugstore it was the first time since tenth grade that hed used his knowledge of romantic poetry for a while hed tried molding himself into the tragic romantic hero brooding and staring clenchjawed off into space as he composed dark verse in his head but it turned out that trying to appear tragic in incontinence indiana was redundant and his mother kept shouting at him and making him forget his rhymes tommy if you keep grinding your teeth like that theyll wear away and youll have to have dentures like aunt ester tommy only wished his beard was as heavy as aunt estersthen he could stare out over the moors while he stroked it pensively yeah jody said because i need to make it more obvious that im an undead creature that feeds on the blood of the living you make it sound so sordid no i meant it in a nice way oh because its not like people wouldnt understand if they found out we were vampires because we slipped up and oh i dont know unsheathed our fangs in the fucking drugstore tommy almost dropped his packages she hadnt said a word about that all night hed hoped she hadnt noticed it was an accident you called that girl milady she was impressed with my byron yeah well your byron was probably sticking out a little too wasnt he it wasnt like that you drooled jody paused at their security door and dug into her jacket for her key tommy stepped around her im still new at this i think im doing pretty well my ghastly pallor obviously impressed the lady at the needle exchange he reached into his bag and fanned out a handful of sterilewrapped and capped syringes congratulations you can now pass as an hivpositive heroin addict très chic he grinned like he imagined a sexy italian manwhore might who drools in public jody said damn shes immune to my sexy italian manwhore grin tommy thought he said be nice im new my lips dont fit together right when my fangs are out she turned the key and swung the door open there passed out on the landing was william the huge cat guy and sleeping on his chest chet the huge cat i told you it would work tommy said jody stepped into the stairwell and closed the door behind her you go first fifteen minutes later as he placed five syringes full of blood in their refrigerator tommy said this vampire thing is going to be great hed had a moment when hed bitten williamnot just getting over the idea of being that close someone who smelled that nasty but also being close to another man period but after cleaning williams neck with an alcohol swab theyd gotten from the drugstore and consoling himself that most literary vampires seemed sexually ambivalent anyway the blood hunger pushed him through he was feeling more relaxed now that they had the food problem solvedfor a while anyway if his friends didnt kill them in the next couple of days he might even enjoy life as a vampire then he turned to jody and frowned but i cant help but think that it may be wrong taking advantage of a homeless alcoholic we could just hunt and kill people jody said cheerfully she had a little crust of williams blood in the corner of her mouth tommy licked his thumb and wiped it away we did give him a nice sweater for his huge shaved cat tommy said i loved that sweater jody said and we are giving him a warm landing to sleep on she added diving onto tommys rationalization dog pile and if we only take a little bit each day hell actually feel better i know i did and we wont become alcoholics ourselves how are you feeling by the way tommy said better hair of the dog you twobeer buzz max ill be fine you want to try the experiment jody checked her watch no time well do it tomorrow night right so on to the list looks like hot monkey love tommy we need to find a daytime person to help us we have to move out of this place ive been thinking about alaska okay good for you but we still need to find a place to live where the animals and inspector rivera cant find us no im thinking we should move to alaska for one thing in the winter its dark for like twenty hours a day so wed have plenty of time and i read somewhere that eskimos put their old people out on the ice when they are ready to die it would be like people were leaving snacks out for us youre kidding eskimo pies he grinned jody put her hand on her hip and looked at him her mouth hanging open a little as if she was waiting for something more when it didnt come she said okay then im going to change into a wolf clothes cadaver breath i didnt know i thought maybe youd learned tommy thought alaska was a great idea just because she was a few years older she always acted like his ideas were stupid the thing with william worked he said defensively as he put away the supplies theyd bought at the drugstore that was a good idea jody said from inside the closet now what well alaska isnt a bad idea tommy theres like nine people in all of alaska well stand out dont you think no everyone is pale there they dont have sun for most of the year she came out of the closet wearing her little black cocktail dress and her strappy comefuckme pumps im ready she said wow tommy said hed forgotten what they were talking about you think the ferrarired lipstick would be too much no i love the ferrarired lipstick on you hot sweet monkey love he thought this was exactly why he loved her in the midst of all of the pressure the danger reallyshe still took time to think of his feelings she lifted her breasts until they threatened to spill out of the plunging neckline of the dress too much perfect tommy said walking toward her with his hands out gimme she breezed past him into the bathroom not for you i need to get going no no no tommy said hot monkey love while tommy watched from the doorway jody applied the ferrarired lipstick checked it then frowned and wiped it off then grabbed a different tube off the vanity when i get back where tommy said sexual frustration had reduced him to single syllables she turned to him with the new coat of maroon lipstick to get your minion not like that youre not tommy said this is how it works tommy this is how i got you nuhuh you werent wearing that when i met you no but the reason you pursued me is because you were interested in me sexually wasnt it well thats how it started but its more than that now and it was more but that was no reason to leave him here all aroused and stuff she walked over to him and put her arms around him he let his hands slip inside the low back of her dress his pants were getting tight and he could feel the pressure of his fangs coming out when i get back she said i promise youre my guy tommy i picked you as my guy forever im going to find someone to help us move and do things for us in the daytime theyre just going to want to bone you and when you dont do them theyll turn on you not necessarily of course they will look at you ill figure it out okay i dont know how else to go about it we could put an ad on craigs list craigs list was a classified web site that had started in the bay area and was now the first place people checked for jobs apartments or nearly everything were not putting an ad on craigs list look tommy we have more things to do than we have time you can clean the loft and go get the laundry done and ill get us an onion minion he corrected whatever i love you she said bitch he was vanquished unfair i love you too ill take one of the disposable cell phones you bought you can call me anytime theyre not even activated yet well get on that buddy the sooner i get out there and find someone the sooner i can get back here for some hot monkey love she has absolutely no sense of ethics he thought shes a monster and yet there she is only a few dress straps from being naked okay he said dont step on the huge cat on the way out jody had only been gone twenty minutes before tommy decided that cleaning and laundry sucked and that he could find a minion as well as she could even if he didnt look as hot in a little black dress he was careful not to wake chet and william on his way out chapter eight she walks in beauty jody moved down columbus avenue with long runwaymodel strides feeling the windblown fog brush by her like the chill ghosts of rejected suitors what she could never teach tommy what she could never really share with him was what it felt like to move from being a victimafraid of attack the shadow around the corner the footsteps behindto being the hunter it wasnt the stalking or the rush of taking down preytommy would understand that it was walking down a dark street late at night knowing that you were the most powerful creature there that there was absolutely nothing no one that could fuck with you until she had been changed and had stalked the city as a vampire she never realized that virtually every moment she had been there as a woman she had been a little bit afraid a man would never understand that was the reason for the dress and the shoesnot to attract a minion but to throw her sexuality out there on display dare some underevolved male to make the mistake of seeing her as a victim truth be told although it had come down to confrontation only once and then shed been wearing a baggy sweatshirt and jeans jody enjoyed kicking ass she also enjoyedevery bit as muchjust knowing that she could it was her secret without fear the city was a great sensual carnival there was no danger in anything she experienced no anxiety red was red yellow didnt mean caution smoke didnt mean fire and the mumbling of the four chinese guys standing by their car just around the corner was just the click and twang of empty swinging dick talk she could hear their hearts speed up when they saw her could smell sweat and garlic and gun oil coming off them shed learned the smell of fear and imminent violence too of sexual arousal and surrender although shed have been hardpressed to describe any of that it was just there like color you know try to describe blue without mentioning blue see there werent a lot of people out on the street at this time of night but there were a few spread up the length of columbus barhoppers late diners just wrapping it up college boys heading down to the strip clubs on broadway the exodus from cobbs comedy club up the street people giddy and so into the rhythm of laughing that they found one another and everything they saw hilariousall of them vibrant wearing auras of healthy pink life trailing heat and perfume and cigarette smoke and gas held through long dinners witnesses the chinese guys werent harmless by any means but she didnt think theyd attack her and she felt a twinge of regret one of them the one with the gun yelled something at her in cantonesesomething sleazy and insulting she could tell by the tone she spun as she walked smiled her biggest red carpet smile and without breaking stride said hey nanodick go fuck yourself there was a lot of bluster and shuffle the smart one the one with fear coming off him held his friend nanodick back thus saving his life she must be a cop or just crazy somethings wrong they clustered around their trickedout honda and huffed out great breaths of testosterone and frustration jody grinned and detoured up a side street away from traffic my night she said to herself mine now off the main drag she saw only a single old man shuffling ahead of her his life aura looked like a burnedout bulb a spot of dark gray around him he walked stooped over with a dogged determination as if he knew that if he stopped he would never start again from what she could tell he never would he wore baggy widewale corduroys that made the sound of rodents nesting when he walked a wisp of breeze off the bay brought jody the acrid smell of failing organs of stale tobacco of despair of a deep rotting sickness and she felt the elation leave her she slipped comfortably into the new slot the night had made for her like tumblers of a lock slipping into place she made sure that she made enough noise so that he could hear her approaching and when she was beside him he paused his feet still moving in tiny steps that turned him to the side as if his motor was idling hi she said he smiled my you are a lovely girl would you walk with me sure they walked a few steps together before he said im dying you know yeah i kind of figured jody said im just walking thinking and walking mostly walking nice night for it a little cold but i dont feel it i got a whole pocketful of painkillers you want one no im good thanks i ran out of things to think about just in time i wondered if id get to kiss a pretty girl once before the end i think that would be all id want whats your name james james omally james my name is jody im pleased to meet you she stopped and offered her hand to shake the pleasure is all mine i assure you said james bowing as best he could she took his face in her hands and steadied him then kissed him on the lips softly and for a long time and when she pulled away they were both smiling that was lovely james omally said yes it was jody said i suppose im finished now james said thank you the pleasure was all mine jody said i assure you then she put her arms around his slight frame and held him one hand cradling the back of his head like an infant and he only trembled a little when she drank a little later she bundled his clothes together under her arm and hooked his old wing tips on two fingers the dust that had been james omally was spread in a powderygray pile on the sidewalk like a negative shadow a bleached spot she brushed it flat with her palm and wrote nice kiss james with her fingernail as she walked away an hourglass trickle of james trailed out of his clothes behind her and was carried off on the chill bay breeze the guy working the door of the glas kat looked like a raven had exploded on his head his hair plastered out in a chaos of black spikes the music coming from inside sounded like robots fucking and complaining about it in rhythmic monotone european robots tommy was a little intimidated sploded ravenhead guy had better fangs than he did was paler and had seventeen silver rings in his lips tommy had counted bet its hard to whistle with those in huh tommy asked ten dollars said sploded tommy gave him the money he checked tommys id and stamped his wrist with a red slash just then a group of japanese girls dressed like tragic victorian baby dolls breezed by behind tommy waving their wrist slashes like theyd just returned from a joyful suicide party instead of smoking cloves on the street they too looked more like vampires than tommy did he shrugged and entered the club everyone it appeared looked more like a vampire than he did hed bought some black jeans and a black leather jacket at the levis store while jody was off finding something hideous for her mother for christmas but evidently he should have been looking for some black lipstick and something cobalt or fuchsiacolored to weave into his hair and in retrospect the flannel shirt may have been a mistake he looked like hed shown up at the sacrificial mass of the damned ready to fix the dishwasher the music changed to an ethereal female chorus of celtic nonsense with a techno beat and robots complaining grumpy robots he tried to listen around it the way jody had taught him with all the black light strobes and black clothing his newly heightened senses were overloading he tried to focus on peoples faces their life auras look through the haze of heat hairspray and patchouli for the girl hed met at walgreens tommy had felt alone in a crowd before even inferior to everyone in a crowd but now he felt well different it wasnt just the clothes and the makeup it was the humanity he wasnt part of it heightened senses or not he felt like he had his nose pressed against the window looking in the problem was it was the window of a donut shop hey someone grabbed his arm and he wheeled around so quickly that the girl nearly tumbled over backwards startled fuck dude hi tommy said wow thinking ah jelly donut it was the girl from walgreens she was nearly a foot shorter than he and a little skinny tonight shed gone with the waifish look wearing striped stockings with holes ripped in them and a shiny red pvc miniskirt shed traded in her lord byron shirt for a tank top black of course with dripping red letters that read got blood and fishnet gloves that went halfway up her biceps her makeup was sadclown marionette black tears drawn streaming down either side of her face she crooked her finger to get him to bend down so she could shout into his ear over the music my names abby normal tommy spoke into her ear she smelled of hairspray and what was that raspberry my name is flood he said c thomas flood it was his pen name the c didnt really stand for anything he just liked the sound of it call me flood he added tommy was a stupid name for a vampire but floodah floodthere was disaster and power there and a hint of mystery he thought abby smiled like a cat in a tuna cannery flood she said flood she was trying it on it seemed to tommy he imagined that shed have a black vinyl binder at school and shed soon be writing mrs flood surrounded by a heart with an arrow through it on the cover in her own blood hed never seen a girl so obviously attracted to him and he realized that he had no experience in dealing with it for a moment he flashed on the three vampire brides of dracula who try to seduce jonathan harker in stokers classic novel hed been studying all the vampire fiction he could get his hands on since meeting jody since it didnt appear that anyone had written a good howto book on vampirism could he really deal with three luscious vampire brides would he have to bring them a kid in a sack the way dracula does in the book how many kids a week would it take to keep them happy and where did you get kid sacks and although he hadnt discussed it with jody he was pretty sure she was not going to be happy sharing him with two other luscious vampire brides even if he brought her sacks and sacks full of kids theyd need a bigger apartment one with a washer and dryer in the building because thered be a lot of bloodstained lingerie to be washed vampire logistics were a nightmare you should get a castle and a staff when you got your fangs how was he going to do all of this this sucks tommy finally said overwhelmed by the enormity of his responsibilities abby looked startled then a little hurt sorry she said you want to get out of here oh no i didnt meani mean uh yes let us go do you still need to get your heroin what no that matter is taken care of you know byron and shelley did opiates abby said laudanum it was like cough syrup then for no reason that he could think of tommy said those scamps they loved to get wrecked and read ghost stories from the german that is so fucking cool abby said grabbing his arm and hugging his biceps like it was her newest bestest friend she started pulling him toward the door what about your friend tommy said oh someone made a comment about his cape being gray when we first got here so he went home to redye all of his blacks of course tommy said thinking what the fuck out on the sidewalk abby said i suppose we need to find somewhere private we do so you can take me abby said stretching her neck to the side looking more like a stringless marionette than ever tommy had no idea what to do how did she know everyone in that club would have scored higher on the are you a vampire test than he would there needed to be a book and this sort of thing needed to be in it should he deny it should he just get on with it what was he going to tell jody when she woke up next to the skinny marionette girl he hadnt really understood women when he was a normal human guy when it seemed that all you had to do was pretend that you didnt want to have sex with them until they would have sex with you but being a vampire added a whole new aspect to things was he supposed to conceal that he was a vampire and a dork he used to read the articles in cosmo to get some clue to the female psyche and so he deferred to advice hed read in an article entitled think hes just pretending to like you so youll have sex with him try a coffee date how bout i buy you a cup of coffee instead he said we can talk its because i have small boobs isnt it abby said going into a very practiced pout of course not tommy smiled in a way he thought would be charming mature and reassuring coffee wont help that as jody pushed the bundle of clothes into the storm sewer a silver cigarette case slid out of the jacket pocket onto the pavement she reached for it and felt a light shockno that wasnt it it was a warmth that moved up her arm she kicked the clothes into the opening and stood under the streetlight turning the silver case in her hands it had his name engraved on it she couldnt keep it like she had the folding money from his pockets but she couldnt throw it away either something wouldnt let her she heard a buzz like an angry insect and looked up to see a neon open sign flickering above a shop called ashers secondhand that was it thats where the cigarette case had to go she owed it to james after all hed given her everything or at least everything hed had left she quickstepped across the street and into the shop the owner was working the counter at the back by himself a thin guy in his early thirties with a look of pleasant confusion not unlike the one shed first noticed on tommys face normally this guy would be prime minion material or at least based on her minion recruitment of the past he would except apparently he was dead or at least not alive like most people he had no life aura around him no healthy pink glow no crusty brown or gray corona of illness nothing the only time shed ever seen this before was with elijah the old vampire the shopkeeper looked up and she smiled he smiled back she moved to the counter while he tried not to stare at her cleavage she looked more closely for some life aura there was heat or at least there appeared to be some heat coming off him hi said the shopkeeper can i help you i found this she said holding up the cigarette case i was in the neighborhood and something made me think that this belonged here she set the case down on the counter how could he have no life aura what the hell was he touch me she said she held out her hand to him huh he seemed a little frightened at first but he took her hand then quickly let go he was warm then youre not one of us but he wasnt one of them either us what do you mean us he touched the cigarette case and she could tell that this was exactly why she had brought it here it was supposed to be here whatever part of james omally had been left in that cigarette case had led her here and this thin confusedlooking guy was supposed to have it he took what was left of people all the time its what he did jody felt some of the confidence shed felt earlier draining away maybe the night wasnt hers after all jody backed away a step no you dont just take the weak and the sick do you you take anyone take what do you mean take he was furiously trying to push the cigarette case back to her across the counter he didnt know he was like she was when shed awakened that first night as a vampire and had no idea what she had become you dont even know do you know what he picked up the cigarette case again wait a second can you see this thing glowing no glow it just felt like it belonged here this poor guy he didnt even know whats your name she asked charlie asher this is ashers well charlie you seem like a nice guy and i dont know exactly what you are and it doesnt seem like you know you dont do you he blushed jody could see his face flush with heat ive been going through some changes lately jody nodded he really would have been perfect as a minionif he hadnt been some bizarre supernatural creature shed just gotten used to the idea of vampires being real and it took some serious blood drinking to drive that reality home and now there were otherotherthings still jody felt bad for him okay she said i know what its like uh to find yourself thrown into a situation where forces beyond your control are changing you into someone something you dont have an owners manual for i understand what it is to not know but someone somewhere does know someone can tell you whats going on and hopefully they arent just fucking with you she wanted to add but thought better of it what are you talking about he asked you make people die dont you charlie she didnt know why she said it but as soon as she said it she knew it was true like when all her other senses had been dialed to eleven she could sense something new like noise on the line and it was telling her this but how do you because its what i do jody said not like you but its what i do find them charlie backtrack and find whoever was there when your world changed she shouldnt have said that she knew it as she was saying it shed just handed him an item that had been owned by someone shed taken not twenty minutes ago but even as regret for passing out incriminating evidence hit her she also realized that she had left tommy out there to wave in the wind just like this guy even if it was only for a few hours tommy had no idea how to go about being a vampiretruth be told he hadnt really been that good at being a human he was just a doofy guy from indiana and shed abandoned him to the merciless city she turned and ran out of the shop cocoa tommy said you look cold hed given her his jacket out on the street hes so gallant abby thought he probably wants me to drink cocoa to get my blood sugar up before he sucks the life from my veins abby had lived much of her life waiting for something extraordinary to happen no matter where she had been there was a world somewhere that was more interesting shed progressed from wanting to live in a fantastic kawaiicute plastic world of hello kitty to being a dayglo manga lollipop space girl in platform sneakers and then just a couple of years ago she had moved into the dark gothic world of pseudo vampires suicidal poets and romantic disappointment it was a dark seductive world where you got to sleep really late on the weekends shed been true to her dark nature too trying to maintain an aspect of exhausted mopeyness while channeling any enthusiasm she felt into a vehicle for imminent disappointment and above all suppressing the deepseated perkiness that her friend lily said shed never shed when shed refused to throw away her hello kitty backpack or let go of her nintendog virtual beagle puppy he has virtual parvo lily had said you have to put him down he doesnt have parvo abby had insisted hes just tired hes doomed and youre cute and hopelessly perky lily taunted i am not im complex and im dark youre perky and your edog has iparvo as azrael is my witness i will never be perky again said abby her wrist set tragically to her forehead lily stood with her as she threw her nintendog cartridge under the tire of the midnight express bus and now she had been chosen by a real creature of the night and she would be true to her word she had shed her perkiness she sipped her hot chocolate and studied the vampire flood across the table how clever that he could appear as just a simple clueless guybut then he could probably take many shapes i could be a slave to your darkest desires abby said i can do things anything you want the vampire flood commenced a coughing fit when he had control again he said well thats terrific because we have a lot of laundry piled up and the apartment is a wreck he was testing her seeing if she was worthy before bringing her into his world anything you desire my lord i can do laundry clean bring you small creatures to quench your thirst until i am worthy the vampire flood snickered this is so cool he said youll do my laundry just like that abby knew she had to tread carefully here not fall for his trap anything she said have you ever gone apartment hunting sure she lied okay you can start tomorrow first thing you need to find us an apartment abby was horrified she hadnt really tried on the idea of leaving her old life so quickly but all that would mean nothing when she became immortal and ran with the children of the night but her mom was going to be pissed i cant move in right away my lord i have affairs to put in order before i make the change the vampire flood smiled his fangs barely visible now oh its not for you theres another he paused and leaned across the table an elder he whispered there was another was she to become the sacrifice to a whole coven of the undead well whatever lily would be so jealous as you please my lord she said you might want to chill with the my lord stuff flood said sorry its okay you know this all has to be completely secret right right secret i mean im okay with it but the other the elder she has a terrible temper she yeah you know an irish redhead a celtic countess then the one who was with you at walgreens exactly sweet abby blurted out she couldnt help it she immediately tried to hide her latent perkiness by biting the edge of her cocoa cup youve got chocolate here the vampire flood gestured to her lip kind of a marshmallow mustache sorry abby said wiping her mouth furiously with the back of her fishnet glove smearing her black lipstick across the side of her face its okay said the vampire flood its cute fuck abby said chapter nine its like time travel only you know slower the chronicles of abby normal tortured victim of the daylight dwellers so here i am again to open my veins and spill my pain onto your pages my dark friend after sixteen years of totally boring existence i come to you at last with a glimmer of hope to break through the gloomth that is my miserable life omg i have found him or i should say he has found me thats right my dark lord has found me a forreal vampyre he is called the vampyre flood and he didnt say but i think he is descended from european royaltya viscount or a discount or one of those i was in walgreens with jared when we saw himand omfg hes so hot in a totally stealth way i would have thought he was just a totally mainstream geek or something with his flannel shirt and jeans but he asked us about buying syringes and i totally saw his fangs come out so i was like i can hook you up with my dealer like that and then he looked at my tshirt and saw byrons picture on it and he quoted she walks in beauty which is like my favorite poem next to the one by baudelaire about his girlfriend being nothing but worm food except that lily called that one first because baudelaire is her fave poet and so she got the shirt with him on it even though byron is way more scrumptious and i would do him on sharp gravel if i had the chance so i went home and changed my clothes and fixed my makeup and when we got to glas kat we breezed by the door like we were twentyfive or something jared made our ids himself at kinkos and we both look so mature in our pictures although i think he overdid it with the mustache anyway we were there like ten minutes and this song came on that i really likeboning you in the ossuary by dead can dubwhich is so cool and macabre and i tried to get jared to dance but this guy comes by and grabs jareds cape and says blacks fade much and that was it jared went into a levelfive freakout and turned into a total fuckwit trying to get me to hide him and stuff and then just saying he couldnt take it anymore and he had to go home and redye right then so he abandoned me to the dank loneliness that is the night and i bought a bottle of water and some chips and got ready to grieve my lost youth when he showed up omg check it he actually knew byron and shelley he used to party with them in switzerland when they were all young they all did laudanum and read ghost stories and stuff and then they actually invented goth right there in this villa on some lake he is like the source he took me for coffee and i wanted to give myself to him right there in starbucks lily will be totally jealous so he said i have to wait he is connected to some ancient celtic vampire countess and im supposed to find them an apartment in the morning he even gave me the name of a rental agent to call and a big wad of cash i have to prove myself worthy of his trust otherwise theres like no way hell bestow the dark gift on me and ill totally have to finish my sophomore year and probably end up in junior college or working at old navy or something so since were off for christmas break im going to call this woman and go find an apartment for the vampyre flood and the celtic vampyre countess and when flood rises from the grave at sunset i will get my reward im totally freaked about meeting the celtic vampyre countess flood says she has a temper what if she hates me flood says hes not really into herits not like that its like shes his vampyre sire and theyve been together for like five hundred years so you know they have history and i can respect that note make sure to find out if i need to move their native soil to the new apartment before we move their coffins note do i need to have a coffin made is it okay if its purple oh yeah my sister ronnie has head lice chapter ten red white and blue not necessarily in that order snow white thought blue with the seven to look after me and me them i could be just like snow white granted the animals werent exactly dwarves jeff murray the exhighschoolbasketball star was at least six five and drew their resident pharmacologist was pretty close to that height but she wasnt exactly snow white either still they were all kind to her considerate and basically respectful of her within their limits as a bunch of pothead punani hounds they did seem to have a decent work ethic were loyal didnt fight among themselves and were relatively clean as guys this age went in a few days shed have the rest of their money she knew it and they knew it but then what it was a ton of money to be sure but it wasnt fuckyou money defined as having so much money that you can say fuck you to anyone anywhere anytime and not have to worry about the consequences shed have to find something to do somewhere to go as the possibility of her getting out of the life finally loomed large she realized that she was going to need a new life to live and frankly it was scaring the hell out of her time isnt kind to a girl living on her looks and shed already extended her sellby date by going blue but what now who knew that the future shed been hoping for would show up with such sharp teeth so blue asked herself the question can a fallen cheddar princess of fond du lac make a life with seven perpetually adolescent party animals from the bay area maybe it could happen but she had her misgivings about dwarf number seven clint in her experience it took a lot of work to fuck the jesus out of a guy and even then he was prone to come down with a bad case of the guilts a day or two later not really a problem when you were working outcall but if you were going to highho a whole pack of dwarves on a semipermanent basis one of them having a highmaintenance holyghost haunting was going to be a problem whore of babylon clint said as the animals led her into the safeway like they were presenting her at the palace she paused in the automatic doors despite the fact that she felt like she was turning blue under her blue dressed as she was in a silver lamé minidress and sixinch clear lucite heels none of it protecting her from the frigid wind coming off the bay whipping through the marina safeway parking lot thinking shed probably spend most of her time naked she hadnt packed for san francisco weather ive never even been to babylon she said but im open to new experiences she licked her lips and stepped to where her breasts were within an inch of clints chest he turned and bolted to the office chanting get thee behind me get thee behind me get thee behind me the whole way however you want it baby said blue she decided shed think of him as freaked the paranoid dwarf barry will show you to the break room lash said hed become the new leader of the animals mainly because he tended to be the most sober jeff send the limo back and lock the doors drew make some coffee gustavo see what the situation is on the floors we may need you to throw stock on the shelves they stood there looking at him stoned drunk baffled blue would think of barry the little prematurely bald guy as her special dwarf baffled she smiled clint peeked over the threequarter wall of the office hey you guys you should know that the emperor was here last night he says that tommy flood is a vampire huh lash said hes a vampire that girl of his she didnt leave town she changed him get the fuck outta here said jeff clint nodded furiously its true well fuck said the others in an unsynchronized chorus meeting lash announced gentlemen take your seats he looked apologetically to blue this shouldnt take long ill make coffee she said uh lash seemed concerned blue were kind of on a budget from here on out coffees free blue said she turned and started heading to the back of the store ill find it the animals watched blue walk away and when she turned the corner gathered by the registers clint unlocked the office door and came out so we have to notify those cops so they can help us hunt him down lash looked at the animals who looked back lash raised an eyebrow the others nodded lash put his arm around clints shoulders clint the guys and i have discussed it and wed all like to do something for you clint ran back in the office and slammed the door no we have to destroy the agents of satan right of course well get right on that but first id like you to ask yourself something clint and id like you to answer not as the bornagain man that you are now but from that little boy thats inside of all of us okay clint said peeking over the office door clint havent you ever wanted to bone a smurf jody heard tommy come in the security door downstairs and met him on the stairs with a big hug and a backbreaking kiss wow tommy said are you okay im really good now i was just checking on william i think he pooped himself im so sorry tommy i shouldnt have left you on your own this soon its okay im okay hey you have something on your dress jody was still wearing the little black dress some of the dust that was james omally was still clinging to it near the hemline oh i must have bumped up against something let me get that for you tommy said brushing at her thigh then starting to raise the dress up past her waist jody caught his hand horndog chet the huge shaved cat looked up for a second then put his head back down on williams chest and went back to sleep but you left me on my own tommy said trying to sound sad but smiling too much to make it work youre fine she looked at her watch we only have about forty minutes till sunup we can talk while we get ready for bed im ready for bed now tommy said she led him up the stairs into the loft through the great room the bedroom and into the bathroom she grabbed her toothbrush off the sink and tossed tommy his she pasted then chucked the tube to him do we still have to floss tommy asked i mean whats the point of being immortal if we have to floss yeah jody said through a mouthful of pinkish foam you should just go lie in the sun and get it over with rather than suffer the torture of flossing dont be sarcastic i didnt think we could get sick at all but your hangover proved that to be wrong jody nodded and spit dont swallow any when you rinse the water will come right back up how come your foam is pink my foam isnt pink and i went last my gums might be bleeding jody said jody wasnt ready to tell him that shed taken someone tonight she would tell him just not now so to change the subject she summoned her superhuman strength and pantsed him hey when did you get skullandcrossbones boxers i bought them tonight when you were getting christmas presents i thought they would seem dangerous you bet jody said nodding furiously to keep from laughing and youll blend inin case youre ever caught with your pants down in the pirate locker room yeah theres that tommy said a little toothpaste foam dribbling down his chest as he looked at his boxers i have the whitest legs in the universe my legs are like great white carrion worms stop youre making me horny ive got to use that tanning lotion we bought where is it jody moved with catlike speed out to the kitchen snatched the lotion off the counter and was back sitting on the edge of the bed in only a couple of seconds if she could just keep tommy from asking any questions until sunup she was sure shed figure out a way to tell him about the old man come over here worm legs let me put some lotion on you to emphasize her commitment to lotionization she stood pulled the straps of her dress off her shoulders and let it fall to the floor at her feet she stepped out of her dress and stood there in just her pumps and a silver necklace with a tiny heart that he had given her tommy hopped out of the bathroomhis pants still around his anklesone long hop and he stood in front of her jody smiled give a geek supernatural agility and speed and what you get is a superagile speedy geek you went out commando in that dress never again jody said grabbing the waistband of his boxers and pulling him toward her these are mine now i want to be dangerous thats so so slutty he said lisping a little his fangs coming out now yep where do you want to start with the lotion he pulled her close and kissed her neck we have to be careful not to break the furniture this time fuck it less to move she said her own fangs coming out now she raked them down his chest if we figure out a way to get a place before someone kills us oh yeah i found us a minion he said as she bit into his side and tore his boxers off in a single swift pull what but tommy was finished talking for a while blue watched as the butterball rocketed by her and slammed into a triangle of twoliter softdrink bottlesthe front bottle burst sending a colabrown eruption of foam across the floor by the meat case strike barry shouted he danced in a tight circle among the animals pointing and chanting i own you and you and you to each as he passed blue looked to lash and raised a cobalt eyebrow lash shrugged it happens thats why we use diet soda its not as sticky he had decided that they all needed to sober up some more before they started stocking the shelves thus the turkey bowling can someone bring a mop clint said because he would not gamble he was the designated pin setter he was scrambling around trying to retrieve soda bottles even as jeff murray was warming up at the other end of the aisle swinging a fosters fresh frozen homestyle in each hand he believed that he got better pin action off the fosters because of the savory gravy packet stuffed in its center he claimed that fosters had mastered superior poultry technology and was in fact working on an oversized titanium turkey the other animals were forced to point out to him that he was completely full of shit as they sprayed root beer on him so you guys hunted vampires blue asked lash she had come back to the front with coffee for everyone just in time to hear lash lay out the scenario for the animals shed held off asking any questions until now a fresh frozen meat missile zipped down the aisle between them lash didnt even blink yep we didnt kill him we just blew up his yacht and took his art thats where we got the money yeah right said blue i got that part its the vampire part im not clear on like a real vampire a real blooddrinking cantgooutintheday liveforever vampire we figured he had to be at least six hundred years old troy lee added joining in the conversation blue you wanna skid the buzzard he nodded to the end of the aisle where jeff was offering his spare fresh frozen turkey like a sacrifice so you guys who work in a grocery store have seen a vampire two of them lash said our nightcrew leader tommy was living with one of them she was hot troy lee added vampire hunters blue couldnt believe it well not anymore lash said yeah troy lee said clint says that tommys a vampire now were not going to mess with him spawn of satan clint shouted from the end of the aisle drew who blue had decided to think of as doc because he always carried the pot ran down the aisle and shotputted a twelvepound selfbasting at clints head shut the fuck up clint ducked and covered the turkey went over the meat counter and stuck in the drywall by the window at the back of the meat department to blue drew said sorry couldnt be helped well thats gonna take all night to patch said clint lash looked at troy lee could you kill him on it troy lee said falling into a fighting stance before taking off and chasing clint around the corner prepare to die white devil so said blue you were saying well clint says tommy is a vampire now and we should go stake him out or something but hes one of us so weve decided to pursue a policy of buddhist tolerance just then troy lee dragged clint back around the corner in a headlock despite being six inches shorter and forty pounds lighter than clint hed studied martial arts since he was six and that took size out of the equation should i hypnotize the chicken troy asked make it so said lash troy lee adjusted his chokehold on clint the larger mans eyes bugged out his mouth moved like a gasping fish out of water and he went limp in troys arms who then dropped him in the puddle of diet soda on the floor hell come around in a second or two lash leaned into blue to explain we used to call it choke the chicken but that sounded kind of gayish of course said blue that trick would come in handy in her work shed have to ask troy lee to teach it to her and you think that your friend and this girl are really vampires i suppose clint said he heard it from the emperor and he was the one that turned us on to the old vampire guy in the first place either way theyre not our problem what if i said they were blue said her mind was putting it together like a sewing machine on crack it was insane but for once she could see a future stretching out before her welcoming her what if i said i wanted you to go after them lash blinked at her like she was speaking klingon huh he looked at the other animals who had stopped bowling and moved into range of the conversation they stood there with frosty gobblers steaming in their hands like they were on wetnurse duty for a group of headless infant snowmen flood is our friend lash said i dont want you to kill him blue said just catch him lash looked to the others who looked awayat the floor at the cabbage and lettuce counter at the turnips at their frozen charges ill make it worth your while blue said jody lay on the bed watching tommy turn slowly back and forth in the air like a pale whiteboy mobile the loft had twentyfoot ceilings with open industrialstyle beams and sometime during their lovemaking they had both ended up hanging from them jody dropped to the bed after she came but tommy still hung by one hand the bright side was that with the exception of the set of shredded sheets upon which she lay they had kept the destruction to a minimum the downsidewell she really could have gone a couple of lifetimes without seeing him from this angle we did good jody said hardly anything broken you think that monkeys really do it that way tommy replied i always thought you were just using that as an expression shed thought she could remain detached enough about their lovemaking to stay in controlto enjoy it but to use it as it werebut since tommy had changed it wasnt like that anymore she lost herself in it she didnt just make love with him she fucked him like a crazed monkey girl it was good but disconcerting she had liked being in control you look amazing from this angle tommy said you look like a manshaped fluorescent lightbulb jody said grinning at him then noticing a change do not get wood thomas flood you will not get wood do you hear me you sound like my mom tommy said ewwwww jody said shuddering and covering her eyes ewwwww tommy said realizing what he had just said and about what and whom he dropped to the bed and bounced sorry quick put the selftanning lotion on me we only have a few minutes before sunup okay but just the lotion right go jody took the lotion and squirted some on her hands turn around ill get your back but just point that thing the other way writer boy you have had all the monkey love youre going to get tonight she said it but she didnt mean itshed go another round if he wanted if they had time before sunrise then she remembered did you say you found us a minion yeah i did shes going to start tomorrower today i gave her money to get us an apartment told her what we needed her yeah you remember that girl we saw in the drugstore jody stopped rubbing grabbed his shoulders and spun him around you gave our deposit money to a nineyearold shes not nine shes sixteen still tommy you trusted our secret to a sixteenyearold girl she already knew yes because you let your fangs show like some doofus of the night you could have explained that somehow or better yet never seen her again look shes smart and shell be loyal i promise you could have just gotten us killed what would you have done huh you have to trust someone but a sixteenyearold kid im only nineteen and i was a great minion besides she thinks im her dark lord did you even tell her about me of course she knows all about you knows that youre my sirethats what they call the vampire who made you i even told her that you were older that you had vast experience vast vast experience sounds like im a slutty old divorcee how old does she think i am five hundred what but you look great for five hundred i mean look you got my attention do my front do your own front she threw the lotion bottle at him and he snatched it out of the air love you tommy said slathering selftanning goo all over his face and chest im going to lock the bedroom door jody said as the alarm on their watches started beeping signaling ten minutes before sunrise shed gotten the alarm watches for both of them just in case you didnt give her keys did you not to the bedroom great what if she finds william in the stairwell and stakes him out you could have given our key to a buffy wannabe this stuff is supposed to take like eight hours to work so by sundown ill be sexy bronze theres a bronze vampire in the living room why dont you go ask him how thats working out for him hes impersonal bronze not sexy bronze like ill be come to bed and put on a tshirt i dont want a sexy bronze stain on the sheets even if they are torn up tommy snifftested a halfdozen shirts finally decided on one climbed into bed and was kissing jody good morning when the sunrise put them out chapter eleven then when they woke up oh my god that stuff turned me completely orange not completely i look like the great pumpkin good grief tommy you do not chapter twelve blood coffee sex magixnot necessarily in that order just after sundown they watched the coffee dripping out of the filter like they were distilling nitroglycerine and the slightest bit of inattention might cause an explosion it smells really good jody said its like i never noticed it before tommy said youd think it would smell sickening since its indigestible jody said the last time shed taken a sip of coffee her vampire system had rejected it so violently that she ended up convulsively dryheaving on the floor feeling like forks were twisting inside of her this might work tommy said you ready ready he poured a tablespoonful or so of coffee into a glass cup then he uncapped one of the syringes that held williams blood and squirted a few drops into the coffee you first he said swishing the cup around in front of her no you jody said as good as the coffee smelled the memory of her nausea held her back tommy shrugged and threw the coffee back like a tequila shooter then set the cup down on the counter jody stepped back and snatched a tea towel off the fridge handle in preparation for the coffees return trip tommy rolled his eyes shuddered then grabbed his throat and fell to the floor twitching and choking dying he croaked suffering and dying jody was barefoot and didnt want to stub her toe so she pulled the kick to his ribs you suck you know that tommy rolled on the floor giggling curling himself around her foot it works it works it works he sort of doghumped her leg in rhythm and tugged at the hem of her robe you never have to be grumpy again jody grinned pour cups grommet full cups tommy climbed to his feet we dont even know the bloodtocoffee ratio yet pour jody was in the fridge in an instant grabbing another syringe well wing it the she heard the downstairs door open and spun on her heel william tommy listened to the footfalls coming up the steps and shook his head nope too light they could hear the key fitting into the lock you said you didnt give her a key jody said i said i didnt give her a key to the bedroom tommy said lord flood theres a stinky dead guy with a huge cat on your landing said abby normal as she came through the door the chronicles of abby normal dedicated servant of the vampyre flood i have been to the lair of the vampyre flood i am part of the coven kinda okay back up so i like slept till eleven because were on christmas break only its called winter break now because jesus is an oppressive zombie bastard and we do not bow down to his birthday at least not at allen ginsberg high school we dont go fighting beatniks but its all good cause im going to have to get used to getting up later if im going to be a creature of the night so like first thing i made some toast and it burned as black as my soul and i was so bummed that my tears of despair fell like cold bits of crystal to be destroyed on the unforgiving rocks of this miserable life but then i saw that mom had left a twenty out on the counter with a note allison allison is my dayslave namemy mom named me after some song by some elvis guy so i totally refuse to accept it heres your lunch money and please stop at walgreens and pick up some rid shampoo for ronnies head lice veronica is my sister who is twelve and a total tumor on the ass of my existence so i was like sweet starbucks it took forever to pick what i was going to wear and not just because id never rented an apartment before the lightbulb burned out in my closet and we didnt have any extras so i had to take everything out in the living room to look at it in the light like the song says i wear black on the outside to reflect the black i feel on the inside but omg its impossible to tell one thing from another in a dark closet since it was going to be a business thing i decided on my striped tights with my red pvc mini my skullandcrossbones hoodie and my lime converse all stars i went with just a plain stud in my nose a barbell in my eyebrow and a simple silver ring in my lipunderstated and elegant i carried my hotpink biohazard messenger bag ronnie was all i wanna come with you i wanna come with you but i pointed out that she was a scourge on humanity and that if she came along i would tell everyone on the bus she had lice so she elected to stay home and watch toons it was then that i ventured into the undiscovered country and called the number that the vampyre flood had given me and the woman was totally a bitch she was like hello blah blah property management and i was like i need to rent an apartment and she was all how many bedrooms and did you have an area in mind and i was all whats with all the questions bitch are you some kind of thought police or something and she was like im just trying to help right help like tuberculosis so shes all i beg your pardon like the queen of freakin france or something and then i remembered that i was supposed to ask for a specific person so i was like oh i need to speak to alicia devries is she there and the bitch connected me so it turns out that alicia devries is this crusty hippie who is like as old as my grandma but wants to be all earth mother and everything which im not against because old hippies have the best pot and theyll just give it to you if you pretend not to notice that theyre crusty and old so alicia picks me up in her crustmobile rainbow peaceandlove jeep cj and i give her the requirements of the vampyre flood which were bedroom with no windows a washer and dryer private entrance with lockout and at least above the ground floor windows looking down on the street and shes all we have to have a social security number and drivers license number for the paperworkyou have to be eighteen so im my client will provide all the information you need its just that hes very busy and cant deal with pissant details during the day then i waved the cash that flood gave me and she went all spacey overmeditated namaste on me like its not about the money when its really about the money then she takes me to this loft which it turns out is only like a half a block from the address where flood said to meet him at sundown sweet so im all excellent the master will be pleased and shes like ill make you out a receipt then she starts to lecture me about respecting myself as a woman and not allowing myself to be subjugated to the desires of an older man and shitlike im this corporate fuckpuppet for some creepy businessman or something i didnt want her to get suspicious and try to rescue me so im like no you misunderstand i call him the master because hes the sensei of my jujitsu dojohes not boning me or anything luckily i have an extensive martialarts background from watching anime with jared and i knew that one must never bone the sensei so she like reaches over and pats my knee all thats okay sweetheart and im like step off rugmuncher i mean im as bi as the next person but not with some crusty old hippiei need music and some x and then only if some guy has rejected me and thrown my heart into the gutter like an abandoned vegetarian burritoand even then i draw the line at making out so she gave me the keys and took my money and just like left me there so i called lily who came over with a twoliter of diet green tea a bag of cheese newts i still hadnt had breakfast and some book she found called the big book of death so we looked at the book which is this howto thing with great art and drank tea and ate cheese newts until she had to go to work i wanted to tell her about the vampyre flood but i promised that i would keep his secret so all i told her was that i had discovered my dark lord and he would soon satisfy my every desire and i couldnt tell her anything else so she was all whatever ho which is what i like about herlily is très noir so i walked over to the sony metreon and watched the flatscreens until it started to get dark i was already about ready to pee with nervousness when i got to floods door but then just as i get my key in the door this big hummer limo pulls up and these three collegeage guys climb out followed by this blue woman in a silver dress with ginormous fake boobs and theyre all where is flood we need to find flood and shes all where did you get the key you need to let us in before it gets dark im not intimidatedbecause i know that her boobs are fake and its so obvious that they hunt the nosferatu that its not even funny inside i was like ha suck my spiky rubber strapon vampyre hunter but on the outside i was totally chill and im like i dont know who youre talking about this is my apartment then i opened the door and inside lying on the landing theres this dead guy with a huge bald cat in a red sweater on his chest and the cat hissed at me and i screamed just a little bit and slammed the door you have to go i said my boyfriend is naked and he gets mad if strangers see his enormous unit i looked right at the blue bitch when i said that like oh yeah some of us are confident enough in our own femininity that we dont need fake tits to get a guy with a huge unit and the black guy is like i just talked to flood here last night and i was like yeah he moved then the asian guy checked his watch and was like dude too late its officially sunset and it was like it was on cue or something the cat on the dead guy let out a long scary yowl and even the blue skank backed away toward the limo youd better go now i said all ominous and full of foreboding and dread and she was all well be back and i was like so so they went but then i had to get past the cat and the dead guy and go up the steps i have to say that as much as im all about the peace of the grave and the glorious gloomth of the nonliving and all its different when theres a real dead guy you have to walk over not to mention a really big angry cat in a sweater note to self always carry kitty treats for selfdefense because evidently they dont like skittles which i tried since i didnt have any kitty treats i got by the preternaturally bigass cat by opening the door wide and yelling hey kitty go away much to my amazement the cat ran out of the doorway and hid under a parked car it was like i already had vampyre powers to command the children of the night then i had to get past the dead guy on the landing which was sort of like deadguy hopscotch but i got up the stairs and managed only to step on one of his arms i was hoping he really was dead and not one of the nosferatu because then he might be pissed off when he rose he certainly smelled dead the fetid stench of the charnel house emanated from him like a foul miasma of evil as they say in the books so i opened the door and i go lord flood theres a stinky dead guy with a huge cat on your landing thinking that i would get total loyalservant brownies then i saw her the ancient vampyre mistressher skin like alabaster or you know no zits at all and she seemed to glow with inner power i could see why even a powerful vampyre like flood might be helpless under her awesome strengths gathered over the ages by sucking the lifeblood of thousands of helpless victims probably kids and she was like drinking a cup of coffee out of a garfield mug as if flaunting her immortality in the face of us petty insignificant mortals she had on only a bathrobe which was partly open in front so you could see that she had like great cleavage ancient total skank that she was so im like hi and shes like so wednesday you know buffys not a real person right bitch what do you mean dead tommy said he ran to the door and flung it open hes not here he bolted down the steps in his bare feet leaving jody standing across the breakfast bar from abby im going to look for him tommy called the downstairs door closed the lock clicked jody pulled her robe closed when she saw abby normal staring she could hear the girls heart pounding could see her pulse beating in her neck could smell nervous sweat clove cigarettes and some kind of cheese snack they stared at each other i found you an apartment mistress abby said she dug into the pocket of her hoodie and came out with a rent receipt call me jody jody said abby nodded conspiratorially like she was acknowledging it was only a code name she was a cute kid in a scary willprobablypoisonthedogandthenmolesthim kind of way jody had never really had a problem with younger women as competition after all she was only twentysix and with the extreme antiaging treatment shed gained from her vampirism right down to her baby toes straightening out and every freckle shed ever had disappearing she felt superior even a tad maternal toward abby who was a little knockkneed in her red plastic skirt and green sneakers im abby abby said and she curtsied jody choked sprayed coffee out her nose and turned quickly so as not to laugh in abbys face are you okay mistressi mean jody no im fine it was strange just how sensitive the vampire sinus is to hot liquids jody was sure that she might never smell anything but bloody french roast again and her eyes were watering or so she thought but when she turned back around abby jumped back six feet and yelped holy shit abby had backed against the futon frame and was about to tumble over backwards jody was around the breakfast bar steadying the girl in less than a tenth of a secondwhich caused abby to jump straight into the air about three feet jody could tell the girl was going to fall abby was going to come down with one foot on the back of the futon frame one in midair and she was going to tumble over and land on her shoulder and head on the hardwood floor jody saw this coming could have caught abby and set her gently on her feet but instead she felt that maternal instinct kick inthe realization that if the child didnt take a knock or two shed never learnso jody stepped back into the kitchen where she picked up her coffee and watched as the kid hit ouch said abby now a blackandred heap on the floor boy that looked like it hurt jody said abby was on her feet limping and rubbing her head what the fuck countess i thought you had my back yeah sorry jody said why the freakout theres blood running down your face i guess it startled me jody dabbed at her eyes with the sleeve of her robe leaving little red spots on the white terry cloth well would you look at that she was trying to be casual trying to act like someone four or five hundred years old might behave but the blood tears were disturbing her more than a little change the subject so this apartment you found where is it dont you want to wait for flood abby asked flood what flood flood the orangecolored vampire who just ran out the door oh him jody said tommy and his tanning lotion he was out running around on the street with no shirt or shoes orange was he orange abby threw out her nearly nonexistent hip hello youre crying blood and your partner is orange and you didnt notice do you guys get senile over the years or what jody set her cup down on the counter just to make sure that it didnt shatter in her hand she drew on her experience working in the claims department at transamerica where her immediate supervisor was a complete assbag and it took everything she could do every minute of the day not to bang the womans skull repeatedly in a filing drawer she liked to think of it as her professional face so instead of snapping abbys pale little neck she smiled counting to ten as she did at ten she said go get him bring him back another smile okay sweetie but why is he orange the shedding is upon him jody said every hundred years or so we shed our skin and a few weeks prior we turn orange its a very dangerous time for us so please go find him abby nodded furiously and backed away toward the door really really jody said nodding gravely quick away with you the time of the shedding is upon him she waved toward the door the way she thought a fivehundredyearold countess might where did the countess thing come from anyway right abby said and she took off out the loft door and down the steps after tommy jody went to the bathroom and used a damp washcloth to wash the blood tears off her face i may actually be evil she thought she knew it should bother her more being evil and all but after she put on a little mascara and some lipstick and poured herself another cup of bloodlaced coffee she found that she was okay with it chapter thirteen moving day jody sipped her coffee and sighed satisfied like shed just had a gentle coffee orgasm the sort of pleasurable release you only see people have in commercials for froufrou coffee and hemorrhoid cream this bloodbeverage phenomenon added a whole new twist to their lives a glass of wine a diet cola maybewait screw dieta sugary teethrotting cola what about solid food sure being a godlike creature of the night was great but what about a jelly donut french fries she was irish she felt a deepseated need for potatoes she was musing on the idea of heading up to mcdonalds on market street and spooging a syringe full of williams blood all over a supersized box of deepfried nirvana when the phone rang the caller id number was blocked it just said mobile it might be tommy hed activated the disposable mobile phones theyd bought but he probably hadnt written down the numbers hey pumpkin jody said she heard a clattering at the other end of the line sorry i dropped the phone oops not tommy who is this uh its uh its steve im the med student who called you about your condition hed found her when shed gone to a blood drinkers anonymous meeting in japan town which turned out to be a bunch of nerds with problems distinguishing fantasy from reality had watched her from a distance and called her on a pay phone from blocks away ready to jump in his car and bolt if she came near him he knew what she was hed said that he had examined one of the bodies left by the old vampire elijah had snapped their necks so the bodies would be found instead of turning to dust what do you want well like i said im a med student at berkeley

natural human state which is dead jody said no living cells i just need to meet with you hed pressed this before and jody had been willing to meet with him but unfortunately while she was sleeping tommy had put her in the freezer for a few days and shed missed the appointment no meeting steve forget you know anything about this youll have to write your dissertation on something else well take

looked at the bronze statue that held elijah ben sapir he wont bother you either oh good steve yeah if you tell anyone ill find you and ill slowly snap every bone in your body before i kill you jody tried to make it sound cheerful but the threat sort of cut through the bright friendly lilt in her voice okay then bye yeah jody said you take care the shedding tommy said as he came through the door jody stood at the counter in her new red leather jacket boots and misttight black jeans jody could hear abby locking the downstairs door so they had a few seconds alone look did you want me to tell her you were just a big orange doofus i guess not hey she calls you flood i couldnt tell her tommy im her dark lord your dark lord cant be named tommy flood has an air of power and dampness yeah its got the dampness thing going for it too abby came in breathing hard shed been sweating and her eyeliner was running in two black streaks down her cheeks we didnt find him i could have sworn he was dead he smelled like it you got something against dead people jody saidtoughguy voice are you saying theres something wrong with dead people is that what youre saying are you saying youre too good for the dead is that what youre saying abby stepped behind tommy and peeked around the kid was still out of breath from trying to keep up with tommy and now she was frightened too no mistress i think the nonliving are great im all about dead people i have a i fuck the dead tshirt even i can wear it tomorrow if you want i didnt mean its okay abby jody said waving it off just fucking with you jody tommy said scolding dont scare the minion sorry jody said thinking once again that she might be evil what about the new apartment did you look at it we went by it its only a few doors down we dont even have to cross the street you think thats far enough they wont find us there well at least they wont find us here i dont think anyones going to think that wed only move a few doors down theyll think weve at least left the city what kind of idiot would only move a few doors away its brilliant plus an easy move jody said you guys can do it without a truck you guys well ive got to find william and you cant exactly run around until the shedding has subsided abby do you have enough makeup to cover his face and hands tons abby said she held up her messenger bag but i can only help for a little while i have to get home why tommy asked we require your services he meant to sound sophisticated and european but it came out sounding lecherous he means moving jody said ive got his other services covered i cant abby said my sister has lice so abby said the countess is kind of a bitch no shes just a dark creature of unspeakable evil tommy said he had the futon on his back and was making his way down the street as abby followed him with a lamp in one hand and a blender in the other in a nice way he addedthinking that maybe hed already made enough of an impression on abby although it was early in the evening and it was a little unusual to see a guy walking down the street carrying a futon followed by a goth girl carrying a lamp and a blender it was just unusual enough that people would have felt stupid if they asked what was going on and someone pointed out it was modern dance or performance art or people robbing an apartment san francisco is a city of sophisticates and except for a homeless guy who remarked on the tackiness of tommys pier imports decor they had moved half of the furniture and clothing without comment do you need to feed abby asked when they got back to the old loft they were standing in the living room where there was little left except some bookcases and the three bronze statues huh tommy replied im guessing that you need to feed abby said pulling her hoodie aside and offering up her neck and i have to get going i have to get to walgreens and catch the bus home before the parental unit goes critical go ahead im ready she closed her eyes and started breathing hard as if bracing for the pain take me flood im ready really tommy said abby opened one eye well yeah youre sure tommy hadnt bitten another woman he wasnt sure if it might not be cheating what if the whole sex thing went off the way it did with jody that kind of activity would kill a normal human woman plus he was pretty sure that jody would not approve maybe a little from the wrist tommy said abby opened her eyes and pulled up her sleeve of course so you dont leave the mark of nosferatu she said it with a hissnassssssssferatoolike she was speaking snake oh it wont leave any marks tommy said youll heal up like instantly he was starting to feel the hunger rise in him he could feel his fangs pressing down from the roof of his mouth really oh yeah jody bit me almost every night before i changed over and no one ever noticed down at the store the store oops the ye olde porridge and leeches store where i worked in the ye old days i thought you were a lord well yeah i mean i owned the store and some serfs and scullery maidscouldnt get enough of the scullery maidsbut i put in a shift now and then you know help to stir the porridge and inventory the leeches serfs will steal you blind if you dont watch them well enough business lets get to that feeding he took her wrist and pulled it to his mouth then stopped she was looking at him one eyebrow sort of cocked in the air and there was a silver ring in it so it felt more incredulous than a normal eyebrow he dropped her arm you know maybe you should get home before you get in trouble i wouldnt want my minion on restriction abby looked hurt now but lord flood have i offended you am i not deserving you were looking at me like you thought i was fucking with you tommy said werent you well no this is a twoway street abby i cant ask for your loyalty if i dont give you trust in return he couldnt believe the bullshit that was coming out of his mouth oh okay then tomorrow night tommy said ill bleed you within an inch of your life i promise the things you never think youll hear yourself say abby rolled down her sleeve okay then will you be able to get the rest by yourself sure vampire powers duh he laughed waving at the heavy bronze statues like they were nothing you know abby said the man and the turtle are cool but that woman statue you should get rid of that she looks kind of skanky you think abby nodded yeah maybe theres some church or something that you could donate it to like to show how you dont want your daughter to grow up oh sorry lord flood i didnt mean to say church no im okay tommy said ill walk you out thanks abby said he followed her downstairs and held the door to the street then at the last minute as she was walking away she turned and kissed him quickly on the cheek i love you lord flood she whispered in his ear then she turned and ran up the sidewalk tommy felt himself blush dead as he was he felt heat rise in his cheeks he turned and trudged back up the steps feeling the full weight of his four maybe five hundred years of life he needed to talk to jody how long could it take to find one drunk guy with a giant cat he dug his cell phone out of his pocket and dialed the number of the phone hed given jody he could hear it ringing on the kitchen counter where she had left it chapter fourteen powers for good the emperor was sitting on a black marble bench just around the corner from the great opera house feeling small and ashamed when he saw the striking redhead in jeans coming toward him bummer lapsed into a barking fit and the emperor snatched the boston terrier up by the scruff of the neck and stuffed him into the oversized pocket of his coat to quiet him brave bummer said the old man would that i could still hold that kind of passion even if it were fear but my fear is weak and damp ive barely the spine for a dignified surrender hed felt like this since hed seen jody outside the secondhand store where shed warned him away from the owner yes now he knew her to be one of the undead a bloodsucking fiendbut then not so much a fiend she had been a friend a good one even after he had betrayed tommy iff to the animals he could feel the citys eye on him could feel her disappointment in him what does a man have if not character what is character if not a mans measure of himself against his friends and enemies the great city of san francisco shook her head at him ashamed her bridges slumped in the fog with disappointment he remembered a house somewhere and that same look on the face of a darkhaired woman but mercifully in an instant that memory was a ghost and jody was bending to scratch behind the ears of the steadfast lazarus who had never been agitated by her like his bugeyed brother who even now squirmed furiously in the woolen pocket your majesty jody said how are you worthless and weak said the emperor she really was a lovely girl hed never known her to hurt a soul what a cad he was im sorry to hear that you have plenty to eat staying warm the men and i have this very hour vanquished a corned beef on a sourdough roll the size of a healthy infant thank you tommys joynt jody said with a smile indeed we are not worthy yet my people provide dont be silly youre worthy look emperor have you seen william william of the huge and recently shaven cat thats the one why yes we crossed his path not long ago he was at the liquor store at geary and taylor he seemed very enthusiastic about purchasing some scotch more energetic than ive seen him in many years that was how long ago she stopped petting lazarus and stood little more than an hour ago thank you your majesty you dont know where he was going i should think to find a safe place to drink his dinner although i cant claim to know him well i dont think william passes the evening in the tenderloin often jody patted the emperors shoulder and he took her hand im so sorry dear sorry about what when i saw you and thomas the other night i noticed its true isnt it thomas has changed no hes still a doofus i mean he is one of your kind now yes she looked up the street i was alone she said the emperor knew exactly how she felt i told one of his crew from the safeway jody im sorry i was frightened you told the animals the bornagain one yes and how did he react he was worried for thomass soul yeah that would be clints reaction you dont know if he told the other animals i would guess yes by now okay dont worry then your highness its okay just dont tell anyone else tommy and i are leaving the city just like we promised those police detectives we just have to get things in order and the otherthe old vampire yes him too she turned and strode away heading into the tenderloin her boot heels clacking on the sidewalk as she kept her pace just below a run the emperor shook his head and rubbed lazarus behind the ears i should have told her about the detectives i know that old friend there was only so much weakness he could confess to at one timethat too a fault the emperor resolved to sleep somewhere cold and damp tonight perhaps in the park by the maritime museum as penance for his weakness there was no way she was going to remember his new mobile number it was five in the morning before tommy had finished moving all of the furniture books and clothes now the new loft looked almost exactly like the old loft had looked except that it didnt have a working phone line so tommy sat on the counter of the old loft looking at the three bronze statues and waiting for jody to call just the three statues left to move jody the old vampire and the turtle the old vampire looked fairly natural hed been unconscious when hed been bronzed but tommy had the biker sculptors downstairs pose him as if he was in midstep out for a stroll jody was posed with her hand on her hip her head thrown back as if shed just tossed her long hair over her shoulder smiling tommy turned his head to the side getting perspective she didnt look skanky what made abby say the statue was skanky sexy well yes jody had been wearing some very lowcut jeans and a crop top when hed posed her for the electroplating and the bikers had insisted upon exposing more of her cleavage than was probably decorous but what could you expect from a couple of guys who specialized in making highend garden gnomes acting out the kama sutra okay she looked a little skanky but he didnt see how that was a bad thing he had actually been delighted when she came streaming out of the ear holes to materialize stark naked in front of him if she hadnt killed him it would have been the fulfillment of a sexual fantasy hed nurtured for a long time there had been this old tv show hed watched as a kid about a beautiful genie who lived in a bottlewell tommy had done some serious bottle polishing over that one so the jody statue stayed but the old vampire elijah that was a different story there was a real creature in there a real scary creature whatever bizarre events had brought them to this spot had been set off by elijah ben sapir he was a reminder that neither hetommynor jody had chosen to be vampires neither had chosen to live out the rest of their days in the night elijah had taken their choices away from them and replaced them with a whole new set of scarier bigger choices the first of which was how the hell do you deal with the fact that you have imprisoned a sentient feeling being in a shell of bronze even if he is an evil dickweed from the dark ages but they couldnt let him out hed kill them for sure if they did really kill them too a complete death the kind with no nooky suddenly tommy was angry hed had a future he might have been a writer a nobel prize winner an adventurer a spy now he was just a foul dead thing and the furthest his ambition would reach was his next victim okay that wasnt really true but still he was pissed off so what if elijah was trapped in bronze shell forever hed trapped them in these monstrous bodies maybe it was time to do something monstrous tommy picked up jodys statue and threw it over his shoulder and despite his great vampire strength followed it over backward as it clanged against the floor okay it had taken the two bikers and a refrigerator dolly to get the statues up here maybe a little planning was in order it turned out he could move the statue pretty efficiently if he slung it over his back and let one of her feet drag and so he did down the steps half a block down the sidewalk and back up the steps of the new loft bronze jody looked happy in the new place he thought the turtle took half as long she too looked pleased with the surroundings as for elijah tommy figured what was the point of being in a city on a peninsula if you didnt take advantage of the water now and then and elijah evidently liked the ocean since hed come to the city on his yacht which tommy and the animals had managed to blow to smithereens the vampire statue was even heavier that jodys but tommy felt energized by the idea of getting rid of it just a short twelve blocks to the sea and that would be that from the sea ye came and to the sea ye shall return tommy said thinking that he might be quoting coleridge or maybe a godzilla movie as tommy dragged the bronzed vampire down mission street he considered his future what would he do he had a lot of time to fill and after a while figuring out new ways to jump jody would only fill up a part of his nights he was going to have to find a purpose they had moneycash the vampire had given jody when he turned herand what was left of the money from the sale of elijahs art but eventually that would run out maybe he should get a job or become a crime fighter thats it he would use his powers for good maybe get an outfit after a few blocks tommy noticed that elijahs toe the one that was dragging on the sidewalk was starting to wear away the bikers had warned tommy that the bronze shell was pretty thin it wouldnt do to unleash a claustrophobic and hungry ancient vampire when you were the guy who had imprisoned him so tommy stood the vampire on the corner for a minute while he dug through a trash bin until he found some heavyduty plastic big gulp cups which he fitted on the vampires dragging foot as skid protection ha tommy said thought you had me a couple of guys in hiphop wear walked by as tommy was fitting the cups on the vampires feet tommy made the mistake of making eye contact and they paused stole it from a building on fourth tommy said the two nodded as if they were saying of course we were just wondering and proceeded to move down the sidewalk they must sense my superior strength and speed tommy thought so they wouldnt dare mess with me in fact the two had confirmed that the white boy in the ghost makeup was crazyand what would they do with a fourhundredpound statue anyway tommy figured hed drag the statue to the embarcadero and toss it off the pier by the ferry building if there was anyone around hed just stand at the rail like he was there with his gay lover then shove the statue in when no one was looking he felt enormously sophisticated about the plan no one would ever think a guy from indiana was pretending to be gay that kind of thing just wasnt done tommy had known a kid once in high school who had gone up to chicago to see the musical rent and was never heard from again tommy reckoned hed been disappeared by the local kiwanis club when he got to the embarcadero which ran all along the waterfront tommy was tempted to just chuck elijah in the bay right there and call it a night but he had a plan so he dragged the vampire that last two blocks to the promenade at the end of market street where the antique streetcars the cable cars and the crossbay ferries all converged in a big paved park and sculpture garden here away from the buildings the night seemed to open up to his vampire senses take on a new light tommy stopped for moment stood elijah by a fountain and watched heat streaming out of some grates by the streetcar turnaround perfect there was absolutely no one around then the beeping started tommy looked at his watch sunrise in ten minutes the night hadnt opened up to him it had been shutting him down ten minutes and the loft was a good twenty blocks away jody was quickstepping along the alleyway that came out in front of their old loft she still had twenty minutes until sunrise but she could see the sky lightening and twenty minutes was cutting it too close tommy would be freaked she should have taken the cell phone with her she shouldnt have left him alone with the new minion shed finally found william passed out in a doorway in chinatown with chet the huge cat sleeping on his chest theyd have to remember not to leave william with any money from now on if he was going to be their food source otherwise hed go elsewhere for his alcohol and that wasnt going to work he was making his staggering way home on his own maybe shed let him take a shower at the old loftthey werent going to get their deposit back anyway there was still a light on in the loft great tommy was home shed forgotten to get a key for the new place she was about to step out of the alley when she smelled cigar smoke and heard a mans voice she stopped and peeked around the corner there was a brown ford sedan parked across the street from their old loft and in it sat two middleaged men cavuto and rivera the homicide detectives that shed made a deal with the night theyd blown up elijahs yacht theyd moved just in time but then maybe not quite she couldnt get to the new place either it was only a half a block away and shed have to cross in the open and even then what if it was locked she jumped four feet straight up when the alarm on her watch went off it was toward the end of their second shift after returning to the safeway that the animals sobered up lash was sitting by himself in the wide backseat of the hummer limo his head cradled in his hands hoping desperately that the despair and selfloathing he was feeling was only the effect of a hangover instead of what it really was which was a big flaming enema of reality the reality was they had spent more than a half a million dollars on a blue hooker he let the hugeness of it roll around in his head and looked up at the other animals who were sitting around the perimeter of the limo similarly posed trying not to make eye contact with one another theyd had nearly two semi trucks of stock to put up that night and theyd known it was coming because theyd ordered it to make up for the time theyd been away and clint had let the shelves get low so theyd sobered up put their heads down and thrown stock like the animals that they were now it was getting close to dawn and it was dawning on all of them that they might have severely fucked up lash risked a sideways glance at blue who was sitting between barry and troy lee shed taken lashs apartment on northpoint and made him sleep on the couch at troy lees where there were about seven hundred chinese family members including troys grandmother who every time she passed through the room during the day when lash was trying to sleep would screech whats up my nigga and try to get him to wake up and give her a pound or a high five lash had been explaining to her that its impolite to refer to an african american as a nigga unless one was another africanamerican when troy lee came in and said she only speaks cantonese she does not she keeps coming in and saying whats up my nigga oh yeah she does that to me too did you give her a pound no i didnt give her a pound motherfucker she called me a nigga well shes not going to quit unless you give her a pound its just the way she rolls thats some bullshit troy its her couch lash exhausted and already hungover gave the wizened old woman a pound granny turned to troy lee whats up my nigga she offered and received a pound from her grandson that shit is not the same lash said get some sleep we have a big load tonight now half a million dollars was gone his apartment was gone the limo was costing them a thousand dollars a day lash looked out the blackout windows at the moving patchwork of shadows thrown by the streetlights then turned to blue blue he said we have to get rid of the limo everyone looked up shocked no one had said anything to her since theyd finished stocking theyd brought her coffee and juice but no one had said anything blue looked at him get me what i want not a hint of malice not even a demand really just a statement of fact okay lash said then to the driver he said take a right up here head back to that building where we went last night lash crawled over the divider into the front passenger seat he couldnt see shit out the blackened windows theyd only gone about three blocks into the soma district when he saw someone running running way way too fast for a jogger runninglike he was on firerunning pull up alongside of that guy the driver nodded hey guys is that flood yeah it is barry the bald one said lash rolled down the window tommy you need a ride man tommy still running nodded like a bobblehead on crack barry threw open the back door and before the limo could even slow down tommy leapt in landing across drew and gustavos laps man am i glad you guys came along tommy said in about a minute im going to he passed out in their laps as the sun washed over the hills of san francisco chapter fifteen broken clowns inspector alphonse rivera watched the broken clown girlblackandwhitestriped stockings and green sneakerscome out of jody strouds apartment and head up the street then turn and look back at their brown unmarked sedan were made said nick cavuto riveras partner a broadshouldered bear of a man who longed for the days of dashiell hammett when cops talked tough and there were very few problems that couldnt be solved with your fists or a smack from a lead sap were not made shes just looking two middleaged guys sitting in the car on the city streetits unusual if cavuto was a bear then rivera was a ravena sharpfeatured lean hispanic with just a touch of gray at the temples lately hed taken to wearing expensive italian suits in raw silk or linen when he could find them his partner was in rumpled mens wearhouse rivera often wondered if nick cavuto might not be the only gay man on the planet who had no fashion sense whatsoever the knockkneed kid with the raccoon eye makeup was making her way across the street toward them roll up your window cavuto said roll up your window pretend like you dont see her im not going to hide from her rivera said shes just a kid exactly you cant hit her jesus nick shes just a creepy kid whats wrong with you cavuto had been on edge since theyd pulled up an hour ago they both had really since the guy named clint one of the night crew from the marina safeway had left a message on riveras voice mail that jody stroud the redheaded vampire had not left town as she had promised and that her boyfriend tommy flood was now also a vampire it was a very bad turn of events for the two cops both of whom had taken a share of the money from the old vampires art collection in return for letting them all go it had seemed like the only option really neither of the cops wanted to explain how the serial killer theyd been chasing had been an ancient vampire and how hed been tracked down by a bunch of stoners from the safeway and when the animals blew up the vampires yachtwell the case was solved and if the vampires had left it would have all been good the cops had planned to retire early and open a rarebook store rivera thought he might learn to golf now he was feeling it all float away on an evil breeze a cop for twenty years without ever so much as fixing a traffic ticket then the one time you take a hundred thousand dollars and let a vampire go the whole world turns on you like youre some kind of bad guy rivera was raised a catholic but he was starting to believe in karma pull out pull out cavuto said go around the block until she goes away hey said the broken clown girl you guys cops cavuto hit the window button on his door but the ignition was off so the window didnt budge go away kid why arent you in school do we need to take you in winter break brain trust said the kid rivera couldnt hold the laugh in and he snorted a little trying to move along kid go wash that shit off your face you look like you fell asleep with a magic marker in your mouth yeah said the kid examining a black fingernail well you look like someone pumped about three hundred pounds of cat barf into a cheap suit and gave it a bad haircut rivera slid down in his seat and turned his face toward the door he couldnt look at his partner he was sure that if it was possible for steam to come out of someones ears that might be happening to cavuto and if he looked hed lose it if you were a guy cavuto said id have you in handcuffs already kid oh god rivera said under his breath if i were a guy ill bet you would and ill bet id have to send you to the s and m atm because the kinky shit is extra the kid leaned down so she was eye level with cavuto and winked that was it rivera started giggling like a little girltears were creeping out the corners of his eyes youre a big fucking help cavuto said he reached over flipped the ignition key to accessory then rolled up his window the kid came over to riveras side of the car so have you seen flood she asked cop she added cop with a high pop on the p like it was punctuation mark not a profession you just came out of his apartment rivera said trying to shake off the giggles you tell me place is empty the douche nozzle owes me money said the kid for what stuff i did for him be specific sweetheart unlike my partner i dont threaten it was a threat of course but he thought he might have hit pay dirt the kids eyes opened wide enough to see light i helped him and that redheaded hag load their stuff into a truck rivera looked her up and down she couldnt have weighed ninety pounds he hired you to help him move just little crap lamps and stuff they were like in a hurry i was walking by he flagged me down said hed give me a hundred bucks but he didnt he gave me eighty he said it was all he had on him to come back this morning for the rest did either of them say where they were going just that they were going to leave the city this morning as soon as they paid me you notice anything unusual about either of themflood or the redhead just day dwellers like you bourgeois fourohfours fourohfours cluelesspottery barn fucktards of course rivera said he could hear his partner snickering now so you havent seen them the kid said theyre not coming kid how do you know that i know that youre out twenty dollars cheap lesson go away and dont come back here and if either of them contact you or you see them call me rivera handed the kid a business card whats your name my dayslave name sure lets try that one allison allison green but on the street im known as abby normal on the street shut up i have street cred then she added cop like the chirp of a car alarm arming good take your street cred and run along allison she shuffled off trying to swivel nearly nonexistent hips as she went you think they left the city cavuto asked i want to own a bookstore nick i want to sell old books and learn to golf so that would be no lets go talk to the bornagain safeway guy four robots and one statue guy worked the embarcadero by the ferry building not every day some days when it was slow there were only two robots and a statue guy or on rainy days none of them worked because the silver or gold makeup they used to color their skin didnt hold up well in the rain but as a rule it was four robots and one statue guy monet was the statue guythe only statue guy hed staked his territory three years ago and if some poseur ever showed up he had to meet monet on the field of stillness where they would clash in the motionfree battle of doing absolutely nothing monet had always prevailed but this guythis new guywas really good the challenger had been there when monet arrived in the late morning and he hadnt even blinked for two hours the guys makeup was perfect too he looked as if he had really been bronzed so it was beyond monet why he would choose to get his collections in big gulp cups that hed jammed his feet into monet carried a small portfolio case with a hole cut in it where tourists could stuff their bills he had primed his money hole with a five today just to show the challenger that he wasnt intimidated but the truth was after two hours he hadnt made half of what he saw the newcomer take in and he was intimidated and his nose itched his nose itched and the new statue guy was kicking his ass normally monet would change positions every half hour or so then stand motionless while the tourists taunted him and tried to make him flinch but with the new competition he had to stay still as long as it took the robots on the promenade had all assumed poses from which they could watch they only had to hold still until someone dropped cash into their cup then they would do the robot dance it was boring work but the hours were good and you were outside it looked like monet was going down sundown he felt like his ass was on fire tommy came to to the sound of a riding crop being smacked against his bare butt and the rough bark of a womans voice say it say it say it he tried to pull away from the pain but couldnt move his arms or legs he was having trouble focusing his visionwaves of light and heat were rocketing around his brain and all he could really see was a bright red spot with waves of heat coming off of it and a figure moving around the edges it was like staring into the sun through a red filter he could feel the heat on his face ouch tommy said dammit he pulled against his bonds and heard a metallic rattling but nothing gave the red hot light went away and was replaced by the blurry form of a female face a blue face just inches away from his own say it she whispered harshly spitting a little on the it say what say it vampire she said she whipped the riding crop across his stomach and he howled tommy squirmed against his bonds and heard the rattling again with the spotlight moved away he could see that he was suspended by very professionallooking nylon restraints to a brass fourposter bed frame that had been stood on end he was completely naked and evidently the blue woman who was dressed in a black vinyl bustier boots and nothing else had been whaling on him for some time he could see welts across his stomach and thighs and well his ass felt like it was on fire she wound up to smack him again whoa whoa whoa whoa tommy said trying not to screech he only realized then that his fangs were extended and hed bitten his own lips the blue woman held up say it tommy tried to keep his voice calm i know youve been doing this for a while now but ive only been awake for about a minute of it so i have no idea what you are asking me if you slow down and repeat the whole question ill be happy to tell you whatever i know your safety word said the blue woman which is tommy said he noticed for the first time that she had enormous boobs spilling out of that bustier and it occurred to him that he had never seen big blue boobs before they were kind of mesmerizing he wouldnt have been able to look away even if he werent strapped down i told you she said letting the riding crop fall to her side you told me what a safety word is i just told you what it is so you know it then yes she said then why are you asking to see if youre at your breaking point she seemed to be pouting a little now dont be a dick this isnt my specialty where am i tommy asked youre lashs smurf arent you are we at lashs im asking the questions here she snapped the riding crop against his thigh ouch fuck stop that you have issues lady say it what is it i was asleep when you told me you stupid bitch he was wrong he was able to look away from the blue boobs he snarled at her something coming up from deep inside him that he didnt even recognizesomething that felt wild and on the verge of out of controllike when he first made love with jody as a vampire only this feltwell lethal its cheddar cheddar like the cheese he was getting beating because of cheese yes so i said it now what youre broken kay tommy said straining against the heavy nylon straps understanding now what he was feeling he was going to kill her he didnt know how yet but he was as certain of it as of anything he had ever known grass was green water was wet and this bitch was dead so now you have to turn me she said turn you he said his fangs ached like they were going to leap out of his mouth make me like you she said you want to be orange is this another cheddar thing because not orange you nitwit a vampire she said and she snapped the riding crop across his chest he bit his lips again and felt the blood running down his chin so for that you needed all the hitting he said come over here she leaned up and kissed him then pushed away hard and came away with his blood on her mouth i guess im going to have to get used to this she said licking her lips closer tommy said chapter sixteen being the chronicles of abby normal completely fucked servant of the vampyre flood omfgwoot i have failed left my duty undone like so much dog poop on the gloaming sidewalk of the tragedy that is my life even as i sit here at the metreon starbucks writing this the froth slaves seem to move like silvereyed zombies and my nonfat soy amaretto mochaccino has gone as bitter as snake bile which is like the bitterest bile you can get if there wasnt a totally hot guy two tables away acting like he doesnt notice me i would weepbut real tears make your mascara run so im staying chilly in my despair your loss cute guy for i have been chosen suffer bitch i had to leave lord flood to his own devices last night but before i left i confessed my undying love for him i am a hopeless hose beast all i had to do was say goodbye but no i just barked it out its like he has this power over melike i have an eating disorder and hes a package of oreo double stuff cookies i dont have an eating disorder im just skinny because i enjoy eating mass quantities and then yakking it back up its not a bodyimage problem i think my system has always wanted to live on a liquid diet and until im brought into my dark lords loving embrace then its starbucks for me i have been trying to call my dark lord and the countess all day on their cells but i kept getting voice mail well duhtheyre vampires they wont be answering the phone im such a tard sometimes so i went to the old loft early this morning in fact even before dawn i should be like made a bronte sister for coming up with a story to get out of the house that early but i wanted to talk to the master before his slumber thing was the scary drunk guy and his huge cat were gone but so were my master and the countess everything had been moved except the statue of the turtle and the countess so i rolled out headed for the new loft i rented when i spotted two cops sitting in a pos brown car i knew they were vampyre hunters right away it must be the masters dark powers rubbing off on me there was a big fat gay cop and a sharpfaced hispanocop so i was like could you guys look any more like cops and they were like move along little lady so i was forced to point out to them that they were not the boss of me and then i proceeded to humiliate them by verbally bitchslapping them until they cried what is it about the crusties their minds work so slowly that you have to like prompt them to stand up so you can slap them again until they faint like the little wussbags that they are i never want to be crusty and i wont be because my lord will bring me into the fold and i shall stalk the night for eternity my beauty forever preserved as it is except id like a little bigger boobs anyway i wandered around on market street and up in union square to give the cops enough time to slink off to lick their wounds then i returned to the masters street to check the new loft this time there was this asian guy sitting across the street in a honda looking all mangacool but it was obvious that he was watching the loft door he didnt look like a cop but he was definitely watching so i stopped and pretended to watch the sculptors work who have the space under the masters old loft they are these two crusty biker guys but they do some amazing shit theyd left the garage door open so i stepped in they were putting dead chickens on wires and dipping them in silver paint then hanging them on sticks by the wires so i was all what the fuck biker what are you doing and one of them was like its almost the year of the cock and i was all dont be gross you crustacious fuck you pull that thing out and ill pepperspray you until you fry you have to be stern with weenie waggersive been exposed to on the bus over seventeen times so i know and he was like no its the year of the cock in the chinese zodiac which i knew of course were making statues said the bigger biker who was named frank the other ones name was monk he didnt talk much which might explain the name so they showed me how they took real dead roosters they bought in chinatown ran wires through them to pose them then dipped them in a thin metallic paint then put them in this big tank and attached electric clips to them they pass some current through the clips and the current attracts bronze molecules or something to the metallic paint its like instant bronze rooster i thought about the statue of the countess upstairs and got a little creeped out so im all you ever do a person and they were like no way that would be wrong youd better go now because were behind and dont you have school and stuff so walking out i saw the asian guy checking me out and i was like hey its almost the year of the cock shouldnt you be out shopping for one he looked really nervous but he kinda grinned then started his car and drove off but he wants me i can tell so hell be back i hope he wants me he was so cutein that final fantasy thirtyseven way what im saying is the sex fu is strong with this one so there was no sign of my dark lord or the countess at the new place i wonder if they have crawled under the earth in some park and satisfied their perverse desires with each other among the worms and the tree roots eww oh well almost dark id better go back to the loft and wait for them addendum the lice shampoo didnt work on my sister looks like we might have to shave her head im going to try to talk her into getting a pentagram tattooed on her scalp i know a guy in the haight who will do it for free if you verbally abuse him while hes tattooing more later sundown jody awoke to pain and the smell of cooking meat she rolled away from the source of the pain and went crashing through the acoustical ceiling tiles to land in a commercial sink full of dishes and soapy water a mexican guy was backing across the dish room crossing himself and invoking saints in spanish as jody climbed out of the sink and brushed suds off her jacket and jeans when she touched the front of her thighs she nearly leapt back through the ceiling the pain was so sharp motherfuckthathurts she said hopping around on one foot because that will generally help all manner of pain regardless of where its located on the body her boot heel clicking against the tiles sounded like a limping flamenco dancer the dishwasher turned and bolted out of the dish room into the bakery the bakery when the alarm on her watch had threatened dawn she ran down the alley checking doors as she went and the only one she found unlocked led into the stockroom of a bakery she needed a place to hide where shed be undisturbed while she slept and although she considered hiding under a couple of the fiftypound bags of flour she had no way of knowing if the bakers would be using them today shed already awakened in a morgue once before when tommy had frozen her and finding a rotund necrophiliac morgue attendant rubbing his hands and other bits over her seminaked body while she thawed had soured her to the whole morgue experience no she had to find someplace more secluded one of the bakers had been coming into the stockroom she could hear his voice and footfalls outside the door she looked around for somewhere to hide then spotted the grimy acoustic ceiling tiles suspended above she leapt onto the pallet of flour lifted a tile to see that the ceiling was suspended a full four feet below the structural ceiling bless old buildings she grabbed a water pipe pulled herself through the ceiling jackknifed her legs up and around the pipe then used her free hand to pull the ceiling tile back in place all in less than two seconds she listened as the man moved around below her then scooped up one of the big bags of flour and left the room that was a good call she checked her watch less than a minute before shed go out she spotted four pipes running together parallel to the floor they were slightly warm which was why she could see them at all in the darkness but each was two inches around and braced to the ceiling every few feet theyd hold her she scrambled over to the pipes squirmed out of her leather jacket and put it across the pipes then lay facedown on top of it this way even if one of her legs slipped off it wouldnt pull her off the pipes she was trying to wedge the toes of her boots into the gap between the pipes when she went out the problem was that the pipes werent used that early in the morning as the building awoke hot water began coursing through them and jody had been subjected to the heat all day her jacket had protected her face and torso but her thighs had been slowcooked inside her jeans she gritted her teeth and bolted through the dish room door into the back room of the bakery so now its deserted of course bakers work in the middle of the night and the early morning at sundown the dishwasher would be the only guy still in the building she found her way to the stockroom then out into the alley she could see the entries to both of their lofts from the end of the alley and fortunately no one appeared to be watching from the street there were lights on in the new loft and she made her way to the door her legs burning with every step she listened at the doordid what she thought of as reaching out if she focused she could almost hear shapes depending on the ambient noise there was someone in the loftshe could hear the heartbeat industrial music playing in headphones the shuffling of a bodya light body dancing it was the kid abby normal where in the hell was tommy he couldnt be far from the loftthe sun had gone down only five minutes ago jody pounded on the door but the shuffling sounds upstairs didnt change rhythm and she pounded again this time leaving a dent in the metal door fuck the kid has the headphones cranked and cant hear a thing jody shivered although not because of the cold but because the hunger was rising in her her body telling her she needed to feed so she could heal shed only done it once before and wasnt sure she could pull it off again but she needed to get into the loft and leave a lockable door intact she concentrated as the old vampire had taught her and gradually she felt herself fadinggoing to mist monet was no longer dressed as the statue guy no longer in characternot that character anyway now he was the mastablasta ganstarappa fullninjabadass and a bag of mothafuckin chips biyatchbent on revenge and whatnot hed given up midafternoon on making any money and had gone home to remove his makeup and lick his wounds hed taken a vicious asswhuppin today even if it was only to his ego but now he was rolling with his

civic with rims worth more than the rest of the car huh monet inquired do you have a weapon fly said enunciating all royal shakespeare company precise oh yeah monet pulled the glock out of his waistband and showed it to fly nigga put that shit down said pj who was in the backseat wearing a phat pharm tracksuit that was four sizes too big for him sorry monet said tucking the gun back into

gun he made him swear that no one would be wearing gang colors so nothing monet did could come back on him monet had made the assurance then after pj did a google search for gang colors they settled on orange dorags since no gang seemed to claim that one highway safety posse yo monet had said yo stone tangerine thugs yo suggested fly yo yo yo check it out said pj with enough hand gestures that any deaf person watching would have thought he had asl tourettes syndrome cheesy goldfish crew yo dog thats so stupid its not stupid monet said is that good asked fly yo dog get in character fly was a bad actor they were all in the same acting class he should have just hired real gangsters to do this pj was probably going to trip over the legs of his track pants and completely ruin their intimidation this is it fly said pulling off the street right up onto the sidewalk of the embarcadero by the ferry building that him thats him monet said there was no one around but the occasional passing car but the new statue guy still stood there remember fly said walk dont run up just walk like you got all the time in the world use your sense memories right right right monet said he and pj got out of the car and quickstepped across the bricks to where the statue guy was running his game damn he was good didnt even flinch as he reached the statue guy monet raised the glock and the barrel connected with the statues forehead biyatch there was a dull clank whoa pj said nigga really is a statue monet tapped the statue three dull clanks yep but he got all that money in his shoes pj said well take it stupid monet said yo step off monet im not the one that got upstaged by a statue shut up monet said pj was grabbing handfuls of bills out of the big gulp cups at the statues feet and shoving them into his pockets must be a g here g yo monet said help me get the statue into the car pj stood and got one shoulder under the statue and tried to lift it while monet tucked the gun in his pants and got under the other they dragged the statue only a couple of feet before they had to set it down and catch their breath motherfucker heavy pj said would you guys come on fly screamed from the car totally out of character now fuck this monet said this whole thing was just too embarrassing hed paid rent on the gun hadnt he he drew the glock from his waistband and squeezed one off at the statue shit pj said ducking are you crazy biatch need to learn a monets comment was choked off pj stood up and looked back there was smoke streaming out of the bullet hole in the statue and in the second he watched it had formed into a hand and grabbed monet by the throat pj turned to run but something caught the hood of his tracksuit and yanked him back off his feet he could hear monet gagging and choking then he felt a sharp pain in the side of his neck and he felt suddenly lightheaded the last thing he saw was fly peeling away in the honda chapter seventeen being the chronicles of abby normal newly baptized minion of the night bow before me skeezy mortals for now i see you for the pathetic little rodents that you are scurry before my dazzling darkness daysters for i am your mistress your queen your goddessi have been brought into the foldi am abigail von normal nosferatu bitches sort of omg it was so fucking coollike coming twice with skittles and a coke i was in the loft spacing into my jams on my mp player i had downloaded the latest dead can dub cd death boots badonka mix at the starbucks and it was totally transcendent i was transported to an ancient romanian castle where everyone had done x and was dancing totally chill and sensuous with perfect hair i was grinding a freeform booty dance on the armchairperfecting my dance gestaltwhen i saw some smoke coming in under the door i cant wait to dance with jared to this new cd hes so going to love this move i do thats what i love about dancing with gay guys if they get wood during a booty dance you can just take it as a compliment not an agenda jared said that if i was a guy he would totally suck my dick he can be so sweet so i pulled out one of my headphones and i was like whoa fire in the staircasesucks to be me theres only one exit so you know blackened abby coming up but the smoke formed into a pillar and then it started growing arms and legs when i saw it had eyes i ran into the bedroom and shut the door i wasnt trippin or anything just totally calm but it wasnt like when your friends hold your hair while you puke and tell you its just the drugs and youll be okayso i went for the safe thing of locking the door so i could assess the situation then the door just splodes into splinters and theres the countess totally naked standing in the doorway with the knob in her hand and she was totally hot except that her legs were all fucked up like they were burned or rotted or something so im all you totally wrecked your deposit and the countess like grabs my hair and pulls me to her and bites my neck just like that it didnt really hurtit was more surprisinglike you woke up from getting a root canal to find your dentist going down on you well not exactly like thatmore mystical but still surprising okay it hurt but not as much as the time lily tried to pierce our nipples with a compass from geometry class and an ice cube youch she smelled like burning meat and i tried to push her away but it was like my limbs were paralyzed or there was a fat guy sitting on melike i was buried alive or something just watching it happen and then i started to get lightheaded and i thought i was going to pass out thats when the ho dropped me she goes go downstairs and get my clothes off the sidewalk and make coffee and im like wait a minute i just lost my mortality virginity shouldnt i get a cigarette and a fucking towel or something but i just said okay because where the countess was all burned was healing while i watched and it was kind of freaking me out to be looking at her naked burnedup thighs and her totally red pubes anyway so i went downstairs and just outside the door there was a homeless guy digging through a pile of clothes well really he was sniffing her panties and because i dont feel we always do enough to help the homeless i was like take them and tell no one what you witnessed here tonight i was already feeling the superiority of my nosferatitude so it only seemed appropriate that i go all noblesse oblige on his ass so off he went to sniff the lacy crotch of the undead while i went back upstairs to find coffee filters so when i get up there the countess is dressed and hair brushed and shes all where is tommy have you seen tommy did you talk to those cops and wheres tommy and i was all countess begging your pardon and shit but you need to chill the vampyre flood was gone when i got here this morning and so was that bronze statue from the other side i thought you guys went off to sleep in the damp womb of your native soil or something yuck goes the countess then she tightens down all of sudden make me a cup of coffee two sugars and squeeze one of those vials of blood into itand call us a cab and i was like hey step off countess im one of you and you are not the boss of me and and she said i said for us didnt i so i did her biddingwell our bidding reallyand we took a cab over to the marina safeway but why we didnt transform into bats and fly is beyond me anyway we were there in ten minutes but as we start to pull in the countess tells the driver to keep going she was all its rivera and cavuto this is not good the pos brown cop car was parked in front of the store i was all cops their shit is weak she seemed surprised that i knew the cops but i told her how i had owned them like the little wussyboys that they are and i could tell that the countess was feeling pretty good about bringing me into the dark fold of the coven then she was all fucking clinthes telling them about tommy but i couldnt even see what she was looking at beyond the big glass front of the safeway i guess my powers will develop as time goes on five hundred years is a long time to get your vampyre kung fu down the countess had the driver drop us at fort mason so we could still see the front of the safeway and we stood in the fog like the creatures of the night that we were while we waited for the cops to leave then the countess put her arm around my shoulders and she was all abby im sorry i uh attacked you like that i was hurt really badly and to heal i needed fresh blood i wasnt really in control of myself it wont happen again no worries i told her im honored to be promoted besides it was kind of hot which it was you know except for the smell of burning flesh and stuff and she was all well thanks for looking out for us and i was all pardon countess but why are we at the safeway because its not like we needed groceries and she was all these guys used to work with tommy and one of them knows that he is uh one of the children of the night i think they might know something about where he is now then over at the safeway we saw this goofylooking guy with frizzy hair and glasses unlock the front door and let the cops out they got in their car and the frizzy guy locked the front door behind them showtime said the countess she zipped up her leather jacket took a pair of sunglasses out of her jacket pocket and put them on she goes stay back abby ill be right back then she started across the parking lot toward the safeway taking big strides and looking all angel of vengeance with her red hair flying out behind her and the lights shining down on her through the fog i was like oh shit she didnt even slow down when she got about ten feet from the front window she snatched up one of the steelreinforced trash cans like it was made of cardboard and flung it through the window and she just kept walking little cubes of safety glass rained down on her and she just walked through the front of the store like she owned it and everyone in itwhich she did before i even got in the store she was coming back around the corner dragging the frizzyhaired guy by the throat she threw him up against a rack of wine bottles which shattered spilling red all over the floor and splattering the registers and stuff i was all oh dog countess gonna crack open a forty of whupass on you now oh you in the shit now wigga i am not inclined to use hiphop vernacular often but there are times when like french it just better expresses the sentiment of the moment just then the whole crowd of guys id seen in the limo came running around the corner the countess snatched a wine bottle off the rack and without a second of hesitation she threw it and it hit the first guy a tall hippielooking guy right in the middle of the forehead and he went down like he was shot she goes back and they all headed back around the corner the way they came except the hippielooking guy who was out cold then the countess picked up the guy with glasses by the throat and even though he was like a foot taller than her she whipped him around like a rag doll until he was screaming stuff about satan and jesus and telling her to get behind him and shit and the countess was all where is tommy and he was all i dont know i dont know and the countess grabbed him by the hair and held his head steady against the wine rack real chilly she says clint im going to take your right eye now then if you dont tell me where tommy is im going to take your left ready on three one two then hes all i didnt have anything to do with it shes the spawn of satan i told them that three goes the countess hes in lashs apartment on northpoint i dont know the number and the countess just yells number out to the whole store and the black guy pops up from behind a display of cheerios and is all six ninetythree northpoint apartment and one of the other guys pulls him back down then the countess is all thank you if hes hurt ill be back and she throws the clint guy through a rack of doritos which exploded their nacho cheesy goodness all over the place then shes all well thats a nice surprise and im all that lord flood is in an apartment on northpoint i didnt think they would really know i just didnt know where else to start probably your senses attuned to lord floods presence over the eons i said like a total tard and shes all lets go abby and i dont know why i guess because i had like low blood sugar or something from blood loss but i was like can i get some gum and she was all sure grab some coffee too whole beans were almost out so i did and when i caught up with her she was halfway across the parking lot headed back toward ghirardelli square and little pieces of safety glass were still shining in her hair and she smiled at me when i caught up and i just couldnt help myself because that was the coolest thing id ever seen ever and i was all countess i love you and she put her arm around me and kissed me on the forehead and goes lets get tommy i guess ill start feeling my vampyre powers tomorrow night but right now i feel like a total fucking loser but i am so going to rule when school starts again chapter eighteen nobody likes a dead whore finding her boyfriend tied naked to an upright bed frame covered in blood with a dead blue dominatrix at his feet would be enough to rattle some womens confidence in the stability of their relationship some women might even take it as a sign of trouble but jody had been single for a number of yearsshed dated rock musicians and stockbrokersand was conditioned to unusual bumps on the road of romance so she simply sighed and kicked the hooker in the ribsmore as a conversation opener than a confirmation that the ho was deadand said so rough night awkward abby sang peeking in the door then immediately swinging back into the hallway i forgot my safety word tommy said jody nodded well that had to be embarrassing she beat me you okay yeah but it hurt a lot tommy looked past jody toward the door hi abby abby swung around the corner lord flood she said with a nod and a little grin then she looked down at the body her eyes went wide and she swung back out into the hall howre your sisters lice tommy said shampoo didnt work abby called without looking in we had to shave her head sorry about that its okay she looks kind of cool in a make a wish kid kind of way jody said abby why dont you come in and shut the door if someone walks by and looks in it might oh i dont know freak them out a little kay said abby she stepped in and palmed the door shut behind her as if the clicking of the door latch might actually be the thing that would attract attention i think i killed her tommy said she was beating me and she wanted me to bite her so i did i think i drained her dry well shes dead all right jody reached down and tossed the blue hookers arm up it fell back to the floor but you didnt drain her i didnt shed be dust if you did heart attack or stroke or something looks like most of her blood went on you and the carpet yeah i sort of tore her throat out and she fell before i could finish well what did she expect you were tied up you dont seem that bothered by it i thought youd be jealous did you ask her to bring you here and beat you until you snapped and killed her nope did you encourage her to beat you until you snapped and killed her of course not and you didnt get off on her beating you until you snapped and killed her honestly youre naked and chained to a bed frame and im just inches away from both a riding crop and your genitals i think honesty would be a good policy well honestly the killing part was kind of a turnon but not sexual no way it was totally homicidal lust then were okay really youre not mad im just glad youre okay i should feel bad about it i know but i dont that happens some bitches just need killing abby said looking briefly at tommy then realizing he was naked under all that blood looking away quickly there you go jody said she stepped up and began to undo his restraints they were double bands of fleece and nylon with heavy metal shackles locked over them what did she buy these for to handcuff a grizzly bear abby check the body for a key nuhuh abby said staring down at the dead blue hooker jody noticed that the kid was focused on the breasts which were defying gravity and apparently death itself by standing there at complete attention those arent real jody said i knew that she was a very mean woman tommy said trying to help with really big but insincere boobs dont be afraid abby tore her gaze from the dead womans chest and looked from tommy to jody to jodys chest and back to the body fucksocks does everybody have big boobs but me god i hate you guys she ran out the door and slammed it behind her i do not have big boobs jody said perfectly proportioned tommy said perfect really thanks sweetie jody said kissing him on the lips lightly so as not to get a taste of the whores blood i think i saw her hang the key in lashs fortyfuckingniners hat rack by the door i really need to teach you how to go to mist jody said retrieving the key yeah that would have helped me avoid a lot of this you know the animals sold you out right i cant see them doing that she must have blackmailed them or something clint told the cops too rivera and cavuto had our loft staked out clint doesnt really count though he traded in all his moral credibility in this world when he committed to live forever amazing how badly the promise of immortality makes people behave like it doesnt matter how you treat people tommy said there jody finally got the shackle on tommys right wrist unlocked and started working on the left they were heavy but she thought that given the motivation of torture she could have broken loose or at least torn apart the bed frame you couldnt just snap these i guess i need to work out he scratched his nose furiously so should we hide the body or something no i think its a good warning for your buddies right what about the cops not our problem she said as she twisted the key in the lock and snapped the restraint off his left wrist we dont have a dead blue hooker in our apartment thats an excellent point tommy said rubbing his wrist thank you for rescuing me by the way i love you he grabbed her and pulled her to him nearly tumbling over on his face when she stepped back and he encountered the resistance of his ankle restraints i love you too she said palming his forehead and pushing him back on balance but you are covered with skank oil and you will not get it on my new leather jacket in the cab abby poutedsticking out her lower lip far enough that pink was showing above her black lipstick making her look vaguely like a cat eating a plum just drop me at my house tommy who sat in the middle wearing one of lashs fortyniners jerseys put his arm around abbys shoulders to comfort her its okay kid you did great we are most pleased with you abby snorted and looked out the window jody in turn put her arm around tommys neck and dug her nails into his shoulder shut up she whispered so soft that only tommy would be able to hear it youre not helping look abby jody said its not something that happens all at once like in the movies sometimes you have to eat bugs for years before you become one of the chosen i know i did tommy said beetles bugs spiders mice rats snakes marmosets ouch stop that ive been tortured already tonight you two are just into each other abby said you dont care about anyone else were like cattle to you the cabdriver who was a hindu looked in the rearview mirror so whats your point jody said tommy elbowed her in the ribs kidding jeez abby we care very deeply about you weve trusted you with everything in fact you may have saved my life tonight tommy reared back and looked at jody long story the redhead said then to abby again get some rest and come to the loft tomorrow at dusk well talk about your future abby crossed her arms tomorrow is christmas im trapped with the family tomorrow is christmas tommy said yeah jody said so the animals wont be working i have some issues with them you were thinking revenge well yeah jody patted the flight bag on the seat which held all of the money that the animals had paid to blue almost six hundred thousand dollars i think you have that covered tommy frowned im beginning to doubt the steadiness of your moral compass sure im the one with skewed ethics when you spent the whole night tied up and beaten by a blue dominatrix and then ripping her throat out you make everything sound so sleazy abby put her fingers in her mouth and whistledshrill and nearly deafening in the enclosed space hello theres a cabdriver here would you two shut the fuck up hey jody said hey tommy said hey you little creepy girl said the cabdriver you will not be whistling in my cab again or i will be putting you out on the curb sorry abby said sorry tommy and jody said in unison with the exception of the odd serial killer and car salesmen who think of them as the perfect unit for measuring trunk space nobody likes a dead whore yeah you can get fivemaybe six dead hookers in this baby she looks so natural said troy lee looking down on blue except for the way her arm is bent under herand the riding cropand the blood everywhere i mean and shes blue said lash the other animals nodded mournfully it was turning out to be a stressful morning for the animals cleaning up the mess that jody had made of the store getting drew to the emergency room to get his forehead sewn up where the wine bottle had hit him they immediately passed around the painkillers he was prescribed which help to take the edge off then explaining the broken front window to the manager when he came in and now this youre the one with almost an mba barry the short balding one said to lash you should know what to do they dont cover what to do with a dead hooker lash countered thats a whole different program political science i think despite the dulling theyd given themselves with the painkillers and a case of beer theyd shared in the parking lot at the safeway they were all feeling sad and a little frightened gustavo is the porter clint said shouldnt he do the cleanups ahhhhh said jeff the tall exjock as he thumped clint on the head with a protruding knuckle feeling like the knuckle might not quite be enough he snatched off clints hornrimmed glasses and threw them to troy lee who snapped them into four neat pieces and handed them back to clint this is all your fault lash said if you hadnt ratted flood out to the cops this wouldnt have happened i just told them that tommy was a vampire clint whined i didnt tell them he was here i didnt tell them about your whore of babylon you didnt know her like we did barry added his voice breaking a little she was special expensive drew said sí expensive added gustavo she probably could finally afford to go to babylon said lash forgive them for they know not what they do clint said troy lee bent and examined blue careful not to touch her its hard to see bruising through the blue dye but i guess she broke her neck the blood must be floods i dont see any marks on her no bite marks you mean said clint of course thats what i mean nit wit you know floods girlfriend did this right how do you know lash asked it could have been flood i dont think so said troy lee tommy was tied up heresee the orange crap all over the restraints and these were unlocked not broken maybe when blue let him go he killed her troy lee picked something off of blues face as delicately as if he were taking her ghost except for this he held a long red hair up where lash could see it no reason for her to be here if flood was loose dude youre like one of those csi guys drew said we should call those two homicide cops barry said like he was the first who might have thought of it and tell them to come help us with our dead hooker lash said well they know about the vampires barry said maybe theyll help us how bout we move her to your apartment and then call them well what are we going to do with her barry said standing feet apart hands behind his back a brave hobbit ready to face a dragon troy lee shrugged wait until dark then drop her in the bay i cant bear to touch her barry said not after the moments we shared you little puntas gustavo said stepping up and beginning to roll up the bloodstained rug he had a wife and five children and although he had never disposed of a dead hooker before he thought that it couldnt be any worse than changing the diaper on a gloopy infant the other animals all looked at one another embarrassed until gustavo growled at them and they jumped to move the heavy bed frame out of his way i never really liked her that much anyway barry said she really did take advantage of us jeff said i just went along with you guys so i didnt ruin the party said troy lee i didnt enjoy even half of those blow jobs lets just put her in my closet until tonight then a couple of us can sneak the bitch out to hunters point and drop her off on christmas drew asked cant believe she took all our money and now shes going to ruin christmas said troy lee our money said lash that bitch nobody likes a dead whore i do like a dead whore now and then said the vampire elijah ben sapir derailing a perfectly good theme hed snapped the whores neck right before she was completely drained so there would be a body but one doesnt want to be too obvious he dragged the whores body behind a dumpster and watched as the wounds on her neck healed over hed taken her in an alley near tenth and mission streets hed had the hood up on the oversized tracksuit he was wearing so shed been surprised when theyd ventured down the alley and he threw it back to reveal a very pale semitic man look atchew thought baby was a playa the whore had said her last words shed only had a hundred dollars on her which along with the tracksuit and a pair of nikes were the complete resources the ancient vampire had at his disposal hed come to the city in a yacht worth millions filled with art worth millions more and now he was reduced to making kills for petty cash of course he owned several homes around the world and had stashes of cash put away in a dozen cities but it would take some time to access it and perhaps it wasnt so bad to have the wolf at the door for a change after all hed come to the city and taken a new fledgling in order to alleviate his boredom its very hard to feel alive when youve been dead for eight hundred years and she had done that he was not boredand he felt very much alive he walked out of the alley and checked the sky dawn was threateninghe had perhaps twenty minutes until sunup where does the time go he crossed the street and was buzzed into a hotel with a sign that read for rent by hour day or week he could smell the cigarettes sweat and heroin on the desk clerk and he kept his head down so the hood covered his face do you have a room without a window twentyfive bucks like all the others the clerk said you want sheets sheets are five more the vampire smiled no i dont want to spoil myself he paid the clerk took the key and trudged up the steps yes he felt very much alive one really cant appreciate what one has until its gone and without a significant loss how would one enjoy the process of revenge chapter nineteen our dead homeys the vampires sat side by side on the bare futon frame watching as a fivelegged bug limped up the big front window of the loft tommy thought that the rhythm of the bugs steps made a for a danceable backbeatthought he might be able to set music to it if he knew how to write music suite for angst and limping bug hed call it nice bug tommy said yeah jody said we should save it for abby jody thought she was feeling guilty about having bitten the girlnot so much because of the violation because obviously the kid had been willing but because she felt as if she really didnt have any choice she had been injured and her predator nature told her to survive whatever the cost which is what bothered her was her humanity drifting away the animals are going to come for us now tommy said he was feeling angry betrayed by his old crew but most of all he felt separate from them now he felt separate from everyone tomorrow was christmas and he didnt even want to call his parents because they were a different species now what do you buy for an inferior species its just the animals jody said well be safe ill bet thats what elijah thought too and they got him we should go get him jody said she imagined elijah ben sapir standing in the full sun by the ferry building tourists passing him wondering why someone would put a statue there would the brass protect him tommy checked his watch wed never get there and back in time i tried that yesterday how could you do that to him tommy he was one of us one of us he was going to kill us if you remember he kind of did kill us i resent that besides if youre covered in bronze what does it matter if youre underwater i was just trying to get him out of sight so we could think about our future without him being part of it right okay jody said sorry future shed lived with a halfdozen guys none had ever willingly talked about the future before and she and tommy had a supersized buttload of future ahead of them as long as someone didnt catch them sleeping maybe we really should leave the city she said no one would know about us in a new city i was thinking we should get a christmas tree tommy said jody looked away from the bug thats a thought or we could put some mistletoe up put on christmas carols and stand outside waiting for santa until the sun comes up and incinerates us hows that sound nobody appreciates your sarcasm missy im just trying to get a handle on normal three months ago i was stocking groceries in indiana looking at community college driving around in my crappy car wishing i had a girlfriend and wishing that there was some potential for something to happen beyond getting a job with benefits and living the same life as my dad now i have a girlfriend and superpowers and a bunch of people want to kill me and i dont know how to act i dont know what to do next and its going to be that way forever forever im going to be scared out of my mind forever i cant deal with forever hed been barking at her but she resisted the urge to snap back he was nineteen not a hundred and fiftyhe didnt even have the tools for being an adult let alone being immortal i know she said tomorrow night first thing well hire a car go get elijah and pick up a christmas tree on the way back hows that sound hiring a car that sounds exotic itll be like prom was she being too patronizing you dont have to do that he said im sorry im acting like a weenie but youre my weenie jody said take me to bed still holding her hand he stood then pulled her up into his arms well be okay right she nodded and kissed him feeling for just a second like a girl in love instead of a predator she immediately felt a resurgence of shame over feeding on abby the doorbell rang did you know we had a doorbell nope you cant beat a dead whore in the morning said nick cavuto cheerfully because apparently everyone loves a dead hooker despite what certain writer types might think they were standing in the alley off mission street dorothy chinshort pretty and whipsmartsnorted a laugh and checked the thermometer probe shed stuck in the deceaseds liver like a meat thermometer into a roast she hasnt been dead four hours guys rivera rubbed his temples and felt his bookstore slipping away along with his marriage hed known the marriage had been going for a while but he was feeling a little brokenhearted about the bookstore he figured he knew but he asked anyway cause of death toothy blow job cavuto said yes alphonse said dorothy with a tad too much sincerity id have to concur with detective cavuto she died of a toothy blow job it just pisses some guys off cavuto added a professional without skills guy just snapped her neck and took his money back said dorothy with a big grin so a broken neck said rivera mentally waving goodbye to a whole set of firstedition raymond chandlers tentosix workdays golfing on mondays cavuto snorted this time her heads turned around the wrong way rivera what did you think it was seriously dorothy chin said i have to do the autopsy to be sure but offhand thats the obvious cause id also say shes probably lucky to go that way shes hiv positive and it looks like the disease had developed into fullblown aids how do you know that see these sarcomas on her feet chin had removed one of the hookers shoesshe pointed to open sores on the corpses foot and ankle rivera sighed he didnt want to ask but he asked anyway what about blood loss dorothy chin had done the autopsies on two of the previous victims and cringed a little it was a pattern theyd all been terminally ill theyd all died of a broken neck and theyd all shown evidence of extreme blood loss but no external woundsnot even a needle mark cant tell out here cavuto had lost his cheery manner now so we spend christmas day canvassing dirtbags to see if anyone saw anything at the end of the alley uniforms were still talking to the grimy homeless man who had called in the murder he was trying to get them to spring for a bottle of whiskeybecause it was christmas rivera didnt want to go home but he didnt want to spend a day trying to find out what he already knew he checked his watch what time was sunrise this morning he asked oh wait cavuto said patting down his pockets ill check my almanac dorothy chin snorted again then started giggling dr chin rivera said tightening down now could you be more precise about the time of death chin picked up on riveras tone and went full professional sure theres an algorithm for the cooling time of a body get me the weather from last night let me get her back to the morgue and weigh her and ill get you a time within ten minutes what cavuto said to chin what this time to rivera winter solstice nick rivera said christmas was originally set at the winter solstice the shortest day of the year its eleventhirty now im betting that four hours ago the sun was just coming up uhhuh cavuto said prostitutes have shitty hoursis that what youre saying rivera raised an eyebrow our guy didnt travel far after sunrise is what im saying hes going to be around here i was afraid thats what you were saying cavuto said were never going to get the bookstore open are we tell the uniforms to look anywhere its dark under dumpsters in crawl spaces atticsanywhere getting warrants on christmas day might be a problem you wont need warrants if you get permission from the ownerswere not looking to bust anyone living here were looking for a murder suspect cavuto pointed to the eightstory brick building that composed one wall of the alley this building has something like eight hundred ministorage units in it then you guys had better get started wherere you going there was a missing person report on an old guy in north beach a couple of days ago im going to check it out because you dont want to go dumpster diving for v because rivera cut him off before he could say the vword he had terminal cancer his wife assumed he just wandered off and got lost now im not so sure call me if you find anything uhhuh cavuto turned to the three uniforms who were interviewing the bum hey guys have i got a merry christmas detail for you the animals decided to hold a small memorial service for blue in chinatown troy lee was already there as was lash who wouldnt go home to his apartment until blues body was removed and barry who was jewish would be coming there for dinner with his family as was the tradition in his faith plus the liquor stores in chinatown were open on christmas and if you slipped some money under the counter you could get firecrackers the animals were fairly sure that blue would have wanted firecrackers at her funeral the animals stood in a semicircle beers in hand on a playground off grant street the deceased was being honored in absentiain her place was a halfeaten pair of edible panties from a distance they looked like a bunch of wastrels mourning a fruit rollup id like to start if i may said drew he wore a long overcoat and his hair was tied back with a black ribbon revealing the targetshaped bruise on his forehead where jody had hit him with the wine bottle out of his coat he pulled a bong the size of a tenor sax and using a long lighter designed for lighting fireplaces he sparked that magnificent mamajama up and bubbled away like a scuba diver having an asthma attack when he could hold no more he raised the bong poured some water on the ground and croaked to blue which came out in a perfect smoke ring the sight of which brought tears to everyones eyes to blue everyone repeated as they placed one hand on the bong and tipped a bit out of their beers to broo my nigga said troy lees grandma who had insisted upon joining the ceremony once she realized there would be firecrackers she will be avenged said lash and well get our fucking money back said jeff the big jock amen the animals said they had decided on a nondenominational ceremony as barry was a jew troy lee was a buddhist clint was an evangelical drew was a rastafarian gustavo was a catholic and lash and jeff were heathen stoners gustavo had been called in to work that day because someone had to be in the store as long as the front was only boarded up with plywood so in deference to his beliefs they had bought some incense and holders and placed a picket fence of smoldering joss sticks around the edible panty the incense also worked within troy and grandmas buddhist tradition and lash pointed out during the ceremony that although they have their differences otherwise all gods like a goodsmellin ho amen said the animals again and theyre handy for lightin firecrackers off of added jeff as he bent over an incense stick and set a string cracking hallelujah said the animals each offered to share some kind of memory of blue but all of their stories quickly degenerated to orifices and squishiness and no one wanted to go there in front of troys grandma so instead they threw firecrackers at clint while he read from the twentythird psalm before they cracked the second case of beer it was decided that after dark three of themlash troy lee and barrywould take blue from lashs apartment load her into the back of barrys station wagon and take her out in the middle of the bay in barrys zodiac barry was the diver of the bunch and had all the cool aquatic stuff theyd used his spearguns to help take down the old vampire lash braced himself as he opened the apartment door but to his surprise there was no smell he led barry and troy into the bedroom and together they wrestled the rolledup rug out of the closet its not heavy enough barry said oh shit oh shit oh shit troy said trying furiously to unroll the rug finally lash reached down grabbed the edge of the rug and whipped it up over his head there was a thudding sound against the far wall followed by the jingle of metal like coins settling the three animals stood and stared what are those asked barry earrings answered troy indeed there were seven earrings settling on the hardwood floor not those those barry nodded toward two clear cantaloupesized gelatinous lozenges that quivered on the floor like stranded jellyfish lash shivered ive seen them before my brother used to work in a plant in santa barbara that made them what the fuck are they said troy squinting through a drunken haze those are breast implants lash said what are those wormy things asked barry there were two translucent sluglike blobs of something stuck to the rug near the edge looks like window caulk said lash he noticed that there was a fine blue powder near the edge of the rug he ran his hand over it pinched some on his fingers and sniffed it nothing whered she go asked barry no idea said lash chapter twenty its a wonderful life gustavo chavez had been born the seventh child of a brick maker in a small village in the state of michoacan mexico at eighteen he married a local girl the daughter of a farmer herself a seventh child and at twenty with his second child on the way he crossed the border into the united states where he lived with a cousin in oakland along with a score of other relatives and worked grueling twelvehour days as a laborer making enough to feed himself and send more money home to his family than he could possibly have made in his fathers brickyard he did this because it was the responsible and right thing to do and because he had been raised a good catholic man who like his father would provide for his family and no more than two or three mistresses each year about a month before christmas he would sneak back across the border to celebrate christmas with his family meet any new children that might been born and make love with his wife maria until they were both so sore it hurt to walk in fact the vision of marias inviting thighs would often begin haunting him around halloween and the hapless night porter would find himself in a state of semiarousal as he swung his soapy mop to and fro across fifteen thousand square feet of linoleum every night tonight he was in the store alone and he was feeling far from aroused for it was christmas night and he could not go to mass or take communion until he confessed he was feeling deeply ashamed christmas night and he hadnt even called mariahadnt spoken to her for weeks because like the rest of the animals he had gone to las vegas and had given all his money to the blue whore he had called of course after theyd first taken the vampires art and sold it for so much money but since then his life had been a fog of tequila and marijuana and the evil attentions of the blue one he a good man who cared for his family had never hit his wife had only cheated with a second cousin and never with a white woman had been undone by the curse of the blue devils pussy la maldición de la cocha del diablo azul this is the saddest loneliest christmas ever thought gustavo as he dragged his mop past the canvas doors leading into the producedepartment cooler i am like the poor cabrón in that book the pearl where by simply trying to take advantage of some good fortune i have lost all that i care about okay i did get drunk for a week and my pearl was a blue whore who fucked the chimichangas out of me but still pretty sad he thought these things in spanish so they sounded infinitely more tragic and romantic then there came a noise from the cooler and he was startled for a second he wrung out his mop so as to be ready for anything he didnt like being in the store by himself but with the front windows broken out someone had to be here and because he was far from home had nowhere else to go and the union would see that he was paid double time gustavo had volunteered perhaps if he sent home a little extra maria might forget the hundred thousand dollars hed promised there something was moving behind the plastic doors of the cooler which were waving slightly the stout mexican crossed himself and backed out of the produce department swinging his mop now in quick swaths leaving barely a hint of dampness on the linoleum he was by the dairy case now and a stack of yogurts fell over inside the glass doors as if someone had shoved them out of the way to look through gustavo dropped the mop and ran to the back of the store saying a hail mary peppered with swearwords as he went wondering if those were footsteps he heard behind him or the echoes of his own footfalls resounding through the deserted store out the front door and away he chanted in his head out the front door and away he nearly fell rounding the turn at the meat case his shoes still wet from the mop water he caught himself on one hand and came up like a sprinter while reaching back on his belt for his keys as he went there were footfalls behind himlight slappingbare feet on linoleum but fast and close he couldnt stop to unlock the door when he got there he couldnt look back he couldnt turn to looka second of hesitation and he would be lost he exhaled a long wail and ran right through a rack of candy and gum by the registers he tumbled over the first register in an avalanche of candy bars and magazines many of which displayed headlines like i married bigfoot or space alien cult takes over hollywood or vampires hunt our streets and other such nonsense gustavo scrambled out of the pile and was crawling on his belly like a desert lizard scrambling to get across hot sand when a heavy weight came down on his back knocking the air out of him he gasped trying to get his breath but something grabbed him by the hair and yanked his head backwards he heard crackling noises in his ear smelled something like rotten meat and gagged he saw the fluorescent lights some canned hams and a very happy cardboard elf making cookies as he was dragged down the aisle and through the doors into the dark back room of the deli like so much lunch meat feliz navidad our first christmas together jody said kissing him on the cheekgiving his butt a little squeeze through his pj bottoms did you get me something cute hi

brain for traveling kay oh my god youll do anything to get out of calling your mom chapter twentyone ladies and gentlemen presenting the disappointments he was the best onehanded freethrow shooter in the bay area and that christmas night he had sunk sixtyfour in a row in his driveway hoop shooting the new leather spauldingball his dad had left under the tree for him sixtyseven in a row without ever setting down or spilling his beer his record was seventytwo and he would have broken it had he not been dragged off into the bushes to be slaughtered jeff murray was not the smartest of the animals nor the most wellborn but when it came to squandering potential he was the handsdown winner jeff had been a star power forward through his sophomore junior and senior years in high school and he had been offered a fullboat ride to cal berkeleythere had even been talk of his going pro after a couple of years in college but jeff had decided to impress his prom date by showing her he had enough vertical leap to clear a moving car it was a minor misjudgment and he would have cleared the car had he not drunk most of a case of beer before the attempt and had the cars height not been eight inches enhanced by the light bar on the roof the light bar just caught jeffs left sneaker and somersaulted him four times in the air before he landed upright in a james brown split on the tarmac he was pretty sure that his knee wasnt supposed to bend that way and a team of doctors would later agree hed wear a brace forever and hed never play competitive basketball again although he was a smokin onehanded horse player and he might have even been a champion if it werent for that slaughteredinthebushes thing he liked the new leather ball and he knew he shouldnt be using it on the asphalt and especially this late at night when the sound of his dribbling might disturb his neighbors he lived in a garage apartment in cow hollow and the fog was blowing in damp streams up his street making the basketball sound lonely and ominous so no one complained it was christmasif all some poor bastard had was some hoops then youd have to be a special kind of heartless to call the cops on him a car turned at the end of the street blue halogens swept through the fog like sabers then went out jeff squinted into the fog but couldnt make out what kind of car it was only that it had stopped a couple of doors down and it was a dark color he turned to take his recordbreaking shot but distracted he put a little too much backspin on the ball and it jumped out of the hoop he ran it down at the junipers by the garage but was only able to tip it so that it went into the bushes he set his beer down on the driveway and went in after it andwell you know francis evelyn stroud answered the phone on the second ring as she always did as it was proper to do hello hi mom its jody merry christmas and to you darling youre calling rather late i know mom i was going to call earlier but had a thing i was a thing jody thought a thing of course did you get the package i sent it would be expensive and completely inappropriate a cashmere business suit or something in a houndstooth or a herringbone something worn only by matronly academics or matronly spies with stout poisondart shoes and mother stroud would have sent it to the old address yes i got it its lovely i cant wait to wear it i sent a leatherbound set of the complete works of wallace stegner mother stroud said fuck jody kicked at tommy for making her call he skipped out of range waving a scolding finger at her of course stegner the stanford paragon mother was one of the first coeds to graduate from stanford and she never missed an opportunity to point out that jody hadnt gone there jodys father had also gone to stanford she was born to stanford and yet she had disgraced them by going to san francisco state and not finishing yeah those will be great too i guess they just havent caught up with me yet youve moved again mrs stroud had lived in the same house in carmel for thirty years carpet and draperies never survived more than two years but shed been in the same house yeah we needed a little more space tommys working

my present in the mail mom id better go tommys being honored at a dinner tonight because of his massive intellect on christmas oh what the fuck hes jewish she could hear the intake of breath on the other end of the phone this is the light version mom imagine how scandalized you be if i told you he was dead and that i killed him you didnt tell me that sure i did you must be losing details gotta go mom i gotta help tommy get his penis piercing in before the dinner bye she hung up tommy had been dancing naked in front of her for most of the phone call when she hung up he stopped did i mention that i worry about your ethical equilibrium said the guy who was just playing buff the scrotum with my red scarf while i was making the merry christmas call to my mother admit it youre a little turned on dr drewdrew mccomber the ohmbudsman the resident pharmacist and medical adviser to the animals was afraid of the dark the fear had crept up on him like a hash brownie and coldcocked him with an inescapable paranoia after four years on the night crew at the marina safeway thing was he awoke in the evening to the pervasive grow lights in his garage apartment in the marina then drove four blocks under the streetlights to the brightly lit safeway then got off work in the morning when the sun was well off the horizon to return to his growlit apartment to sleep with a satin mask in place he encountered darkness so infrequently that it seemed like a menacing stranger when he did on christmas night round midnight drew sat among a jungle of fivefoottall pot plants in his living room wearing sunglasses and watching a movie on cable about the special relationship between the lady of an english manor and her chimney sweep because of his work schedule and the constant demand to stay wasted drew found it difficult to keep a girlfriend until the animals found blue his sex life had been a largely solitary affair and sigh apparently had become so once again each time the chimney sweeps sooty hand smacked the powdered bottom of the lady of the manor drew grieved a littlethat dusky handprint on alabaster flank falling like a shadow on his erotic soul there was arousal but no joy sad and lonely wood did tent his hempfiber cargo pants then as if scripted by erecto the generously endowed pizza delivery god of improbable trysts there was a knock at drews door rather than answer the door directly drew adjusted himself and ambled through the ganja forest to a small video screen in his kitchenettea video peephole hed installed it in the days before his doctor had given him the prescription that made him a quasilegal medical marijuana grower patient complains that reality harshes his mellowprescribe grams cannabis every three hours by inhalation ingestion or suppository sure enough as if he had called in an order the video screen revealed a pale but pretty blonde standing on his doorstep in a conservative blue cocktail dress and heels she might have just come from a party or a dinner outher hair was pinned up with tiny blue bows she might have shown up to audition for the role of the lady of the manor drew keyed the intercom hi are you sure you have the right house i think so said the girl im looking for drew she smiled into the camera perfect teeth jeez drew said then realizing that he had said it allowed he cleared his throat and said ill be right there he smoothed his erection down pushed his hair behind his ears and in five long strides he was through the forest and at the front door at the last second he remembered the sunglasses pushed them up on his head smiled broadly and threw open the door releasing a wide beam of ultraviolet light into the night fog the pretty blonde dropped her smile then screamed as she burst into flames and leapt out of the light drew ran out into the dark to save her chapter twentytwo being the chronicles of abby normal pathetic nosferatu noobsicle well except for the murder christmas was like a slow drag over broken glassi now truly know the ennui of passing eternity in total boredomeating and hurling tofurky all day stuck with ronnie and mom until like six when jared came over his father has a fresh family with little crumbsnatcher stepsisters so they like forget about him as soon as the squealing and presents start in the morning he spent the whole day rewatching the nightmare before christmas disc in his room and smoking cloves his room is totally sacrosanct since he told his rents that he couldnt guarantee that he wouldnt be masturbating to gay porn if anyone came in hes so lucky sometimesi could stand on my head and flick the bean right there at the dinner table and my mom would be all honey christmas is family time we should be together and make me finish in front of everyone so we like watched the nightmare before christmas disc with mom and ronnie until they fell asleep on the couchthen jared and i drew some really cool tribal tattoos on ronnies shaved head with magic marker but only like in red and black so they look real then he was all we should go get some coffeemy aunt gave me a hundreddollar starbucks gift card for christmas and i hate it when people brag about their christmas presents because its completely shallow and materialistic so i was all yeah well id love to but i am now one of the chosen so i have duties and he was all no way youre jewish and i was all no i am nosferatu and he was all you are not and i was all remember that sexylicious guy from walgreens it was him well actually its the countess who brought me into the sacred circle of sanguinity and he was all you didnt even call me im sorry jared but you are of an inferior species now so he goes i know i totally suck and i know hes going to go all tragicoemo on me so i say buy me a mochaccino and ill reveal to you our dark ways and stuff we leave a note saying that jared has impregnated me and were running off together to join a satanic cult so my mother wont panic when she wakes up because shes totalitarian about leaving notes then we head to the soma but apparently the entire fucking country shuts down on christmas slammed under the oppressive iron fist of the baby jesus so out of nine starbucks we try all are closed and jared is all take me to meet them i want to be in the dark fold too and i was all no way loser your hair is totally flat which it was he only had the one spike in front and his sculpting gel had like failed hours ago so in his pvc raincoat he kinda looked like a black lacquer coatrack like you see in chinatown but that wasnt why i couldnt take him to see the countess and my dark lord i just couldnt i knew the countess would freak out if she saw i was exploiting her exquisite gift to show off for a friend so i was all its very secret but jared started to pout and brood at the same time which he can totally pull off because he practices so i started to feel like a malodorous soupçon of mashed assholes as lautréamont so aptly put it shut up lily says it sounds more romantic in french so i let him come but i told him he had to say outside across the street but when we came around the corner of the dark lords block there was a guy in a yellow tracksuit standing in the middle of the street just standing there with his hood up and his head down looking like he was going to stand there forever and he turned really slow in our direction jared was all wanksta rappa in my ear and he giggled that highpitched littlegirl giggle he does sometimes thats like violence catnip to other guys which is why jared has to carry a footlong doubleedged dagger in his boot which he calls his wolffang fortunately it doesnt give him any false confidence and he is still a total puss but he likes the attention he gets when doormen take it away from him at clubs anyway i think my vampyre senses were like on edge because i could just tell that this wasnt your normal hiphop guy standing in the middle of a deserted street in a threehundreddollar tracksuit at midnight on christmas night so i grabbed jareds arm and pulled him back around the corner and im all dude shields up creep stealth lowest profile so we peek around the corner totally cloaked this time and the tracksuit guy is like over by the door of the loft and someone is coming out its the crusty old drunk guy with the huge shaved cat and he has his unit out like hes going to take a leak which i could have gone another sixteen years without seeing and tracksuit grabs him like hes a rag doll and pulls his head back by the hair and bites him on the neck and when he does i can see that its not a hiphop guy at all but some crusty white vampyre his fangs were like visible from space so the huge cat guy is thrashing and screaming and spraying whiz all over the place and i can hear the huge cat hissing behind the door and jared grabs me by my messenger bag and starts pulling me away down the street so thats all i saw and jared was all whoa and i was all yeah and as soon as we got a few blocks away i pulled out my cell and called the countesss cell but it went right to voice mail so now were at a special midnight showing of the nightmare before christmas at the metreon drinking a huge diet coke to calm our nerves while we wait for a return call from my vampyre coven jared forgot his inhaler and has been gasping since we saw the attack its so embarrassing people are like looking and ive moved a couple of seats over so they wont think im giving him a hand job or something i am totally overcome with dread and foreboding and the time passes like a seeping infection on a bad eyebrow piercing so we wait i wish we had some pot more later oh yeah and mom got me a green care bear for christmas i totally love it youre sure this is where you left it jody was looking up and down the embarcadero there were no people out on the streetthe performers and hustlers were long gone she could hear the bay bridge humming in the distance a foghorn started to low over in alameda a bart train burped out of a tunnel onto the street a block away headed toward the ballpark empty a police cruiser turning out of market street strafed them with its headlights before heading past the ferry building toward fishermans wharf tommy waved to the cops yeah i was right here and my watch went off he weighed a ton it would have taken a bunch of guys to move him jody saw something shining on the bricks near her feet and crouched down to touch the source metal filings of some sort she licked her finger and came up with a coating of yellowish metallic particles on her fingertip unless someone cut it up who would do that who would cut a statue up and steal the pieces doesnt matter maybe thieves maybe city workers if someone cut that bronze shell one of two things happened if it was daytime elijah fried out here in the sun if it was dark hes free it wasnt light was it jody shook her head im guessing no she saw a light pattern among the bricks a few steps away and crouched down again there was a fine grayish powder between the bricks she pinched some between her fingers and shook her head for sure no what what is that she brushed her finger off on her jeans and dug into her jacket pocket tommy remember i told you that you didnt drink the whore dry because she wouldnt have been there if you had yeah well thats because when a vampire drains someonewhen we drain someone they turn to a fine gray powder i cant explain why but it looks like that feels like that she pointed to the mortar lines between the bricks tommy knelt down and touched the powder looked up how do you know that you know how i know that youve killed people she shrugged just a couple and they were sick terminal they were asking for it sort of so thats why you werent upset about the hooker she pulled her cell phone out of her jacket pocket then held it behind her back and twisted back and forth looking at her feet like a little girl being interrogated about how mommys lamp got broken are you mad im a little disappointed really im really sorry you would have done the same thing if youd been there im just disappointed that you didnt feel that you could trust me you were having a hard time with your change i didnt want to bother you but it wasnt sexual or anything right absolutely not purely nutritional she didnt think it necessary to tell him about kissing the old man it would just confuse things well i guess its okay then i guess if you had to he stood and she ran to him and kissed him i cant tell you how glad i am to have that off my chest yeah well hang on she held up a finger and hit the power button on her phone calling your mom to tell her she was right about your being a tramp im calling the kid abby yeah i need to tell her to stay away from our place elijah is going to start messing with us like before jody watched as the little icons on her phone showed that it was searching for a signal but she said she wasnt coming by tonight its christmas i know she said that but i think she may come by anyway why well she has a thing for me i think i bit her last night you bit abby yeah i told you i was hurt i needed god youre such a blood slut i knew youd be mad well its abby for fucks sake im her dark lord look a voice mail elijah ben sapir cast the twitching peespraying alcoholic across the street where he bounced off the metal garage door of the foundry and back out to the curb where his head knocked the side mirror off an illegally parked mazda then the vampire walked with exaggerated steps his arms held out from his sides like a bad stage monster to try to keep the urinesotted velour fabric of his tracksuit from contacting his skin although he had experienced all manner of filth and gore in his eight hundred years and had in fact spent whole days hiding naked under loamy soil to escape the sun he didnt remember being quite so put off as he was at being pissed on by his lunch perhaps it was that he only had one set of clothes now and there was no luxurious yacht with a full wardrobe to retire to or perhaps it was that he had spent the day between two urinestained mattresses under an unconscious junkie while police searched the hotel around him hed just hit his limit thats all hed known the desk clerk would give him up to the police so as soon as he had gone to his room the vampire had hidden his tracksuit in the corner of the closet gone to mist then slipped under the door into the next room and in between the mattress and box springs of a semiconscious junkie hed gone back to solid just as sunrise put him out for the day at sundown he was surprised at how elated he was to find the tracksuit still in the closet after he fed off the junkie just a sip and snapped his neck leaving more or less a greeting card to the homicide inspectors who had attacked him with the others at the yacht club now his precious tracksuit was all covered in whiz and he was furious he stalked over to where hed thrown the bum and snatched him up by the ankle elijah was not tall by modern standards but he found that if he held the bums ankle high above his head he could shake him sufficiently to get the job done youre not even her minion are you elijah banged the bums head against the sidewalk to punctuate his question please said the bum my huge cat thud thud thud on the sidewalk a little shake change a few bills a lighter and a bottle of johnny walker rained out of the bums pockets youre just her little moo cow arent you i tasted her on you theres a kid said the moo cow a spooky little girl she takes care of them them elijah flung the bum against the garage and proceeded to pick up the change and the bills on the sidewalk the steel door next to the garage door opened and a burly bald man in overalls stepped out on the sidewalk smacking a leadtipped tire thumper on his palm you motherfuckers making enough noise out here elijah bared his fangs and hissed at the biker then leapt to the wall over the garage door and clung there facedown above the bikers head the biker looked up at the vampire down at the prostrate bum then at the damaged mazda well okay then he said i can see you fellas still have some shit to work out he slipped back into the foundry and slammed the door elijah dropped to his feet and headed up the street not even bothering to stop to snap the moo cows neck how could he have been so stupid he wasnt going to terrorize her by killing a food source he needed to threaten her minion just as he had with the boy how could he have known that shed actually betray him and choose the boy turn the boy it wouldnt happen again amid all the anger the hunger and the excitement at having a purpose elijah ben sapir felt a twinge of heartache he had begun this adventure thinking himself the puppet master now he was all entangled in the strings making mistakes no worry he cocked his head and focused past the rasping breath of the moo cow the buildings settling the bay bridge humming and a thousand hearts beating in the lofts around him he could hear the retreating steps of the little girl and her friend chapter twentythree being the chronicles of abby normal the hunted apparently i am the hunted which i want to note here i am totally not qualified for here i sit perched in the rafters i think these things are rafters of the oakland bay bridge like a crippled night bird waiting for doom to descend on me in the form of an ancient undead thing to wrench the very limbs from my delicate body so that sucks fortunately i have some sustenance until my dark lord and lady rise from their diurnal slumber to kick some fucking ass i know i should be eating bugs and spiders and stuff to facilitate my vampyrism but as a vegetarian i havent developed the hunting skills so ive started with some gummi bears i got at the theater supposedly they are made out of beef pectin or extract of horse hooves or something so i think they make a good transition to the nosferatu diet and i like biting off their tiny heads here high above the citywell actually were about ten feet above some homeless people who live under the bridgei feel like the guardian of an ancient tomb willing to face any attacker to protect my master and mistress who are wrapped in tarps lying on the next beam or rafter or whatever omfg there are fucking pigeons everywhere sorry one just pooped on my notebook never mind move along im over it but ewwww jared has gone to his dads house in the noe valley to get the lawn cart and minivan so we can transport my masters to safety he left me his dagger which ive only had to brandish once against a woman who wanted to take the tarp from over my dark lord then i used it to scrape off my old nail polish which was totally chipped and stuff from doing minion manual labor so my masters like met up with us outside the museum of modern art and they were all are you okay did he hurt you and they were being all secretive around jared like he didnt know we were vampyres and i was all just chill hes assistant minion so they relaxed then flood pulls this bronze hand out of his bag and hes all abby do you know what this is and i was all why yes lord flood because i speak obvious as a second language its a bronze hand correct so the countess took the hand from him abby this is whats left of the shell of the vampyre who turned me so im all begging your pardon and whatnot countess but thats a statue hand and shes all thats what im saying which is not what the fuck she was saying at all so it turns out that the bronze statue that used to be in the loft was actually the vampyre who turned the countess and then the countess turned the vampyre flood except he was just flood then so the old vampyre whose name is elijah got all pms and started fucking with the countess by leaving dead bodies all over town with evidence pointing toward her and threatening to kill her minion who was flood at the time and it got completely out of hand with some cops and the geeks from the safeway blowing up elijahs yacht and really pissing him off and then the countess pretending to save elijah when in fact she was extracting his ancient vampyry secrets and flood bronzing them both but letting the countess out because she is the love of his life and whatnot so flood who is not a mysterious and ancient creature of the night at all but has been a vampyre like a week longer than i have took the statue down to the waterfront to drop it in the bay so it wouldnt remind the countess of her heart being torn asunder by the yearning for two lovers and stuff but the sun came up and flood left the statue on the embarcadero and when they went back it was gone and it turns out that elijah is loose and he was the crusty vampyre in the yellow tracksuit i saw shaking the huge cat guy and he is now stalking me to get back at the countess for being a duplicitous ho so jared was all fuck thats awesome and i was all you lied to me and the countess was all yeah sunshine thats why im telling you this now which was completely unnecessary sarcasm on her part and jared was like this is the best christmas ever and i was all shut up gaybait ive been betrayed and the countess was all youll get over it we have to go see if william is okay and i see now that she was right but i brooded as we went back to the loft just to make a point because i hate it when people take me for granted when we got to the countesss block there was an ambulance there and cops all over the place so flood and the countess hung back and sent me over to get the i could see that the huge cat guy was on a stretcher and they were strapping oxygen on him and i was all let me through this man is my father and the emts were all no way and i was all who called you anyway and they were like the guy in the building a sculptor or something and then the cat guy was all let her through so they let me through so i blew by the emt to the huge cat guy and i was all are you okay and he was like well my head hurts like hell and i think my leg is broke and i was all is there anything i can do because i was under orders of the countess to gain information and offer assistance and he was like if you could take care of chet hes in the stairwell hell be hungry and i was all you got it so then he like pulled the oxygen mask off and had me bend over so he could whisper and i was all yes dad for the emts who were watching and he whispered like before they take me away could i see your tits so i kicked him in the ribs and the emts went all byzerk and shit and told me to get away but they were totally overreacting because i had on my red converse all stars which will hardly even bruise you so they loaded him into the ambulance and just as they were shutting the doors he reached out his hand like he was a drowning man reaching for the last spark of his mortality before the inky waves of death swept him awayso i flashed my boobs for him just a quick lift of my bra and top at the same time because i dont think we do enough to help the homeless and i wanted him to die a happy man and besides theyre small and i dont get that many requests so i got chet out of the stairway of the old loft and was carrying him kidstyle when i saw the two cops from beforethe ones the countess said helped blow up elijahso i went up to the hispanocop and i was all so whats up cop and he was all you need to get home and you have no business out at this hour and we should take you to the station and call your parents and blah blah blah threat threat disapproval and fascist dogma all up in your darkly delicious grille im paraphrasing although i do have a delicious grille as i had to wear braces for three years when i was a kid and now my teeth are like my most acceptable feature i hope my fangs come in straight and the big gay cop was all what are you doing here and i was all i live here bonesmoker what are you doing here arent you guys homicide cops and he was all lets see some id blah blah bluster bluster oh my god i am so full of shit and i was like i guess you wouldnt have to deal with this shit if you had properly blowed up that old vampyre when you stole his art collection so all of a sudden the hispanocop and his big gay partner were all whaaa and im like just so we know where we stand how long you bitches going to be here and they were like just a half hour or so longer miss we need to interview some witnesses and go clean out our boxers where we have just completely shit ourselves do you need a ride somewhere again paraphrasing so i walked off while they were still stunned let chet into the new loft down the street like it was mine then ran around the block and reported to the countess and flood jared was just staring at them like he was hypnotized or something i was like hey boo to remind him what a tard he was being and jared snapped out lily and jared and i watched the to kill a mockingbird dvd like six times together and our favorite part is when scout sees boo radley behind the door and goes hey boo its like thanking the universe for sending you a benevolent retard to help you out which is how i often feel about jared so i was like buy me a coffee and the countess and flood look at each other and shake their heads no money so i was like you guys are so fucking lame you have piles of cash and you roll with no money you are no longer the dark lord and lady of me which i totally didnt mean but i was stressed and starting to get a lowoncaffeine headache but jared goes hey boo at me and hes holding a tendollar bill and i pretended to find a snag in my fishnets so everyone would quit looking at me the countess said she knew of a chinese diner off freemont street that was open all night on christmas and we could hang out there until the cops left jared and i had cups of coffee and an order of fries which fyi taste a little like shrimp in a chinese diner and flood and the countess are watching us looking all sad so im like what what what and the countess is all nothing which i know is totally something because i say it all the time and i watch her eyes follow jareds cup as he sips his coffee and im all oh fucksocks countess cowboy the fuck up would you then i slipped jareds dagger out of his boot grabbed his hand and poked him in the thumb id like to say right here that the screaming was totally unnecessary and whatever the chinese guy was saying at me from behind the counter was a total overreaction and how does he expect me to understand him when hes talking that fast and in chinese anyway after i squeezed jareds thumb into his cup then a little into my own and gave it to flood everyone calmed down even the chinese guy after jared paid him for two more coffeesand the meeting of the immortal soma drama queens officially came to order it seemed like we waited forever and the countess and flood wouldnt answer any of my questions about the way of the nosferatu it was like they had no idea what they were doing like last year i took advanced foods class which is like cooking for nerds after lunch and so i usually took a nap which was fine because im not even thrilled about regular foods so you know what do i need with like advanced digital hd wifi foods and whatnotso i took the course passfail and slept but then at the end of the semester my mom springs this trap on me likeoh allison ive bought ingredients and you can prepare dinner for ronnie and me to show what you learned in your advanced foods class itll be fun you can pretty much bet that anytime mom uses the phrase itll be fun she is about to drive a stake in funs heart so that it may never rise again which is what happened artichokes who eats something like that i thought it was a weapon so anyway after nine eternities in the diner we went back to the loft where the countess said she had my christmas present waiting when we got to the block the cops and emts were gone and it looked like the coast was clear but when the countess opened the security door to the loft there sitting on the steps was the old vampyre naked well the countess and flood jumped about eighteen feet in the air and im pretty sure i peed a little yes i definitely peed jared just started an asthma attack not the whole attack just the first gasp he just stopped breathing after that so elijah is all i needed to do some laundry let me say right here if i havent made it clear that i have seen as many pale naked oldman parts in the last twentyfour hours to bruise my delicate psyche for a lifetime so dont be surprised if you someday find me wandering the moors at midnight a crazed look in my eye babbling about albino tater tots nesting in brillo pads and being pursued by sagging man ass because that shit can happen when youve been traumatized then flood threw himself against the door and screamed for us to run as he bravely held the door against our ancient vampyre ancestors assaults i was beginning to doubt floods ability to fulfill his duties as my dark lord until he stepped up and saved usvaliant vampyre hero that he isbecause i was starting to think he was just a geek with a passing knowledge of poetry as we ran i could hear elijah saying he peed on my tracksuit as he threw himself against the door or i guessed he did because i didnt turn around until we were two blocks away the countess was all ive got to go back for him but before she even turned around my dark lord came running around the corner and he was all go go go waving at us and we were all where where where and then as the countess threw her arms around flood and started to squeeze the bejeezus out of him and jared was all gasp get a room gasp her watch started beeping then floods watch was beeping too and they were all uhoh so we had like ten minutes to find someplace dark to hide them and no one had any money for a hotel even if we had the time to check in and whatnot so they ran toward a big construction site under the bay bridge and i was thinking i do not want to bury my masters in the construction site what if they got paved it would totally freak them out to get paved and the countess was all how did you get away and the vampyre flood was all the dryer buzzer went off and she was all he let you live because his laundry was done and flood goes lucky huh totally not out of breath even with the running so when we got to the construction site everything was either open or would be when everyone came to work and the countess looked up into the rafters or whatever of the bridge and goes there so there is where we went i grabbed some tarps that were covering this generator thing by the construction site and jared and i climbed up into the rafters with our vampyre sires and helped tuck them in just in time for them to go out but as it got lighter and we saw all the homeless people around jared and i realized that our masters would not be safe here when all the homeless people who lived under the bridge noticed the tarps and our delicate youth or smelled my gummi bears and came after us so jared went to get the garden cart some trash bags and duct tape and hopefully his stepmoms minivan so we can move our masters to a safer realm oh check it before the countess passed into the inky sleep of the undead i was like so what did you get me for christmas and she was all ten thousand dollars and i was like i didnt get you guys anything and she was like thats okay you are our most special favorite minion and its all good which is why i love her and will guard her to the death then she like kissed the vampyre flood and passed out im sure their love will span the ages if jared and i dont fuck up and fry them during transport omg i just remembered we forgot to feed chet chapter twentyfour the halflife of american cheese the cheddar princess of fond du lac was toasted it wasnt just the bursting into flames that had crispied her up more than somewhat physically it was that drews blood tasted like bong water and she was still a little mentally baked from feeding on him shed made the mistake of trying to get the taste out of her mouth with some orange juice and had been rewarded with five minutes of the dry heaves she brushed at her arms and great black flakes of burned skin came away revealing fresh unscarred skin below drews blood was healing her but it appeared that the process was going to take time and like life in general was going to be messy maybe a bath she padded naked into the bathroom which was done all in slabs of granite and green glass and ran her bath while the tub filled she picked the last few burned tatters of her dress away from her skin and dropped them into the toilet there was a swath of gray dust across the black tile the remains of the original owner and she was tracking him all over the bathroom and bedroom suite so she stopped to sweep him into the corner with a towel that had sort of been a surprise in what was turning out to be a long line of surprises when her first victim had disintegrated in her arms two nights ago just as she was getting the hang of blood drinking oops he had been so nice too had picked her up in his mercedes not two minutes after shed stumbled out of lashs apartment building wearing nothing but a leather bustier and thighhigh platform boots it wasnt the first time shed been on the street with her ass hanging outthat wasnt what had thrown her it was waking up feeling like her tits were on fire to see her body rejecting the giant silicone globes she had spent so much money having implanted even as she tried to push them back in with her hands the implants pushed through her skin opening her up like they were aliens hatching out of her she screamed as they broke through and rolled to the floor then lay there quivering on the carpet as she watched her skin mended her breasts tightened and lifted the pain had turned to a tingling but now she felt a squirming in her faceher lips specifically and she wiped her mouth and came away with two sluglike lines of silicone that had been injected years ago it was only then in looking at the grotesque globs of lip filler on her hand that blue realized she wasnt blue at all her palms were baby white her arms her legsshe ran to the bathroom and looked in the mirror an old familiar stranger looked back at herthe cheddar princess of fond du lac she hadnt seen this person since high school the milkywhite skin hair almost white blond still in the severe cut of the blue call girl but looking somewhat like a pageboy cut now even the tattoos shed had done in her early days in vegas were gone im alive she thought then and im going to be alive forever then and im going to need some fucking money she ran to lashs bedroom to where shed left her makeup case it was gone her money was gone she ran out of the apartment and down the steps like she might see a green trail of bills blowing in the wind in the direction her money had escaped but once on the street she headed for the only place she knew toward the marina safeway she got half a block before the mercedes pulled up and the electric window rolled down hey you need a ride its a little chilly out here for that outfit his name had been david and he did something that had to do with moving money around whatever it was it must have paid well he was wearing a twothousanddollar suit and his penthouse apartment on russian hill looked out on golden gate bridge and the massive dome at the palace of fine arts hed given her his coat to wear up in the elevator it was in the elevator that the hunger had come upon her poor david they hadnt even talked price before shed had him bent over the green glass vanity in the bathroom drinking his life away oops the difference she realized between what had happened to her and what had happened to david had been the bloody kiss shed taken from tommy but for a kiss she too would be a pile of dust there should be a song like that she thought at least shed learned before she took her victims now she swept the last of david into the corner then scraped him up with a piece of cardboard from his shirt drawer and dumped him into the wastebasket then she slipped into the tub full of bubbles and began to scrub off her charred skin she wouldnt be able to stay long david had been married or had a girlfriend blue had found a whole closet full of womens clothesexpensive clothes and the woman would probably be back of course this would make a great base of operations maybe she could just wait for the wife to return and sweep her into the wastebasket with david blue leaned back and closed her eyes listened to the bubbles popping the wires humming through the building the traffic out on the streets to fishing boats leaving the wharfthen a sudden intake of breath from the living room then another deeper gasp as the second one found life then a long manscream the dead animals shed collected were coming back to life sit tight boys blue said mamas just going to get cleaned up and put on a new dress then well go get you something to eat and pick up my money she ran a sponge over her arm and smiled she really could be snow white now one dwarf at a time she thought elijah ben sapir had roamed the planet for eight hundred and seventeen years in that time he had seen empires rise and fall miracles and massacres ages of ignorance and ages of enlightenment the full spectrum of mankinds cruelty and kindness he had seen all manner of freakishness from the perversions of nature to the perversions of mind twisted beautiful terrifying he thought he had seen it all but for all of his years and all the acuity of perception enabled by his vampire senses he had never seen a huge shaved cat in a red sweater and sitting there in his newly washed yellow tracksuit still warm from the dryer and smelling of soap and fabric softener he smiled hey kitty the old vampire said the huge cat eyed him suspiciously from across the loft the cat could sense that he was a predator just as elijah could sense that the cat had been prey to a vampire kitty treat im not going to eat you kitty ive fed quite enough it was true elijah was feeling a little bloated from trying to keep the body count up perhaps he should just kill the next few not feed but no the police wouldnt know it was a vampire then and thered be no joy in terrorizing the fledgling he just wasnt ready to feed yet there was someone in the stairwell right now he could hear her breathing and smell patchouli and clove cigarette odor wafting under the door soon enough he thought perhaps well find something for you to eat hey kitty elijah vaulted off the bar stool and began opening cupboards in the third one he found pouches of tender vittles he took a bowl from the cupboard that looked as if it had never been used dumped in the meatish nuggets and shook them around come kitty chet padded a few steps toward the kitchenette then stopped elijah put the bowl down and stepped away i understand kitty i dont like to eat in front of witnesses either but sometimes the vampire heard a car pull up outside a car that hadnt been tuned in a while he cocked his head and listened as the doors opened and slammed four got out he heard their steps on the concrete a female voice hissing at the other three in an instant he was at the window looking down and in spite of himself he smiled again there was no vivid life aura around the four down on the sidewalk no healthy pink glow no black shadow of death the visitors below were not human vampires on one hand an indication of an enormous problemone that just might attract attention that he could ill affordbut on the other exciting in a way that he hadnt felt in a hundred years four against one oh my kitty how ever will i prevail the old vampire ran his tongue over his fangs for all the rage frustration and discomfort hed endured since choosing the redhead as his fledgling he was for the first time in decades not bored he was having the time of his very long life killing time kitty he said slipping into a pair of tommys nikes jody awoke to the smell of clove cigarettes and the crunching of cheese newts there was music screeching tooa whiny guy singing about some girl named ligeia who apparently he missed a great deal because he was talking about dragging her wormworn corpse from the earth and caressing her cheek on a cliff above the sea before throwing himself off with her in his arms the singer sounded a little down and like he could have used a throat lozenge she opened her eyes and was initially blinded until she adjusted to the black light then she yelped jared white wolf was sitting on the bed about two feet away from her shoving handfuls of crunchy cheese newts into his mouth there was a brown rat on his shoulder hi newt crumbs sprayed and fluoresced on the black sheets and clothing hi jody said turning her head to avoid the crumbs this is my room do you like it jody looked around for once not really that thrilled with her vampire nightvision abilities there were disturbing stains glowing on the sheets and almost everything else in the room was black with a patina of vibrant blacklightenhanced dust or lintthere was even lint on the rat its swell she said interesting she thought she was no longer afraid of gang members and street criminals and would even throw down with an eighthundredyearold vampire if need be but rodents still sort of gave her the willies the rats eyes were glowing silver in the black light this is lucifer two jared scooped the animal off his shoulder and held him out despite an attempt at selfcontrol jody climbed backwards halfway up the wall shredding a marilyn manson poster with her nails in the process lucifer one went on to his dark reward when i tried to dye him black sad jody said yeah jared turned the rat and rubbed noses with him i was hoping we could turn him to nosferatu when you bring abby and me into the fold yeah sure thatll happen why am i in your room jared it was the only place we could think to bring you it wasnt safe under the bridge abby had to go so im in charge good for you wheres tommy under the bed she would have known thatwould have heard him breathing if the music wasnt cranked up to coffinsplitting volume could you turn the music down a little please kay jared said he tucked lucifer two in his pocket and spidered across the bed getting a little tangled in his black duster then rolled to the floor and across the room in a commandounderfire move until he got to the stereo where he twisted the dial putting the keening emo singer out of his misery or at least shutting him the fuck up where are we tommys voice from under the bed it smells like gym socks stuffed with groundup hippies were in jareds room jody said she let a hand drop off the edge of the bed tommy took it and she pulled him out he was still partially wrapped in duct tape and garbage bags was i a hostage again we had to cover you up to keep you from burning in the sun well thanks tommy looked at jody who shrugged i was unwrapped when i woke up she said thats because abby says youre the alpha vamp do you guys want to play xbox or watch a dvd i have the crow special collectors edition gee jody said that would be great jared but wed better be going tommy had already picked up the xbox controller but set it down with marked disapproval as if hed notice a little botulism there on the trigger button oh you cant go until the rents go to bed jared giggled high and girlish the door is right by where they watch tv well go out a window jody said jared giggled again then snorted a little then started to honk then took a hit from the inhaler that hung around his neck before he went on theres no window this basement is totally windowless like weve been walled up in here with our own grotesque despair isnt it sweet we could go to mist tommy said go out under the door that would be so cool jared said but my dad put rubber gaskets around the door to contain my disgusting goth stench thats what he calls it my disgusting goth stench although i dont think im really goth more like death punk he just doesnt like cloves or pot or patchouli or gay people philistine tommy said oh would you guys like some cheese newts jared picked the box up off the floor and held it out i can open a vein on them if you need me to he waved the thumb abby had stabbed to prepare their coffee the night before now wrapped in a ragged ball of gauze and medical tape the size of a racquetball im good tommy said jody nodded in agreement although she would love a cup of coffee she didnt think she should ask the kid to stab himself quite so soon she checked her watch what time do your parents go to bed oh around ten youll have plenty of time to stalk the night and whatnot would you like to wash up or something theres a bathroom down here and a washing machine my room was the wine cellar then my dad crashed his car and started twelvestepping so i got this sweet room for my own abby says its dank and disgustingand she says it like its a bad thing i think its just her perky side manifesting i love her but she really can be perky sometimesdont tell her i said so jody shook her head then nudged tommy who shook his head in agreement we wont tell the kid was sort of giving her the creeps she thought she might have lost that ability with blood drinking and the sleep of the undead and all but nope she was getting completely creeped out jared when is abby coming back oh she should be here any minute she went to your loft to feed the cat she went to our loft the loft where elijah was no its okay she went during daylight so he couldnt hurt her its not daylight anymore jody said how do you know jared said no windows duh tommy stoogesmacked his forehead with enough force to render a mortal man unconscious because were awake you fucking moron oh yeah ha jared said the trilling giggle again thats bad huh chapter twentyfive they know not what they do when rivera and cavuto arrived at the safeway they found that the remaining animals had crucified clint on a stainlesssteel chip rack and were shooting him with paintball guns lash unlocked the door to let them in the emperor and his men followed clints screaming sent bummer into a barking fit and the emperor snatched him up and stuffed him headfirst into the pocket of his overcoat that really necessary rivera asked pointing to the paintsplattered martyr we think so lash said he ratted us out lash turned sighted down the passthrough of register three and fired a quick volley of electricblue paintballs into the center of clints chest did he call you again rivera threw a thumb over his shoulder at the emperor the emperor bowed you needed help my son lash nodded considering that the emperor might be right then reeled and fired three quick shots into clints groin just the same motherfucker stop that rivera said he snatched the paintball gun out of lashs hand its cool hes wearing a cup and hes saved said barry who had been firing from register four well he is now cavuto said as he approached the paintsodden evangelical he pulled a serratededge pocket knife from his back pocket and flicked it open and just so you know cavuto added when his back was to them if i turn and theres a single paintball gun pointed in this direction i will be forced to mistake it for a real weapon and unleash lead disneyland on your pathetic asses barry and troy lee immediately dropped their weapons onto the counter so the emperor tells us that you guys have been up to some shit i thought we all agreed that we were going to keep it on the downlow until things calmed down lash looked at his shoes we just had a little party in vegas rivera nodded and you kidnapped tommy flood lash glared over riveras shoulder at the emperor that was a secret really we were saving him from the daylight so the redhead did turn him looked like it he was unconscious at dawn just a little sunlight hit his leg when we were moving him and it started to smoke so you geniuses did what well we tied him to a bed at my apartment and left you left we had to work cavuto had cut the zip ties that held clint to the chip rack and helped him to the register where he sat him down careful not to get any paint on his sport coat forgive them they know not what they do clint said wincing as he touched his paintspattered shoulder because theyre fucking idiots cavuto said handing him a roll of paper towels rivera ignored the scene at the register so you just left him there so ill find him there now right that was a couple of nights ago lash said go on rivera looked at his watch well in the morning he was gone and its awkward for variety lash looked at barrys shoes yeah tying up your friends and torturing them can be that way rivera said we didnt torture him that was her her rivera raised an eyebrow blue a hooker we rented in vegas now were talkin cavuto said she came back with us she wanted us to kidnap tommy or his girlfriend why did she want that to get their share of the art money no she had plenty of money i think she wanted to be a vampire rivera tried to hide his surprise and when we went back to the apartment in the morning tommy was gone and blue was dead we had nothing to do with it barry added but we didnt think youd believe it troy lee said rivera felt a tension headache starting to throb in his temples he closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead so you found a dead woman in your apartment and you didnt think that then might be a good time to call the police well you know dead hooker in your houseembarrassing troy lee said i think weve all been there can i get a high five apparently he couldnt and was thus left hanging thats the weird thing barry said when we went to move her body it was gone but the rug we wrapped her in was still there yeah thats the weird thing cavuto said nudging his partner in the arm heinous fuckery most foul said the emperor ya think said cavuto bummer growled from his pocket sanctuary you guys are not helping rivera said then to lash again you have a description of this hooker lash described blue glossing quickly over the fact that she was blue and spending entirely too much time describing her breasts they were outstanding barry said i kept them rivera turned to troy lee who seemed the most rational of these insane bastards explain please we found silicone implants wrapped up in the rug where we had left blue uhhuh rivera said intact huh troy inquired were they all cut up you think someone cut them out of her and took the body troy asked no rivera said so now youve lost three of your buddies yeah drew jeff and gustavo didnt show up tonight rivera had lash get the addresses of the missing animals from the office and wrote them down in his notebook and you dont think that they might just be out partying we called all the phones checked their houses lash said the door was hanging open at drews and jeff had left half a beer in the driveway which he would never do besides jeff and drew might flake but gustavo wouldnt we even went to his cousins house in oakland looking for him and he did not está en la biblioteca either said barry who for some reason believed that all spanishspeaking people spent a lot of time in the library and had therefore checked there for the intrepid night porter no more bodies that you might have forgotten to mention nuhuh lash said our money was gone though but wed given it all to blue anyway i didnt clint said mutual funds less ten percent for the church you gave six hundred thousand dollars to a hooker rivera almost slapped the kid almost well lash looked at barry and troy lee then trying to suppress a grinyeah rivera shook his head keep the door locked and dont report this to anyone else thats it lash said you arent going to arrest us or anything for what rivera flipped his notebook closed and tucked it into the inside pocket of his suit coat uh i dont know me either said rivera emperor you stay inside tonight with these guys okay as you wish inspector the emperor scratched behind lazaruss ears that okay rivera said to lash lash nodded are we going to be safe he asked rivera stopped looked around at the animals and the emperor and his dogs nope he said lets go nick he turned and walked out the door the foghorn was lowing across the bay as the detectives walked back to their car fort mason just across the street was barely visible in the rolling cloud of gray mist you think the old vampire is hunting the animals cavuto asked someone is rivera said but im not sure its him you think it might be the redhead and the kid could be but i dont think so you know even with the vampire we always had an identifiable mobroken neck and massive blood loss on a victim who turned out to be terminally ill right yeah so if he went after these kids why no bodies so its flood and the redhead and they hide their bodies i think it could be worse than that like worse in a way that well never be able to open the bookstore and may in fact end up doing time for taking the vampires art collection like worse in that the hooker and the missing animals arent dead at all how is that worse then cavuto realized how that was worse they climbed into the car and stared at the windshield for a while without saying anything finally after a full minute cavuto said were fucked yep rivera said the whole city is fucked yep chapter twentysix being the chronicles of abby normal starcrossed lover and tragic fatale omg we are doomed by our forbidden love we are like from different feuding families from the wrong side of the tracks he is like year of the rabbit and i am a leo so we are even starcrossed and its a wellknown fact that rabbits and lions have a strained relationship omfg hes so hot he rocks my stripy socks if we had moors i would so be off brooding upon one my delicate jaw muscles clenched as i stared off into the mist feeling my profound missingness for him i cant believe that san francisco doesnt have a moor everywhere you go we have automated coinoperated robotic bathrooms or frisbee golf courses or some new stainlesssteel epileptic razorblade publicart thingy youd think the least they could do would be to install a decent moorbecause there are a lot more people who like brooding than like frisbee golf im pretty sure moors can be used for other purposes too like hauntings and hiding bodies and family picnics and whatnot thus i am forced to do my brooding at tulleys coffee on market street it took most of the day for us to move the countess and the vampyre flood to jareds room first we had to wrap them up in duct tape and garbage bags to protect them from the sun then get them down the hill from the bay bridge in the garden cart which was totally physically hard and not like taking x and dancing or playing ddr all night more like work then when we were loading them into the minivan these two cops come by and theyre all so what are you doing with your piercings and your magentaonblack hair and what can we do to further repress your creativity blusterblahblah and jared was all nothing all wussy and guiltysounding he had the front end of the countess at the time and he totally just dropped her headfirst on the floorboard of the van so i was like fucktard the countess is going to rip your nads off when she awakens and she might too although when we unwrapped her she seemed unbruised and the cop was all hold it right there kid with his hand on his gun like i was going to go all columbine on his ass or something so i knew it was time for some strategy so i stepped over to the cop and i started whispering like i didnt want jared to hear and im all officer im really embarrassed to even be seen like this im a kappa kappa delta pledge and were doing this hazing thing i wouldnt be caught dead dressed like this but its like the most popular and powerful sorority on campus and the cop is all what about the guy hes not in your sorority and i was all shhhhhhh god you want to hurt her feelings they made her shave her head like that and shes having a hard enough time with that and being totally flatchested frankly i dont think shes going to make it everyone knows that kkds are pretty hello i batted my eyelashes and sort of pushed my basically invisible boobs together with my arms as i have often seen done in music videos and the cop was all can i see your student id and i was like fuck because i didnt know which college would be most likely to have a sorority so i went with my berkeley student id because berkeley is a wellknown bastion of hippie behavior and higher learning in which a sorority girl would probably have to blow like a hundred football players just to keep her gpa up and cops like football so he was all okay but make sure theres plenty of airholes so your friends can breathe and i was all sure thing see ya later cop so when we got the masters to jareds house his stepmom was all so i see you have your little friend with you and jared had to play chilly so he was like yeah we have a school project and stepmonster was so protoorgasmic that jared was with a girl that she didnt even say much when we dragged the bodies through the den jared was all theyre for social studies were doing replicas of egyptian mummies despite the complete embarrassment for me as a fellow woman im grateful that when fathers pick their trophy wives they dont check resumes or sat scores because you couldnt get away with that shit with a woman of normal intelligence but jareds stepmonster was all oh how nice for you would you like some juice fortunately she wasnt around in sixth grade when jared and i actually did our mummy project we got in trouble for charging three hundred dollars worth of ace bandages on my moms visa and my sister ronnie has never fully recovered the feeling in her feet and has an anxiety attack whenever shes in an enclosed space but there was no gangrene or amputations like the doctors threatened and we got a b so i dont see what all the noise and counseling was about anyway after we unwrapped the countess i knew i had to go back and feed chet like i promised the disgusting huge cat guy and since we had now shared a moment of intimacy i felt obligated so we shoved the vampyre flood under jareds bed because jared wanted to sit on the bed and play xbox and its a single bed so anyway i caught the bus on twentyfourth street and got back to the soma with just enough time to feed chet before the old naked vampyre awakened from his undead slumber and i took jareds dagger with me in my biohazard messenger bag because i thought i would dispatch elijah by decapitation as like an extracredit thing for the countess shut up it wasnt like i went down in the basement in my nightgown to check on a blown fuse when the radio clearly had stated that there was a psycho killer on the loose and he was probably in the basement im not stupid i put on jareds motocross boots and his leather jacket and spiked dog collar and tied my hair back so i was totally thunderdomeready how hard could it be to feed the cat and cut the head off a sleeping old guy anyway its not like they wake up i mean we bonked floods head on the steps going to jareds room like eight times and he didnt even groan so i would have been all good and totally in line to be princess of darkness or at least assistant manager of darkness except when i was going up the steps i heard the dryer open and i was all uhoh since when is sundown like at fiveoclock what am i nine years old that i should have sunset at five oclock sunset shouldnt be until like eight or nine oclock right right so im like whoa and i froze and i stood there for like a half an hour not moving at all because i didnt buckle like the top buckles of jareds motocross boots to show my casual badassness so it was like i was wearing fucking sleigh bells i know im a tard so i couldnt move then after about a year i hear this car pull up outside and the doors open and im thinkinghello diversion my old friend and i ran out the security door and right into this tall blond ho and shes dressed all couture and shit like its fashion week at church or something except shes with three of the guys from the hummer limo and shes pale as albino monkey cum and i dont mean in a good way either i mean in a sort of hey myrtle joe cornfed yall let go your stepdaddys penis and get over here and turn the channel to nascar kind of way i mean she had no mascara on at all then she just picks me up by the arms and it hurt a lot and im like kicking and thrashing and all and she throws back her head and here come the fangs and im all no way theyll just let anyfuckingbody into the coven and shes all not you unless you know where my money is and im all step off skank and she goes to bite me and something yanks her back off her feet and i go flying next thing im looking up at the old vampyre in his yellow tracksuit who is holding the blond ho by the hair and the pale limo guys are like coming in on him and tracksuit is all against the rules pet you cant go willynilly turning everyone you meet it attracts the wrong kind of attention and wham he smacks her face on the hood of her mercedes leaving a face print on the paint i swear on the crusty hippie grave of my mother so im all owned beeyatch dog fucking owned you doing a minor booty dance of ownage perhaps in retrospect a bit prematurely i believe hiphop to be the appropriate language for taunting at least until i learn french so they all turn on me and im all awkward so i started backing across the street and crusty old vampyre bounces monkey cums face off the hood of the mercedes a couple of more times then drops her and comes for me the limo guys are all sort of standing by the car like they are waiting for instructions or something then one of them says hey and starts coming my way too so im at the wall across the street and i know i cant run so i reach into my bag and pull jareds dagger and tracksuit starts laughinglike really stoner laughing pointing at my ensemble and i was all shut up fuckface this knife and boots totally go with fishnets except for the countess i realize now that vampyres lose all fashion sense at death but then i hear this really loud thumper coming from down the alley like club music you can feel in your breastbone and this totally racepimped yellow honda comes screaming out of the alley who knew you could even get a car down that alley so the old vampyre has to jump back to avoid being run over and the limo guys jump back and i was kind of hiding my head in my arms but i hear get in and its the cool mangahaired asian guy who id seen outside the loft before and im all what because the music is really loud and hes all get in and im all what and by this time the old vampyre has jumped over the hood of the honda and is about to grab me when theres this flash really more than a flash because it stayed on but there was this blinding light and the music goes down and i hear get in so i look into the light and im like grandma is that you okay i didnt say that im totally fucking with you i looked into the light and saw the mangahaired guy wearing sunglasses and hes waving for me to get in his car and then i see that the old vampyre is charred like wile e coyote after a bad rocket shoes test and so are the limo guys and theyre smoking and limping away from the honda which is shining like a star or something and manga is all now and im all shut up youre not the boss of me but i got in the honda and we totally drifted around the corner and when were a block or two away steve thats his name steve kills the ginormous floodlights in the backseat and i can sort of see again and hes all highintensity ultraviolet and im you too and hes like what are you talking about im like i thought it was a compliment then he smiled like the cutest smile although he was still driving muy intense and totally badass and he goes no that light back there was highintensity ultraviolet it burns them and i was all i knew that and he was like you know that those three guys were vampyres too right and im all duh but i didnt know so im like how did you know then he takes off his shades and puts on these binocular robotglasses things like they wear in siphon assassin six for xbox which i am against because it glorifies violence in the minds of adolescent boys and because its totally impossible to get a decent head shot when your squad mates are bumping into you which needs to be fixed in the next version if im going to be able to do the gray spray on the sentry tower glass so steve is all yeah theyre infrared you can see heat with them and there was no heat coming off anyone back there but you and im like who the fuck are you and hes like my names steve im working on my biochem masters at sf state stop i said please do not further endorken youself to me you have great hair and a car that is most fly and you have just saved me with your mad ninja driving skills so do not sully your heroic hottie image in my mind by further reciting your nerdy scholastic agenda dont tell me what youre studying steve tell me whats in your soul what haunts you and he was like dude you need to cut back on the caffeine which was fair and i know that he was only saying it out of concern for my welfare and whatnot because i think he knew even then that we were destined to be together soul mates so while he drives steve tells me that he was doing some experiments on some bodies for his masters thingy and he found that the cells of the victims were regenerating when you added blood to them and he thinks he can turn them back to normal human cells by using some gene therapy or something and hes been talking to the countess and lord flood about turning them back but the countess is all no way hot mangahaired science guy so i was all why would she want to give up immortality and superpowers and whatnot and he was all i dont know and i was all we should discuss it over coffee and he was like i would love to do that but im already late for work and i was like i thought you were a mad scientist and he was all i work at stereo city and i was like dude you should get a job at metreon selling the bigscreens because they have like the best test couches and he was like okay just like that okay so he wanted to give me a ride home so i would be safe which is so sweet but i needed doublesoy mochaccino to calm my nerves so here i am at tulleys totally brooding but before i got out of the car i was like steve do you have a girlfriend and he was like no i put a lot of time into my studies and i sort of always have and i was like so would you be in the market for a gaijin princess and he was like thats japanese im chinese and im like dont change the subject kung pao what i want to know is if youre ready to spend some upclose and personal time with ninety pounds of barbarian womanflesh sorry i dont know how much that is in kilos i dont know what came over me i was just fizzing over with adrenaline and passion and whatnot i guess i usually dont throw myself at guys but he was so mysterious and smart and hot so he got this big grin and he was like my parents would freak out if they saw you and i was like you live at home and he was all well uh yeah uh kinda uh so i grabbed the pen out of his pocket and wrote my cell number on his arm while he stuttered then when i put the pen back i kissed him sort of hard and totally passionately which i could tell he liked a lot so i pushed him away and slapped him so he wouldnt think i was a slut but not very hard so he wouldnt think i wasnt interested and i was all call me and he was all i will so i was like do not fuck with your hair and he was all okay and i was all be careful and he was all i will you too and i was all oh yeah thanks for the rescue and whatnot and he was all sure thanks for the kiss and so i am his shameless white devil juliet and he is my sweet ninja romeo unless ninjas are also japanese in which case i will have to look some shit up for metaphors because the only thing chinese i can think of right now is dim sum and i believe its disrespectful to refer to your soul mate in terms of finger food fucksocks my cell jared lrz chapter twentyseven well that was fucked up then lucifer two attains the blood sword and takes jared the white as his consort and they hold dominion over all of the kindred for ever and ever said jared white wolf concluding the hourlong plot synopsis of his unwritten epic vampire adventure novel so what do you think i really liked it but i think you may need to work on the characters more tommy said flexing his writer muscles a little it helped him to not think about the thirst that was rising in him jared looked to jody and raised a drawnon eyebrow i think we must get out of this basement right now jody said and if that means murdering your parents and little sisters well you dont make an omelet but what did you think of my novel jared said i think its not a novel its a sexual fantasy about you and your rat it is not thats just the characters names try abbys cell again jared jody was gritting her teeth tell her to get back here tommy said he was starting to get cramps from the blood thirst hold on i get shit reception down here jared took his cell and his rat and headed out the door and up the steps when he was gone tommy turned to jody im really feeling the hunger me too should we maybe just you know sample jared i dont think thats a good idea well tommy said william is in the hospital and we dont know where abby is and i dont see as we have that many options tommy lets just walk out of here whats the worst that can happen we shock jareds parents i get the feeling they may be desensitized thats fine but then where do we go tomorrow a hotel i guess if we get the money we can have abby guard the door to keep the maid from coming in and frying us tommy brightened hey maybe abby grabbed some money from the loft abby might not even be alive jody said more than just irritation in her voice now you know how elijah was going to kill you to fuck with me if hes been watching us he has to know about abby shell be next we should have left here right away i feel horrible for leaving her out there alone she went right to him tommy cradled his head in hands i hate this jody why did you do this to me it could have worked i could have looked out for you and had a real life now i just live from feeding to feeding putting people in danger everyone wants to kill us or take something from us im from indiana they dont prepare us for this kind of thing in the midwest jody slid off the bed to the floor and sat next to him put her arm around his shoulders its not like that tommy were like gods sure we have to hunt but if you let go to the predator part of you youll lose that anxious feeling you have to feel the power of it power what power i was ready to have the rat as a snack well you can have the rat if you need him because that little fucker is creepy tommy pulled away from her dont jared came through the door then pumping his inhaler oh my god oh my god she met the hottest guy who is a ninja and theyre like totally into each other and those guys you told us about that kidnapped you a bunch of them are vampires now and theres a tall woman vampire too who tried to bite abs and abby totally took them all on and burned them up with some kind of portable sunlight oh my god shes so awesome i wish i had balls like her where is she now jody asked shes having a mochaccino at tulleys on market i loaned her like twenty dollars which shes going to pay me back out of her christmas bonus youre giving her hey do i get a christmas bonus because call her and tell her to stay right where she is jody said were on our way we are tommy said they could get out of here find aa donor no not you jody said we are she patted jared on the shoulder careful not to get her hand near the rat we are jared said yes jared you have to come out to your parents you have to confess that youve had a girl in your room all day well walk up and you can just introduce me as your girlfriend okay i guess you might want to borrow some eyeliner and touch up your lipstick a little first okay i will slap the gloom off of you rat shagger jody said with a smile that was just a few degrees below being warm over his very long life elijah ben sapir had been hunted beaten tortured drowned impaled imprisoned and even burned on two occasionstolerance for those who live off the lifeblood of others being what it isbut in eight centuries this was the first time he had been flashfried by a trickedout honda despite the novelty of it when novelty had just become his new joy he figured that if he went another eight hundred years before it happened again hed be okay creeping down a soma alley snatching rats from behind dumpsters and draining them to dust just so he could heal himself enough to hunt a real victim was serving as an abject lesson as to why he and his kind were sworn to remain concealed it was bound to happen the application of new technology for the detection and destruction of vampires hadnt he adopted technology to protect himself his selfpiloting yacht with its sensors and sealed vault had served him as well as any guarded castle but hed forgotten the rulenot forgotten really but ignored itdeciding to indulge in hope to the point of faith that he would always prevail so some clever cow had figured out how to package sunlight and unleash it upon his arrogant carcass the cow would never have found the solution had the vampire not shown him the problem humbled was elijah and angry and hungry and a little sad because he had loved his yellow tracksuit and now it was but beads of blackened polyester burned into his skin he picked at them as he listened for prey tucked between a dumpster and a white stepvan full of bread racks here came one nowfat enough to complete the healing elijah could tell by the weight of his step the back door of the bakery opened and the rotund baker stepped out and shook a cigarette out of his pack his life aura was pink and healthy his heart thumped strong and would for a long time if elijah did not suck it dry normally he only took the sick and the weak those who were short for the grave anyway but this was a desperate time he leapt on the big mans back and rode him to the ground catching his scream in one hand using the other to hit pressure points in his neck that had the baker unconscious in two seconds elijah drank listening to his blackened skin crackle slough and heal even as the baker still breathed there would be no neck snap no body to find this time he dumped the dust from the bakers clothes and slipped into them his white nikes were the only survivors of his previous outfit so he threw the bakers clogs into the dumpster along with his wallet pocketed the cash and took off dressed in white from head to foot the vampire smiled to himself not with joy but with the grim irony of the situation people often speak of things coming to them in a flash of inspiration but the cliché held new meaning for elijah the flash meant that the game was over that his foray into human desire even for revenge had gone far enough and now it was time for damage control they all had to die he wouldnt enjoy killing her not her after being burned up for the second time in two days blue was ready for a healing massacrea bloodbathbut the animals had stopped her citing sissy ethical reasons like murder was you know wrong youre burned up blue said this is no time to develop a conscience where was your conscience when you were making me do you a dozen times a day huh thats different said drew you were in on it yeah added jeff and we paid you no one was hurt amiga gustavo added blue broke off some charred crust coming over the seat of the mercedes at gustavo who was in the passenger seat drew dragged her back into her seat by her hips she crossed her arms and pouted huffing out little flakes of ash in exasperation they were supposed to be doing her bidding they were supposed to be her sevenwell threedwarves you shut the fuck up bean town i was hurt i am hurt look at me they didnt look at her they were all burnt black from the waist up in the front at least their shirts hung on them in charred shreds the linen dress that blue had been wearing had incinerated almost completely she was wearing only her panties and a severely singed bra her face was still a bit lopsided from where elijah had banged it on the car hood we didnt do this blue drew said blue smacked him repeatedly in the head a halfdozen times knocking off most of one of his charred ears and all of the carbon strands that were what was left of his hair the tip of her little finger broke off in the process at which point she sat back and growled like a beaten dog we need blood to heal blue said lots of it i know jeff said the charred power forward was driving im takin care of it you just passed five perfectly good teenagers blue said where the fuck are you going somewhere where the donors can handle our action jeff said well were broke until you get my money back so your donors better have some fucking cash we cant exactly go into a bar in the financial district drew said not looking like this oh like theyd let you dirtbags in at your best blue found that being burnt up put her on edge more than normal shed tried taking a valium left by the mercedes guy just like drew and the other had downed handfuls of his painkillers only to find their vampire systems rejected them with extreme violence were here jeff said pulling the mercedes into a wide public parking lot youre fucking kidding me blue said the zoo tommy waited half an hour before he called jodys cell only to get a dropped signal then voice mail he called three more times in the next half hour played two rounds of gunning for nuns xtreme on jareds xbox called abbys cell only to get voice mail then made his first sincere attempt at turning to mist jody had said it was a mental thing you just had to see yourself as mist force yourself to mist like flexing a muscle she had said once youve done it once you just know how it feels and you can do it again like getting up on water skis it wasnt that he could get out of the basement undetected it was what jody had said about being in the mist statethat time sort of just glided like you were in a dream it was the only reason she said that she hadnt beaten him senseless for having her bronzed when you were mist it just wasnt all that bad maybe if he could turn to mist he could pass the time without driving himself nuts with worry for all his mental flexing all he got was a flatulent toot that sent him diving for the door and fanning the room out with it he was truly a foul dead thingfouler than hed even guessed he looked for paint peeling off the walls that was it he was not a kid hiding in his friends basement he was awhat did abby call it he was one of the anointed a prince of the night he was going to walk out of here right past the family and if he had to take them out well so be it that would teach jody for leaving him behind and turning her phone off how do you feel now red huh massacred dismembered family huh glad you saved your anytime minutes now he tramped up the steps and into jareds parents family room hi jareds father said tommy had expected a bit of a monster based on jareds description of his father instead what he saw was a bit of an accountant he was about fortyfive in pretty good shape holding a little girl on his lap who was coloring a picture of a pony another little girl who looked about the same age was coloring on the floor at his feet hi tommy said you must be the vampire flood jareds dad said with a bit of a knowing smile uh well kinda it showed he could no longer hide among the humans it must be because it had been so long since he had fed sort of a weak ensemble dont you think jareds dad said weak repeated the little girl without looking up from her pony huh tommy inquired for a vampire jeans sneakers and flannel tommy looked at his clothes black jeans he pointed out shouldnt this guy be cowering in fear maybe begging tommy not to put his little daughter in a sack for his vampire brides okay i suppose times change you know that jared and his girlfriend went up to tulleys on market to meet abby right his girlfriend jody right said dad cute girl not as many piercings as i expected but were just happy shes a girl an attractive blond woman in her late twenties came into the room carrying a tray with carrot and celery sticks on it oh hi she said dazzling a smile at tommy you must be the vampire flood hi im emily would you like some crudites youre welcome to stay for dinner were having mac and cheese it was the girls night to pick i should drink her blood and put her kids in a sack tommy thought but his vicious predator nature was overcome by his midwestern upbringing so instead he said thank you very much emily but i really should be going if im going to catch up to jared and jody well okay then said the woman girls say goodbye to the vampire flood goodbye the vampire flood the girls sang in chorus uh bye tommy bolted out of the room then back in again wheres the door everyone pointed through the kitchen whence jareds stepmonster had just come he ran through the kitchen and out the door then stood with his back against the minivan in the drive trying to catch his breath that was fucked up he gasped then realized that he wasnt out of breath from exertion at all he was having an anxiety attack that was really really fucked up chapter twentyeight wallflowers of the night it was a lot like trying to get your courage up to ask a girl to dance except that in this case it wasnt so much the fear of rejection or that youd be awkward and embarrass yourself although that was a consideration but that whoever you picked was going to be reduced to dust which was somewhat more significant than trampling her toes tommy stood on castro street looking for his next victim his first victim really he was tired of being the apprentice if jody was going to just leave him in the basement because he wasnt vampire enough for her then maybe hed have to become like her maybe hed learn about this predator nature she talked about maybe like that guy in the basement in the phantom of the opera he would have to hear the music of the night he wasnt sure what had happened to the basement guy hed gone to see the movie with a girl from his high school but had to leave halfway through to keep from taking his own life it hadnt been a good date there were plenty of people out on the street even at this hour but none of them screamed victim there were no women in lowcut dresses who had just turned an ankle there were no girls in negligees running down the street glancing back over their shoulders there were in fact not many girls at all lots of guys lots he reckoned that it wasnt really necessary that he pick a woman after all hed fed off of william and chet both of whom were male but this was different this was really becoming the hunter and despite his hunger there was no little bit of revenge in his decision to bite someone so it had to be a girl he had to get back at jody for ditching him at jareds he had to show her that she wasnt the only vein in the circulatory system or whatever the few women he saw were so healthy with big bright pink life auras around them and werent alone either he had to get someone alone frustrated he backed down the alley and started pacing back and forth after a short time he took a run at the wall ran up ten feet or so then turned and ran back across the alley and up the other wall about ten feet then back and up the wall fifteen feetlike a skateboarder working a halfpipe he ran back and forth feeling the strength and speed of what he wasfeeling his confidence rise i am a superior being he thought i am a friggin god then his foot went through a window and he sank up to his crotch into the building then dangled over the alley upside down three stories up flailing stupid place for a window he thought then he saw her she was sort of tall but dressed in a red evening gown with athletic curves and long red hair that had been lacquered into ringlets she was perfect and she was coming down the alley it was like hed ordered her from an old hammer film to be the hapless victim sweet so he was hanging upside down by one leg that could be a tactic he felt his fangs extending and he drooled a little which hit her on the shoulder she started a little and thats when he made his move hed always loved the scene in dracula where jonathan harker sees the count climbing facedown down the castle walls and thinks hey something is up here tommy had pleaded with jody to try it but she never would so this was his chance he pulled himself out of the window hooked his fingers between the bricks and began his climb and dropped thirty feet to the alley landing flat on his back ouch upon tommys impact his intended victim had let out a very masculine scream jumped three feet straight up and came down sideways on her high heels she knelt over him rubbing her ankle cheesy christ on a cracker darlin where did you come from southern and deep slipped tommy said youre a man huh well lets say that is a street which i have walked to which i do not wish to return youre very pretty tommy said sweet of you to say he tossed his hair a bit you want i should call an ambulance no no thanks ill be okay what were you doing up there anyway conveniently tommy was still staring straight up at the sky framed by the buildings and he could see that she thought hed fallen from the roof listening for the music of the night were you watching the dvd i heard people tried to kill themselves rather than sit through it something like that honey just push pause just push pause ill remember that thanks you sure you dont want me to call someone no no ill call someone as soon as i catch my breath tommy reached into his back pocket and pulled out a handful of broken plastic and wires that had once been his cell phone okay then yall take care she stood turned and walked slowly out of the alley trying not to limp hey miss tommy called after him im not gay course you arent darlin i rule the night she waved without looking as she rounded the corner redheads he growled he could feel his broken ribs knitting together it wasnt pleasant as soon as they were healed enough it was back to jareds house to eat the rat move up the food chain slowly maybe an hour later the torn and tattered vampire flood limped up the driveway to jareds house abby and jared were smoking in the driveway lord flood abby said what are you doing here you look like someone opened a whole sixpack of whupass on you jared said you shut up how did your family know i was a vampire well certainly not from your wardrobe jared i am all busted up and im feeling hungry and a little fragile now answer my question or i will go inside and murder your family feed on their blood step on your rat and break your xbox whoa drama queen much fine tommy said he shrugged which hurt and headed for the kitchen door find me a sack big enough for your two little sisters jared jumped in front of him i told them we were playing vampire the masquerade and that your part was the vampire flood abby nodded we used to play all the time before we actually became minions its like dungeons and dragons but way cooler jared said okay tommy nodded which hurt there they were two perfectly healthy donors from whom he could feed who would be willing and he was hurt and he needed to feed in order to heal still he couldnt ask he was staring at abbys neck then looked away when she appeared to notice wheres jody shell be here soon abby said she sent us back to find you we called but your cell wasnt on where is she she went to the new loft she said shed bring some money and what was left of williams blood back for you you can stay in a hotel jared and i can guard you she went to the loft where elijah is oh thats not a problem abby said my samurai prince burned him up while rescuing me from the blond vampire ho and her grocerystore vamplets tommy looked at jared splain please just knock drew said theyll unlock it for you youre almost naked they stood by the front door of the marina safeway drew had healed a little from his burns but was still bald and covered with a dusting of soot blue was completely healed but wore only her charred underwear and the beige high heels that had looked so lovely with her linen dress since the first time she took the stage in high heels and a bikini back in her first fond du lac beauty pageant right through her career stripping and then bonking for dollars she thought the whole idea of high heels and underwear patently absurd yet here she was rich powerful and immortalyet still standing around wearing high heels and underwear this time however there was some rationale for the outfit beyond that it floated some horndogs hormonal boat at the zoo while the animals had pursued their prey among animals she had found two night watchmen each isolated on his rounds and took them down unfortunately she hadnt taken their clothing because she didnt want to have to explain to the animals why she was dressed like a night watchman since they had suddenly decided to take the moral high ground on slaughter the animals had not fared so well drew was the only one in better shape than when theyd first been burned hed gone for a llama because hed always thought they were cute he was able to feed only a little however before he was bitten and spat upon and decided to call it a night gustavo had gone for a zebra under the mistaken assumption that his experience with horses as a boy in mexico would somehow give him an edge in handling the african equine consequently he had been summarily stomped and now had several broken bones including a nasty compound fracture of one leg in addition to being burned up jeff the basketball failure was still embarrassed about having been taken down by a girl and so picked a jungle cat as his victim thinking that he would take on the strength and speed of his donor his right arm was attached only by a few muscles and much of that shoulder was gone altogether his skin was still crusty black from the waist up fuck knocking said blue the big front window had only that day been replaced but she was going to lead her charge right through it get in find them and take them she found she was falling back on her dominatrix experience a lot lately which was not a skill in which she had complete confidence having only recently been killed while performing it she took three quick steps up snatched up the steelreinforced trash can that jody had used on the window only days ago and flung it underhanded with all her strength the can rocketed through the air bounced off the new doubleimpactresistant plexiglas window and knocked blue on her ass blue climbed to her feet without making any eye contact with her undead posse dusted off her bottom then snapped her newly broken nose back into place well knock then fuckstick she said to drew knock knock knock we dont have all night chapter twentynine dont you hate running into your ex as soon as she unlocked the new lofts security door from the street jody smelled blood burned flesh and shampoo a case of the willies that felt like an electric serpent slithered up her spine she went up the stairs light on the balls of her feet ready she heard every tick in the apartment the refrigerator motor floorboards shifting the huge cat chet snoring in the bedroom and of course someone breathing the lights were off he was sitting in a canvas slingback chair barefoot in a pair of tommys jeans and a tshirt drying his hair with a towel jody stopped by the kitchen fledgling said the vampire im always pleasantly surprised when i am reminded of how lovely you are surprises are rare at my age must have surprised the fuck out of you to have that honda toast you then huh she felt herself tightening down the electric jangle channeling itself into an awareness an edge it wasnt fear anymore it was readiness an unpleasant one yes i assume your little servant is safe for now well you know she was winded for a few minutes from kicking your ass but she is just a little girl the vampire laughed and jody couldnt help but smile she went to the windows at the front of the loft and opened them smells like burned meat in here shell have to go you know said the vampire still smiling no she wont jody turned on her heel faced him of course she will all of them but you im quite tired of being alone little one you can come away with me just as we planned jody was stunned at his density i was lying to you elijah i never intended to go away with you i was just pretending to find out how to be a vampire what were you going to do the next night thenif your pet hadnt bronzed us i mean i thought id send you away no you didnt i thought id let the animals kill you like they were going to anyway no you didnt i dont know the edge was slipping i dont know maybe she was going to go with him she had felt so alone so lost ah so here we are again lets pretend like all this unpleasantness hasnt happened and its the next night and here we are just the two of us the only ones of our kind what will you do jody but we arent the only ones of our kind we are the only ones you need worry about you do know that you are the first new vampire in a hundred years jody tried not to show her surprise how lucky for me she said oh youre not the only one ive turned ive turned many youre the only one who could weather the change with her mind intact the others had to be well decommissioned you killed them yes but not you help me clean up and then well leave together clean up there are certain rules love rules that i set down myself and the first of them is make no more vampires yet youve let loose a storm of fledglings and they all have to be cleaned up including your boy pet make no more what about me you made me i didnt expect you to survive love i thought you would be an amusement a break in monotony an interlude but you distinguished yourself and now you want me to run off with you well live like royalty i have resources you couldnt imagine youre wearing stolen jeans sugar daddy well yes i will have to make my way to one of my caches i have an idea jody said and this was really the reason she had come here by herself knowing that he would be here or at least hoping how about i give you enough money to get you out of town and you do that just like we promised rivera and cavuto you leave me alone you leave tommy alone you just leave elijah stood now tossed the towel on the chair and moved to her so quickly that she could barely even see him move art music literature said elijah desire passion powerthe best of man and the best of beast together you would say no to that he put his hand on her cheek and she let him love jody said looking into his eyesthey reflected like drops of mercury in her night vision for fairy tales we are the stuff from which nightmares are made make nightmares with me wow nice offer cant imagine why you havent had any takers for a hundred years jody grabbed his wrist if he wouldnt leave she could take him she was a vampire too the vampire had been smiling but his smile changed aspect going from pleased to predatory so be it then his hand was at her neck in an instant she didnt see him move or have a chance to react suddenly she couldnt move her arms or legs and there was an intense pain behind her ear and under her jaw she screamed releasing a sound she couldnt imagine coming out of a human more like something youd hear from a tortured cat he clamped his other hand over her mouth i didnt teach you everything in our one night together love she watched helplessly as he tossed his head back and his fangs unsheathed troy lee squared off against drew at the end of the dogfood aisle two short fighting swords in hand bring it stoner troy lee said he spun the swords drew fell into a crouch by the dishwashing liquids im fast now drew said uhhuh troy said he whipped the swords through the air in a deadly fanning motion hed been training since he was a child he wasnt afraid especially of drew hey came a womans voice from right beside him troy lee looked over lightning quick just in time to register what looked like a full moon coming at his face there was a loud clang and troy was nearly flipped over backwards when the iron skillet hit him in the forehead blue let it drop to her side and grinned at drew ive always wanted to do that housewares used to be my aisle drew said take him said blue let him drink some of your blood before he dies she headed toward a commotion in the can aisle save some boys mamas got a broken nose that needs to heal jody felt her own fangs extend and her kneecaps quiver as elijah fed on her but otherwise she couldnt move how could she have been so stupid he was eight hundred years oldof course he hadnt taught her everything of course he was stronger than she wasshe was stronger than tommy and she had only been a vampire a couple of months longer than he had if she could stay conscious maybe when he stopped feeding she could make her move could he reduce her to dust like a human or would he have to do something else stupid stupid stupid why didnt she know all of this why wasnt she acting on instinct where was the predator mind when you needed it her vision started to tunnel downshe was losing consciousness she could hear rapid footsteps outside though first below then across the street then below again elijah heard them too and he loosened his grip for an instant but before she could twist away his fingers dug into her neck and jaw again then a black blur flew through the window and she heard something thud on the floor over by the kitchen there was another loud thud and elijah released her and she fell to the floor she tried to push herself up but something was thrown over her and she heard a buzzing sound she heard screaming and smelled burning flesh glass breaking then someone was lifting her carrying her she couldnt move or even fight anymore she let go let herself float away but the last thing she heard was a girls voice saying did you feed chet the emperor sat on the dock of the st francis yacht club watching the fog wash over the breakwater hed gone against the advice of the homicide detectives and had left the grocery store it was his city and it was his place to take the battle to its attackers he had cowered in fear long enough his wickedly pointed sword lay on the dock at his side the men bummer and lazarus were sleeping in a fuzzy pile at his back ah gentle warriors how do we engage in battle when our enemy moves with such elegant stealth perhaps we should return to the safeway and help defend bummers left ear twitched and he let out a muffled ruff in his sleep a thick bank of fog was moving down from the opening in the breakwater and it caught the emperors attention because it appeared to be moving across the wind from the west yes it was indeedthe cold breeze was coming straight over the breakwater from the north the fog bank bubbled thick as it moved tendrils reached out and then were reabsorbed like the false feet of some crawling creature the emperor climbed to his feet and roused the men snatched bummer up before the sleepy terrier could get his bearings and headed toward the clubhouse with lazarus at his heels he crouched in a shadow by the entrance to the restrooms holding the hounds as he watched the fog bank enveloped the end of the dock paused then dissipated as if a fan had been turned on it and three tall figures stood on the dock a man and two women they wore long coats cashmere the emperor thought but he couldnt for the life of him remember why he might know that they moved down the dock toward him as if they were floating the emperor could see their outlines in the moonlightjawlines and cheekbones that looked as if theyd been chiseled square shoulders and narrow hips they might have been brother and sisters except one of the women was of african descent the other looked like she might be italian or greek the man was a head taller than the women and looked nordic perhaps german with closecropped white hair all were as pale as bleached bone as they passed him the emperor pulled the hounds closer and bummer let out a threatening ruff they stopped the man turned how long have you been here he asked forever i think said the emperor the man smiled and nodded then turned and was on his way i know how you feel he said without looking back gustavo and jeff found barry hiding in the shelves among the toiletpaper packages when they got close barry burst out of the tp and made a run for the end of the aisle pulling napkins aluminum foil garbage bags and plastic silverware off the shelves as he went to slow his pursuers gustavo went down first slipping on a package of plastic forks jeff highstepped through the obstacles and was right on barrys ass until he was almost to the end of the aisle and lash stepped out holding one of barrys spearguns down lash barked and barry hit the tile on his chest and slid there was a pneumatic hiss and the heavy stainless spear thudded into jeffs sternum and blew him back off his feet ow goddammit said the power forward clutching at the spear and trying to pull it out of his chest gustavo climbed to his feet ran to jeff and started yanking on the spear lash handed barry a fourfootlong stick with a blunt metal tip on it and fitted another spear into the gun that the last one barry asked lash nodded wheres clint just then the tall blond woman appeared at the far end of the aisle dragging an unconscious clint by his collar a wide bloodstain ran from her chin to her crotch and they could see her fangs even from this distance bad boys leaving your bornagain lying on the floor where people can trip over him she dropped clint on his face and headed up the aisle toward them in long slow strides lash bolted barry right behind them through the canvas doors into the back room and into the walkin dairy cooler it was like a long hallway with plastic milk boxes stacked on one side and the glass dairy cases on the other they pushed stacks of heavy onegallon milk boxes in front of the door then leaned with their backs against the back of the cooler watching the store through the clear cooler doors in the dairy case over the cartons of yogurt and cottage cheese whats that shes carrying barry asked a frying pan lash said oh barry said sorry i let her in she was almost naked how could you have known well when she claimed she had a nookygram for my birthday i should have figured something was up your birthdays like in march isnt it yeah lash slapped barry hard once on his bare scalp then reaimed the speargun over the yogurts i deserved that barry said think that spear hit jeffs heart had to its a foot through his sternum he doesnt seem dead guess that means head shot barry shook his head you want me to try nah if i miss you have the bang stick lash nodded at the long stick barry was holding at port arms essentially it was a twelvegauge shotgun shell on the end of a stick used for killing sharks you poked them with it and the shotgun shell fired into them at pointblank range ill bet she doesnt even know what it is get it right lash said blow her fucking brains out they looked at each other as they heard the refrigeration compressors and fans wind down then the lights went out were fucked lash said yep barry agreed chapter thirty being the chronicles of abby normal dark and mysterious goddess of forbidden love dont judge me i have looked death in the face and made him my bitch i did what i did out of love and i dont want to sound conceited but omg we are heroes and when i say we i mean us had i told you before you would have called me losah pronounced me perky and cute beyond redemption but now that i am secure in my own nefarious love lair and whatnot i can at last confess that in my naive youth my favorite literary character was not the tentacled horror cthulu from lovecraft as i previously stated in ap english but in fact pippi longstocking before you condemn me for my pippism check it out pippi drank a lot of coffee because like me she was wise pippi had unnaturally red hair as i myself have had upon occasion pippi often wore long stripy socks as yours truly has been known to do pippi had superhuman strength it could happen pippi kicked ass not unlike your humble narrator pippi was a kid who lived without parents in her own house go girl with a monkey havent you always wanted a monkey what longstockings did not have was the coolest cyberninjasexmagic boyfriend to ever save the world and whatnot props to pip but girlfriend needed some yang to rock her yin steve my darling my love my heart is aflame but omfg steve i grieve that youre name is so fucking lame i call him foo dog because he guards the gate of my temple if you know what i mean im wearing the jacket he made me right now i had it on when they came for me but thats not the thing the thing is i didnt save myself i saved love so that night after i told the countess how my sweet foo dog saved me from the vampyre the countess said she was going to go back to the loft to get some money and feed chet and get the last of williams blood for lord flood for their love is truly eternal and jared and i were like well go too but the countess sent us back to liberate the vampyre flood from jareds basement and his hideous family so we were all well okay but when we got to jareds house flood was totally gone and then stevei mean foo dogcalled me and he was all im getting off work early i dont want to leave you out there unprotected so i told him where we were then lord flood comes walking out of the dark and hes all what what what and im all the countess went back to the loft and hes all she is in danger we must away and i was like chill thee thus for my sweet loveninja is on the way in his fly ride so flood was like kay i see now that my attraction to the vampyre flood was nothing more than childish infatuation never to be requited because he had eyes only for the countess so it was a little awkward when steve showed up and i had to chill the lord flood and make him sit in the backseat to show that my real affections were with foo dog who was formerly known as steve and when we got to the loft the windows were open but there were no lights on and flood had us drive a block past then we got out and he walked back then he runs up and hes like elijahs up there hes got her and im all then go get her and steve is like no ill go get her and he pulls this long coat out of the trunk its all covered with warts or something and im like nice coat but you know vampyre and steve is like theyre uv leds like the lights we burned the vampires with before and im like sweet so steve starts to put the coat on and flood stops him and goes hell hear you coming up the stairs ill go and steve is all you cant it will burn you too and flood is all no it wont so they are like five minutes behind the car putting together this übercool ensem of like an old gas mask and a hoodie and fullon gloves and everything until flood is totally covered wearing the long coat with the glass warts all over it looking like one of the cenobites from hellraiser and steve is like dont hit the switch until you know shes covered and he hands flood like a black rubber tarp and a baseball bat which totally sucked the cool right out of the ensem but i guess was necessary then just when im about to ask how hes going to get in without being heard we hear the countess scream and flood runs across the street and about halfway up the side of the building then turns and runs down it then across the street up the side of his building and goes through the window feet fucking first and im like whoa and steve and jared are like whoa and a second later we hear a thumping and purple light comes on in the loft windows and the old vampyre comes crashing through the windows on fucking fire falling like a comet and he lands on his feet in the middle of the street hisses once and looks at us and thats when steve holds up one of his uv floodlights and the vampyre fucking scrams down the alley across the street so fast that he was just a blur next thing flood is coming out of the building carrying the countess who is wrapped in the black rubber tarp and is totally roofied like a limp rag and steves all get her in the car and im like did you feed chet and jared is like hello abby the other vampyres so im like shut up i know so we all piled into steves car and we took flood and the countess to a hotel off up on van ness which steve paid for with his visa which was generous and mature of him it was one of those motels where you have your own entrance to the parking lot so they dont see you in the hallway so flood carried the countess up to the room and we carried some stuff that steve had packed up in the trunk of his car it was so sad flood just stroked the countesss cheek and tried to get her to wake up but she wouldnt and he was all abby she needs to feed i wouldnt ask but hes done something to her shes hurt and i would have totally done it but steve pulled me back and he picks up this playmate cooler that he had us bring up and he pulls out these pouches of blood and he hands them to flood and says i took them from the university hospital they could kick me out of school for this and flood is all thanks and he bites a hole in one of the pouches and squeezes it on the countesss lips and thats when i started to cry there were like four pouches and when he was going for the last one steve was like you need to drink that one and flood was like no way its for her and steve was like you know you do so flood like nodded and drank the last one himself and then he just sat there by her stroking her hair then steve was like tommy you know i can reverse your vampirism im pretty sure the process works and flood just looked at him and nodded it was so sad and then the countess started to moan and she opened her eyes and she saw the vampyre flood and she was all hey baby just like that and i started crying again like a big wuss and steve took jared and me out to the car to give them some space and steve was like i made this for you from my jacket and he put this leather motorcycle jacket on me that was covered with those glass led thingies it was kinda heavy because there were batteries built into the padding but cool and he was all this will keep you safe the switch is in the snap on the left cuff just squeeze it and the lights will come on they wont hurt you but you should wear sunglasses to protect your retinas then he put a pair of totally cyber wraparound sunglasses on me and kissed me and i kissed him back hard with major tongue and finally he pulled away as gentle as a butterfly so then i slapped him so he wouldnt think i was a slut but so he wouldnt think i was being frigid i sort of jumped on him and wrapped my legs around him and sort of accidentally rode him to the ground and was accidentally kind of dryhumping him on the pavement when the lights on my jacket came on and people looked out their hotel windows and whatnot so jared ended our special romantic moment by hitting my light switch and dragging me off and i was all you are the man foo and he was all huh because i hadnt told him yet that his new name was foo dog but then he said he actually had to get home and check in or his parents would freak out and said to watch the masters until i got back if i got a chance try to talk them into being converted so we made out on the hood of the honda for a while and he drove off into nights cold loneliness like the superhero that he is the effect was ruined kind of in that jared caught a ride with him so i went back upstairs and sat at the foot of the masters bed keeping guard and listening to them they were talking softly but i could hear them the vampyre flood was all maybe we should give it a try and the countess was all what the cure tommy it cant work youve seen what i can do you know what you can do this isnt biology this is magic maybe its not maybe its science we dont know yet it doesnt matter we dont even know if it works we should try why would we try tommy youve only been immortal for a couple of weeks do you want to give up the power thei dont knowthe command over your world wellyes you do yeah i dont like it jody i dont like being afraid all the time i dont like being alone i dont like being a killer that woman was torturing you tommy thats never going to happen again thats wasnt the problem id get over her the problem was that i liked it i liked it then the countess was quiet for a while and i thought it might be dawn or something but i peeked over the edge of the bed and she was just staring into his eyes she looked over at me hey girlie girl the countess said and she smiled at me and it felt like a gift or something it was like real then she took her watch off and threw it to me at the end of the bed that has an automatic almanac in ithow about you set the alarm to go off about twenty minutes before sunset so you dont get caught out again okay and i was going to tell her about the jacket that foo made for me but i kind of couldnt talk so i just nodded and put the watch on and slid back down to the floor then i heard the countess go you arent alone im here we can go where no one knows us no one is chasing us and ill always be here for you and he goes i know i mean alone from everyone else separate i want to be human not some foul dead thing i thought you wanted to be special i do but i want to be human specialbecause of something i did then it was quiet for a while and finally the countess goes i love it tommy im not afraid all the time like you just the opposite i didnt realize how afraid i used to be until i became like this i like walking the street knowing that im the alpha animal hearing and seeing and smelling everything being part of everything i like it i wanted to share that with you its okay you couldnt have known i dont want to be alone either thats why i turned you i love you then the alarm went off on lord floods watch and he shut it off then hes all we cant go back to the way it was before i mean where i look after you its not the same world tommy you know that now we were in the same room in different worlds okay then i love you jody i love you too goes the countess then they didnt say anything for a long time and when my new watch showed that the sun was up i looked and they were lying there holding each other and i could see the red stains on the pillow from their tears and i was like oh hell no chapter thirtyone being the chronicles of abby normal not unlike the toaster i control the darkness so i slept a little that day and talked to my sweet loveninja foo a couple of times on the phone then he came over and we left jared with some blood for lord flood and the countess when they awoke and motored to the loft it took like an hour to clean up all the broken glass and ash and stuff from the night before we had just finished cleaning and counting the money and making out and whatnot when the alarm went off on the countesss watch and i was like dude im not ready and he was all dude you are more ready than anyone ive ever known and i was all omg i am so going to sex you to death if we live through this and then he was all bashful and pretended to be doing something technical so we were ready then like an hour after sundown i heard them coming i was at the kitchen counter when the security door downstairs opened and when i turned around they were just like there lord flood called them the animals but now they were kind of the roadkill and i like touched the snap on my uv jacket just to make sure it was there so i was all hey vampyre scum and the formerly black and now gray one who was like their leader was all up in my grille like we need the money where is the money and i was like step off undeadtard theres no money and he was like dont fuck with us flood and the redhead took like six hundred grand from my apartment and i was all actually its like five hundred and eightythree thousand eight hundred and fiftyeight and he was all give it and all seven of them were like gathering around meeven the bornagain one the countess had thrashedlike they were going to do the massive gangsuck on me so i had my finger on my light button all the time in case i needed to flashfry the motherfuckers but i stayed chilly and i was like are you high and he was all no im not high no one is high and they all started whining and whatnot all we cant even take a bong hit we cant drink a beer our systems wont take it being sober sucks we are useless undead stoners so i was all step back and behold biatches and im all taking a bottle of stoli out of the freezer and mixing in a glass with some of the blood from the pouches just like the ones we left for the countess and lord flood and theyre all drooling when they see the blood so i was thinking dont make me fry you but then i give the glass to the gray vamp and hes all sweet and the others are like me me me so im like mixing bloody marys all around and the greasy hippyish one is like can we dunk pot cookies in this and im like of course stoner vamp and theyre all you are a goddess and we are not worthy and oh please may we have some more until they started to drop so like two minutes later theres like this big pile of passedout vampyres in the kitchen and im all yo foo i got your shit ready and foo comes out of the bedroom all cute holding his uv floodlight like hes going to save me then sees that they are all out cold and gives me a big kiss and is like you rock and im like you have no idea my mangahaired love toy and he was like the sedative in the blood blah blah four hours blah blah nerdspeak geektalk and im like whateva studmumn handle it so it took like two hours for foo to do all his medical stuff with the animals taking some blood and doing various medical nerdism stuff to it then putting it back in but finally he was done and i called jared to tell him that we were on our way to get lord flood and the countess so i like made the other call to make sure everything was all in order and whatnot and foo was all are you sure this is what you want to do and i was all foo theirs is the greatest love of all time its the only thing to do and he was all okay as long as youre sure because we can do them the same as we did the others and i was all no that wont work they have to be together and you dont have to live at home anymore well have a completely sweet love lair so we did it blue watched from the alley across the street as the animals came out the security door emptyhanded and stumbled into the street she knew she should have gone herself but that whole gettingburnedup thing had taught her that perhaps it was better to delegate that they didnt have her money was bad enough but that they didnt have her money and heat was coming off of them was disastrous those dumbfucks cant get anything right she said to herself im going to have to kill them all over again i dont think so said a voice from behind her she whipped around leading with her long fingernails in a swipe that would have taken off half a mans face elijah caught her hand hed found another tracksuit this one powder blue its time to let it go the genie must go

in their long coats looking like sculptures looking eternal like they could wait forever can just anyone sneak up on me now said blue time to go elijah said the african woman none of you would be here if it werent for me elijah said yes and we would have been hunted down and killed a long time ago if we hadnt adhered to your rules ah my rules elijah said looking down now how many left to clean elijah looked across the street to the loft windows then at blue she raised an eyebrow smiled a little shes the only one left he lied then finish it id rather not elijah said the emperor of san francisco wept for his city he had done what he could called the police alerted the newspapers even tried to take to battle himself but by the time hed gathered the courage to return to the marina safeway it had been finished and he could do nothing more than speculate to the uniformed police officers how the window had been broken and why the store was empty theyd tried to track down the night crew but none of them seemed to be home and his city was plagued by vampires now the emperor wept and consoled the troops rubbing bummer behind the ears and gently patting lazarus on the ribs as he lay sleeping on the dock the fog was coming slow off the bay tonight not windblown like it was so often here he heard footsteps before he saw them then there were five of them the fiend the three in the long coats he had seen come in the night before and a blond woman in a blue party dress they walked past and only the fiend turned and paused the emperor held bummer tight afraid that he would burst into one of his barking fits and all would be lost old man said elijah the city is yours again then he joined the others at the end of the dock the emperor could see their motor yacht waiting outside the breakwaterit had to be two hundred feet long far too big to enter the marina very well then shall we go said elijah can i get a coat like that asked blue nodding toward the tall blond man the blond man said youll get one when you learn the secret handshake and get your decoder ring blue looked at elijah is he fuckin with me yes said elijah he offered her his arm she took it and stepped down into the longboat the emperor watched the vampires disappear into the fog rivera had six uniforms in swat gear with a battering ram ready to take down the door so he and cavuto were more than somewhat surprised when it opened almost as soon as they knocked a shirtless sleepylooking chinese guy with spiky hair stood in the doorway yes can i help you rivera held up the warrant i have a warrant to search this apartment kay said the chinese guy abby cops are here the skinny broken clown girl appeared at the top of the stairs in a kimono hey cops said abby normal what are you doing here rivera said i live here cop she popped the p rivera hated that actually its my apartment said the chinese guy do you need to see id yeah that would be nice kid said cavuto he whipped the kid around and marched him up the stairs as the kid read the warrant do not bruise the foo cop said the broken clown girl rivera turned to the uniforms and shrugged apologetically sorry guys i guess we got this one they shuffled away what are you guys looking for asked the chinese kid maybe we could speed this up were looking for thomas flood and jody stroud hes the one on the lease for this apartment and the one down the street oh yeah im subletting said the chinese kid steven wong cavuto read off the kids license rivera was feeling very very bad about this they had found one more body in the mission with the bloodlossandbrokenneck mothe guy had been naked supposedly someone had stolen his powderblue tracksuit so they logged it as robbery but then a week ago the killings stopped that didnt mean it was over hed made the mistake of thinking it was over with these two before rivera had finally gotten the christian kid at the safeway to file charges on the redhead for assault after a long talk with the other stoners theyd gotten the flood kid on the arrest warrant for conspiracy theyd also implied that somehow flood and the redhead had gotten their share of the old vampires money maybe they had left town if they had well good but he still had a slew of unsolved murders youre subletting from thomas flood i never met him actually said steve we arranged it through the rental agent yeah so step off cop said the skinny girl rivera looked around the apartment there was no need to tear the place apart obviously everything in here was new mostly decorated in pier imports cheap wicker motif and some punky urban outfitter flair which he guessed was the input of the creepy little girl the bronze sculptures were out of character though a lifesized nude of a young woman a large snapping turtle and a lifesized bronze of a couple posed as if in rodins the kiss these must have been expensive rivera said not really i know the artists the chinese kid said some biker guys down the street foos in biotech said the broken clown girl he makes like stupid money cop yeah thats swell said rivera hed watched this neighborhood turn from a rust slum of repair shops and the odd ethnic restaurant to a gentrified hive of hipster professionals in remodeled lofts during the dotcom boom and it had never turned back the whole neighborhood was full of kids who spent the equivalent of riveras annual salary on a car they wouldnt drive a dozen times a year this kid apparently was just another one so you dont know these people rivera said pointing to the warrant steven wong shook his head sorry ive never met them i send my rent directly to the rental agency you might check with them okay then sorry to bother you okay then cavuto said thats it theyre not here nick these two dont know where they are but thats not enough yeah you want to spend some time talking to allison here see what you can find out rivera nodded toward the broken clown girl cavuto had tried to keep someone between himself and the skinny girl since theyd come upstairs but now he looked at her full on and shuddered no i guess thats it he turned and lumbered down the steps you need to check your girlfriends id rivera said to steve you may not be old enough for her then he turned and left as well chill foo abby said theyre gone they wont be back lets go shopping abby are you sure about this it seems cruel he patted the lifesized sculpture of the couple embraced in a kiss i heard the countess say once that it was like being in a dream they just sort of float all peaceful and dreamy the main thing is theyre together youre sure theirs is the greatest love of all time it would be wrong for them to be apart foo well i think we should just change them back now that we know the process works someday now the countess doesnt want that its wrong how can it be wrong its my idea and i am their dedicated minion and whatnot i control the dark she ran and jumped into his arms i guess you do he said okay lets go shopping for stuff for our most fly apartment william arrived back at the loft just after dark feeling very much rested and well fed from his hospital stay but craving a sip or two of the good stuff and terribly worried about chet he let himself into the stairway with his key but when he rang the bell no one answered so he sat down to wait for the redhead and that guy to bring his bottle he hadnt been there ten minutes before he heard the meowing at the door and his heart leapt as he opened the outer door to find chet his red sweater still intact purring outside come on boy i missed you buddy william scooped up his kitty and carried him into the stairwell as soon as the door closed chet the huge shaved vampire cat was upon him
