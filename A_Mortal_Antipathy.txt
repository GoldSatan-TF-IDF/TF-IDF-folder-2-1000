a mortal antipathy by oliver wendell holmes preface a mortal antipathy was a truly hazardous experiment a very wise and very distinguished physician who is as much at home in literature as he is in science and the practice of medicine wrote to me in referring to this story i should have been afraid of my subject he did not explain himself but i can easily understand that he felt the improbability of the physiological or pathological occurrence on which the story is founded to be so great that the narrative could hardly be rendered plausible i felt the difficulty for myself as well as for my readers and it was only by recalling for our consideration a series of extraordinary but wellauthenticated facts of somewhat similar character that i could hope to gain any serious attention to so strange a narrative i need not recur to these wonderful stories there is however one not to be found on record elsewhere to which i would especially call the readers attention it is that of the middleaged man who assured me that he could never pass a tall hall clock without an indefinable terror while an infant in arms the heavy weight of one of these tall clocks had fallen with aloud crash and produced an impression on his nervous system which he had never got over the lasting effect of a shock received by the sense of sight or that of hearing is conceivable enough but there is another sense the nerves of which are in close relation with the higher organs of consciousness the strength of the associations connected with the function of the first pair of nerves the olfactory is familiar to most persons in their own experience and as related by others now we know that every human being as well as every other living organism carries its own distinguishing atmosphere if a mans friend does not know it his dog does and can track him anywhere by it this personal peculiarity varies with the age and conditions of the individual it may be agreeable or otherwise a source of attraction or repulsion but its influence is not less real though far less obvious and less dominant than in the lower animals it was an atmospheric impression of this nature which associated itself with a terrible shock experienced by the infant which became the subject of this story the impression could not be outgrown but it might possibly be broken up by some sudden change in the nervous system effected by a cause as potent as the one which had produced the disordered condition this is the best key that i can furnish to a story which must have puzzled some repelled others and failed to interest many who did not suspect the true cause of the mysterious antipathy beverly farms mass august o w h a mortal antipathy first opening of the new portfolio introduction and why the new portfolio i would ask pray do you remember when there was an accession to the nursery in which you have a special interest whether the newcomer was commonly spoken of as a baby was it not on the contrary invariably under all conditions in all companies by the whole household spoken of as the baby and was the small receptacle provided for it commonly spoken of as a cradle or was it not always called the cradle as if there were no other in existence now this new portfolio is the cradle in which i am to rock my newborn thoughts and from which i am to lift them carefully and show them to callers namely to the whole family of readers belonging to my list of intimates and such other friends as may drop in by accident and so it shall have the definite article and not be lost in the mob of its fellows as a portfolio there are a few personal and incidental matters of which i wish to say something before reaching the contents of the portfolio whatever these may be i have had other portfolios before this two more especially and the first thing i beg leave to introduce relates to these do not throw this volume down or turn to another page when i tell you that the earliest of them that of which i now am about to speak was opened more than fifty years ago this is a very dangerous confession for fifty years make everything hopelessly oldfashioned without giving it the charm of real antiquity if i could say a hundred years now my readers would accept all i had to tell them with a curious interest but fifty years ago there are too many talkative old people who know all about that time and at best half a century is a halfbaked bit of ware a coinfancier would say that your fiftyyearold facts have just enough of antiquity to spot them with rust and not enough to give them the delicate and durable patina which is times exquisite enamel when the first portfolio was opened the coin of the realm bore for its legend or might have borne if the more devout heroworshippers could have had their way andreas jackson populi gratia imp caesar aug div max etc etc i never happened to see any gold or silver with that legend but the truth is i was not very familiarly acquainted with the precious metals at that period of my career and there might have been a good deal of such coin in circulation without my handling it or knowing much about it permit me to indulge in a few reminiscences of that faroff time in those days the athenaeum picture gallery was a principal centre of attraction to young boston people and their visitors many of us got our first ideas of art to say nothing of our first lessons in the comparatively innocent flirtations of our citys primitive period in that agreeable resort of amateurs and artists how the pictures on those walls in pearl street do keep their places in the minds gallery trumbulls sortie of gibraltar with red enough in it for one of our sunset afterglows and neagles fulllength portrait of the blacksmith in his shirtsleeves and copleys longwaistcoated gentlemen and satinclad ladies they looked like gentlemen and ladies too and stuarts florid merchants and highwaisted matrons and allstons lovely italian scenery and dreamy unimpassioned women not forgetting florimel in full flight on her interminable rockinghorse you may still see her at the art museum and the rival landscapes of doughty and fisher much talked of and largely praised in those days and the murillo not from marshal soups collection and the portrait of annibale caracci by himself which cost the athenaeum a hundred dollars and coles allegorical pictures and his immense and dreary canvas in which the prostrate shepherds and the angel in josephs coat of many colors look as if they must have been thrown in for nothing and wests brawny lear tearing his clothes to pieces but why go on with the catalogue when most of these pictures can be seen either at the athenaeum building in beacon street or at the art gallery and admired or criticised perhaps more justly certainly not more generously than in those earlier years when we looked at them through the japanned fishhorns if one happened to pass through atkinson street on his way to the athenaeum he would notice a large square painted brick house in which lived a leading representative of oldfashioned coleopterous calvinism and from which emerged one of the liveliest of literary butterflies the father was editor of the boston recorder a very respectable but very far from amusing paper most largely patronized by that class of the community which spoke habitually of the first day of the week as the sahbuth the son was the editor of several different periodicals in succession none of them over severe or serious and of many pleasant books filled with lively descriptions of society which he studied on the outside with a quick eye for form and color and with a certain amount of sentiment not very deep but real though somewhat frothed over by his worldly experiences nathaniel parker willis was in full bloom when i opened my first portfolio he had made himself known by his religious poetry published in his fathers paper i think and signed roy he had started the american magazine afterwards merged in the new york mirror he had then left off writing scripture pieces and taken to lighter forms of verse he had just written im twentytwo im twentytwo they idly give me joy as if i should be glad to know that i was less a boy he was young therefore and already famous he came very near being very handsome he was tall his hair of light brown color waved in luxuriant abundance his cheek was as rosy as if it had been painted to show behind the footlights he dressed with artistic elegance he was something between a remembrance of count dorsay and an anticipation of oscar wilde there used to be in the gallery of the luxembourg a picture of hippolytus and phxdra in which the beautiful young man who had kindled a passion in the heart of his wicked stepmother always reminded me of willis in spite of the shortcomings of the living face as compared with the ideal the painted youth is still blooming on the canvas but the freshcheecked jaunty young author of the year has long faded out of human sight i took the leaves which lie before me at this moment as i write from his coffin as it lay just outside the door of saint pauls church on a sad overclouded winters day in the year at that earlier time willis was by far the most prominent young american author cooper irving bryant dana halleck drake had all done their best work longfellow was not yet conspicuous lowell was a schoolboy emerson was unheard of whittier was beginning to make his way against the writers with better educational advantages whom he was destined to outdo and to outlive not one of the great histories which have done honor to our literature had appeared our schoolbooks depended so far as american authors were concerned on extracts from the orations and speeches of webster and everett on bryants thanatopsis his lines to a waterfowl and the death of the flowers hallecks marco bozzaris red jacket and burns on drakes american flag and percivals coral grove and his genius sleeping and genius waking and not getting very wide awake either these could be depended upon a few other copies of verses might be found but dwights columbia columbia and pierponts airs of palestine were already effaced as many of the favorites of our own day and generation must soon be by the great wave which the near future will pour over the sands in which they still are legible about this time in the year came out a small volume entitled truth a gift for scribblers which made some talk for a while and is now chiefly valuable as a kind of literary tombstone on which may be read the names of many whose renown has been buried with their bones the london athenaeum spoke of it as having been described as a tomahawk sort of satire as the author had been a trapper in missouri he was familiarly acquainted with that weapon and the warfare of its owners born in boston in the son of an army officer educated at west point he came back to his native city about the year he wrote an article on bryants poems for the north american review and another on the famous indian chief black hawk in this lastmentioned article he tells this story as the great warrior told it himself it was an incident of a fight with the osages standing by my fathers side i saw him kill his antagonist and tear the scalp from his head fired with valor and ambition i rushed furiously upon another smote him to the earth with my tomahawk ran my lance through his body took off his scalp and returned in triumph to my father he said nothing but looked pleased this little red story describes very well spellings style of literary warfare his handling of his most conspicuous victim willis was very much like black hawks way of dealing with the osage he tomahawked him in heroics ran him through in prose and scalped him in barbarous epigrams bryant and halleck were abundantly praised hardly any one else escaped if the reader wishes to see the bubbles of reputation that were floating some of them gay with prismatic colors half a century ago he will find in the pages of truth a long catalogue of celebrities he never heard of i recognize only three names of all which are mentioned in the little book as belonging to persons still living but as i have not read the obituaries of all the others some of them may be still flourishing in spite of mr spellings exterminating onslaught time dealt as hardly with poor spelling who was not without talent and instruction as he had dealt with our authors i think he found shelter at last under a roof which held numerous inmates some of whom had seen better and many of whom had known worse days than those which they were passing within its friendly and not exclusive precincts such at least was the story i heard after he disappeared from general observation that was the day of souvenirs tokens forgetmenots bijous and all that class of showy annuals short stories slender poems steel engravings on a level with the common fashionplates of advertising establishments gilt edges resplendent binding to manifestations of this sort our lighter literature had very largely run for some years the scarlet letter was an unhinted possibility the voices of the night had not stirred the brooding silence the concord seer was still in the lonely desert most of the contributors to those yearly volumes which took up such pretentious positions on the centre table have shrunk into entire oblivion or at best hold their place in literature by a scrap or two in some omnivorous collection what dreadful work spelling made among those slight reputations floating in swollen tenuity on the surface of the stream and mirroring each other in reciprocal reflections violent abusive as he was unjust to any against whom he happened to have a prejudice his castigation of the small litterateurs of that day was not harmful but rather of use his attack on willis very probably did him good he needed a little discipline and though he got it too unsparingly some cautions came with it which were worth the stripes he had to smart under one noble writer spelling treated with rudeness probably from some accidental pique or equally insignificant reason i myself one of the three survivors before referred to escaped with a lovepat as the youngest son of the muse longfellow gets a brief nod of acknowledgment bailey an american writer who made long since a happy snatch at fame which must have been snatched away from him by envious time for i cannot identify him thatcher who died early leaving one poem the last request not wholly unremembered miss hannah f gould a very bright and agreeable writer of light verse all these are commended to the keeping of that venerable public carrier who finds his scythe and hourglass such a load that he generally drops the burdens committed to his charge after making a show of paying every possible attention to them so long as he is kept in sight it was a good time to open a portfolio but my old one had boyhood written on every page a single passionate outcry when the old warship i had read about in the broadsides that were a part of our kitchen literature and in the naval monument was threatened with demolition a few verses suggested by the sight of old major melville in his cocked hat and breeches were the best scraps that came out of that first portfolio which was soon closed that it should not interfere with the duties of a profession authorized to claim all the time and thought which would have been otherwise expended in filling it during a quarter of a century the first portfolio remained closed for the greater part of the time only now and then it would be taken up and opened and something drawn from it for a special occasion more particularly for the annual reunions of a certain class of which i was a member in the year towards its close the atlantic monthly which i had the honor of naming was started by the enterprising firm of phillips sampson under the editorship of mr james russell lowell he thought that i might bring something out of my old portfolio which would be not unacceptable in the new magazine i looked at the poor old receptacle which partly from use and partly from neglect had lost its freshness and seemed hardly presentable to the new company expected to welcome the newcomer in the literary world of boston the least provincial of american centres of learning and letters the gilded covering where the emblems of hope and aspiration had looked so bright had faded not wholly perhaps but how was the gold become dim how was the most fine gold changed long devotion to other pursuits had left little time for literature and the waifs and strays gathered from the old portfolio had done little more than keep alive the memory that such a source of supply was still in existence i looked at the old portfolio and said to myself too late too late this tarnished gold will never brighten these battered covers will stand no more wear and tear close them and leave them to the spider and the bookworm in the mean time the nebula of the first quarter of the century had condensed into the constellation of the middle of the same period when a little while after the establishment of the new magazine the saturday club gathered about the long table at parkers such a representation of all that was best in american literature had never been collected within so small a compass most of the americans whom educated foreigners cared to seeleaving out of consideration official dignitaries whose temporary importance makes them objects of curiosity were seated at that board but the club did not yet exist and the atlantic monthly was an experiment there had already been several monthly periodicals more or less successful and permanent among which putnams magazine was conspicuous owing its success largely to the contributions of that very accomplished and delightful writer mr george william curtis that magazine after a somewhat prolonged and very honorable existence had gone where all periodicals go when they die into the archives of the deaf dumb and blind recording angel whose name is oblivion it had so well deserved to live that its death was a surprise and a source of regret could another monthly take its place and keep it when that with all its attractions and excellences had died out and left a blank in our periodical literature which it would be very hard to fill as well as that had filled it this was the experiment which the enterprising publishers ventured upon and i who felt myself outside of the charmed circle drawn around the scholars and poets of cambridge and concord having given myself to other studies and duties wondered somewhat when mr lowell insisted upon my becoming a contributor and so yielding to a pressure which i could not understand and yet found myself unable to resist i promised to take a part in the new venture as an occasional writer in the columns of the new magazine that was the way in which the second portfolio found its way to my table and was there opened in the autumn of the year i was already at least nel mezzo del cammin di mia vita when i risked myself with many misgivings in littletried paths of what looked at first like a wilderness a selva oscura where if i did not meet the lion or the wolf i should be sure to find the critic the most dangerous of the carnivores waiting to welcome me after his own fashion the second portfolio is closed and laid away perhaps it was hardly worth while to provide and open a new one but here it lies before me and i hope i may find something between its covers which will justify me in coming once more before my old friends but before i open it i want to claim a little further indulgence there is a subject of profound interest to almost every writer i might say to almost every human being no matter what his culture or ignorance no matter what his pursuit no matter what his character the subject i refer to is one of which he rarely ceases to think and if opportunity is offered to talk on this he is eloquent if on nothing else the slow of speech becomes fluent the torpid listener becomes electric with vivacity and alive all over with interest the sagacious reader knows well what is coming after this prelude he is accustomed to the phrases with which the plausible visitor who has a subscription book in his pocket prepares his victim for the depressing disclosure of his real errand he is not unacquainted with the conversational amenities of the cordial and interesting stranger who having had the misfortune of leaving his carpetbag in the cars or of having his pocket picked at the station finds himself without the means of reaching that distant home where affluence waits for him with its luxurious welcome but to whom for the moment the loan of some five and twenty dollars would be a convenience and a favor for which his heart would ache with gratitude during the brief interval between the loan and its repayment i wish to say a few words in my own person relating to some passages in my own history and more especially to some of the recent experiences through which i have been passing what can justify one in addressing himself to the general public as if it were his private correspondent there are at least three sufficient reasons first if he has a story to tell that everybody wants to hear if he has been shipwrecked or has been in a battle or has witnessed any interesting event and can tell anything new about it secondly if he can put in fitting words any common experiences not already well told so that readers will say why yes i have had that sensation thought emotion a hundred times but i never heard it spoken of before and i never saw any mention of it in print and thirdly anything one likes provided he can so tell it as to make it interesting i have no story to tell in this introduction which can of itself claim any general attention my first pages relate the effect of a certain literary experience upon myself a series of partial metempsychoses of which i have been the subject next follows a brief tribute to the memory of a very dear and renowned friend from whom i have recently been parted the rest of the introduction will be consecrated to the memory of my birthplace i have just finished a memoir which will appear soon after this page is written and will have been the subject of criticism long before it is in the readers hands the experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for a long time of living ones self into another mans life for a month or a year or more is a very curious one no matter how much superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes the life feels himself in a certain sense on the level of the person whose life he is writing one cannot fight over the battles of marengo or austerlitz with napoleon without feeling as if he himself had a fractional claim to the victory so real seems the transfer of his personality into that of the conqueror while he reads still more must this identification of subject and object take place when one is writing of a person whose studies or occupations are not unlike his own here are some of my metempsychoses ten years ago i wrote what i called a memorial outline of a remarkable student of nature he was a born observer and such are far from common he was also a man of great enthusiasm and unwearying industry his quick eye detected what others passed by without notice the indian relic where another would see only pebbles and fragments the rare mollusk or reptile which his companion would poke with his cane never suspecting that there was a prize at the end of it getting his single facts together with marvellous sagacity and longbreathed patience he arranged them classified them described them studied them in their relations and before those around him were aware of it the collector was an accomplished naturalist when he died his collections remained and they still remain as his record in the hieratic language of science in writing this memoir the spirit of his quiet pursuits the even temper they bred in him gained possession of my own mind so that i seemed to look at nature through his goldbowed spectacles and to move about his beautifully ordered museum as if i had myself prepared and arranged its specimens i felt wise with his wisdom fairminded with his calm impartiality it seemed as if for the time his placid observant inquiring keensighted nature slid into my soul and if i had looked at myself in the glass i should almost have expected to see the image of the hersey professor whose life and character i was sketching a few years hater i lived over the life of another friend in writing a memoir of which he was the subject i saw him the beautiful brighteyed boy with dark waving hair the youthful scholar first at harvard then at gottingen and berlin the friend and companion of bismarck the young author making a dash for renown as a novelist and showing the elements which made his failures the promise of success in a larger field of literary labor the delving historian burying his fresh young manhood in the dusty alcoves of silent libraries to come forth in the face of europe and america as one of the leading historians of the time the diplomatist accomplished of captivating presence and manners an ardent american and in the time of trial an impassioned and eloquent advocate of the cause of freedom reaching at last the summit of his ambition as minister at the court of saint james all this i seemed to share with him as i tracked his career from his birthplace in dorchester and the house in walnut street where he passed his boyhood to the palaces of vienna and london and then the cruel blow which struck him from the place he adorned the great sorrow that darkened his later years the invasion of illness a threat that warned of danger and after a period of invalidism during a part of which i shared his most intimate daily life the sudden hardly unwelcome final summons did not my own consciousness migrate or seem at least to transfer itself into this brilliant life history as i traced its glowing record i too seemed to feel the delight of carrying with me as if they were my own the charms of a presence which made its own welcome everywhere i shared his heroic toils i partook of his literary and social triumphs i was honored by the marks of distinction which gathered about him i was wronged by the indignity from which he suffered mourned with him in his sorrow and thus after i had been living for months with his memory i felt as if i should carry a part of his being with me so long as my selfconsciousness might remain imprisoned in the ponderable elements the years passed away and the influences derived from the companionships i have spoken of had blended intimately with my own current of being then there came to me a new experience in my relations with an eminent member of the medical profession whom i met habitually for a long period and to whose memory i consecrated a few pages as a prelude to a work of his own written under very peculiar circumstances he was the subject of a slow torturing malignant and almost necessarily fatal disease knowing well that the mind would feed upon itself if it were not supplied with food from without he determined to write a treatise on a subject which had greatly interested him and which would oblige him to bestow much of his time and thought upon it if indeed he could hold out to finish the work during the period while he was engaged in writing it his wife who had seemed in perfect health died suddenly of pneumonia physical suffering mental distress the prospect of death at a near if uncertain time always before him it was hard to conceive a more terrible strain than that which he had to endure when in the hour of his greatest need his faithful companion the wife of many years of happy union whose hand had smoothed his pillow whose voice had consoled and cheered him was torn from him after a few days of illness i felt that my friends trial was such that the cry of the man of many afflictions and temptations might well have escaped from his lips i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground i had dreaded meeting him for the first time after this crushing blow what a lesson he gave me of patience under sufferings which the fearful description of the eastern poet does not picture too vividly we have been taught to admire the calm philosophy of haller watching his faltering pulse as he lay dying we have heard the words of pious resignation said to have been uttered with his last breath by addison but here was a trial not of hours or days or weeks but of months even years of cruel pain and in the midst of its thick darkness the light of love which had burned steadily at his bedside was suddenly extinguished there were times in which the thought would force itself upon my consciousness how long is the universe to look upon this dreadful experiment of a malarious planet with its unmeasurable freight of suffering its poisonous atmosphere so sweet to breathe so sure to kill in a few scores of years at farthest and its heartbreaking woes which make even that brief space of time an eternity there can be but one answer that will meet this terrible question which must arise in every thinking nature that would fain justify the ways of god to men so must it be until that one faroff divine event to which the whole creation moves has become a reality and the anthem in which there is no discordant note shall be joined by a voice from every life made perfect through sufferings such was the lesson into which i lived in those sad yet placid years of companionship with my suffering and sorrowing friend in retracing which i seemed to find another existence mingled with my own and now for many months i have been living in daily relations of intimacy with one who seems nearer to me since he has left us than while he was here in living form and feature i did not know how difficult a task i had undertaken in venturing upon a memoir of a man whom all or almost all agree upon as one of the great lights of the new world and whom very many regard as an unpredicted messiah never before was i so forcibly reminded of carlyles description of the work of a newspaper editor that threshing of straw already thrice beaten by the flails of other laborers in the same field what could be said that had not been said of transcendentalism and of him who was regarded as its prophet of the poet whom some admired without understanding a few understood or thought they did without admiring and many both understood and admired among these there being not a small number who went far beyond admiration and lost themselves in devout worship while one exalted him as the greatest man that ever lived another a friend famous in the world of letters wrote expressly to caution me against the danger of overrating a writer whom he is content to recognize as an american montaigne and nothing more after finishing this memoir which has but just left my hands i would gladly have let my brain rest for a while the wide range of thought which belonged to the subject of the memoir the occasional mysticism and the frequent tendency toward it the sweep of imagination and the sparkle of wit which kept his readers mind on the stretch the union of prevailing good sense with exceptional extravagances the modest audacity of a nature that showed itself in its naked truthfulness and was not ashamed the feeling that i was in the company of a sibylline intelligence which was discounting the promises of the remote future long before they were due all this made the task a grave one but when i found myself amidst the vortices of uncounted various bewildering judgments catholic and protestant orthodox and liberal scholarly from under the tree of knowledge and instinctive from over the potatohill the passionate enthusiasm of young adorers and the cool if not cynical estimate of hardened critics all intersecting each other as they whirled each around its own centre i felt that it was indeed very difficult to keep the faculties clear and the judgment unbiassed it is a great privilege to have lived so long in the society of such a man he nothing common said or mean he was always the same pure and highsouled companion after being with him virtue seemed as natural to man as its opposite did according to the old theologies but how to let ones self down from the high level of such a character to ones own poor standard i trust that the influence of this long intellectual and spiritual companionship never absolutely leaves one who has lived in it it may come to him in the form of selfreproach that he falls so far short of the superior being who has been so long the object of his contemplation but it also carries him at times into the others personality so that he finds himself thinking thoughts that are not his own using phrases which he has unconsciously borrowed writing it may be as nearly like his longstudied original as julio romanos painting was like raphaels and all this with the unquestioning conviction that he is talking from his own consciousness in his own natural way so far as tones and expressions and habits which belonged to the idiosyncrasy of the original are borrowed by the student of his life it is a misfortune for the borrower but to share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of a pure and radiant soul this is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline i have written these few memoirs and i am grateful for all that they have taught me but let me write no more there are but two biographers who can tell the story of a mans or a womans life one is the person himself or herself the other is the recording angel the autobiographer cannot be trusted to tell the whole truth though he may tell nothing but the truth and the recording angel never lets his book go out of his own hands as for myself i would say to my friends in the oriental phrase live forever yes live forever and i at least shall not have to wrong your memories by my imperfect record and unsatisfying commentary in connection with these biographies or memoirs more properly in which i have written of my departed friends i hope my readers will indulge me in another personal reminiscence i have just lost my dear and honored contemporary of the last century a hundred years ago this day december died the admirable and ever to be remembered dr samuel johnson the year was made ponderous and illustrious in english biography by his birth my own humble advent to the world of protoplasm was in the year of the present century summer was just ending when those four letters son b were written under the date of my birth august th autumn had just begun when my great precontemporary entered this unchristian universe and was made a member of the christian church on the same day for he was born and baptized on the th of september thus there was established a close bond of relationship between the great english scholar and writer and myself year by year and almost month by month my life has kept pace in this century with his life in the last century i had only to open my boswell at any time and i knew just what johnson at my age twenty or fifty or seventy was thinking and doing what were his feelings about life what changes the years had wrought in his body his mind his feelings his companionships his reputation it was for me a kind of unison between two instruments both playing that old familiar air life one a bassoon if you will and the other an oaten pipe if you care to find an image for it but still keeping pace with each other until the players both grew old and gray at last the thinner thread of sound is heard by itself and its deep accompaniment rolls out its thunder no more i feel lonely now that my great companion and friend of so many years has left me i felt more intimately acquainted with him than i do with many of my living friends i can hardly remember when i did not know him i can see him in his bushy wig exactly like that of the reverend dr samuel cooper who died in december as copley painted him he hangs there on my wall over the revolving bookcase his ample coat too i see with its broad flaps and many buttons and generous cuffs and beneath it the long still more copiously buttoned waistcoat arching in front of the fine crescentic almost semilunar falstaffian prominence involving no less than a dozen of the abovementioned buttons and the strong legs with their sturdy calves fitting columns of support to the massive body and solid capacious brain enthroned over it i can hear him with his heavy tread as he comes in to the club and a gap is widened to make room for his portly figure a fine day says sir joshua sir he answers it seems propitious but the atmosphere is humid and the skies are nebulous at which the great painter smiles shifts his trumpet and takes a pinch of snuff dear old massive deepvoiced dogmatist and hypochondriac of the eighteenth century how one would like to sit at some ghastly club between you and the bony mightymouthed harshtoned termagant and dyspeptic of the nineteenth the growl of the english mastiff and the snarl of the scotch terrier would make a duet which would enliven the shores of lethe i wish i could find our spiritualists paper in the portfolio in which the two are brought together but i hardly know what i shall find when it is opened yes my life is a little less precious to me since i have lost that dear old friend and when the funeral train moves to westminster abbey next saturday for i feel as if this were and not i seem to find myself following the hearse one of the silent mourners among the events which have rendered the past year memorable to me has been the demolition of that venerable and interesting old dwellinghouse precious for its intimate association with the earliest stages of the war of the revolution and sacred to me as my birthplace and the home of my boyhood the old gambrelroofed house exists no longer i remember saying something in one of a series of papers published long ago about the experience of dying out of a house of leaving it forever as the soul dies out of the body we may die out of many houses but the house itself can die but once and so real is the life of a house to one who has dwelt in it more especially the life of the house which held him in dreamy infancy in restless boyhood in passionate youth so real i say is its life that it seems as if something like a soul of it must outlast its perishing frame the slaughter of the old gambrelroofed house was i am ready to admit a case of justifiable domicide not the less was it to be deplored by all who love the memories of the past with its destruction are obliterated some of the footprints of the heroes and martyrs who took the first steps in the long and bloody march which led us through the wilderness to the promised land of independent nationality personally i have a right to mourn for it as a part of my life gone from me my private grief for its loss would be a matter for my solitary digestion were it not that the experience through which i have just passed is one so familiar to my fellowcountrymen that in telling my own reflections and feelings i am repeating those of great numbers of men and women who have had the misfortune to outlive their birthplace it is a great blessing to be born surrounded by a natural horizon the old gambrelroofed house could not boast an unbroken ring of natural objects encircling it northerly it looked upon its own outbuildings and some unpretending twostory houses which had been its neighbors for a century and more to the south of it the square brick dormitories and the bellfried hall of the university helped to shut out the distant view but the west windows gave a broad outlook across the common beyond which the historical washington elm and two companions in line with it spread their leaves in summer and their networks in winter and far away rose the hills that bounded the view with the glimmer here and there of the white walls or the illuminated casements of some embowered halfhidden villa eastwardly also the prospect was in my earlier remembrance widely open and i have frequently seen the sunlit sails gliding along as if through the level fields for no water was visible so there were broad expanses on two sides at least for my imagination to wander over i cannot help thinking that we carry our childhoods horizon with us all our days among these western wooded hills my daydreams built their fairy palaces and even now as i look at them from my library window across the estuary of the charles i find myself in the familiar home of my early visions the clouds of glory which we trail with us in after life need not be traced to a prenatal state there is enough to account for them in that unconsciously remembered period of existence before we have learned the hard limitations of real life those earliest months in which we lived in sensations without words and ideas not fettered in sentences have all the freshness of proofs of an engraving before the letter i am very thankful that the first part of my life was not passed shut in between high walls and treading the unimpressible and unsympathetic pavement our university town was very much like the real country in those days of which i am thinking there were plenty of huckleberries and blueberries within half a mile of the house blackberries ripened in the fields acorns and shagbarks dropped from the trees squirrels ran among the branches and not rarely the henhawk might be seen circling over the barnyard still another rural element was not wanting in the form of that fardiffused infragrant effluvium which diluted by a good half mile of pure atmosphere is no longer odious nay is positively agreeable to many who have long known it though its source and centre has an unenviable reputation i need not name the animal whose parthian warfare terrifies and puts to flight the mightiest hunter that ever roused the tiger from his jungle or faced the lion of the desert strange as it may seem an aerial hint of his personality in the far distance always awakens in my mind pleasant remembrances and tender reflections a whole neighborhood rises up before me the barn with its haymow where the hens laid their eggs to hatch and we boys hid our apples to ripen both occasionally illustrating the sic vos non vobis the shed where the annual tragedy of the pig was acted with a realism that made salvinis othello seem but a pale counterfeit the rickety old outhouse with the cornchamber which the mice knew so well the paved yard with its open gutter these and how much else come up at the hint of my faroff friend who is my very near enemy nothing is more familiar than the power of smell in reviving old memories there was that quite different fragrance of the woodhouse the smell of fresh sawdust it comes back to me now and with it the hiss of the saw the tumble of the divorced logs which god put together and man has just put asunder the coming down of the axe and the hah that helped it the straightgrained stick opening at the first appeal of the implement as if it were a pleasure and the stick with a knot in the middle of it that mocked the blows and the hahs until the beetle and wedge made it listen to reason there are just such straightgrained and just such knotty men and women all this passes through my mind while biddy whose parlorname is angela contents herself with exclaiming egh how different distances were in those young days of which i am thinking from the old house to the old yellow meetinghouse where the head of the family preached and the limbs of the family listened was not much more than two or three times the width of commonwealth avenue but of a hot summers afternoon after having already heard one sermon which could not in the nature of things have the charm of novelty of presentation to the members of the home circle and the theology of which was not too clear to tender apprehensions with three hymns more or less lugubrious rendered by a villagechoir got into voice by many preliminary snuffles and other expiratory efforts and accompanied by the snort of a huge bassviol which wallowed through the tune like a hippopotamus with other exercises of the customary character after all this in the forenoon the afternoon walk to the meetinghouse in the hot sun counted for as much in my childish deadreckoning as from old israel porters in cambridge to the exchange coffeehouse in boston did in after years it takes a good while to measure the radius of the circle that is about us for the moon seems at first as near as the watchface who knows but that after a certain number of ages the planet we live on may seem to us no bigger than our neighbor venus appeared when she passed before the sun a few months ago looking as if we could take her between our thumb and finger like a bullet or a marble and time too how long was it from the serious sunrise to the joyous sundown of an oldfashioned puritanical judaical first day of the week which a pious fraud christened the sabbath was it a fortnight as we now reckon duration or only a week curious entities or nonentities space and tithe when you see a metaphysician trying to wash his hands of them and get rid of these accidents so as to lay his dry clean palm on the absolute does it not remind you of the hopeless task of changing the color of the blackamoor by a similar proceeding for space is the fluid in which he is washing and time is the soap which he is using up in the process and he cannot get free from them until he can wash himself in a mental vacuum in my reference to the old house in a former paper published years ago i said by and by the stony foot of the great university will plant itself on this whole territory and the private recollections which clung so tenaciously to the place and its habitations will have died with those who cherished them what strides the great university has taken since those words were written during all my early years our old harvard alma mater sat still and lifeless as the colossi in the egyptian desert then all at once like the statue in don giovanni she moved from her pedestal the fall of that stony foot has effected a miracle like the harp that orpheus played like the teeth which cadmus sowed the plain where the moose and the bear were wandering while shakespeare was writing hamlet where a few plain dormitories and other needed buildings were scattered about in my schoolboy days groans under the weight of the massive edifices which have sprung up all around them crowned by the tower of that noble structure which stands in full view before me as i lift my eyes from the portfolio on the back of which i am now writing for i must be permitted to remind you that i have not yet opened it i have told you that i have just finished a long memoir and that it has cost me no little labor to overcome some of its difficulties if i have overcome them which others must decide and i feel exactly as honest dobbin feels when his harness is slipped off after a long journey with a good deal of uphill work he wants to rest a little then to feed a little then if you will turn him loose in the pasture he wants to roll i have left my starry and ethereal companionship not for a long time i hope for it has lifted me above my common self but for a while and now i want so to speak to roll in the grass and among the dandelions with the other pachyderms so i have kept to the outside of the portfolio as yet and am disporting myself in reminiscences and fancies and vagaries and parentheses how well i understand the feeling which led the pisans to load their vessels with earth from the holy land and fill the area of the campo santo with that sacred soil the old house stood upon about as perverse a little patch of the planet as ever harbored a halfstarved earthworm it was as sandy as sahara and as thirsty as tantalus the rustic aiddecamps of the household used to aver that all fertilizing matters leached through it i tried to disprove their assertion by gorging it with the best of terrestrial nourishment until i became convinced that i was feeding the teaplants of china and then i gave over the attempt and yet i did love and do love that arid patch of ground i wonder if a single flower could not be made to grow in a pot of earth from that campo santo of my childhood one noble product of nature did not refuse to flourish there the tall stately beautiful softhaired manyjointed generous maize or indian corn which thrives on sand and defies the blaze of our shrivelling summer what child but loves to wander in its forestlike depths amidst the rustling leaves and with the lofty tassels tossing their heads high above him there are two aspects of the cornfield which always impress my imagination the first when it has reached its full growth and its ordered ranks look like an army on the march with its plumed and bannered battalions the second when after the battle of the harvest the girdled stacks stand on the field of slaughter like so many ragged niobes say rather like the crazy widows and daughters of the dead soldiery once more let us come back to the old house it was far along in its second century when the edict went forth that it must stand no longer the natural death of a house is very much like that of one of its human tenants the roof is the first part to show the distinct signs of age slates and tiles loosen and at last slide off and leave bald the boards that supported them shingles darken and decay and soon the garret or the attic lets in the rain and the snow by and by the beams sag the floors warp the walls crack the paper peels away the ceilings scale off and fall the windows are crusted with clinging dust the doors drop from their rusted hinges the winds come in without knocking and howl their cruel deathsongs through the empty rooms and passages and at last there comes a crash a great cloud of dust rises and the home that had been the shelter of generation after generation finds its grave in its own cellar only the chimney remains as its monument slowly little by little the patient solvents that find nothing too hard for their chemistry pick out the mortar from between the bricks at last a mighty wind roars around it and rushes against it and the monumental relic crashes down among the wrecks it has long survived so dies a human habitation left to natural decay all that was seen above the surface of the soil sinking gradually below it till naught remains the saddening tale to tell save homes last wrecks the cellar and the well but if this sight is saddening what is it to see a human dwelling fall by the hand of violence the ripping off of the shelter that has kept out a thousand storms the tearing off of the once ornamental woodwork the wrench of the inexorable crowbar the murderous blows of the axe the progressive ruin which ends by rending all the joints asunder and flinging the tenoned and mortised timbers into heaps that will be sawed and split to warm some new habitation as firewood what a brutal act of destruction it seems why should i go over the old house again having already described it more than ten years ago alas how many remember anything they read but once and so long ago as that how many would find it out if one should say over in the same words that which he said in the last decade but there is really no need of telling the story a second time for it can be found by those who are curious enough to look it up in a volume of which it occupies the opening chapter in order however to save any inquisitive reader that trouble let me remind him that the old house was general wards headquarters at the breaking out of the revolution that the plan for fortifying bunkers hill was laid as commonly believed in the southeast lower room the floor of which was covered with dents made it was alleged by the butts of the soldiers muskets in that house too general warren probably passed the night before the bunker hill battle and over its threshold must the stately figure of washington have often cast its shadow but the house in which one drew his first breath and where he one day came into the consciousness that he was a personality an ego a little universe with a sky over him all his own with a persistent identity with the terrible responsibility of a separate independent inalienable existence that house does not ask for any historical associations to make it the centre of the earth for him if there is any person in the world to be envied it is the one who is born to an ancient estate with a long line of family traditions and the means in his hands of shaping his mansion and his domain to his own taste without losing sight of all the characteristic features which surrounded his earliest years the american is for the most part a nomad who pulls down his house as the tartar pulls up his tentpoles if i had an ideal life to plan for him it would be something like this his grandfather should be a wise scholarly largebrained largehearted country minister from whom he should inherit the temperament that predisposes to cheerfulness and enjoyment with the finer instincts which direct life to noble aims and make it rich with the gratification of pure and elevated tastes and the carrying out of plans for the good of his neighbors and his fellowcreatures he should if possible have been born at any rate have passed some of his early years or a large part of them under the roof of the good old minister his father should be we will say a business man in one of our great cities a generous manipulator of millions some of which have adhered to his private fortunes in spite of his liberal use of his means his heir our ideally placed american shall take possession of the old house the home of his earliest memories and preserve it sacredly not exactly like the santa casa but as nearly as may be just as he remembers it he can add as many acres as he will to the narrow houselot he can build a grand mansion for himself if he chooses in the not distant neighborhood but the old house and all immediately round it shall be as he recollects it when he had to stretch his little arm up to reach the doorhandles then having well provided for his own household himself included let him become the providence of the village or the town where he finds himself during at least a portion of every year its schools its library its poor and perhaps the new clergyman who has succeeded his grandfathers successor may be one of them all its interests he shall make his own and from this centre his beneficence shall radiate so far that all who hear of his wealth shall also hear of him as a friend to his race is not this a pleasing programme wealth is a steep hill which the father climbs slowly and the son often tumbles down precipitately but there is a tableland on a level with it which may be found by those who do not lose their head in looking down from its sharply cloven summit our dangerously rich men can make themselves hated held as enemies of the race or beloved and recognized as its benefactors the clouds of discontent are threatening but if the goldpointed lightningrods are rightly distributed the destructive element may be drawn off silently and harmlessly for it cannot be repeated too often that the safety of great wealth with us lies in obedience to the new version of the old world axiom richess oblige the new portfolio first opening a mortal antipathy i getting ready it is impossible to begin a story which must of necessity tax the powers of belief of readers unacquainted with the class of facts to which its central point of interest belongs without some words in the nature of preparation readers of charles lamb remember that sarah battle insisted on a cleanswept hearth before sitting down to her favorite game of whist the narrator wishes to sweep the hearth as it were in these opening pages before sitting down to tell his story he does not intend to frighten the reader away by prolix explanation but he does mean to warn him against hasty judgments when facts are related which are not within the range of everyday experience did he ever see the siamese twins or any pair like them probably not yet he feels sure that chang and eng really existed and if he has taken the trouble to inquire he has satisfied himself that similar cases have been recorded by credible witnesses though at long intervals and in countries far apart from each other this is the first sweep of the brush to clear the hearth of the skepticism and incredulity which must be got out of the way before we can begin to tell and to listen in peace with ourselves and each other one more stroke of the brush is needed before the stage will be ready for the chief characters and the leading circumstances to which the readers attention is invited if the principal personages made their entrance at once the reader would have to create for himself the whole scenery of their surrounding conditions in point of fact no matter how a story is begun many of its readers have already shaped its chief actors out of any hint the author may have dropped and provided from their own resources a locality and a set of outward conditions to environ these imagined personalities these are all to be brushed away and the actual surroundings of the subject of the narrative represented as they were at the risk of detaining the reader a little while from the events most likely to interest him the choicest egg that ever was laid was not so big as the nest that held it if a story were so interesting that a maiden would rather hear it than listen to the praise of her own beauty or a poet would rather read it than recite his own verses still it would have to be wrapped in some tissue of circumstance or it would lose half its effectiveness it may not be easy to find the exact locality referred to in this narrative by looking into the first gazetteer that is at hand recent experiences have shown that it is unsafe to be too exact in designating places and the people who live in them there are it may be added so many advertisements disguised under the form of stories and other literary productions that one naturally desires to avoid the suspicion of being employed by the enterprising proprietors of this or that celebrated resort to use his gifts for their especial benefit there are no doubt many persons who remember the old sign and the old tavern and its four chief personages presently to be mentioned it is to be hoped that they will not furnish the public with a key to this narrative and perhaps bring trouble to the writer of it as has happened to other authors if the real names are a little altered it need not interfere with the important facts relating to those who bear them it might not be safe to tell a damaging story about john or james smythe but if the slight change is made of spelling the name smith the smythes would never think of bringing an action as if the allusion related to any of them the same gulf of family distinction separates the thompsons with a p from the thomsons without that letter there are few pleasanter places in the northern states for a summer residence than that known from the first period of its settlement by the name of arrowhead village the indians had found it out as the relics they left behind them abundantly testified the commonest of these were those chipped stones which are the medals of barbarism and from which the place took its name the heads of arrows of various sizes material and patterns some small enough for killing fish and little birds some large enough for such game as the moose and the bear to say nothing of the hostile indian and the white settler some of flint now and then one of white quartz and others of variously colored jasper the indians must have lived here for many generations and it must have been a kind of factory village of the stone age which lasted up to near the present time if we may judge from the fact that many of these relics are met with close to the surface of the ground no wonder they found this a pleasant residence for it is today one of the most attractive of all summer resorts so inviting indeed that those who know it do not like to say too much about it lest the swarms of tourists should make it unendurable to those who love it for itself and not as a centre of fashionable display and extramural cockneyism there is the lake in the first place cedar lake about five miles long and from half a mile to a mile and a half wide stretching from north to south near the northern extremity are the buildings of stoughton university a flourishing young college with an ambitious name but well equipped and promising the grounds of which reach the water at the southern end of the lake are the edifices of the corinna institute a favorite school for young ladies where large numbers of the daughters of america are fitted so far as education can do it for all stations in life from camping out with a husband at the mines in nevada to acting the part of chief lady of the land in the white house at washington midway between the two extremities on the eastern shore of the lake is a valley between two hills which come down to the very edge of the lake leaving only room enough for a road between their base and the water this valley half a mile in width has been long settled and here for a century or more has stood the old anchor tavern a famous place it was so long as its sign swung at the side of the road famous for its landlord portly paternal whose welcome to a guest that looked worthy of the attention was like that of a parent to a returning prodigal and whose parting words were almost as good as a marriage benediction famous for its landlady ample in person motherly seeing to the whole household with her own eyes mistress of all culinary secrets that northern kitchens are most proud of famous also for its ancient servant as city people would call her help as she was called in the tavern and would have called herself the unchanging seemingly immortal miranda who cared for the guests as if she were their nursing mother and pressed the specially favorite delicacies on their attention as a connoisseur calls the wandering eyes of an amateur to the beauties of a picture who that has ever been at the old anchor tavern forgets mirandas a little of this fricasseeit is very nice or some of these cakes you will find them very good nor would it be just to memory to forget that other notable and noted member of the household the unsleeping unresting omnipresent pushee ready for everybody and everything everywhere within the limits of the establishment at all hours of the day and night he fed nobody could say accurately when or where there were rumors of a bunk in which he lay down with his clothes on but he seemed to be always wide awake and at the service of as many guest at once as if there had been half a dozen of him so much for old reminiscences the landlord of the anchor tavern had taken down his sign he had had the house thoroughly renovated and furnished it anew and kept it open in summer for a few boarders it happened more than once that the summer boarders were so much pleased with the place that they stayed on through the autumn and some of them through the winter the attractions of the village were really remarkable boating in summer and skating in winter iceboats too which the wild ducks could hardly keep up with fishing for which the lake was renowned varied and beautiful walks through the valley and up the hillsides houses sheltered from the north and northeasterly winds and refreshed in the hot summer days by the breeze which came over the water all this made the frame for a pleasing picture of rest and happiness but there was a great deal more than this there was a fine library in the little village presented and richly endowed by a wealthy native of the place there was a small permanent population of a superior character to that of an everyday country town there was a pretty little episcopal church with a goodhearted rector broad enough for the bishop of the diocese to be a little afraid of and hospitable to all outsiders of whom in the summer season there were always some who wanted a place of worship to keep their religion from dying out during the heathen months while the shepherds of the flocks to which they belonged were away from their empty folds what most helped to keep the place alive all through the year was the frequent coming together of the members of a certain literary association some time before the tavern took down its sign the landlord had built a hall where many a ball had been held to which the young folks of all the country round had resorted it was still sometimes used for similar occasions but it was especially notable as being the place of meeting of the famous pansophian society this association the name of which might be invidiously interpreted as signifying that its members knew everything had no such pretensions but as its constitution said very plainly and modestly held itself open to accept knowledge on any and all subjects from such as had knowledge to impart its president was the rector of the little chapel a man who in spite of the thirtynine articles could stand fire from the widestmouthed heretical blunderbuss without flinching or losing his temper the hall of the old anchor tavern was a convenient place of meeting for the students and instructors of the university and the institute sometimes in boatloads sometimes in carriageloads sometimes in processions of skaters they came to the meetings in pansophian hall as it was now commonly called these meetings had grown to be occasions of great interest it was customary to have papers written by members of the society for the most part but now and then by friends of the members sometimes by the students of the college or the institute and in rarer instances by anonymous personages whose papers having been looked over and discussed by the committee appointed for that purpose were thought worth listening to the variety of topics considered was very great the young ladies of the village and the institute had their favorite subjects the young gentlemen a different set of topics and the occasional outside contributors their own so that one who happened to be admitted to a meeting never knew whether he was going to hear an account of recent arctic discoveries or an essay on the freedom of the will or a psychological experience or a story or even a poem of late there had been a tendency to discuss the questions relating to the true status and the legitimate social functions of woman the most conflicting views were held on the subject many of the young ladies and some of the university students were strong in defence of all the womans rights doctrines some of these young people were extreme in their views they had read about semiramis and boadicea and queen elizabeth until they were ready if they could get the chance to vote for a woman as president of the united states or as general of the united states army they were even disposed to assert the physical equality of woman to man on the strength of the rather questionable history of the amazons and especially of the story believed to be authentic of the female bodyguard of the king of dahomey females frightful enough to need no other weapon than their looks to scare off an army of cossacks miss lurida vincent gold medallist of her year at the corinna institute was the leader of these advocates of virile womanhood it was rather singular that she should have elected to be the apostle of this extreme doctrine for she was herself far better equipped with brain than muscles in fact she was a largeheaded largeeyed longeyelashed slendernecked slightly developed young woman looking almost like a child at an age when many of the girls had reached their full stature and proportions in her studies she was so far in advance of her different classes that there was always a wide gap between her and the second scholar so fatal to all rivalry had she proved herself that she passed under the school name of the terror she learned so easily that she undervalued her own extraordinary gifts and felt the deepest admiration for those of her friends endowed with faculties of an entirely different and almost opposite nature after sitting at her desk until her head was hot and her feet were like ice she would go and look at the blooming young girls exercising in the gymnasium of the school and feel as if she would give all her knowledge all her mathematics and strange tongues and history all those accomplishments that made her the encyclopaedia of every class she belonged to if she could go through the series of difficult and graceful exercises in which she saw her schoolmates delighting one among them especially was the object of her admiration as she was of all who knew her exceptional powers in the line for which nature had specially organized her all the physical perfections which miss lurida had missed had been united in miss euthymia tower whose school name was the wonder though of full womanly stature there were several taller girls of her age while all her contours and all her movements betrayed a fine muscular development there was no lack of proportion and her finely shaped hands and feet showed that her organization was one of those carefully finished masterpieces of nature which sculptors are always in search of and find it hard to detect among the imperfect products of the living laboratory this girl of eighteen was more famous than she cared to be for her performances in the gymnasium she commonly contented herself with the same exercises that her companions were accustomed to only her dumbbells with which she exercised easily and gracefully were too heavy for most of the girls to do more with than lift them from the floor she was fond of daring feats on the trapeze and had to be checked in her indulgence in them the professor of gymnastics at the university came over to the institute now and then and it was a source of great excitement to watch some of the athletic exercises in which the young lady showed her remarkable muscular strength and skill in managing herself in the accomplishment of feats which looked impossible at first sight how often the terror had thought to herself that she would gladly give up all her knowledge of greek and the differential and integral calculus if she could only perform the least of those feats which were mere play to the wonder miss euthymia was not behind the rest in her attainments in classical or mathematical knowledge and she was one of the very best students in the outdoor branches botany mineralogy sketching from nature to be found among the scholars of the institute there was an eightoared boat rowed by a crew of the young ladies of which miss euthymia was the captain and pulled the bow oar poor little lurida could not pull an oar but on great occasions when there were many boats out she was wanted as coxswain being a mere featherweight and quickwitted enough to serve well in the important office where brains are more needed than muscle there was also an eightoared boat belonging to the university and rowed by a picked crew of stalwart young fellows the bow oar and captain of the university crew was a powerful young man who like the captain of the girls boat was a noted gymnast he had had one or two quiet trials with miss euthymia in which according to the ultras of the womans rights party he had not vindicated the superiority of his sex in the way which might have been expected indeed it was claimed that he let a cannonball drop when he ought to have caught it and it was not disputed that he had been ingloriously knocked over by a sandbag projected by the strong arms of the young maiden this was of course a story that was widely told and laughingly listened to and the captain of the university crew had become a little sensitive on the subject when there was a talk therefore about a race between the champion boats of the two institutions there was immense excitement in both of them as well as among the members of the pansophian society and all the good people of the village there were many objections to be overcome some thought it unladylike for the young maidens to take part in a competition which must attract many lookerson and which it seemed to them very hoidenish to venture upon some said it was a shame to let a crew of girls try their strength against an equal number of powerful young men these objections were offset by the advocates of the race by the following arguments they maintained that it was no more hoidenish to row a boat than it was to take a part in the calisthenic exercises and that the girls had nothing to do with the young mens boat except to keep as much ahead of it as possible as to strength the womans righters believed that weight for weight their crew was as strong as the other and of course due allowance would be made for the difference of weight and all other accidental hindrances it was time to test the boasted superiority of masculine muscle here was a chance if the girls beat the whole country would know it and after that female suffrage would be only a question of time such was the conclusion from rather insufficient premises it must be confessed but if nature does nothing per saltum by jumps as the old adage has it youth is very apt to take long leaps from a fact to a possible sequel or consequence so it had come about that a contest between the two boatcrews was looked forward to with an interest almost equal to that with which the combat between the horatii and curiatii was regarded the terms had been at last arranged between the two crews after cautious protocols and many diplomatic discussions it was so novel in its character that it naturally took a good deal of time to adjust it in such a way as to be fair to both parties the course must not be too long for the lighter and weaker crew for the staying power of the young persons who made it up could not be safely reckoned upon a certain advantage must be allowed them at the start and this was a delicate matter to settle the weather was another important consideration june would be early enough in all probability and if the lake should be tolerably smooth the grand affair might come off some time in that month any roughness of the water would be unfavorable to the weaker crew the rowingcourse was on the eastern side of the lake the startingpoint being opposite the anchor tavern from that three quarters of a mile to the south where the turningstake was fixed so that the whole course of one mile and a half would bring the boats back to their startingpoint the race was to be between the algonquin eightoared boat with outriggers rowed by young men students of stoughton university and the atalanta also eightoared and outrigger boat by young ladies from the corinna institute their boat was three inches wider than the other for various sufficient reasons one of which was to make it a little less likely to go over and throw its crew into the water which was a sound precaution though all the girls could swim and one at least the bow oar was a famous swimmer who had pulled a drowning man out of the water after a hard struggle to keep him from carrying her down with him though the coming trial had not been advertised in the papers so as to draw together a rabble of betting men and illconditioned lookerson there was a considerable gathering made up chiefly of the villagers and the students of the two institutions among them were a few who were disposed to add to their interest in the trial by small wagers the bets were rather in favor of the quins as the university boat was commonly called except where the natural sympathy of the young ladies or the gallantry of some of the young men led them to risk their gloves or cigars or whatever it might be on the atalantas the elements of judgment were these average weight of the algonquins one hundred and sixtyfive pounds average weight of the atalantas one hundred and fortyeight pounds skill in practice about equal advantage of the narrow boat equal to three lengths whole distance allowed the atalantas eight lengths a long stretch to be made up in a mile and a half and so both crews began practising for the grand trial ii the boatrace the th of june was a delicious summer day rather warm but still and bright the water was smooth and the crews were in the best possible condition all was expectation and for some time nothing but expectation no boatrace or regatta ever began at the time appointed for the start somebody breaks an oar or somebody fails to appear in season or something is the matter with a seat or an outrigger or if there is no such excuse the crew of one or both or all the boats to take part in the race must paddle about to get themselves ready for work to the infinite weariness of all the spectators who naturally ask why all this getting ready is not attended to beforehand the algonquins wore plain gray flannel suits and white caps the young ladies were all in dark blue dresses touched up with a red ribbon here and there and wore light straw hats the little coxswain of the atalanta was the last to step on board as she took her place she carefully deposited at her feet a white handkerchief wrapped about something or other perhaps a sponge in case the boat should take in water at last the algonquin shot out from the little nook where she lay long narrow shining swift as a pickerel when he darts from the reedy shore it was a beautiful sight to see the eight young fellows in their closefitting suits their brown muscular arms bare bending their backs for the stroke and recovering as if they were parts of a single machine the gals cant stan it agin them fellers said the old blacksmith from the village you wait till the gals get agoin said the carpenter who had often worked in the gymnasium of the corinna institute and knew something of their muscular accomplishments y ought to see em climb ropes and swing dumbbells and pull in them rowinmachines ask jake there whether they cant row a mild in doublequick time he knows all abaout it jake was by profession a fisherman and a freshwater fisherman in a country village is inspectorgeneral of all that goes on outofdoors being a lazy wandering sort of fellow whose study of the habits and habitats of fishes gives him a kind of shrewdness

depreciation all its own jake made his usual preliminary signal and delivered himself to the following effect wahl i don know jest what to say ive seed em both often enough when they was practisin an

petticoats the freshwater fisherman had expressed the prevailing belief that the young ladies were overmatched still there were not wanting those who thought the advantage allowed the lantas as they called the corinna boatcrew was too great and that it would be impossible for the quins to make it up and go by them the algonquins rowed up and down a few times before the spectators they appeared in perfect training neither too fat nor too fine mettlesome as colts steady as draughthorses deepbreathed as oxen disciplined to work together as symmetrically as a single sculler pulls his pair of oars the fisherman offered to make his quarter fifty cents no takers five minutes passed and all eyes were strained to the south looking for the atalanta a clump of trees hid the edge of the lake along which the corinnas boat was stealing towards the startingpoint presently the long shell swept into view with its blooming rowers who with their ample dresses seemed to fill it almost as full as raphael fills his skiff on the edge of the lake of galilee but how steadily the atalanta came on no rocking no splashing no apparent strain the bow oar turning to look ahead every now and then and watching her course which seemed to be straight as an arrow the beat of the strokes as true and regular as the pulse of the healthiest rower among them all and if the sight of the other boat and its crew was beautiful how lovely was the look of this eight young girls young ladies for those who prefer that more dignified and less attractive expression all in the flush of youth all in vigorous health every muscle taught its duty each rower alert not to be a tenth of a second out of time or let her oar dally with the water so as to lose an ounce of its propelling virtue every eye kindling with the hope of victory each of the boats was cheered as it came in sight but the cheers for the atalanta were naturally the loudest as the gallantry of one sex and the clear high voices of the other gave it life and vigor take your places shouted the umpire five minutes before the half hour the two boats felt their way slowly and cautiously to their positions which had been determined by careful measurement after a little backing and filling they got into line at the proper distance from each other and sat motionless their bodies bent forward their arms outstretched their oars in the water waiting for the word go shouted the umpire away sprang the atalanta and far behind her leaped the algonquin her oars bending like so many long indian bows as their blades flashed through the water a stern chase is a long chase especially when one craft is a great distance behind the other it looked as if it would be impossible for the rear boat to overcome the odds against it of course the algonquin kept gaining but could it possibly gain enough that was the question as the boats got farther and farther away it became more and more difficult to determine what change there was in the interval between them but when they came to rounding the stake it was easier to guess at the amount of space which had been gained it was clear that something like half the distance four lengths as nearly as could be estimated had been made up in rowing the first three quarters of a mile could the algonquins do a little better than this in the second half of the racecourse they would be sure of winning the boats had turned the stake and were coming in rapidly every minute the university boat was getting nearer the other go it quins shouted the students pull away lantas screamed the girls who were crowding down to the edge of the water nearer nearer the rear boat is pressing the other more and more closely a few more strokes and they will be even for there is but one length between them and thirty rods will carry them to the line it looks desperate for the atalantas the bow oar of the algonquin turns his head he sees the little coxswain leaning forward at every stroke as if her trivial weight were of such mighty consequence but a few ounces might turn the scale of victory as he turned he got a glimpse of the stroke oar of the atalanta what a flash of loveliness it was her face was like the reddest of june roses with the heat and the strain and the passion of expected triumph the upper button of her closefitting flannel suit had strangled her as her bosom heaved with exertion and it had given way before the fierce clutch she made at it the bow oar was a staunch and steady rower but he was human the blade of his oar lingered in the water a little more and he would have caught a crab and perhaps lost the race by his momentary bewilderment the boat which seemed as if it had all the life and nervousness of a derby threeyearold felt the slight check and all her men bent more vigorously to their oars the atalantas saw the movement and made a spurt to keep their lead and gain upon it if they could it was of no use the strong arms of the young men were too much for the young maidens only a few lengths remained to be rowed and they would certainly pass the atalanta before she could reach the line the little coxswain saw that it was all up with the girls crew if she could not save them by some strategic device dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirat she whispered to herself for the terror remembered her virgil as she did everything else she ever studied as she stooped she lifted the handkerchief at her feet and took from it a flaming bouquet look she cried and flung it just forward of the track of the algonquin the captain of the university boat turned his head and there was the lovely vision which had a moment before bewitched him the owner of all that loveliness must he thought have flung the bouquet it was a challenge how could he be such a coward as to decline accepting it he was sure he could win the race now and he would sweep past the line in triumph with the great bunch of flowers at the stem of his boat proud as van tromp in the british channel with the broom at his masthead he turned the boats head a little by backing water he came up with the floating flowers and near enough to reach them he stooped and snatched them up with the loss perhaps of a second in all no more he felt sure of his victory how can one tell the story of the finish in coldblooded preterites are we not there ourselves are not our muscles straining with those of these sixteen young creatures full of hot fresh blood their nerves all tingling like so many tightstrained harpstrings all their life concentrating itself in this passionate moment of supreme effort no we are seeing not telling about what somebody else once saw the bow of the algonquin passes the stern of the atalanta the bow of the algonquin is on a level with the middle of the atalanta three more lengths rowing and the college crew will pass the girls hurrah for the quins the algonquin ranges up alongside of the atalanta through with her shouts the captain of the algonquin now girls shrieks the captain of the atalanta they near the line every rower straining desperately almost madly crack goes the oar of the atalantas captain and up flash its splintered fragments as the stem of her boat springs past the line eighteen inches at least ahead of the algonquin hooraw for the lantas hooraw for the girls hooraw for the institoot shout a hundred voices hurrah for womans rights and female suffrage pipes the small voice of the terror and there is loud laughing and cheering all round she had not studied her classical dictionary and her mythology for nothing i have paid off one old score she said set down my damask roses against the golden apples of hippomenes it was that one second lost in snatching up the bouquet which gave the race to the atalantas iii the white canoe while the two boats were racing other boats with lookerson in them were rowing or sailing in the neighborhood of the racecourse the scene on the water was a gay one for the young people in the boats were many of them acquainted with each other there was a good deal of lively talk until the race became too exciting then many fell silent until as the boats neared the line and still more as they crossed it the shouts burst forth which showed how a cramp of attention finds its natural relief in a fit of convulsive exclamation but far away on the other side of the lake a birchbark canoe was to be seen in which sat a young man who paddled it skillfully and swiftly it was evident enough that he was watching the race intently but the spectators could see little more than that one of them however who sat upon the stand had a powerful spyglass and could distinguish his motions very minutely and exactly it was seen by this curious observer that the young man had an operaglass with him which he used a good deal at intervals the spectator thought he kept it directed to the girls boat chiefly if not exclusively he thought also that the operaglass was more particularly pointed towards the bow of the boat and came to the natural conclusion that the bow oar miss euthymia tower captain of the atalantas the wonder of the corinna institute was the attraction which determined the direction of the instrument who is that in the canoe over there asked the owner of the spyglass thats just what we should like to know answered the old landlords wife he and his man boarded with us when they first came but we could never find out anything about him only just his name and his ways of living his name is kirkwood maurice kirkwood esq it used to come on his letters as for his ways of living he was the solitariest human being that i ever came across his man carried his meals up to him he used to stay in his room pretty much all day but at night he would be off walking or riding on horseback or paddling about in the lake sometimes till nigh morning theres something very strange about that mr kirkwood but there dont seem to be any harm in him only nobody can guess what his business is they got up a story about him at one time what do you think they said he was a counterfeiter and so they went one night to his room when he was out and that man of his was away too and they carried keys and opened pretty much everything and they found well they found just nothing at all except writings and letters letters from places in america and in england and some with italian postmarks that was all since that time the sheriff and his folks have let him alone and minded their own business he was a gentleman anybody ought to have known that and anybody that knew about his nice ways of living and behaving and knew the kind of wear he had for his underclothing might have known it i could have told those officers that they had better not bother him i know the ways of real gentlemen and real ladies and i know those fellows in store clothes that look a little too fine outside wait till washingday comes the good lady had her own standards for testing humanity and they were not wholly unworthy of consideration they were quite as much to be relied on as the judgments of the travelling phrenologist who sent his accomplice on before him to study out the principal personages in the village and in the light of these revelations interpreted the bumps with very little regard to gall and spurzheim or any other authorities even with the small amount of information obtained by the search among his papers and effects the gossips of the village had constructed several distinct histories for the mysterious stranger he was an agent of a great publishing house a leading contributor to several important periodicals the author of that anonymously published novel which had made so much talk the poet of a large clothing establishment a spy of the italian some said the russian some said the british government a proscribed refugee from some country where he had been plotting a schoolmaster without a school a minister without a pulpit an actor without an engagement in short there was no end to the perfectly senseless stories that were told about him from that which made him out an escaped convict to the whispered suggestion that he was the eccentric heir to a great english title and estate the one unquestionable fact was that of his extraordinary seclusion nobody in the village no student in the university knew his history no young lady in the corinna institute had ever had a word from him sometimes as the boats of the university or the institute were returning at dusk their rowers would see the canoe stealing into the shadows as they drew near it sometimes on a moonlight night when a party of the young ladies were out upon the lake they would see the white canoe gliding ghostlike in the distance and it had happened more than once that when a boats crew had been out with singers among them while they were in the midst of a song the white canoe would suddenly appear and rest upon the water not very near them but within hearing distance and so remain until the singing was over when it would steal away and be lost sight of in some inlet or behind some jutting rock naturally enough there was intense curiosity about this young man the landlady had told her story which explained nothing there was nobody to be questioned about him except his servant an italian whose name was paolo but who to the village was known as mr paul mr paul would have seemed the easiest person in the world to worm a secret out of he was goodnatured childlike as a heathen chinee talked freely with everybody in such english as he had at command knew all the little people of the village and was followed round by them partly from his personal attraction for them and partly because he was apt to have a stick of candy or a handful of peanuts or other desirable luxury in his pocket for any of his little friends he met with he had that wholesome happy look so uncommon in our arid countrymen a look hardly to be found except where figs and oranges ripen in the open air a kindly climate to grow up in a religion which takes your money and gives you a stamped ticket good at saint peters box office a roomy chest and a good pair of lungs in it an honest digestive apparatus a lively temperament a cheerful acceptance of the place in life assigned to one by nature and circumstance these are conditions under which life may be quite comfortable to endure and certainly is very pleasant to contemplate all these conditions were united in paolo he was the easiest pleasantest creature to talk with that one could ask for a companion his southern vivacity his amusing english his simplicity and openness made him friends everywhere it seemed as if it would be a very simple matter to get the history of his master out of this guileless and unsophisticated being he had been tried by all the village experts the rector had put a number of wellstudied careless questions which failed of their purpose the old librarian of the town library had taken note of all the books he carried to his master and asked about his studies and pursuits paolo found it hard to understand his english apparently and answered in the most irrelevant way the leading gossip of the village tried her skill in pumping him for information it was all in vain his masters way of life was peculiar in fact eccentric he had hired rooms in an oldfashioned threestory house he had two rooms in the second and third stories of this old wooden building his study in the second his sleepingroom in the one above it paolo lived in the basement where he had all the conveniences for cooking and played the part of chef for his master and himself this was only a part of his duty for he was a manofallwork purveyor steward chambermaid as universal in his services for one man as pushee at the anchor tavern used to be for everybody it so happened that paolo took a severe cold one winters day and had such threatening symptoms that he asked the baker when he called to send the village physician to see him in the course of his visit the doctor naturally inquired about the health of paolos master signor kirkwood well molto bene said paolo why does he keep out of sight as he does asked the doctor he always so replied paolo una antipatia whether paolo was off his guard with the doctor whether he revealed it to him as to a father confessor or whether he thought it time that the reason of his masters seclusion should be known the doctor did not feel sure at any rate paolo was not disposed to make any further revelations una antipatia an antipathy that was all the doctor learned he thought the matter over and the more he reflected the more he was puzzled what could an antipathy be that made a young man a recluse was it a dread of blue sky and open air of the smell of flowers or some electrical impression to which he was unnaturally sensitive dr butts carried these questions home with him his wife was a sensible discreet woman whom he could trust with many professional secrets he told her of paolos revelation and talked it over with her in the light of his experience and her own for she had known some curious cases of constitutional likes and aversions mrs butts buried the information in the grave of her memory where it lay for nearly a week at the end of that time it emerged in a confidential whisper to her favorite sisterinlaw a perfectly safe person twentyfour hours later the story was all over the village that maurice kirkwood was the subject of a strange mysterious unheardof antipathy to something nobody knew what and the whole neighborhood naturally resolved itself into an unorganized committee of investigation iv what is a country village without its mysterious personage few are now living who can remember the advent of the handsome young man who was the mystery of our great university town sixty years since long enough ago for a romance to grow out of a narrative as waverley may remind us the writer of this narrative remembers him well and is not sure that he has not told the strange story in some form or other to the last generation or to the one before the last no matter if he has told it they have forgotten it that is if they have ever read it and whether they have or have not the story is singular enough to justify running the risk of repetition this young man with a curious name of scandinavian origin appeared unheralded in the town as it was then of cantabridge he wanted employment and soon found it in the shape of manual labor which he undertook and performed cheerfully but his whole appearance showed plainly enough that he was bred to occupations of a very different nature if in deed he had been accustomed to any kind of toil for his living his aspect was that of one of gentle birth his hands were not those of a laborer and his features were delicate and refined as well as of remarkable beauty who he was where he came from why he had come to cantabridge was never clearly explained he was alone without friends except among the acquaintances he had made in his new residence if he had any correspondents they were not known to the neighborhood where he was living but if he had neither friends nor correspondents there was some reason for believing that he had enemies strange circumstances occurred which connected themselves with him in an ominous and unaccountable way a threatening letter was slipped under the door of a house where he was visiting he had a sudden attack of illness which was thought to look very much like the effect of poison at one time he disappeared and was found wandering bewildered in a town many miles from that where he was residing when questioned how he came there he told a coherent story that he had been got under some pretext or in some not incredible way into a boat from which at a certain landingplace he had escaped and fled for his life which he believed was in danger from his kidnappers whoever his enemies may have been if they really existed he did not fall a victim to their plots so far as known to or remembered by this witness various interpretations were put upon his story conjectures were as abundant as they were in the case of kaspar hauser that he was of good family seemed probable that he was of distinguished birth not impossible that he was the dangerous rival of a candidate for a greatly coveted position in one of the northern states of europe was a favorite speculation of some of the more romantic young persons there was no dramatic ending to this story at least none is remembered by the present writer he left a name like the royal swede of whose lineage he may have been for aught that the village people knew but not a name at which anybody grew pale for he had swindled no one and broken no womans heart with false vows possibly some withered cheeks may flush faintly as they recall the handsome young man who came before the cantabridge maidens fully equipped for a hero of romance when the century was in its first quarter the writer has been reminded of the handsome swede by the incidents attending the advent of the unknown and interesting stranger who had made his appearance at arrowhead village it was a very insufficient and unsatisfactory reason to assign for the young mans solitary habits that he was the subject of an antipathy for what do we understand by that word when a young lady screams at the sight of a spider we accept her explanation that she has a natural antipathy to the creature when a person expresses a repugnance to some wholesome article of food agreeable to most people we are satisfied if he gives the same reason and so of various odors which are pleasing to some persons and repulsive to others we do not pretend to go behind the fact it is an individual and it may be a family peculiarity even between different personalities there is an instinctive elective dislike as well as an elective affinity we are not bound to give a reason why dr fell is odious to us any more than the prisoner who peremptorily challenges a juryman is bound to say why he does it it is enough that he does not like his looks there was nothing strange then that maurice kirkwood should have his special antipathy a great many other people have odd likes and dislikes but it was a very curious thing that this antipathy should be alleged as the reason for his singular mode of life all sorts of explanations were suggested not one of them in the least satisfactory but serving to keep the curiosity of inquirers active until they were superseded by a new theory one story was that maurice had a great fear of dogs it grew at last to a connected narrative in which a fright in childhood from a rabid mongrel was said to have given him such a sensitiveness to the near presence of dogs that he was liable to convulsions if one came close to him this hypothesis had some plausibility no other creature would be so likely to trouble a person who had an antipathy to it dogs are very apt to make the acquaintance of strangers in a free and easy way they are met with everywhere in ones daily walk at the thresholds of the doors one enters in the gentlemans library on the rug of my ladys sittingroom and on the cushion of her carriage it is true that there are few persons who have an instinctive repugnance to this friend of man but what if this socalled antipathy were only a fear a terror which borrowed the less unmanly name it was a fair question if indeed the curiosity of the public had a right to ask any questions at all about a harmless individual who gave no offence and seemed entitled to the right of choosing his way of living to suit himself without being submitted to espionage there was no positive evidence bearing on the point as yet but one of the village people had a large newfoundland dog of a very sociable disposition with which he determined to test the question he watched for the time when maurice should leave his house for the woods or the lake and started with his dog to meet him the animal walked up to the stranger in a very sociable fashion and began making his acquaintance after the usual manner of wellbred dogs that is with the courtesies and blandishments by which the canine chesterfield is distinguished from the illconditioned cur maurice patted him in a friendly way and spoke to him as one who was used to the fellowship of such companions that idle question and foolish story were disposed of therefore and some other solution must be found if possible a much more common antipathy is that which is entertained with regard to cats this has never been explained it is not mere aversion to the look of the creature or to any sensible quality known to the common observer the cat is pleasing in aspect graceful in movement nice in personal habits and of amiable disposition no cause of offence is obvious and yet there are many persons who cannot abide the presence of the most innocent little kitten they can tell in some mysterious way that there is a cat in the room when they can neither see nor hear the creature whether it is an electrical or quasimagnetic phenomenon or whatever it may be of the fact of this strange influence there are too many wellauthenticated instances to allow its being questioned but suppose maurice kirkwood to be the subject of this antipathy in its extremest degree it would in no manner account for the isolation to which he had condemned himself he might shun the firesides of the old women whose tabbies were purring by their footstools but these worthy dames do not make up the whole population these two antipathies having been disposed of a new suggestion was started and was talked over with a curious sort of half belief very much as ghost stories are told in a circle of moderately instructed and inquiring persons this was that maurice was endowed with the unenviable gift of the evil eye he was in frequent communication with italy as his letters showed and had recently been residing in that country as was learned from paolo now everybody knows that the evil eye is not rarely met with in italy everybody who has ever read mr storys roba di roma knows what a terrible power it is which the owner of the evil eye exercises it can blight and destroy whatever it falls upon no persons life or limb is safe if the jettatura the withering glance of the deadly organ falls upon him it must be observed that this malign effect may follow a look from the holiest personages that is if we may assume that a monk is such as a matter of course certainly we have a right to take it for granted that the late pope pius ninth was an eminently holy man and yet he had the name of dispensing the mystic and dreaded jettatura as well as his blessing if maurice kirkwood carried that destructive influence so that his clear blue eyes were more to be feared than the fascinations of the deadliest serpent it could easily be understood why he kept his look away from all around him whom he feared he might harm no sensible person in arrowhead village really believed in the evil eye but it served the purpose of a temporary hypothesis as do many suppositions which we take as a nucleus for our observations without putting any real confidence in them it was just suited to the romantic notions of the more flighty persons in the village who had meddled more or less with spiritualism and were ready for any new fancy if it were only wild enough the riddle of the young strangers peculiarity did not seem likely to find any very speedy solution every new suggestion furnished talk for the gossips of the village and the babble of the many tongues in the two educational institutions naturally the discussion was liveliest among the young ladies here is an extract from a letter of one of these young ladies who having received at her birth the everpleasing name of mary saw fit to have herself called mollie in the catalogue and in her letters the old postmaster of the town to which her letter was directed took it up to stamp and read on the envelope the direction to miss lulu pinrow he brought the stamp down with a vicious emphasis coming very near blotting out the nursery name instead of cancelling the postagestamp lulu he exclaimed i should like to know if that great strapping girl isnt out of her cradle yet i suppose miss louisa will think that belongs to her but i saw her christened and i heard the name the minister gave her and it was nt lulu or any such baby nonsense and so saying he gave it a fling to the box marked p as if it burned his fingers why a grownup young woman allowed herself to be cheapened in the way so many of them do by the use of names which become them as well as the frock of a tenyearold schoolgirl would become a graduate of the corinna institute the old postmaster could not guess he was a queer old man the letter thus scornfully treated runs over with a young girls written loquacity oh lulu there is such a sensation as you never saw or heard of in all your born days as mamma used to say he has been at the village for some time but lately we have had oh the weirdest stories about him the mysterious stranger is the name some give him but we girls call him the sachem because he paddles about in an indian canoe if i should tell you all the things that are said about him i should use up all my paper ten times over he has never made a visit to the institute and none of the girls have ever spoken to him but the people at the village say he is very very handsome we are dying to get a look at him of course though there is a horrid story about him that he has the evil eye did you ever hear about the evil eye if a person who is born with it looks at you you die or something happens awful is nt it the rector says he never goes to church but then you know a good many of the people that pass the summer at the village never do they think their religion must have vacations thats what ive heard they say vacations just like other hard work it ought not to be hard work im sure but i suppose they feel so about it should you feel afraid to have him look at you some of the girls say they would nt have him for the whole world but i shouldnt mind it especially if i had on my eyeglasses do you suppose if there is anything in the evil eye it would go through glass i dont believe it do you think blue eyeglasses would be better than common ones dont laugh at me they tell such weird stories the terror lurida vincent you knowmakes fun of all they say about it but then she knows everything and doesnt believe anything the girls say well i should be awfully scared i know if anybody that had the evil eye should look at me but oh i dont know but if it was a young man and if he was very very goodlooking i think perhaps i would run the risk but dont tell anybody i said any such horrid thing and burn this letter right up there s a dear good girl it is to be hoped that no reader will doubt the genuineness of this letter there are not quite so many awfuls and awfullys as one expects to find in young ladies letters but there are two weirds which may be considered a fair allowance how it happened that jolly did not show itself can hardly be accounted for no doubt it turns up two or three times at least in the postscript here is an extract from another letter this was from one of the students of stoughton university to a friend whose name as it was written on the envelope was mr frank mayfield the old postmaster who found fault with miss lulus designation would probably have quarrelled with this address if it had come under his eye frank is a very pretty pleasantsounding name and it is not strange that many persons use it in common conversation all their days when speaking of a friend were they really christened by that name any of these numerous franks perhaps they were and if so there is nothing to be said but if not was the baptismal name francis or franklin the mind is apt to fasten in a very perverse and unpleasant way upon this question which too often there is no possible way of settling one might hope if he outlived the bearer of the appellation to get at the fact but since even gravestones have learned to use the names belonging to childhood and infancy in their solemn record the generation which docks its christian names in such an unchristian way will bequeath whole churchyards full of riddles to posterity how it will puzzle and distress the historians and antiquarians of a coming generation to settle what was the real name of dan and bert and billy which last is legible on a white marble slab raised in memory of a grown person in a certain burialground in a town in essex county massachusetts but in the mean time we are forgetting the letter directed to mr frank mayfield dear frank hooray hurrah rah i have made the acquaintance of the mysterious stranger it happened by a queer sort of accident which came pretty near relieving you of the duty of replying to this letter i was out in my little boat which carries a sail too big for her as i know and ought to have remembered one of those fitful flaws of wind to which the lake is so liable struck the sail suddenly and over went my boat my feet got tangled in the sheet somehow and i could not get free i had hard work to keep my head above water and i struggled desperately to escape from my toils for if the boat were to go down i should be dragged down with her i thought of a good many things in the course of some four or five minutes i can tell you and i got a lesson about time better than anything kant and all the rest of them have to say of it after i had been there about an ordinary lifetime i saw a white canoe making toward me and i knew that our shy young gentleman was coming to help me and that we should become acquainted without an introduction so it was sure enough he saw what the trouble was managed to disentangle my feet without drowning me in the process or upsetting his little flimsy craft and as i was somewhat tired with my struggle took me in tow and carried me to the landing where he kept his canoe i cant say that there is anything odd about his manners or his way of talk i judge him to be a native of one of our northern states perhaps a new englander he has lived abroad during some parts of his life he is not an artist as it was at one time thought he might be he is a goodlooking fellow well developed manly in appearance with nothing to excite special remark unless it be a certain look of anxiety or apprehension which comes over him from time to time you remember our old friend squire b whose companion was killed by lightning when he was standing close to him you know the look he had whenever anything like a thundercloud came up in the sky well i should say there was a look like that came over this maurice kirkwoods face every now and then i noticed that he looked round once or twice as if to see whether some object or other was in sight there was a little rustling in the grass as if of footsteps and this look came over his features a rabbit ran by us and i watched to see if he showed any sign of that antipathy we have heard so much of but he seemed to be pleased watching the creature if you ask me what my opinion is about this maurice kirkwood i think he is eccentric in his habit of life but not what they call a crank exactly he talked well enough about such matters as we spoke of the lake the scenery in general the climate i asked him to come over and take a look at the college he did nt promise but i should not be surprised if i should get him over there some day i asked him why he did nt go to the pansophian meetings he did nt give any reason but he shook his head in a very peculiar way as much as to say that it was impossible on the whole i think it is nothing more than the same feeling of dread of human society or dislike for it which under the name of religion used to drive men into caves and deserts what a pity that protestantism does not make special provision for all the freaks of individual character if we had a little more faith and a few more caverns or convenient places for making them we should have hermits in these holes as thick as woodchucks or prairie dogs i should like to know if you never had the feeling oh that the desert were my dwellingplace i know what your answer will be of course you will say certainly with one fair spirit for my minister but i mean alone all alone dont you ever feel as if you should like to have been a pillarsaint in the days when faith was as strong as lye spelt with a y instead of being as weak as dishwater jerry is looking over my shoulder and says this pun is too bad to send and a disgrace to the university but never mind i often feel as if i should like to roost on a pillar a hundred feet high yes and have it soaped from top to bottom wouldnt it be fun to look down at the bores and the duns let us get up a pillarroosters association jerry still looking over says there is an absurd contradiction in the idea what a matteroffact idiot jerry is how do you like looking over mr inspector general the reader will not get much information out of this lively young fellows letter but he may get a little it is something to know that the mysterious resident of arrowhead village did not look nor talk like a crazy person that he was of agreeable aspect and address helpful when occasion offered and had nothing about him so far as yet appeared to prevent his being an acceptable member of society of course the people in the village could never be contented without learning everything there was to be learned about their visitor all the city papers were examined for advertisements if a cashier had absconded if a broker had disappeared if a railroad president was missing some of the old stories would wake up and get a fresh currency until some new circumstance gave rise to a new hypothesis unconscious of all these inquiries and fictions maurice kirkwood lived on in his inoffensive and unexplained solitude and seemed likely to remain an unsolved enigma the sachem of the boating girls became the sphinx of the village ramblers and it was agreed on all hands that egypt did not hold any hieroglyphics harder to make out than the meaning of this young mans odd way of living v the enigma studied it was a curious if it was not a suspicious circumstance that a young man seemingly in good health of comely aspect looking as if made for companionship should keep himself apart from all the world around him in a place where there was a general feeling of good neighborhood and a pleasant social atmosphere the public library was a central point which brought people together the pansophian society did a great deal to make them acquainted with each other for many of the meetings were open to outside visitors and the subjects discussed in the meetings furnished the material for conversation in their intervals a card of invitation had been sent by the secretary to maurice in answer to which paolo carried back a polite note of regret the paper had a narrow rim of black implying apparently some loss of relative or friend but not any very recent and crushing bereavement this refusal to come to the meetings of the society was only what was expected it was proper to ask him but his declining the invitation showed that he did not wish for attentions or courtesies there was nothing further to be done to bring him out of his shell and seemingly nothing more to be learned about him at present in this state of things it was natural that all which had been previously gathered by the few who had seen or known anything of him should be worked over again when there is no new ore to be dug the old refuse heaps are looked over for what may still be found in them the landlord of the anchor tavern now the head of the boardinghouse talked about maurice as everybody in the village did at one time or another he had not much to say but he added a fact or two the young gentleman was good pay so they all said sometimes he paid in gold sometimes in fresh bills just out of the bank he trusted his man mr paul with the money to pay his bills he knew something about horses he showed that by the way he handled that colt the one that threw the hostler and broke his collarbone mr paul come down to the stable let me see that cult you all fraid of says he my master he ride any hoss says paul you saddle him says be and so they did and paul he led that colt the kickinest and ugliest young beast you ever see in your life up to the place where his master as he calls him and he lives what does that kirkwood do but clap on a couple of long spurs and jump on to that colts back and off the beast goes tail up heels flying standing up on end trying all sorts of capers and at last going it full run for a couple of miles till hed got about enough of it that colt went off as ferce as a wildcat and come back as quiet as a cosset lamb a man that pays his bills reglar in good money and knows how to handle a hoss is three quarters of a gentleman if he is nt a whole one and most likely he is a whole one so spake the patriarch of the anchor tavern his wife had already given her favorable opinion of her former guest she now added something to her description as a sequel to her husbands remarks i call him she said about as likely a young gentleman as ever i clapped my eyes on he is rather slighter than i like to see a young man of his age if he was my sun i should like to see him a little more fleshy i dont believe he weighs more than a hundred and thirty or forty pounds did y ever look at those eyes of his mrandy just as blue as succory flowers i do like those lightcomplected young fellows with their fresh cheeks and their curly hair somehow curly hair doos set off anybodys face he is nt any foreigner for all that he talks italian with that mr paul thats his help he looks just like our kind of folks the college kind thats brought up among books and is handling em and reading of em and making of em as like as not all their lives all that you say about his riding the mad colt is just what i should think he was up to for hes as spry as a squirrel you ought to see him go over that fence as i did once i dont believe theres any harm in that young gentleman i dont care what people say i suppose he likes this place just as other people like it and cares more for walking in the woods and paddling about in the water than he doos for company and if he doos whose business is it i should like to know the third of the speakers was miranda who had her own way of judging people i never see him but two or three times miranda said i should like to have waited on him and got a chance to look stiddy at him when he was eatin his vittles that s the time to watch folks when their jaws get agoin and their eyes are on whats afore em do you remember that chap the sheriff come and took away

nobody can say after em but this gentleman knows good cookin and thats as good a sign of a gentleman as i want to tell em by vi still at fault the house in which maurice kirkwood had taken up his abode was not a very inviting one it was old and had been left in a somewhat dilapidated and disorderly condition by the tenants who had lived in the part which maurice now occupied they had piled their packingboxes in the cellar with broken chairs broken china and other household wrecks a cracked mirror lay on an old straw mattress the contents of which were airing themselves through wide rips and rents a lame clotheshorse was saddled with an old rug fringed with a ragged border out of which all the colors had been completely trodden no woman would have gone into a house in such a condition but the young man did not trouble himself much about such matters and was satisfied when the rooms which were to be occupied by himself and his servant were made decent and tolerably comfortable during the fine season all this was not of much consequence and if maurice made up his mind to stay through the winter he would have his choice among many more eligible places the summer vacation of the corinna institute had now arrived and the young ladies had scattered to their homes among the graduates of the year were miss euthymia tower and miss lurida vincent who had now returned to their homes in arrowhead village they were both glad to rest after the long final examinations and the exercises of the closing day in which each of them had borne a conspicuous part it was a pleasant life they led in the village which was lively enough at this season walking riding driving boating visits to the library meetings of the pansophian society hops and picnics made the time pass very cheerfully and soon showed their restoring influences the terrors large eyes did not wear the dull glazed look by which they had too often betrayed the after effects of overexcitement of the strong and active brain behind them the wonder gained a fresher bloom and looked full enough of life to radiate vitality into a statue of ice they had a boat of their own in which they passed many delightful hours on the lake rowing drifting reading telling of what had been dreaming of what might be the library was one of the chief centres of the fixed population and visited often by strangers the old librarian was a peculiar character as these officials are apt to be they have a curious kind of knowledge sometimes immense in its way they know the backs of books their titlepages their popularity or want of it the class of readers who call for particular works the value of different editions and a good deal besides their minds catch up hints from all manner of works on all kinds of subjects they will give a visitor a fact and a reference which they are surprised to find they remember and which the visitor might have hunted for a year every good librarian every private bookowner who has grown into his library finds he has a bunch of nerves going to every bookcase a branch to every shelf and a twig to every book these nerves get very sensitive in old librarians sometimes and they do not like to have a volume meddled with any more than they would like to have their naked eyes handled they come to feel at last that the books of a great collection are a part not merely of their own property though they are only the agents for their distribution but that they are as it were outlying portions of their own organization the old librarian was getting a miserly feeling about his books as he called them fortunately he had a young lady for his assistant who was never so happy as when she could find the work any visitor wanted and put it in his hands or her hands for there were more readers among the wives and daughters and especially among the aunts than there were among their male relatives the old librarian knew the books but the books seemed to know the young assistant so it looked at least to the impatient young people who wanted their services maurice had a good many volumes of his own a great many according to paolos account but paolos ideas were limited and a few wellfilled shelves seemed a very large collection to him his master frequently sent him to the public library for books which somewhat enlarged his notions still the signor was a very learned man he was certain and some of his white books bound in vellum and richly gilt were more splendid according to paolo than anything in the library there was no little curiosity to know what were the books that maurice was in the habit of taking out and the librarians record was carefully searched by some of the more inquisitive investigators the list proved to be a long and varied one it would imply a considerable knowledge of modern languages and of the classics a liking for mathematics and physics especially all that related to electricity and magnetism a fancy for the occult sciences if there is any propriety in coupling these words and a whim for odd and obsolete literature like the parthenologia of fortunius licetus the quaint treatise de sternutatione books about alchemy and witchcraft apparitions and modern works relating to spiritualism with these were the titles of novels and now and then of books of poems but it may be taken for granted that his own shelves held the works he was most frequently in the habit of reading or consulting not much was to be made out of this beyond the fact of wide scholarship more or less deep it might be but at any rate implying no small mental activity for he appeared to read very rapidly at any rate exchanged the books he had taken out for new ones very frequently to judge by his reading he was a man of letters but so widereading a man of letters must have an object a literary purpose in all probability why should not he be writing a novel not a novel of society assuredly for a hermit is not the person to report the talk and manners of a world which he has nothing to do with novelists and lawyers understand the art of cramming better than any other persons in the world why should not this young man be working up the picturesque in this romantic region to serve as a background for some story with magic perhaps and mysticism and hints borrowed from science and all sorts of outoftheway knowledge which his odd and miscellaneous selection of books furnished him that might be or possibly he was only reading for amusement who could say the funds of the public library of arrowhead village allowed the managers to purchase many books out of the common range of reading the two learned people of the village were the rector and the doctor these two worthies kept up the old controversy between the professions which grows out of the fact that one studies nature from below upwards and the other from above downwards the rector maintained that physicians contracted a squint which turns their eyes inwardly while the muscles which roll their eyes upward become palsied the doctor retorted that theological students developed a third eyelid the nictitating membrane which is so well known in birds and which serves to shut out not all light but all the light they do not want their little skirmishes did not prevent their being very good friends who had a common interest in many things and many persons both were on the committee which had the care of the library and attended to the purchase of books each was scholar enough to know the wants of scholars and disposed to trust the judgment of the other as to what books should be purchased consequently the clergyman secured the addition to the library of a good many old theological works which the physician would have called brimstone divinity and held to be just the thing to kindle fires with good books still for those who know how to use them oftentimes as awful examples of the extreme of disorganization the whole moral system may undergo when a barbarous belief has strangled the natural human instincts the physician in the mean time acquired for the collection some of those medical works where one may find recorded various rare and almost incredible cases which may not have their like for a whole century and then repeat themselves so as to give a new lease of credibility to stories which had come to be looked upon as fables both the clergyman and the physician took a very natural interest in the young man who had come to reside in their neighborhood for the present perhaps for a long period the rector would have been glad to see him at church he would have liked more especially to have had him hear his sermon on the duties of young men to society the doctor meanwhile was meditating on the duties of society to young men and wishing that he could gain the young mans confidence so as to help him out of any false habit of mind or any delusion to which he might be subject if he had the power of being useful to him dr butts was the leading medical practitioner not only of arrowhead village but of all the surrounding region he was an excellent specimen of the country doctor selfreliant selfsacrificing working a great deal harder for his living than most of those who call themselves the laboring classes as if none but those whose hands were hardened by the use of farming or mechanical implements had any work to do he had that sagacity without which learning is a mere incumbrance and he had also a fair share of that learning without which sagacity is like a traveller with a good horse but who cannot read the directions on the guideboards he was not a man to be taken in by names he well knew that oftentimes very innocentsounding words mean very grave disorders that all degrees of disease and disorder are frequently confounded under the same term that run down may stand for a fatigue of mind or body from which a week or a month of rest will completely restore the overworked patient or an advanced stage of a mortal illness that seedy may signify the mornings state of feeling after an evenings overindulgence which calls for a glass of sodawater and a cup of coffee or a dangerous malady which will pack off the subject of it at the shortest notice to the south of france he knew too well that what is spoken lightly of as a nervous disturbance may imply that the whole machinery of life is in a deranged condition and that every individual organ would groan aloud if it had any other language than the terrible inarticulate one of pain by which to communicate with the consciousness when therefore dr butts heard the word antipatia he did not smile and say to himself that this was an idle whim a foolish fancy which the young man had got into his head neither was he satisfied to set down everything to the account of insanity plausible as that supposition might seem he was prepared to believe in some exceptional perhaps anomalous form of exaggerated sensibility relating to what class of objects he could not at present conjecture but which was as vital to the subject of it as the insulating arrangement to a piece of electrical machinery with this feeling he began to look into the history of antipathies as recorded in all the books and journals on which he could lay his hands the holder of the portfolio asks leave to close it for a brief interval he wishes to say a few words to his readers before offering them some verses which have no connection with the narrative now in progress if one could have before him a set of photographs taken annually representing the same person as he or she appeared for thirty or forty or fifty years it would be interesting to watch the gradual changes of aspect from the age of twenty or even of thirty or forty to that of threescore and ten the face might be an uninteresting one still as sharing the inevitable changes wrought by time it would be worth looking at as it passed through the curve of life the vital parabola which betrays itself in the symbolic changes of the features an inscription is the same thing whether we read it on slatestone or granite or marble to watch the lights and shades the reliefs and hollows of a countenance through a lifetime or a large part of it by the aid of a continuous series of photographs would not only be curious it would teach us much more about the laws of physiognomy than we could get from casual and unconnected observations the same kind of interest without any assumption of merit to be found in them i would claim for a series of annual poems beginning in middle life and continued to what many of my correspondents are pleased to remind me as if i required to have the fact brought to my knowledge is no longer youth here is the latest of a series of annual poems read during the last thirtyfour years there seems to have been one interruption but there may have been other poems not recorded or remembered this the latest poem of the series was listened to by the scanty remnant of what was a large and brilliant circle of classmates and friends when the first of the long series was read before them then in the flush of ardent manhood the old song the minstrel of the classic lay of love and wine who sings still found the fingers run astray that touched the rebel strings of cadmus he would fair have sung of atreus and his line but all the jocund echoes rung with songs of love and wine ah brothers i would fair have caught some fresher fancys gleam my truant accents find unsought the old familiar theme love love but not the sportive child with shaft and twanging bow whose random arrows drove us wild some threescore years ago not eros with his joyous laugh the urchin blind and bare but love with spectacles and staff and scanty silvered hair our heads with frosted locks are white our roofs are thatched with snow but red in chilling winters spite our hearts and hearthstones glow our old acquaintance time drops in and while the running sands their golden thread unheeded spin he warms his frozen hands stay winged hours too swift too sweet and waft this message oer to all we miss from all we meet on lifes fastcrumbling shore say that to old affection true we hug the narrowing chain that binds our hearts alas how few the links that yet remain the fatal touch awaits them all that turns the rocks to dust from year to year they break and fall they break but never rust say if one note of happier strain this wornout harp afford one throb that trembles not in vain their memory lent its chord say that when fancy closed her wings and passion quenched his fire love love still echoed from the strings as from anacreons lyre january vii a record of antipathies in thinking the whole matter over dr butts felt convinced that with care and patience and watching his opportunity he should get at the secret which so far bad yielded nothing but a single word it might be asked why he was so anxious to learn what from all appearances the young stranger was unwilling to explain he may have been to some extent infected by the general curiosity of the persons around him in which good mrs butts shared and which she had helped to intensify by revealing the word dropped by paolo but this was not really his chief motive he could not look upon this young man living a life of unwholesome solitude without a natural desire to do all that his science and his knowledge of human nature could help him to do towards bringing him into healthy relations with the world about him still he would not intrude upon him in any way he would only make certain general investigations which might prove serviceable in case circumstances should give him the right to counsel the young man as to his course of life the first thing to be done was to study systematically the whole subject of antipathies then if any further occasion offered itself he would be ready to take advantage of it the resources of the public library of the place and his own private collection were put in requisition to furnish him the singular and widely scattered facts of which he was in search it is not every reader who will care to follow dr butts in his study of the natural history of antipathies the stories told about them are however very curious and if some of them may be questioned there is no doubt that many of the strangest are true and consequently take away from the improbability of others which we are disposed to doubt but in the first place what do we mean by an antipathy it is an aversion to some object which may vary in degree from mere dislike to mortal horror what the cause of this aversion is we cannot say it acts sometimes through the senses sometimes through the imagination sometimes through an unknown channel the relations which exist between the human being and all that surrounds him vary in consequence of some adjustment peculiar to each individual the brute fact is expressed in the phrase one mans meat is another mans poison in studying the history of antipathies the doctor began with those referable to the sense of taste which are among the most common in any collection of a hundred persons there will be found those who cannot make use of certain articles of food generally acceptable this may be from the disgust they occasion or the effects they have been found to produce every one knows individuals who cannot venture on honey or cheese or veal with impunity carlyle for example complains of having veal set before him a meat he could not endure there is a whole family connection in new england and that a very famous one to many of whose members in different generations all the products of the dairy are the subjects of a congenital antipathy montaigne says there are persons who dread the smell of apples more than they would dread being exposed to a fire of musketry the readers of the charming story a week in a french countryhouse will remember poor monsieur jacques piteous cry in the night ursula art thou asleep oh ursula thou sleepest but i cannot close my eyes dearest ursula there is such a dreadful smell oh ursula it is such a smell i do so wish thou couldst smell it goodnight my angeldearest i have found them they are apples the smell of roses of peonies of lilies has been known to cause faintness the sight of various objects has had singular effects on some persons a boars head was a favorite dish at the table of great people in marshal dalbrets time yet he used to faint at the sight of one it is not uncommon to meet with persons who faint at the sight of blood one of the most inveterately pugnacious of dr buttss collegemates confessed that he had this infirmity stranger and far more awkward than this is the case mentioned in an ancient collection where the subject of the antipathy fainted at the sight of any object of a red color there are sounds also which have strange effects on some individuals among the obnoxious noises are the crumpling of silk stuffs the sound of sweeping the croaking of frogs the effects in different cases have been spasms a sense of strangling profuse sweating all showing a profound disturbance of the nervous system all these effects were produced by impressions on the organs of sense seemingly by direct agency on certain nerve centres but there is another series of cases in which the imagination plays a larger part in the phenomena two notable examples are afforded in the lives of two very distinguished personages peter the great was frightened when an infant by falling from a bridge into the water long afterward when he had reached manhood this hardy and resolute man was so affected by the sound of wheels rattling over a bridge that he had to discipline himself by listening to the sound in spite of his dread of it in order to overcome his antipathy the story told by abbe boileau of pascal is very similar to that related of peter as he was driving in his coach and four over the bridge at neuilly his horses took fright and ran away and the leaders broke from their harness and sprang into the river leaving the wheelhorses and the carriage on the bridge ever after this fright it is said that pascal had the terrifying sense that he was just on the edge of an abyss ready to fall over what strange early impression was it which led a certain lady always to shriek aloud if she ventured to enter a church as it is recorded the old and simple way of accounting for it would be the scriptural one that it was an unclean spirit who dwelt in her and who when she entered the holy place and brought her spiritual tenant into the presence of the sacred symbols cried with a loud voice and came out of her a very singular case the doctor himself had recorded and which the reader may accept as authentic is the following at the head of the doctors front stairs stood and still stands a tall clock of early date and stately presence a middleaged visitor noticing it as he entered the front door remarked that he should feel a great unwillingness to pass that clock he could not go near one of those tall timepieces without a profound agitation which he dreaded to undergo this very singular idiosyncrasy he attributed to a fright when he was an infant in the arms of his nurse she was standing near one of those tall clocks when the cord which supported one of its heavy leaden weights broke and the weight came crashing down to the bottom of the case some effect must have been produced upon the pulpy nerve centres from which they never recovered why should not this happen when we know that a sudden mental shock may be the cause of insanity the doctor remembered the verse of the ancient mariner i moved my lips the pilot shrieked and fell down in a fit the holy hermit raised his eyes and prayed where he did sit i took the oars the pilots boy who now doth crazy go laughed loud and long and all the while his eyes went to and fro this is only poetry it is true but the poet borrowed the description from nature and the records of our asylums could furnish many cases where insanity was caused by a sudden fright more than this hardly a year passes that we do not read of some person a child commonly killed outright by terror scared to death literally sad cases they often are in which nothing but a surprise being intended the shock has instantly arrested the movements on which life depends if a mere instantaneous impression can produce effects like these such an impression might of course be followed by consequences less fatal or formidable but yet serious in their nature if here and there a person is killed as if by lightning by a sudden startling sight or sound there must be more numerous cases in which a terrible shock is produced by similar apparently insignificant causes a shock which falls short of overthrowing the reason and does not destroy life yet leaves a lasting effect upon the subject of it this point then was settled in the mind of dr butts namely that as a violent emotion caused by a sudden shock can kill or craze a human being there is no perversion of the faculties no prejudice no change of taste or temper no eccentricity no antipathy which such a cause may not rationally account for he would not be surprised he said to himself to find that some early alarm like that which was experienced by peter the great or that which happened to pascal had broken some spring in this young mans nature or so changed its mode of action as to account for the exceptional remoteness of his way of life but how could any conceivable antipathy be so comprehensive as to keep a young man aloof from all the world and make a hermit of him he did not hate the human race that was clear enough he treated paolo with great kindness and the italian was evidently much attached to him he had talked naturally and pleasantly with the young man he had helped out of his dangerous situation when his boat was upset dr butts heard that he had once made a short visit to this young man at his rooms in the university it was not misanthropy therefore which kept him solitary what could be broad enough to cover the facts of the case nothing that the doctor could think of unless it were some color the sight of which acted on him as it did on the individual before mentioned who could not look at anything red without fainting suppose this were a case of the same antipathy how very careful it would make the subject of it as to where he went and with whom he consorted time and patience would be pretty sure to bring out new developments and physicians of all men in the world know how to wait as well as how to labor such were some of the crude facts as dr butts found them in books or gathered them from his own experience he soon discovered that the story had got about the village that maurice kirkwood was the victim of an antipathy whatever that word might mean in the vocabulary of the people of the place if he suspected the channel through which it had reached the little community and spreading from that centre the country round he did not see fit to make out of his suspicions a domestic casus belli paolo might have mentioned it to others as well as to himself maurice might have told some friend who had divulged it but to accuse mrs butts good mrs butts of petit treason in telling one of her husbands professional secrets was too serious a matter to be thought of he would be a little more careful he promised himself the next time at any rate for he had to concede in spite of every wish to be charitable in his judgment that it was among the possibilities that the worthy lady had forgotten the rule that a doctors patients must put their tongues out and a doctors wife must keep her tongue in viii the pansophian society the secretary of this association was getting somewhat tired of the office and the office was getting somewhat tired of him it occurred to the members of the society that a little fresh blood infused into it might stir up the general vitality of the organization the woman suffragists saw no reason why the place of secretary need as a matter of course be filled by a person of the male sex they agitated they made domiciliary visits they wrote notes to influential citizens and finally announced as their candidate the young lady who had won and worn the school name of the terror who was elected she was just the person for the place wide awake with all her wits about her full of every kind of knowledge and above all strong on points of order and details of management so that she could prompt the presiding officer to do which is often the most essential duty of a secretary the president the worthy rector was good at plain sailing in the track of the common moralities and proprieties but was liable to get muddled if anything came up requiring swift decision and offhand speech the terror had schooled herself in the debating societies of the institute and would set up the president when he was floored by an awkward question as easily as if he were a ninepin which had been bowled over it has been already mentioned that the pansophian society received communications from time to time from writers outside of its own organization of late these had been becoming more frequent many of them were sent in anonymously and as there were numerous visitors to the village and two institutions not far removed from it both full of ambitious and intelligent young persons it was often impossible to trace the papers to their authors the new secretary was alive with curiosity and as sagacious a little body as one might find if in want of a detective she could make a pretty shrewd guess whether a paper was written by a young or old person by one of her own sex or the other by an experienced hand or a novice among the anonymous papers she received was one which exercised her curiosity to an extraordinary degree she felt a strong suspicion that the sachem as the boatcrews used to call him the recluse the nighthawk the sphinx as others named him must be the author of it it appeared to her the production of a young person of a reflective poetical turn of mind it was not a womans way of writing at least so thought the secretary the writer had travelled much had resided in italy among other places but so had many of the summer visitors and residents of arrowhead village the handwriting was not decisive it had some points of resemblance with the pencilled orders for books which maurice sent to the library but there were certain differences intentional or accidental which weakened this evidence there was an undertone in the essay which was in keeping with the mode of life of the solitary stranger it might be disappointment melancholy or only the dreamy sadness of a young person who sees the future he is to climb not as a smooth ascent but as overhanging him like a cliff ready to crush him with all his hopes and prospects this interpretation may have been too imaginative but here is the paper and the reader can form his own opinion my three companions i have been from my youth upwards a wanderer i do not mean constantly flitting from one place to another for my residence has often been fixed for considerable periods from time to time i have put down in a notebook the impressions made upon me by the scenes through which i have passed i have long hesitated whether to let any of my notes appear before the public my fear has been that they were too subjective to use the metaphysicians term that i have seen myself reflected in nature and not the true aspects of nature as she was meant to be understood one who should visit the harz mountains would see might see rather his own colossal image shape itself on the morning mist but if in every mist that rises from the meadows in every cloud that hangs upon the mountain he always finds his own reflection we cannot accept him as an interpreter of the landscape there must be many persons present at the meetings of the society to which this paper is offered who have had experiences like that of its author they have visited the same localities they have had many of the same thoughts and feelings many i have no doubt not all no not all others have sought the companionship of nature i have been driven to it much of my life has been passed in that communion these pages record some of the intimacies i have formed with her under some of her various manifestations i have lived on the shore of the great ocean where its waves broke wildest and its voice rose loudest i have passed whole seasons on the banks of mighty and famous rivers i have dwelt on the margin of a tranquil lake and floated through many a long long summer day on its clear waters i have learned the various language of nature of which poetry has spoken at least i have learned some words and phrases of it i will translate some of these as i best may into common speech the ocean says to the dweller on its shores you are neither welcome nor unwelcome i do not trouble myself with the living tribes that come down to my waters i have my own people of an older race than yours that grow to mightier dimensions than your mastodons and elephants more numerous than all the swarms that fill the air or move over the thin crust of the earth who are you that build your palaces on my margin i see your white faces as i saw the dark faces of the tribes that came before you as i shall look upon the unknown family of mankind that will come after you and what is your whole human family but a parenthesis in a single page of my history the raindrops stereotyped themselves on my beaches before a living creature left his footprints there this horseshoecrab i fling at your feet is of older lineage than your adam perhaps indeed you count your adam as one of his descendants what feeling have i for you not scorn not hatred not love not loathing no indifference blank indifference to you and your affairs that is my feeling say rather absence of feeling as regards you oh yes i will lap your feet i will cool you in the hot summer days i will bear you up in my strong arms i will rock you on my rolling undulations like a babe in his cradle am i not gentle am i not kind am i not harmless but hark the wind is rising and the wind and i are rough playmates what do you say to my voice now do you see my foaming lips do you feel the rocks tremble as my huge billows crash against them is not my anger terrible as i dash your argosy your thunderbearing frigate into fragments as you would crack an eggshell no not anger deaf blind unheeding indifference that is all out of me all things arose sooner or later into me all things subside all changes around me i change not i look not at you vain man and your frail transitory concerns save in momentary glimpses i look on the white face of my dead mistress whom i follow as the bridegroom follows the bier of her who has changed her nuptial raiment for the shroud ye whose thoughts are of eternity come dwell at my side continents and islands grow old and waste and disappear the hardest rock crumbles vegetable and animal kingdoms come into being wax great decline and perish to give way to others even as human dynasties and nations and races come and go look on me time writes no wrinkle on my forehead listen to me all tongues are spoken on my shores but i have only one language the winds taught me their vowels the crags and the sands schooled me in my rough or smooth consonants few words are mine but i have whispered them and sung them and shouted them to men of all tribes from the time when the first wild wanderer strayed into my awful presence have you a grief that gnaws at your heartstrings come with it to my shore as of old the priest of fardarting apollo carried his rage and anguish to the margin of the loudroaring sea there if anywhere you will forget your private and shortlived woe for my voice speaks to the infinite and the eternal in your consciousness to him who loves the pages of human history who listens to the voices of the world about him who frequents the market and the thoroughfare who lives in the study of time and its accidents rather than in the deeper emotions in abstract speculation and spiritual contemplation the river addresses itself as his natural companion come live with me i am active cheerful communicative a natural talker and storyteller i am not noisy like the ocean except occasionally when i am rudely interrupted or when i stumble and get a fall when i am silent you can still have pleasure in watching my changing features my idlest babble when i am toying with the trifles that fall in my way if not very full of meaning is at least musical i am not a dangerous friend like the ocean no highway is absolutely safe but my nature is harmless and the storms that strew the beaches with wrecks cast no ruins upon my flowery borders abide with me and you shall not die of thirst like the forlorn wretches left to the mercies of the pitiless salt waves trust yourself to me and i will carry you far on your journey if we are travelling to the same point of the compass if i sometimes run riot and overflow your meadows i leave fertility behind me when i withdraw to my natural channel walk by my side toward the place of my destination i will keep pace with you and you shall feel my presence with you as that of a selfconscious being like yourself you will find it hard to be miserable in my company i drain you of illconditioned thoughts as i carry away the refuse of your dwelling and its grounds but to him whom the ocean chills and crushes with its sullen indifference and the river disturbs with its neverpausing and neverending story the silent lake shall be a refuge and a place of rest for his soul vex not yourself with thoughts too vast for your limited faculties it says yield not yourself to the babble of the running stream leave the ocean which cares nothing for you or any living thing that walks the solid earth leave the river too busy with its own errand too talkative about its own affairs and find peace with me whose smile will cheer you whose whisper will soothe you come to me when the morning sun blazes across my bosom like a golden baldric come to me in the still midnight when i hold the inverted firmament like a cup brimming with jewels nor spill one star of all the constellations that float in my ebon goblet do you know the charm of melancholy where will you find a sympathy like mine in your hours of sadness does the ocean share your grief does the river listen to your sighs the salt wave that called to you from under last months full moon today is dashing on the rocks of labrador the stream that ran by you pure and sparkling has swallowed the poisonous refuse of a great city and is creeping to its grave in the wide cemetery that buries all things in its tomb of liquid crystal it is true that my waters exhale and are renewed from one season to another but are your features the same absolutely the same from year to year we both change but we know each other through all changes am i not mirrored in those eyes of yours and does not nature plant me as an eye to behold her beauties while she is dressed in the glories of leaf and flower and draw the icy lid over my shining surface when she stands naked and ashamed in the poverty of winter i have had strange experiences and sad thoughts in the course of a life not very long but with a record which much longer lives could not match in incident oftentimes the temptation has come over me with dangerous urgency to try a change of existence if such change is a part of human destiny to seek rest if that is what we gain by laying down the burden of life i have asked who would be the friend to whom i should appeal for the last service i should have need of ocean was there all ready asking no questions answering none what strange voyages downward through its glaucous depths upwards to its boiling and frothing surface wafted by tides driven by tempests disparted by rude agencies one remnant whitening on the sands of a northern beach one perhaps built into the circle of a coral reef in the pacific one settling to the floor of the vast laboratory where continents are built to emerge in faroff ages what strange companions for my pallbearers unwieldy seamonsters the stories of which are counted fables by the spectacled collectors who think their catalogues have exhausted nature nakedeyed creatures staring glaring nightmarelike spectres of the ghastlygreen abysses pulpy islands with life in gelatinous immensity what a company of hungry heirs at every ocean funeral no no ocean claims great multitudes but does not invite the solitary who would fain be rid of himself shall i seek a deeper slumber at the bottom of the lake i love than i have ever found when drifting idly over its surface no again i do not want the sweet clear waters to know me in the disgrace of nature when life the faithful bodyservant has ceased caring for me that must not be the mirror which has pictured me so often shall never know me as an unwelcome object if i must ask the allsubduing element to be my last friend and lead me out of my prison it shall be the busy whispering not unfriendly pleasantly companionable river but ocean and river and lake have certain relations to the periods of human life which they who are choosing their places of abode should consider let the child play upon the seashore the wide horizon gives his imagination room to grow in untrammelled that background of mystery without which life is a poor mechanical arrangement is shaped and colored so far as it can have outline or any hue but shadow on a vast canvas the contemplation of which enlarges and enriches the sphere of consciousness the mighty ocean is not too huge to symbolize the aspirations and ambitions of the yet untried soul of the adolescent the time will come when his indefinite mental horizon has found a solid limit which shuts his prospect in narrower bounds than he would have thought could content him in the years of undefined possibilities then he will find the river a more natural intimate than the ocean it is individual which the ocean with all its gulfs and inlets and multitudinous shores hardly seems to be it does not love you very dearly and will not miss you much when you disappear from its margin but it means well to you bids you goodmorning with its coming waves and goodevening with those which are leaving it will lead your thoughts pleasantly away upwards to its source downwards to the stream to which it is tributary or the wide waters in which it is to lose itself a river by choice to live by in middle age in hours of melancholy reflection in those last years of life which have little left but tender memories the still companionship of the lake embosomed in woods sheltered fed by sweet mountain brooks and hidden springs commends itself to the wearied and saddened spirit i am not thinking of those great inland seas which have many of the features and much of the danger that belong to the ocean but of those ponds as our countrymen used to call them until they were rechristened by summer visitors beautiful sheets of water from a hundred to a few thousand acres in extent scattered like raindrops over the map of our northern sovereignties the loneliness of contemplative old age finds its natural home in the near neighborhood of one of these tranquil basins nature does not always plant her poets where they belong but if we look carefully their affinities betray themselves the youth will carry his byron to the rock which overlooks the ocean the poet loved so well the man of maturer years will remember that the sonorous couplets of pope which ring in his ears were written on the banks of the thames the old man as he nods over the solemn verse of wordsworth will recognize the affinity between the singer and the calm sheet that lay before him as he wrote the stainless and sleepy windermere the dwellers by cedar lake may find it an amusement to compare their own feelings with those of one who has lived by the atlantic and the mediterranean by the nile and the tiber by lake leman and by one of the fairest sheets of water that our own north america embosoms in its forests miss lurida vincent secretary of the pansophian society read this paper and pondered long upon it she was thinking very seriously of studying medicine and had been for some time in frequent communication with dr butts under whose direction she had begun reading certain treatises which added to such knowledge of the laws of life in health and in disease as she had brought with her from the corinna institute naturally enough she carried the anonymous paper to the doctor to get his opinion about it and compare it with her own they both agreed that it was probably they would not say certainly the work of the solitary visitor there was room for doubt for there were visitors who might well have travelled to all the places mentioned and resided long enough on the shores of the waters the writer spoke of to have had all the experiences mentioned in the paper the terror remembered a young lady a former schoolmate who belonged to one of those nomadic families common in this generation the heads of which especially the female heads can never be easy where they are but keep going between america and europe like so many pithballs in the electrical experiment alternately attracted and repelled never in contented equilibrium every few years they pull their families up by the roots and by the time they have begun to take hold a little with their radicles in the spots to which they have been successively transplanted up they come again so that they never get a taproot anywhere the terror suspected the daughter of one of these families of sending certain anonymous articles of not dissimilar character to the one she had just received but she knew the style of composition common among the young girls and she could hardly believe that it was one of them who had sent this paper could a brother of this young lady have written it possibly she knew nothing more than that the young lady had a brother then a student at the university all the chances were that mr maurice kirkwood was the author so thought lurida and so thought dr butts whatever faults there were in this essay it interested them both there was nothing which gave the least reason to suspect insanity on the part of the writer whoever he or she might be there were references to suicide it is true but they were of a purely speculative nature and did not look to any practical purpose in that direction besides if the stranger were the author of the paper he certainly would not choose a sheet of water like cedar lake to perform the last offices for him in case he seriously meditated taking unceremonious leave of life and its accidents he could find a river easily enough to say nothing of other methods of effecting his purpose but he had committed himself as to the impropriety of selecting a lake so they need not be anxious about the white canoe and its occupant as they watched it skimming the surface of the deep waters the holder of the portfolio would never have ventured to come before the public if he had not counted among his resources certain papers belonging to the records of the pansophian society which he can make free use of either for the illustration of the narrative or for a diversion during those intervals in which the flow of events is languid or even ceases for the time to manifest any progress the reader can hardly have failed to notice that the old anchor tavern had become the focal point where a good deal of mental activity converged there were the village people including a number of cultivated families there were the visitors among them many accomplished and widely travelled persons there was the university with its learned teachers and aspiring young men there was the corinna institute with its eager ambitious hungrysouled young women crowding on class after class coming forward on the broad stream of liberal culture and rounding the point which once passed the boundless possibilities of womanhood opened before them all this furnished material enough and to spare for the records and the archives of the society the new secretary infused fresh life into the meetings it may be remembered that the girls had said of her when she was the terror that she knew everything and didnt believe anything that was just the kind of person for a secretary of such an association properly interpreted the saying meant that she knew a great deal and wanted to know a great deal more and was consequently always on the lookout for information that she believed nothing without sufficient proof that it was true and therefore was perpetually asking for evidence where others took assertions on trust it was astonishing to see what one little creature like the terror could accomplish in the course of a single season she found out what each member could do and wanted to do she wrote to the outside visitors whom she suspected of capacity and urged them to speak at the meetings or send written papers to be read as an official with the printed title at the head of her notes pansophian society she was a privileged personage she begged the young persons who had travelled to tell something of their experiences she had contemplated getting up a discussion on the womans rights question but being a wary little body and knowing that the debate would become a dispute and divide the members into two hostile camps she deferred this project indefinitely it would be time enough after she had her team well in hand she said to herself had felt their mouths and tried their paces this expression as she used it in her thoughts seems rather foreign to her habits but there was room in her large brain for a wide range of illustrations and an ample vocabulary she could not do much with her own muscles but she had known the passionate delight of being whirled furiously over the road behind four scampering horses in a rocking stagecoach and thought of herself in the secretarys chair as not unlike the driver on his box a few weeks of rest had allowed her nervous energy to store itself up and the same powers which had distanced competition in the classes of her school had of necessity to expend themselves in vigorous action in her new office her appeals had their effect a number of papers were very soon sent in some with names some anonymously she looked these papers over and marked those which she thought would be worth reading and listening to at the meetings one of them has just been presented to the reader as to the authorship of the following one there were many conjectures a wellknown writer who had spent some weeks at arrowhead village was generally suspected of being its author some however questioned whether it was not the work of a new hand who wrote not from experience but from his or her ideas of the condition to which a storyteller a novelist must in all probability be sooner or later reduced the reader must judge for himself whether this first paper is the work of an old hand or a novice some experiences of a novelist i have written a frightful number of stories forty or more i think let me see for twelve years two novels a year regularly that makes twentyfour in three different years i have written three stories annually that makes thirtythree in five years one a year thirtyeight that is all is nt it yes thirtyeight not forty i wish i could make them all into one composite story as mr galton does his faces hero heroine mamma papa uncle sister and so on love obstacles misery tears despair glimmer of hope unexpected solution of difficulties happy finale landscape for background according to season plants of each month got up from botanical calendars i should like much to see the composite novel why not apply mr galtons process and get thirtyeight stories all in one all the yankees would resolve into one yankee all the pwest britons into one patrick etc what a saving of time it would be i got along pretty well with my first few stories i had some characters around me which a little disguised answered well enough there was the minister of the parish and there was an old schoolmaster either of them served very satisfactorily for grandfathers and old uncles all i had to do was to shift some of their leading peculiarities keeping the rest the old minister wore kneebreeches i clapped them on to the schoolmaster the schoolmaster carried a tall goldheaded cane i put this in the ministers hands so with other things i shifted them round and got a set of characters who taken together reproduced the chief persons of the village where i lived but did not copy any individual exactly thus it went on for a while but by and by my stock company began to be rather too familiarly known in spite of their change of costume and at last some altogether too sagacious person published what he called a key to several of my earlier stories in which i found the names of a number of neighbors attached to aliases of my own invention all the types as he called them represented by these personages of my story had come to be recognized each as standing for one and the same individual of my acquaintance it had been of no use to change the costume even changing the sex did no good i had a famous old gossip in one of my tales a muchbabbling widow sertingly sho they all said that s old deacon spinner the same he told about in that other story of his only the deacons got on a petticoat and a mobcap but its the same old sixpence so i said to myself i must have some new characters i had no trouble with young characters they are all pretty much alike darkhaired or lighthaired with the outfits belonging to their complexion respectively i had an old greataunt who was a tiptop eccentric i had never seen anything just like her in books so i said i will have you old lady in one of my stories and sure enough i fitted her out with a firstrate oddsounding name which i got from the directory and sent her forth to the world disguised as i supposed beyond the possibility of recognition the book sold well and the eccentric personage was voted a novelty a few weeks after it was published a lawyer called upon me as the agent of the person in the directory whose family name i had used as he maintained to his and all his relatives great damage wrong loss grief shame and irreparable injury for which the sum of blank thousand dollars would be a modest compensation the story made the book sell but not enough to pay blank thousand dollars in the mean time a cousin of mine had sniffed out the resemblance between the character in my book and our greataunt we were rivals in her good graces cousin pansie spoke to her of my book and the trouble it was bringing on me she was so sorry about it she liked my story only those personalities you know what personalities says old grannyaunt why auntie dear they do say that he has brought in everybody we know did nt anybody tell you about well i suppose you ought to know it did nt anybody tell you you were made fun of in that novel somebody no matter who happened to hear all this and told me she said grannyaunts withered old face had two red spots come to it as if she had been painting her cheeks from a pink saucer no she said not a pink saucer but as if they were two coals of fire she sent out and got the book and made her the somebody that i was speaking of read it to her when she had heard as much as she could stand for cousin pansie explained passages to her explained you know she sent for her lawyer and that same somebody had to be a witness to a new will she had drawn up it was not to my advantage cousin pansie got the corner lot where the grocery is and pretty much everything else the old woman left me a legacy what do you think it was an old set of my own books that looked as if it had been bought out of a bankrupt circulating library after that i grew more careful i studied my disguises much more diligently but after all what could i do here i was writing stories for my living and my reputation i made a pretty sum enough and worked hard enough to earn it no tale no money then every story that went from my workshop had to come up to the standard of my reputation and there was a set of critics there is a set of critics now and everywhere that watch as narrowly for the decline of a mans reputation as ever a village half drowned out by an inundation watched for the falling of the waters the fame i had won such as it was seemed to attend me not going before me in the shape of a woman with a trumpet but rather following me like one of actaeons hounds his throat open ready to pull me down and tear me what a fierce enemy is that which bays behind us in the voice of our proudest bygone achievement but as i said above what could i do i must write novels and i must have characters then why not invent them asks some novice oh yes invent them you can invent a human being that in certain aspects of humanity will answer every purpose for which your invention was intended a basket of straw an old coat and pair of breeches a hat which has been soaked sat upon stuffed a broken window and had a brood of chickens raised in it these elements duly adjusted to each other will represent humanity so truthfully that the crows will avoid the cornfield when your scarecrow displays his personality do you think you can make your heroes and heroines nay even your scrappy supernumeraries out of refuse material as you made your scarecrow you cant do it you must study living people and reproduce them and whom do you know so well as your friends you will show up your friends then one after another when your friends give out who is left for you why nobody but your own family of course when you have used up your family there is nothing left for you but to write your autobiography after my experience with my grandaunt i be came more cautious very naturally i kept traits of character but i mixed ages as well as sexes in this way i continued to use up a large amount of material which looked as if it were as dangerous as dynamite to meddle with who would have expected to meet my maternal uncle in the guise of a schoolboy yet i managed to decant his characteristics as nicely as the old gentleman would have decanted a bottle of juno madeira through that long siphon which he always used when the most sacred vintages were summoned from their crypts to render an account of themselves on his hospitable board it was a nice business i confess but i did it and i drink cheerfully to that good uncles memory in a glass of wine from his own cellar which with many other more important tokens of his good will i call my own since his lamented demise i succeeded so well with my uncle that i thought i would try a course of cousins i had enough of them to furnish out a whole gallery of portraits there was cousin creeshy as we called her lucretia more correctly she was a cripple her left lower limb had had something happen to it and she walked with a crutch her patience under her trial was very pathetic and picturesque so to speak i mean adapted to the tender parts of a story nothing could work up better in a melting paragraph but i could not of course describe her particular infirmity that would point her out at once i thought of shifting the lameness to the right lower limb but even that would be seen through so i gave the young woman that stood for her in my story a lame elbow and put her arm in a sling and made her such a model of uncomplaining endurance that my grandmother cried over her as if her poor old heart would break she cried very easily my grandmother in fact she had such a gift for tears that i availed myself of it and if you remember old judy in my novel honi soit honey sweet the booksellers called it old judy the blacknurse that was my grandmother she had various other peculiarities which i brought out one by one and saddled on to different characters you see she was a perfect mine of singularities and idiosyncrasies after i had used her up pretty well i came dawn upon my poor relations they were perfectly fair game what better use could i put them to i studied them up very carefully and as there were a good many of them i helped myself freely they lasted me with occasional intermissions i should say three or four years i had to be very careful with my poor relations they were as touchy as they could be and as i felt bound to send a copy of my novel whatever it might be to each one of them there were as many as a dozen i took care to mix their characteristic features so that though each might suspect i meant the other no one should think i meant him or her i got through all my relations at last except my father and mother i had treated my brothers and sisters pretty fairly all except elisha and joanna the truth is they both had lots of odd ways family traits i suppose but were just different enough from each other to figure separately in two different stories these two novels made me some little trouble for elisha said he felt sure that i meant joanna in one of them and quarrelled with me about it and joanna vowed and declared that elnathan in the other stood for brother lisha and that it was a real mean thing to make fun of folks own flesh and blood and treated me to one of her cries she was nt handsome when she cried poor dear joanna in fact that was one of the personal traits i had made use of in the story that elisha found fault with so as there was nobody left but my father and mother you see for yourself i had no choice there was one great advantage in dealing with them i knew them so thoroughly one naturally feels a certain delicacy it handling from a purely artistic point of view persons who have been so near to him ones mother for instance suppose some of her little ways were so peculiar that the accurate delineation of them would furnish amusement to great numbers of readers it would not be without hesitation that a writer of delicate sensibility would draw her portrait with all its whimsicalities so plainly that it should be generally recognized ones father is commonly of tougher fibre than ones mother and one would not feel the same scruples perhaps in using him professionally as material in a novel still while you are employing him as bait you see i am honest and plainspoken for your characters are baits to catch readers with i would follow kind izaak waltons humane counsel about the frog you are fastening to your fishhook fix him artistically as he directs but in so doing i use him as though you loved him i have at length shown up in one form and another all my townsmen who have anything effective in their bodily or mental makeup all my friends all my relatives that is all my blood relatives it has occurred to me that i might open a new field in the family connection of my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw we have been thinking of paying them a visit and i shall have an admirable opportunity of studying them and their relatives and visitors i have long wanted a good chance for getting acquainted with the social sphere several grades below that to which i am accustomed and i have no doubt that i shall find matter for half a dozen new stories among those connections of mine besides they live in a western city and one doesnt mind much how he cuts up the people of places he does nt himself live in i suppose there is not really so much difference in peoples feelings whether they live in bangor or omaha but ones nerves cant be expected to stretch across the continent it is all a matter of greater or less distance i read this morning that a chinese fleet was sunk but i did nt think half so much about it as i did about losing my sleeve button confound it people have accused me of want of feeling they misunderstand the artistnature that is all i obey that implicitly i am sorry if people dont like my descriptions but i have done my best i have pulled to pieces all the persons i am acquainted with and put them together again in my characters the quills i write with come from live geese i would have you know i expect to get some firstrate pluckings from those people i was speaking of and i mean to begin my thirtyninth novel as soon as i have got through my visit ix the society and its new secretary there is no use in trying to hurry the natural course of events in a narrative like this june passed away and july and august had come and as yet the enigma which had completely puzzled arrowhead village and its visitors remained unsolved the white canoe still wandered over the lake alone ghostly always avoiding the near approach of the boats which seemed to be coming in its direction now and then a circumstance would happen which helped to keep inquiry alive good horsemanship was not so common among the young men of the place and its neighborhood that maurices accomplishment in that way could be overlooked if there was a wicked horse or a wild colt whose owner was afraid of him he would be commended to maurices attention paolo would lead him to his master with all due precaution for he had no idea of risking his neck on the back of any illconditioned beast and maurice would fasten on his long spurs spring into the saddle and very speedily teach the creature good behavior there soon got about a story that he was what the freshwater fisherman called one o them whisperers it is a common legend enough coming from the old world but known in american horsetalking circles that some persons will whisper certain words in a horses ear which will tame him if he is as wild and furious as ever cruiser was all this added to the mystery which surrounded the young man a single improbable or absurd story amounts to very little but when half a dozen such stories are told about the same individual or the same event they begin to produce the effect of credible evidence if the year had been and the place had been salem village maurice kirkwood would have run the risk of being treated like the reverend george burroughs miss lurida vincents curiosity had been intensely excited with reference to the young man of whom so many stories were told she had pretty nearly convinced herself that he was the author of the paper on ocean lake and river which had been read at one of the meetings of the pansophian society she was very desirous of meeting him if it were possible it seemed as if she might as secretary of the society request the cooperation of any of the visitors without impropriety so after much deliberation she wrote a careful note of which the following is an exact copy her hand was bold almost masculine a curious contrast to that of euthymia which was delicately feminine pansophian society arrowhead village august maurice kirkwood esq dear sir you have received i trust a card of invitation to the meetings of our society but i think we have not yet had the pleasure of seeing you at any of them we have supposed that we might be indebted to you for a paper read at the last meeting and listened to with much interest as it was anonymous we do not wish to be inquisitive respecting its authorship but we desire to say that any papers kindly sent us by the temporary residents of our village will be welcome and if adapted to the wants of our association will be read at one of its meetings or printed in its records or perhaps both read and printed may we not hope for your presence at the meeting which is to take place next wednesday evening respectfully yours lurida vincent secretary of the pansophian society to this note the secretary received the following reply miss lurida vincent arrowhead village august secretary of the pansophian society dear miss vincent i have received the ticket you refer to and desire to express my acknowledgments for the polite attention i regret that i have not been and i fear shall not be able to attend the meetings of the society but if any subject occurs to me on which i feel an inclination to write it will give me pleasure to send a paper to be disposed of as the society may see fit very respectfully yours maurice kirkwood he says nothing about the authorship of the paper that was read the other evening the secretary said to herself no matter he wrote it there is no mistaking his handwriting we know something about him now at any rate but why doesnt he come to our meetings what has his antipathy to do with his staying away i must find out what his secret is and i will i dont believe its harder than it was to solve that prize problem which puzzled so many teachers or than beating crakowitz the great chessplayer to this enigma then the terror determined to bend all the faculties which had excited the admiration and sometimes the amazement of those who knew her in her schooldays it was a very delicate piece of business for though lurida was an intrepid womans rights advocate and believed she was entitled to do almost everything that men dared to she knew very well there were certain limits which a young woman like herself must not pass in the mean time maurice had received a visit from the young student at the university the same whom he had rescued from his dangerous predicament in the lake with him had called one of the teachers an instructor in modern languages a native of italy maurice and the instructor exchanged a few words in italian the young man spoke it with the ease which implied long familiarity with its use after they left the instructor asked many curious questions about him who he was how long he had been in the village whether anything was known of his history all these inquiries with an eagerness which implied some special and peculiar reason for the interest they evinced i feel satisfied the instructor said that i have met that young man in my own country it was a number of years ago and of course he has altered in appearance a good deal but there is a look about him of what shall i call it apprehension as if he were fearing the approach of something or somebody i think it is the way a man would look that was haunted you know what i mean followed by a spirit or ghost he does not suggest the idea of a murderer very far from it but if he did i should think he was every minute in fear of seeing the murdered mans spirit the student was curious in his turn to know all the instructor could recall he had seen him in rome he thought at the fountain of trevi where so many strangers go before leaving the city the youth was in the company of a man who looked like a priest he could not mistake the peculiar expression of his countenance but that was all he now remembered about his appearance his attention had been called to this young man by seeing that some of the bystanders were pointing at him and noticing that they were whispering with each other as if with reference to him he should say that the youth was at that time fifteen or sixteen years old and the time was about ten years ago after all this evidence was of little or no value suppose the youth were maurice what then we know that he had been in italy and had been there a good while or at least we infer so much from his familiarity with the language and are confirmed in the belief by his having an italian servant whom he probably brought from italy when he returned if he wrote the paper which was read the other evening that settles it for the writer says he had lived by the tiber we must put this scrap of evidence furnished by the professor with the other scraps it may turn out of some consequence sooner or later it is like a piece of a dissected map it means almost nothing by itself but when we find the pieces it joins with we may discover a very important meaning in it in a small concentrated community like that which centred in and immediately around arrowhead village every day must have its local gossip as well as its general news the newspaper tells the small community what is going on in the great world and the busy tongues of male and female especially the latter fill in with the occurrences and comments of the everstirring microcosm the fact that the italian teacher had or thought he had seen maurice ten years before was circulated and made the most of turned over and over like a cake until it was thoroughly done on both sides and all through it was a very small cake but better than nothing miss vincent heard this story as others did and talked about it with her friend miss tower here was one more fact to help along the two young ladies who had recently graduated at the corinna institute remained as they had always been intimate friends they were the natural complements of each other euthymia represented a complete symmetrical womanhood her outward presence was only an index of a large wholesome affluent life she could not help being courageous with such a firm organization she could not help being generous cheerful active she had been told often enough that she was fair to look upon she knew that she was called the wonder by the schoolmates who were dazzled by her singular accomplishments but she did not overvalue them she rather tended to depreciate her own gifts in comparison with those of her friend miss lurida vincent the two agreed all the better for differing as they did the octave makes a perfect chord when shorter intervals jar more or less on the ear each admired the other with a heartiness which if they had been less unlike would have been impossible it was a pleasant thing to observe their dependence on each other the terror of the schoolroom was the oracle in her relations with her friend all the freedom of movement which the wonder showed in her bodily exercises the terror manifested in the world of thought she would fling open a book and decide in a swift glance whether it had any message for her her teachers had compared her way of reading to the taking of an instantaneous photograph when she took up the first book on physiology which dr butts handed her it seemed to him that if she only opened at any place and gave one look her mind drank its meaning up as a moist sponge absorbs water what can i do with such a creature as this he said to himself there is only one way to deal with her treat her as one treats a silkworm give it its mulberry leaf and it will spin its own cocoon give her the books and she will spin her own web of knowledge do you really think of studying medicine said dr butts to her i have nt made up my mind about that she answered but i want to know a little more about this terrible machinery of life and death we are all tangled in i know something about it but not enough i find some very strange beliefs among the women i meet with and i want to be able to silence them when they attempt to proselyte me to their whims and fancies besides i want to know everything they tell me you do already said dr butts i am the most ignorant little wretch that draws the breath of life exclaimed the terror the doctor smiled he knew what it meant she had reached that stage of education in which the vast domain of the unknown opens its illimitable expanse before the eyes of the student we never know the extent of darkness until it is partially illuminated you did not leave the institute with the reputation of being the most ignorant young lady that ever graduated there said the doctor they tell me you got the highest marks of any pupil on their record since the school was founded what a grand thing it was to be the biggest fish in our small aquarium to be sure answered the terror he was six inches long the monster a little too big for bait to catch a pickerel with what did you hand me that schoolbook for did you think i did nt know anything about the human body you said you were such an ignorant creature i thought i would try you with an easy book by way of introduction the terror was not confused by her apparent selfcontradiction i meant what i said and i mean what i say when i talk about my ignorance i dont measure myself with schoolgirls doctor i dont measure myself with my teachers either you must talk to me as if i were a man a grown man if you mean to teach me anything where is your hat doctor let me try it on the doctor handed her his wideawake the terrors hair was not naturally abundant like euthymias and she kept it cut rather short her head used to get very hot when she studied hard she tried to put the hat on do you see that she said i could nt wear it it would squeeze my eyes out of my head the books told me that womens brains were smaller than mens perhaps they are most of them i never measured a great many but when they try to settle what women are good for by phrenology i like to have them put their tape round my head i dont believe in their nonsense for all that you might as well tell me that if one horse weighs more than another horse he is worth more a carthorse that weighs twelve or fourteen hundred pounds better than eclipse that may have weighed a thousand give me a list of the best books you can think of and turn me loose in your library i can find what i want if you have it and what i dont find there i will get at the public library i shall want to ask you a question now and then the doctor looked at her with a kind of admiration but thoughtfully as if he feared she was thinking of a task too formidable for her slight constitutional resource she returned instinctively to the apparent contradiction in her statements about herself i am not a fool if i am ignorant yes doctor i sail on a wide sea of ignorance but i have taken soundings of some of its shallows and some of its depths your profession deals with the facts of life that interest me most just now and i want to know something of it perhaps i may find it a calling such as would suit me do you seriously think of becoming a practitioner of medicine said the doctor certainly i seriously think of it as a possibility but i want to know something more about it first perhaps i shant believe in medicine enough to practise it perhaps i shant like it well enough no matter about that i wish to study some of your best books on some of the subjects that most interest me i know about bones and muscles and all that and about digestion and respiration and such things i want to study up the nervous system and learn all about it i am of the nervous temperament myself and perhaps that is the reason i want to read about insanity and all that relates to it a curious expression flitted across the doctors features as the terror said this nervous system insanity she has headaches i know all those largeheaded hardthinking girls do as a matter of course but what has set her off about insanity and the nervous system i wonder if any of her more remote relatives are subject to mental disorder bright people very often have crazy relations perhaps some of her friends are in that way i wonder whether the doctor did not speak any of these thoughts and in fact hardly shaped his whether for the terror interrupted his train of reflection or rather struck into it in a way which startled him where is the first volume of this medical cyclopaedia she asked looking at its empty place on the shelf on my table the doctor answered i have been consulting it lurida flung it open in her eager way and turned the pages rapidly until she came to the one she wanted the doctor cast his eye on the beading of the page and saw the large letters a n t i thought so he said to himself we shall know everything there is in the books about antipathies now if we never did before she has a special object in studying the nervous system just as i suspected i think she does not care to mention it at this time but if she finds out anything of interest she will tell me if she does anybody perhaps she does not mean to tell anybody it is a rather delicate business a young girl studying the natural history of a young man not quite so safe as botany or palaeontology lurida lately the terror now miss vincent had her own plans and chose to keep them to herself for the present at least her hands were full enough it might seem without undertaking the solution of the great arrowhead village enigma but she was in the most perfect training so far as her intelligence was concerned and the summer rest had restored her bodily vigor so that her brain was like an overcharged battery which will find conductors somewhere to carry off its crowded energy at this time arrowhead village was enjoying the most successful season it had ever known the pansophian society flourished to an extraordinary degree under the fostering care of the new secretary the rector was a good figurehead as president but the secretary was the life of the society communications came in abundantly some from the village and its neighborhood some from the university and the institute some from distant and unknown sources the new secretary was very busy with the work of examining these papers after a forenoon so employed the carpet of her room looked like a barn floor after a huskingmatch a glance at the manuscripts strewed about or lying in heaps would have frightened any young writer away from the thought of authorship as a business if the candidate for that fearful calling had seen the process of selection and elimination he would have felt still more desperately a paper of twenty pages would come in with an underscored request to please read through carefully that request alone is commonly sufficient to condemn any paper and prevent its having any chance of a hearing but the secretary was not hardened enough yet for that kind of martial law in dealing with manuscripts the lookeron might have seen her take up the paper cast one flashing glance at its title read the first sentence and the last dip at a venture into two or three pages and decide as swiftly as the lightning calculator would add up a column of figures what was to be its destination if rejected it went into the heap on the left if approved it was laid apart to be submitted to the committee for their judgment the foolish writers who insist on ones reading through their manuscript poems and stories ought to know how fatal the request is to their prospects it provokes the reader to begin with the reading of manuscript is frightful work at the best the reading of worthless manuscript and most of that which one is requested to read through is worthless would add to the terrors of tartarus if any infernal deity were ingenious enough to suggest it as a punishment if a paper was rejected by the secretary it did not come before the committee but was returned to the author if he sent for it which he commonly did its natural course was to try for admission into some one of the popular magazines into the sifter the most fastidious of them all if that declined it into the second best and if that returned it into the omnivorous if it was refused admittance at the doors of all the magazines it might at length find shelter in the corner of a newspaper where a good deal of very readable verse is to be met with nowadays some of which has been no doubt presented to the pansophian society but was not considered up to its standard x a new arrival there was a recent accession to the transient population of the village which gave rise to some speculation the newcomer was a young fellow rather careless in his exterior but apparently as much at home as if he owned arrowhead village and everything in it he commonly had a cigar in his mouth carried a pocket pistol of the nonexplosive sort and a stick with a bulldogs bead for its knob wore a soft bat a coarse check suit a little baggy and gaiterboots which had been halfsoled a bohemianlooking personage altogether this individual began making explorations in every direction he was very curious about the place and all the people in it he was especially interested in the pansophian society concerning which he made all sorts of inquiries this led him to form a summer acquaintance with the secretary who was pleased to give him whatever information he asked for being proud of the society as she had a right to be and knowing more about it than anybody else the visitor could not have been long in the village without hearing something of maurice kirkwood and the stories true and false connected with his name he questioned everybody who could tell him anything about maurice and set down the answers in a little notebook he always had with him all this naturally excited the curiosity of the village about this new visitor among the rest miss vincent not wanting in an attribute thought to belong more especially to her sex became somewhat interested to know more exactly who this inquiring notetaking personage who seemed to be everywhere and to know everybody might himself be meeting him at the public library at a fortunate moment when there was nobody but the old librarian who was hard of hearing to interfere with their conversation the little secretary had a chance to try to find out something about him this is a very remarkable library for a small village to possess he remarked to miss lurida it is indeed she said have you found it well furnished with the books you most want oh yes books enough i dont care so much for the books as i do for the newspapers i like a review well enough it tells you all there is in a book but a good abstract of the review in a newspaper saves a fellow the trouble of reading it you find the papers you want here i hope said the young lady oh i get along pretty well its my offtime and i dont do much reading or writing who is the city correspondent of this place i dont think we have any one who writes regularly now and then there is a letter with the gossip of the place in it or an account of some of the doings at our society the city papers are always glad to get the reports of our meetings and to know what is going on in the village i suppose you write about the society to the papers as you are the secretary this was a pointblank shot she meant to question the young man about his business and here she was on the witnessstand she ducked her head and let the question go over her oh there are plenty of members who are willing enough to write especially to give an account of their own papers i think they like to have me put in the applause when they get any i do that sometimes how much more she did not say i have seen some very well written articles which from what they tell me of the secretary i should have thought she might have written herself he looked her straight in the eyes i have transmitted some good papers she said without winking or swallowing or changing color precious little color she had to change her brain wanted all the blood it could borrow or steal and more too you spoke of newspapers she said without any change of tone or manner do you not frequently write for them yourself i should think i did answered the young man i am a regular correspondent of the peoples perennial and household inquisitor the regular correspondent from where where oh anywhere the place does not make much difference i have been writing chiefly from naples and st petersburg and now and then from constantinople how long since your return to this country may i ask my return i have never been out of this country i travel with a gazetteer and some guidebooks it is the cheapest way and you can get the facts much better from them than by trusting your own observation i have made the tour of europe by the help of them and the newspapers but of late i have taken to interviewing i find that a very pleasant specialty it is about as good sport as trouttickling and much the same kind of business i should like to send the society an account of one of my interviews dont you think they would like to hear it i have no doubt they would send it to me and i will look it over and if the committee approve it we will have it at the next meeting you know everything has to be examined and voted on by the committee said the cautious secretary very well i will risk it after it is read if it is read please send it back to me as i want to sell it to the sifter or the second best or some of the paying magazines this is the paper which was read at the next meeting of the pansophian society i was ordered by the editor of the newspaper to which i am attached the peoples perennial and household inquisitor to make a visit to a certain wellknown writer and obtain all the particulars i could concerning him and all that related to him i have interviewed a good many politicians who i thought rather liked the process but i had never tried any of these literary people and i was not quite sure how this one would feel about it i said as much to the chief but he poohpoohed my scruples it is nt our business whether they like it or not said he the public wants it and what the public wants its bound to have and we are bound to furnish it dont be afraid of your man he s used to it hes been pumped often enough to take it easy and what youve got to do is to pump him dry you need nt be modest ask him what you like he is nt bound to answer you know as he lived in a rather nice quarter of the town i smarted myself up a little put on a fresh collar and cuffs and got a fivecent shine on my best highlows i said to myself as i was walking towards the house where he lived that i would keep very shady for a while and pass for a visitor from a distance one of those admiring strangers who call in to pay their respects to get an autograph and go home and say that they have met the distinguished so and so which gives them a certain distinction in the village circle to which they belong my man the celebrated writer received me in what was evidently his receptionroom i observed that he managed to get the light full on my face while his own was in the shade i had meant to have his face in the light but he knew the localities and had arranged things so as to give him that advantage it was like two frigates manoeuvring each trying to get to windward of the other i never take out my notebook until i and my man have got engaged in artless and earnest conversation always about himself and his works of course if he is an author i began by saying that he must receive a good many callers those who had read his books were naturally curious to see the writer of them he assented emphatically to this statement he had he said a great many callers i remarked that there was a quality in his books which made his readers feel as if they knew him personally and caused them to cherish a certain attachment to him he smiled as if pleased he was himself disposed to think so he said in fact a great many persons strangers writing to him had told him so my dear sir i said there is nothing wonderful in the fact you mention you reach a responsive chord in many human breasts one touch of nature makes the whole world kin everybody feels as if he and especially she his eyes sparkled were your blood relation do they not name their children after you very frequently he blushed perceptibly sometimes he answered i hope they will all turn out well i am afraid i am taking up too much of your time i said no not at all he replied come up into my library it is warmer and pleasanter there i felt confident that i had him by the right handle then for an authors library which is commonly his workingroom is like a ladys boudoir a sacred apartment so we went upstairs and again he got me with the daylight on my face when i wanted it on has you have a fine library i remarked there were books all round the room and one of those whirligig square bookcases i saw in front a bible and a concordance shakespeare and mrs cowden clarkes book and other classical works and books of grave aspect i contrived to give it a turn and on the side next the wall i got a glimpse of barnums rhyming dictionary and several dictionaries of quotations and cheap compends of knowledge always twirl one of those revolving bookcases when you visit a scholars library that is the way to find out what books he does nt want you to see which of course are the ones you particularly wish to see some may call all this impertinent and inquisitive what do you suppose is an interviewers business did you ever see an oyster opened yes well an interviewers business is the same thing his man is his oyster which he not with sword but with pencil and notebook must open mark how the oystermans thin blade insinuates itself how gently at first how strenuously when once fairly between the shells and here i said you write your books those books which have carried your name to all parts of the world and will convey it down to posterity is this the desk at which you write and is this the pen you write with it is the desk and the very pen he replied he was pleased with my questions and my way of putting them i took up the pen as reverentially as if it had been made of the feather which the angel i used to read about in youngs night thoughts ought to have dropped and did nt would you kindly write your autograph in my notebook with that pen i asked him yes he would with great pleasure so i got out my notebook it was a spick and span new one bought on purpose for this interview i admire your bookcases said i can you tell me just how high they are they are about eight feet with the cornice i should like to have some like those if i ever get rich enough said i eight feet eight feet with the cornice i must put that down so i got out my pencil i sat there with my pencil and notebook in my hand all ready but not using them as yet i have heard it said i observed that you began writing poems at a very early age is it taking too great a liberty to ask how early you began to write in verse he was getting interested as people are apt to be when they are themselves the subjects of conversation very early i hardly know how early i can say truly as louise colet said je fis mes premiers vers sans savoir les ecrire i am not a very good french scholar said i perhaps you will be kind enough to translate that line for me certainly with pleasure i made my first verses without knowing how to write them how interesting but i never heard of louise colet who was she my man was pleased to give me a piece of literary information louise the lioness never heard of her you have heard of alphonse karr why yes more or less to tell the truth i am not very well up in french literature what had he to do with your lioness a good deal he satirized her and she waited at his door with a caseknife in her hand intending to stick him with it by and by he came down smoking a cigarette and was met by this woman flourishing her caseknife he took it from her after getting a cut in his dressinggown put it in his pocket and went on with his cigarette he keeps it with an inscription donne a alphonse karr par madame louise colet dans le dos lively little female i could nt help thinking that i should nt have cared to interview the lively little female he was evidently tickled with the interest i appeared to take in the story he told me that made him feel amiably disposed toward me i began with very general questions but by degrees i got at everything about his family history and the small events of his boyhood some of the points touched upon were delicate but i put a good bold face on my most audacious questions and so i wormed out a great deal that was new concerning my subject he had been written about considerably and the public wouldnt have been satisfied without some new facts and these i meant to have and i got no matter about many of them now but here are some questions and answers that may be thought worth reading or listening to how do you enjoy being what they call a celebrity or a celebrated man so far as ones vanity is concerned it is well enough but selflove is a cup without any bottom and you might pour the great lakes all through it and never fill it up it breeds an appetite for more of the same kind it tends to make the celebrity a mere lump of egotism it generates a craving for highseasoned personalities which is in danger of becoming slavery like that following the abuse of alcohol or opium or tobacco think of a mans having every day by every post letters that tell him he is this and that and the other with epithets and endearments one tenth part of which would have made him blush red hot before he began to be what you call a celebrity are there not some special inconveniences connected with what is called celebrity i should think so suppose you were obliged every day of your life to stand and shake hands as the president of the united states has to after his inauguration how do you think your hand would feel after a few months practice of that exercise suppose you had given you thirtyfive millions of money a year in hundreddollar coupons on condition that you cut them all off yourself in the usual manner how do you think you should like the look of a pair of scissors at the end of a year in which you had worked ten hours a day every day but sunday cutting off a hundred coupons an hour and found you had not finished your task after all you have addressed me as what you are pleased to call a literary celebrity i wont dispute with you as to whether or not i deserve that title i will take it for granted i am what you call me and give you some few hints on my experience you know there was formed a while ago an association of authors for selfprotection it meant well and it was hoped that something would come of it in the way of relieving that oppressed class but i am sorry to say that it has not effected its purpose i suspected he had a hand in drawing up the constitution and laws of that association yes i said an admirable association it was and as much needed as the one for the prevention of cruelty to animals i am sorry to hear that it has not proved effectual in putting a stop to the abuse of a deserving class of men it ought to have done it it was well conceived and its public manifesto was a masterpiece i saw by his expression that he was its author i see i can trust you he said i will unbosom myself freely of some of the grievances attaching to the position of the individual to whom you have applied the term literary celebrity he is supposed to be a millionaire in virtue of the immense sales of his books all the money from which it is taken for granted goes into his pocket consequently all subscription papers are handed to him for his signature and every needy stranger who has heard his name comes to him for assistance he is expected to subscribe for all periodicals and is goaded by receiving blank formulae which with their promises to pay he is expected to fill up he receives two or three books daily with requests to read and give his opinion about each of them which opinion if it has a word which can be used as an advertisement he will find quoted in all the newspapers he receives thick masses of manuscript prose and verse which he is called upon to examine and pronounce on their merits these manuscripts having almost invariably been rejected by the editors to whom they have been sent and having as a rule no literary value whatever he is expected to sign petitions to contribute to journals to write for fairs to attend celebrations to make afterdinner speeches to send money for objects he does not believe in to places he never heard of he is called on to keep up correspondences with unknown admirers who begin by saying they have no claim upon his time and then appropriate it by writing page after page if of the male sex and sheet after sheet if of the other if a poet it is taken for granted that he can sit down at any moment and spin off any number of verses on any subject which may be suggested to him such as congratulations to the writers greatgrandmother on her reaching her hundredth year an elegy on an infant aged six weeks an ode for the fourth of july in a western township not to be found in lippincotts last edition perhaps a valentine for some bucolic lover who believes that wooing in rhyme is the way to win the object of his affections is nt it so i asked the celebrity i would bet on the prose lover she will show the verses to him and they will both have a good laugh over them i have only reported a small part of the conversation i had with the literary celebrity he was so much taken up with his pleasing selfcontemplation while i made him air his opinions and feelings and spread his characteristics as his laundress spreads and airs his linen on the clothesline that i dont believe it ever occurred to him that he had been in the hands of an interviewer until he found himself exposed to the wind and sunshine in full dimensions in the columns of the peoples perennial and household inquisitor after the reading of this paper much curiosity was shown as to who the person spoken of as the literary celebrity might be among the various suppositions the startling idea was suggested that he was neither more nor less than the unexplained personage known in the village as maurice kirkwood why should that be his real name why should not he be the celebrity who had taken this name and fled to this retreat to escape from the persecutions of kind friends who were pricking him and stabbing him nigh to death with their daggers of sugar candy the secretary of the pansophian society determined to question the interviewer the next time she met him at the library which happened soon after the meeting when his paper was read i do not know she said in the course of a conversation in which she had spoken warmly of his contribution to the literary entertainment of the society that you mentioned the name of the literary celebrity whom you interviewed so successfully i did not mention him miss vincent he answered nor do i think it worth while to name him he might not care to have the whole story told of how he was handled so as to make him communicative besides if i did it would bring him a new batch of sympathetic letters regretting that he was bothered by those horrid correspondents full of indignation at the bores who presumed to intrude upon him with their pages of trash all the writers of which would expect answers to their letters of condolence the secretary asked the interviewer if he knew the young gentleman who called himself maurice kirkwood what he answered the man that paddles a birch canoe and rides all the wild horses of the neighborhood no i dont know him but i have met him once or twice out walking a mighty shy fellow they tell me do you know anything particular about him not much none of us do but we should like to the story is that he has a queer antipathy to something or to somebody nobody knows what or whom to newspaper correspondents perhaps said the interviewer what made you ask me about him you did nt think he was my literary celebrity did you i did not know i thought he might be why dont you interview this mysterious personage he would make a good sensation for your paper i should think why what is there to be interviewed in him is there any story of crime or anything else to spice a column or so or even a few paragraphs with if there is i am willing to handle him professionally i told you he has what they call an antipathy i dont know how much wiser you are for that piece of information an antipathy why so have i an antipathy i hate a spider and as for a naked caterpillar i believe i should go into a fit if i had to touch one i know i turn pale at the sight of some of those great green caterpillars that come down from the elmtrees in august and early autumn afraid of them asked the young lady afraid what should i be afraid of they cant bite or sting i cant give any reason all i know is that when i come across one of these creatures in my path i jump to one side and cry out sometimes using very improper words the fact is they make me crazy for the moment i understand what you mean said miss vincent i used to have the same feeling about spiders but i was ashamed of it and kept a little menagerie of spiders until i had got over the feeling that is pretty much got over it for i dont love the creatures very dearly though i dont scream when i see one what did you tell me miss vincent was this fellows particular antipathy that is just the question i told you that we dont know and we cant guess what it is the people here are tired out with trying to discover some good reason for the young mans keeping out of the way of everybody as he does they say he is odd or crazy and they dont seem to be able to tell which it would make the old ladies of the village sleep a great deal sounder yes and some of the young ladies too if they could find out what this mr kirkwood has got into his head that he never comes near any of the people here i think i can find out said the interviewer whose professional ambition was beginning to be excited i never came across anybody yet that i could nt get something out of i am going to stay here a week or two and before i go i will find out the secret if there is any of this mr maurice kirkwood we must leave the interviewer to his contrivances until they present us with some kind of result either in the shape of success or failure xi the interviewer attacks the sphinx when miss euthymia tower sent her oar off in flashing splinters as she pulled her last stroke in the boatrace she did not know what a strain she was putting upon it she did know that she was doing her best but how great the force of her best was she was not aware until she saw its effects unconsciousness belonged to her robust nature in all its manifestations she did not pride herself on her knowledge nor reproach herself for her ignorance in every way she formed a striking contrast to her friend miss vincent every word they spoke betrayed the difference between them the sharp tones of luridas headvoice penetrative aggressive sometimes irritating revealed the corresponding traits of mental and moral character the quiet conversational contralto of euthymia was the index of a nature restful and sympathetic the friendships of young girls prefigure the closer relations which will one day come in and dissolve their earlier intimacies the dependence of two young friends may be mutual but one will always lean more heavily than the other the masculine and feminine elements will be as sure to assert themselves as if the friends were of different sexes on all common occasions euthymia looked up to her friend as her superior she fully appreciated all her varied gifts and knowledge and deferred to her opinion in everyday matters not exactly as an oracle but as wiser than herself or any of her other companions it was a different thing however when the graver questions of life came up lurida was full of suggestions plans projects which were too liable to run into whims before she knew where they were tending she would lay out her ideas before euthymia so fluently and eloquently that she could not help believing them herself and feeling as if her friend must accept them with an enthusiasm like her own then euthymia would take them up with her sweet deliberate accents and bring her calmer judgment to bear on them lurida was in an excited condition in the midst of all her new interests and occupations she was constantly on the lookout for papers to be read at the meetings of her society for she made it her own in great measure by her zeal and enthusiasm and in the mean time she was reading in various books which dr butts selected for her all bearing on the profession to which at least as a possibility she was looking forward privately and in a very still way she was occupying herself with the problem of the young stranger the subject of some delusion or disease or obliquity of unknown nature to which the vague name of antipathy had been attached euthymia kept an eye upon her partly in the fear that overexcitement would produce some mental injury and partly from anxiety lest she should compromise her womanly dignity in her desire to get at the truth of a very puzzling question how do you like the books i see you reading said euthymia to lurida one day as they met at the library better than all the novels i ever read she answered i have been reading about the nervous system and it seems to me i have come nearer the springs of life than ever before in all my studies i feel just as if i were a telegraph operator i was sure that i had a battery in my head for i know my brain works like one but i did not know how many centres of energy there are and how they are played upon by all sorts of influences external and internal do you know i believe i could solve the riddle of the arrowhead village sphinx as the paper called him if he would only stay here long enough what paper has had anything about it lurida i have not seen or heard of its being mentioned in any of the papers you know that rather queerlooking young man who has been about here for some time the same one who gave the account of his interview with a celebrated author well he has handed me a copy of a paper in which he writes the peoples perennial and household inquisitor he talks about this village in a very free and easy way he says there is a sphinx here who has mystified us all and you have been chatting with that fellow dont you know that hell have you and all of us in his paper dont you know that nothing is safe where one of those fellows gets in with his notebook and pencil oh lurida lurida do be careful what with this mysterious young man and this very questionable newspaperparagraph writer you will be talked about if you dont mind before you know it you had better let the riddle of the sphinx alone if you must deal with such dangerous people the safest way is to set one of them to find out the other i wonder if we cant get this new man to interview the visitor you have so much curiosity about that might be managed easily enough without your having anything to do with it let me alone and i will arrange it but mind now you must not meddle if you do you will spoil everything and get your name in the household inquisitor in a way you wont like dont be frightened about me euthymia i dont mean to give him a chance to work me into his paper if i can help it but if you can get him to try his skill upon this interesting personage and his antipathy so much the better i am very curious about it and therefore about him i want to know what has produced this strange state of feeling in a young man who ought to have all the common instincts of a social being i believe there are unexplained facts in the region of sympathies and antipathies which will repay study with a deeper insight into the mysteries of life than we have dreamed of hitherto i often wonder whether there are not heartwaves and soulwaves as well as brainwaves which some have already recognized euthymia wondered as well she might to hear this young woman talking the language of science like an adept the truth is lurida was one of those persons who never are young and who by way of compensation will never be old they are found in both sexes two wellknown graduates of one of our great universities are living examples of this precocious but enduring intellectual development if the readers of this narrative cannot pick them out they need not expect the writer of it to help them if they guess rightly who they are they will recognize the fact that just such exceptional individuals as the young woman we are dealing with are met with from time to time in families where intelligence has been cumulative for two or three generations euthymia was very willing that the questioning and questionable visitor should learn all that was known in the village about the nebulous individual whose misty environment all the eyes in the village were trying to penetrate but that he should learn it from some other informant than lurida the next morning as the interviewer took his seat on a bench outside his door to smoke his afterbreakfast cigar a brightlooking and handsome youth whose features recalled those of euthymia so strikingly that one might feel pretty sure he was her brother took a seat by his side presently the two were engaged in conversation the interviewer asked all sorts of questions about everybody in the village when he came to inquire about maurice the youth showed a remarkable interest regarding him the greatest curiosity he said existed with reference to this personage everybody was trying to find out what his story was for a story and a strange one he must surely have and nobody had succeeded the interviewer began to be unusually attentive the young man told him the various antipathy stories about the evileye hypothesis about his horsetaming exploits his rescuing the student whose boat was overturned and every occurrence he could recall which would help out the effect of his narrative the interviewer was becoming excited cant find out anything about him you said did nt you how do you know theres anything to find do you want to know what i think he is ill tell you i think he is an actor a fellow from one of the city theatres those fellows go off in their summer vacation and like to puzzle the country folks they are the very same chaps like as not the visitors have seen in plays at the city theatres but of course they dont know em in plain clothes kings and emperors look pretty shabby off the stage sometimes i can tell you the young man followed the interviewers lead i shouldnt wonder if you were right he said i remember seeing a young fellow in romeo that looked a good deal like this one but i never met the sphinx as they call him face to face he is as shy as a woodchuck i believe there are people here that would give a hundred dollars to find out who he is and where he came from and what he is here for and why he does nt act like other folks i wonder why some of those newspaper men dont come up here and get hold of this story it would be just the thing for a sensational writer to all this the interviewer listened with true professional interest always on the lookout for something to make up a paragraph or a column about driven oftentimes to the stalest of repetitions to the biggest pumpkin story the tall cornstalk the fat ox the live frog from the human stomach story the third set of teeth and reading without spectacles at ninety story and the rest of the marvellous commonplaces which are kept in type with e o y or e m every other year or every six months at the foot always in want of a fresh incident a new story an undescribed character an unexplained mystery it is no wonder that the interviewer fastened eagerly upon this most tempting subject for an inventive and emotional correspondent he had seen paolo several times and knew that he was maurices confidential servant but had never spoken to him so he said to himself that he must make paolos acquaintance to begin with in the summer season many kinds of small traffic were always carried on in arrowhead village among the rest the sellers of fruits oranges bananas and others according to the seasons did an active business the interviewer watched one of these fruitsellers and saw that his handcart stopped opposite the house where as he knew maurice kirkwood was living presently paolo came out of the door and began examining the contents of the handcart the interviewer saw his opportunity here was an introduction to the man and the man must introduce him to the master he knew very well how to ingratiate himself with the man there was no difficulty about that he had learned his name and that he was an italian whom maurice had brought to this country with him good morning mr paul he said how do you like the look of these oranges they pretty fair said paolo no so good as them las week no sweet as them was why how do you know without tasting them said the interviewer i know by his look i know by his smell he no good yaller he no smell ripe i know orange ever since my head no bigger than he is and paolo laughed at his own comparison the interviewer laughed louder than paolo good said he firstrate of course you know all about em why cant you pick me out a couple of what you think are the best of em i shall be greatly obliged to you i have a sick friend and i want to get two nice sweet ones for him paolo was pleased his skill and judgment were recognized he felt grateful to the stranger who had given him an opportunity of conferring a favor he selected two after careful examination and grave deliberation the interviewer had sense and tact enough not to offer him an orange and so shift the balance of obligation how is mr kirkwood today he asked signor he very well he always well why you ask anybody tell you he sick no nobody said he was sick i have nt seen him going about for a day or two and i thought he might have something the matter with him is he in the house now no he off riding he take long long rides sometime gone all day sometime he go on lake paddle paddle in the morning very very early in night when the moon shine sometime stay in house and read and study and write he great scholar misser kirkwood a good many books has nt he he got whole shelfs full of books great books little books old books new books all sorts of books he great scholar i tell you has nt he some curiosities old figures old jewelry old coins or things of that sort paolo looked at the young man cautiously almost suspiciously he dont keep no jewels nor no money in his chamber he got some old things old jugs old brass figgers old money such as they used to have in old times she dont pass now paolos genders were apt to be somewhat indiscriminately distributed a lucky thought struck the interviewer i wonder if he would examine some old coins of mine said he in a modestly tentative manner i think he like to see anything curious when he come home i ask him who will i tell him wants to ask him about old coin tell him a gentleman visiting arrowhead village would like to call and show him some old pieces of money said to be roman ones the interviewer had just remembered that he had two or three old battered bits of copper which he had picked up at a tollmans where they had been passed off for cents he had bought them as curiosities one had the name of gallienus upon it tolerably distinct a common little roman penny but it would serve his purpose of asking a question as would two or three others with less legible legends paolo told him that if he came the next morning he would stand a fair chance of seeing mr kirkwood at any rate he would speak to his master the interviewer presented himself the next morning after finishing his breakfast and his cigar feeling reasonably sure of finding mr kirkwood at home as he proved to be he had told paolo to show the stranger up to his library or study as he modestly called it it was a pleasant room enough with a lookout on the lake in one direction and the wooded hill in another the tenant had fitted it up in scholarly fashion the books paolo spoke of were conspicuous many of them by their white vellum binding and tasteful gilding showing that probably they had been bound in rome or some other italian city with these were older volumes in their dark original leather and recent ones in cloth or paper as the interviewer ran his eye over them he found that he could make very little out of what their backs taught him some of the papercovered books some of the clothcovered ones had names which he knew but those on the backs of many of the others were strange to his eyes the classics of greek and latin and italian literature were there and he saw enough to feel convinced that he had better not attempt to display his erudition in the company of this young scholar the first thing the interviewer had to do was to account for his visiting a person who had not asked to make his acquaintance and who was living as a recluse he took out his battered coppers and showed them to maurice i understood that you were very skilful in antiquities and had a good many yourself so i took the liberty of calling upon you hoping that you could tell me something about some ancient coins i have had for a good while so saying he pointed to the copper with the name of gallienus is this very rare and valuable i have heard that great prices have been paid for some of these ancient coins ever so many guineas sometimes i suppose this is as much as a thousand years old more than a thousand years old said maurice and worth a great deal of money asked the interviewer no not a great deal of money answered maurice how much should you say said the interviewer maurice smiled a little more than the value of its weight in copper i am afraid not much more there are a good many of these coins of gallienus knocking about the peddlers and the shopkeepers take such pieces occasionally and sell them sometimes for five or ten cents to young collectors no it is not very precious in money value but as a relic any piece of money that was passed from hand to hand a thousand or fifteen hundred years ago is interesting the value of such relics is a good deal a matter of imagination and what do you say to these others asked the interviewer poor old wornout things they were with a letter or two only and some faint trace of a figure on one or two of them very interesting always if they carry your imagination back to the times when you may suppose they were current perhaps horace tossed one of them to a beggar perhaps one of these was the coin that was brought when one said to those about him bring me a penny that i may see it but the market price is a different matter that depends on the beauty and preservation and above all the rarity of the specimen here is a coin now he opened a small cabinet and took one from it here is a syracusan decadrachm with the head of persephone which is at once rare well preserved and beautiful i am afraid to tell what i paid for it the interviewer was not an expert in numismatics he cared very little more for an old coin than he did for an old button but he had thought his purchase at the tollmans might prove a good speculation no matter about the battered old pieces he had found out at any rate that maurice must have money and could be extravagant or what he himself considered so also that he was familiar with ancient coins that would do for a beginning may i ask where you picked up the coin you are showing me he said that is a question which provokes a negative answer one does not pick up firstclass coins or paintings very often in these times i bought this of a great dealer in rome lived in rome once said the interviewer for some years perhaps you have been there yourself the interviewer said he had never been there yet but he hoped he should go there one of these years suppose you studied art and antiquities while you were there he continued everybody who goes to rome must learn something of art and antiquities before you go there i advise you to review roman history and the classic authors you had better make a study of ancient and modern art and not have everything to learn while you are going about among ruins and churches and galleries you know your horace and virgil well i take it for granted the interviewer hesitated the names sounded as if he had heard them not so well as i mean to before going to rome he answered may i ask how long you lived in rome long enough to know something of what is to be seen in it no one should go there without careful preparation beforehand you are familiar with vasari of course the interviewer felt a slight moisture on his forehead he took out his handkerchief it is a warm day he said i have not had time to read all the works i mean to i have had too much writing to do myself to find all the time for reading and study i could have wished in what literary occupation have you been engaged if you will pardon my inquiry said maurice i am connected with the press i understood that you were a man of letters and i hoped i might have the privilege of hearing from your own lips some account of your literary experiences perhaps that might be interesting but i think i shall reserve it for my autobiography you said you were connected with the press do i understand that you are an author by this time the interviewer had come to the conclusion that it was a very warm day he did not seem to be getting hold of his pitcher by the right handle somehow but he could not help answering maurices very simple question if writing for a newspaper gives one a right to be called an author i may call myself one i write for the peoples perennial and household inquisitor are you the literary critic of that wellknown journal or do you manage the political column i am a correspondent from different places and on various matters of interest places you have been to and people you have known well yes generally that is sometimes i have to compile my articles did you write the letter from rome published a few weeks ago the interviewer was in what he would call a tight place however he had found that his man was too much for him and saw that the best thing he could do was to submit to be interviewed himself he thought that he should be able to pick up something or other which he could work into his report of his visit well i prepared that article for our columns you know one does not have to see everything he describes you found it accurate i hope in its descriptions yes murray is generally accurate sometimes he makes mistakes but i cant say how far you have copied them you got the ponte molle the old milvian bridge a good deal too far down the stream if i remember i happened to notice that but i did not read the article carefully may i ask whether you propose to do me the honor of reporting this visit and the conversation we have had for the columns of the newspaper with which you are connected the interviewer thought he saw an opening if you have no objections he said i should like very much to ask a few questions he was recovering his professional audacity you can ask as many questions as you consider proper and discreet after you have answered one or two of mine who commissioned you to submit me to examination the curiosity of the public wishes to be gratified and i am the humble agent of its investigations what has the public to do with my private affairs i suppose it is a question of majority and minority that settles everything in this country you are a minority of one opposed to a large number of curious people that form a majority against you that is the way ive heard the chief put it maurice could not help smiling at the quiet assumption of the american citizen the interviewer smiled too and thought he had his man sure at last maurice calmly answered there is nothing left for minorities then but the right of rebellion i dont care about being made the subject of an article for your paper i am here for my pleasure minding my own business and content with that occupation i rebel against your system of forced publicity whenever i am ready i shall tell the public all it has any right to know about me in the mean time i shall request to be spared reading my biography while i am living i wish you a goodmorning the interviewer had not taken out his notebook and pencil in his next communication from arrowhead village he contented himself with a brief mention of the distinguished and accomplished gentleman now visiting the place whose library and cabinet of coins he had had the privilege of examining and whose courtesy was equalled only by the modesty that shunned the public notoriety which the organs of popular intelligence would otherwise confer upon him the interviewer had attempted the riddle of the sphinx and had failed to get the first hint of its solution the many tongues of the village and its visitors could not remain idle the whole subject of antipathies had been talked over and the various cases recorded had become more or less familiar to the conversational circles which met every evening in the different centres of social life the prevalent hypothesis for the moment was that maurice had a congenital aversion to some color the effects of which upon him were so painful or disagreeable that he habitually avoided exposure to it it was known and it has already been mentioned that such cases were on record there had been a great deal of discussion of late with reference to a fact long known to a few individuals but only recently made a matter of careful scientific observation and brought to the notice of the public this was the now wellknown phenomenon of colorblindness it did not seem very strange that if one person in every score or two could not tell red from green there might be other curious individual peculiarities relating to color a case has already been referred to where the subject of observation fainted at the sight of any red object what if this were the trouble with maurice kirkwood it will be seen at once how such a congenital antipathy would tend to isolate the person who was its unfortunate victim it was an hypothesis not difficult to test but it was a rather delicate business to be experimenting on an inoffensive stranger miss vincent was thinking it over but said nothing even to euthymia of any projects she might entertain xii miss vincent as a medical student the young lady whom we have known as the terror as lurida as miss vincent secretary of the pansophian society had been reading various works selected for her by dr butts works chiefly relating to the nervous system and its different affections she thought it was about time to talk over the general subject of the medical profession with her new teacher if such a selfdirecting person as lurida could be said to recognize anybody as teacher she began at the beginning what is the first book you would put in a students hands doctor she said to him one day they were in his study and lurida had just brought back a thick volume on insanity one of bucknill and pukes which she had devoured as if it had been a pamphlet not that book certainly he said i am afraid it will put all sorts of notions into your head who or what set you to reading that i should like to know i found it on one of your shelves and as i thought i might perhaps be crazy some time or other i felt as if i should like to know what kind of a condition insanity is i dont believe they were ever very bright those insane people most of them i hope i am not stupid enough ever to lose my wits there is no telling my dear what may happen if you overwork that busy brain of yours but did nt it make you nervous reading about so many people possessed with such strange notions nervous not a bit i could nt help thinking though how many people i had known that had a little touch of craziness about them take that poor woman that says she is her majestys person not her majesty but her majestys person a very important distinction according to her how she does remind me of more than one girl i have known she would let her skirts down so as to make a kind of train and pile things on her head like a sort of crown fold her arms and throw her head back and feel as grand as a queen i have seen more than one girl act very much in that way are not most of us a little crazy doctor just a little i think so it seems to me i never saw but one girl who was free from every hint of craziness and who was that pray why euthymia nobody else of course she never loses her head i dont believe she would in an earthquake whenever we were at work with our microscopes at the institute i always told her that her mind was the only achromatic one i ever looked into i did nt say looked through but i did nt come to talk about that i read in one of your books that when sydenham was asked by a student what books he should read the great physician said read don quixote i want you to explain that to me and then i want you to tell me what is the first book according to your idea that a student ought to read what do you say to my taking your question as the subject of a paper to be read before the society i think there may be other young ladies at the meeting besides yourself who are thinking of pursuing the study of medicine at any rate there are a good many who are interested in the subject in fact most people listen readily to anything doctors tell them about their calling i wish you would doctor i want euthymia to hear it and i dont doubt there will be others who will be glad to hear everything you have to say about it but oh doctor if you could only persuade eutbymia to become a physician what a doctor she would make so strong so calm so full of wisdom i believe she could take the wheel of a steamboat in a storm or the hose of a fireengine in a conflagration and handle it as well as the captain of the boat or of the firecompany have you ever talked with her about studying medicine indeed i have oh if she would only begin with me what good times we would have studying together i dont doubt it medicine is a very pleasant study but how do you think practice would be how would you like being called up to ride ten miles in a midnight snowstorm just when one of your raging headaches was racking you oh but we could go into partnership and euthymia is nt afraid of storms or anything else if she would only study medicine with me well what does she say to it she does nt like the thought of it she does nt believe in women doctors she thinks that now and then a woman may be fitted for it by nature but she does nt think there are many who are she gives me a good many reasons against their practising medicine you know what most of them are doctor and ends by saying that the same woman who would be a poor sort of doctor would make a firstrate nurse and that she thinks is a womans business if her instinct carries her to the hospital or sickchamber i cant argue her ideas out of her neither can i argue you out of your feeling about the matter but i am disposed to agree with your friend that you will often spoil a good nurse to make a poor doctor doctors and sidesaddles dont seem to me to go together riding habits would be awkward things for practitioners but come we wont have a controversy just now i am for giving women every chance for a good education and if they think medicine is one of their proper callings let them try it i think they will find that they had better at least limit themselves to certain specialties and always have an expert of the other sex to fall back upon the trouble is that they are so impressible and imaginative that they are at the mercy of all sorts of fancy systems you have only to see what kinds of instruction they very commonly flock to in order to guess whether they would be likely to prove sensible practitioners charlatanism always hobbles on two crutches the tattle of women and the certificates of clergymen and i am afraid that half the women doctors will be too much under both those influences lurida believed in dr butts who to use the common language of the village had carried her through a fever brought on by overexcitement and exhausting study she took no offence at his reference to nursery gossip which she had learned to hold cheap nobody so despises the weaknesses of women as the champion of womans rights she accepted the doctors concession of a fair field and open trial of the fitness of her sex for medical practice and did not trouble herself about his suggested limitations as to the imaginative tendencies of women she knew too well the truth of the doctors remark relating to them to wish to contradict it be sure you let me have your paper in season for the next meeting doctor she said and in due season it came and was of course approved for reading xiii dr butts reads a paper next to the interest we take in all that relates to our immortal souls is that which we feel for our mortal bodies i am afraid my very first statement may be open to criticism the care of the body is the first thought with a great many in fact with the larger part of the world they send for the physician first and not until he gives them up do they commonly call in the clergyman even the minister himself is not so very different from other people we must not blame him if he is not always impatient to exchange a world of multiplied interests and everchanging sources of excitement for that which tradition has delivered to us as one eminently deficient in the stimulus of variety besides these bodily frames even when worn and disfigured by long years of service hang about our consciousness like old garments they are used to us and we are used to them and all the accidents of our lives the house we dwell in the living people round us the landscape we look over all up to the sky that covers us like a bell glass all these are but looser outside garments which we have worn until they seem a part of us and we do not like the thought of changing them for a new suit which we have never yet tried on how well i remember that dear ancient lady who lived well into the last decade of her century as she repeated the verse which if i had but one to choose i would select from that string of pearls grays elegy for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being eer resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind plotinus was ashamed of his body we are told better so it may be than to live solely for it as so many do but it may be well doubted if there is any disciple of plotinus in this society on the contrary there are many who think a great deal of their bodies many who have come here to regain the health they have lost in the wear and tear of city life and very few who have not at some time or other of their lives had occasion to call in the services of a physician there is therefore no impropriety in my offering to the members some remarks upon the peculiar difficulties which beset the medical practitioner in the discharge of his laborious and important duties a young friend of mine who has taken an interest in medical studies happened to meet with a very familiar story about one of the greatest and most celebrated of all english physicians thomas sydenham the story is that when a student asked him what books he should read the great doctor told him to read don quixote this piece of advice has been used to throw contempt upon the study of books and furnishes a convenient shield for ignorant pretenders but sydenham left many writings in which he has recorded his medical experience and he surely would not have published them if he had not thought they would be better reading for the medical student than the story of cervantes his own works are esteemed to this day and he certainly could not have supposed that they contained all the wisdom of all the past no remedy is good it was said of old unless applied at the right time in the right way so we may say of all anecdotes like this which i have told you about sydenham and the young man it is very likely that he carried him to the bedside of some patients and talked to him about the cases he showed him instead of putting a latin volume in his hand i would as soon begin in that way as any other with a student who had already mastered the preliminary branches who knew enough about the structure and functions of the body in health but if you ask me what reading i would commend to the medical student of a philosophical habit of mind you may be surprised to hear me say it would be certain passages in rasselas they are the ones where the astronomer gives an account to imlac of his management of the elements the control of which as he had persuaded himself had been committed to him let me read you a few sentences from this story which is commonly bound up with the vicar of wakefield like a woollen lining to a silken mantle but is full of stately wisdom in processions of paragraphs which sound as if they ought to have a grammatical drummajor to march before their tramping platoons the astronomer has taken imlac into his confidence and reveals to him the secret of his wonderful powers hear imlac what thou wilt not without difficulty credit i have possessed for five years the regulation of the weather and the distribution of the seasons the sun has listened to my dictates and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction the clouds at my call have poured their waters and the nile has overflowed at my command i have restrained the rage of the dogstar and mitigated the fervors of the crab the winds alone of all the elemental powers have hitherto eluded my authority and multitudes have perished by equinoctial tempests which i found myself unable to prohibit or restrain the reader naturally wishes to know how the astronomer a sincere devoted and most benevolent man for forty years a student of the heavens came to the strange belief that he possessed these miraculous powers this is his account one day as i was looking on the fields withering with heat i felt in my mind a sudden wish that i could send rain on the southern mountains and raise the nile to an inundation in the hurry of my imagination i commanded rain to fall and by comparing the time of my command with that of the inundation i found that the clouds had listened to my lips might not some other cause said i produce this concurrence the nile does not always rise on the same day do not believe said he with impatience i that such objections could escape me i reasoned long against my own conviction and labored against truth with the utmost obstinacy i sometimes suspected myself of madness and should not have dared to impart this secret but to a man like you capable of distinguishing the wonderful from the impossible and the incredible from the false the good old astronomer gives his parting directions to imlac whom he has adopted as his successor in the government of the elements and the seasons in these impressive words do not in the administration of the year indulge thy pride by innovation do not please thyself with thinking that thou canst make thyself renowned to all future ages by disordering the seasons the memory of mischief is no desirable fame much less will it become thee to let kindness or interest prevail never rob other countries of rain to pour it on thine own for us the nile is sufficient do you wonder my friends why i have chosen these passages in which the delusions of an insane astronomer are related with all the pomp of the johnsonian vocabulary as the first lesson for the young person about to enter on the study of the science and art of healing listen to me while i show you the parallel of the story of the astronomer in the history of medicine this history is luminous with intelligence radiant with benevolence but all its wisdom and all its virtue have had to struggle with the everrising mists of delusion the agencies which waste and destroy the race of mankind are vast and resistless as the elemental forces of nature nay they are themselves elemental forces they may be to some extent avoided to some extent diverted from their aim to some extent resisted so may the changes of the seasons from cold that freezes to heats that strike with sudden death be guarded against so may the tides be in some small measure restrained in their inroads so may the storms be breasted by walls they cannot shake from their foundations but the seasons and the tides and the tempests work their will on the great scale upon whatever stands in their way they feed or starve the tillers of the soil they spare or drown the dwellers by the shore they waft the seaman to his harbor or bury him in the angry billows the art of the physician can do much to remove its subjects from deadly and dangerous influences and something to control or arrest the effects of these influences but look at the records of the lifeinsurance offices and see how uniform is the action of natures destroying agencies look at the annual reports of the deaths in any of our great cities and see how their regularity approaches the uniformity of the tides and their variations keep pace with those of the seasons the inundations of the nile are not more certainly to be predicted than the vast wave of infantile disease which flows in upon all our great cities with the growing heats of july than the fevers and dysenteries which visit our rural districts in the months of the falling leaf the physician watches these changes as the astronomer watched the rise of the great river he longs to rescue individuals to protect communities from the inroads of these destroying agencies he uses all the means which experience has approved tries every rational method which ingenuity can suggest some fortunate recovery leads him to believe he has hit upon a preventive or a cure for a malady which had resisted all known remedies his rescued patient sounds his praises and a wide circle of his patients friends joins in a chorus of eulogies selflove applauds him for his sagacity selfinterest congratulates him on his having found the road to fortune the sense of having proved a benefactor of his race smooths the pillow on which he lays his head to dream of the brilliant future opening before him if a single coincidence may lead a person of sanguine disposition to believe that he has mastered a disease which had baffled all who were before his time and on which his contemporaries looked in hopeless impotence what must be the effect of a series of such coincidences even on a mind of calmer temper such series of coincidences will happen and they may well deceive the very elect think of dr rush you know what a famous man he was the very head and front of american medical science in his day and remember how he spoke about yellow fever which he thought he had mastered thus the physician is entangled in the meshes of a wide conspiracy in which he and his patient and their friends andnature herself are involved what wonder that the history of medicine should be to so great an extent a record of selfdelusion if this seems a dangerous concession to the enemies of the true science and art of healing i will remind you that it is all implied in the first aphorism of hippocrates the father of medicine do not draw a wrong inference from the frank statement of the difficulties which beset the medical practitioner think rather if truth is so hard of attainment how precious are the results which the consent of the wisest and most experienced among the healers of men agrees in accepting think what folly it is to cast them aside in favor of palpable impositions stolen from the records of forgotten charlatanism or of fantastic speculations spun from the squinting brains of theorists as wild as the egyptian astronomer begin your medical studies then by reading the fortieth and the following four chapters of rasselas your first lesson will teach you modesty and caution in the pursuit of the most deceptive of all practical branches of knowledge faith will come later when you learn how much medical science and art have actually achieved for the relief of mankind and how great are the promises it holds out of still larger triumphs over the enemies of human health and happiness after the reading of this paper there was a lively discussion which we have no room to report here and the society adjourned xiv miss vincents startling discovery the soberminded sensible wellinstructed dr butts was not a little exercised in mind by the demands made upon his knowledge by his young friend and for the time being his pupil miss lurida vincent i dont wonder they called her the terror he said to himself she is enough to frighten anybody she has taken down old books from my shelves that i had almost forgotten the backs of and as to the medical journals i believe the girl could index them from memory she is in pursuit of some special point of knowledge i feel sure and i cannot doubt what direction she is working in but her wonderful way of dealing with books amazes me what marvels those first scholars in the classes of our great universities and colleges are to be sure they are not as a rule the most distinguished of their class in the long struggle of life the chances are that the field will beat the favorite over the long racecourse others will develop a longer stride and more staying power but what fine gifts those first scholars have received from nature how dull we writers famous or obscure are in the acquisition of knowledge as compared with them to lead their classmates they must have quick apprehension fine memories thorough control of their mental faculties strong will power of concentration facility of expression a wonderful equipment of mental faculties i always want to take my hat off to the first scholar of his year dr butts felt somewhat in the same way as he contemplated the terror she surprised him so often with her knowledge that he was ready to receive her without astonishment when she burst in upon him one allay with a cry of triumph eureka eureka and what have you found my dear said the doctor lurida was flushed and panting with the excitement of her new discovery i do believe that i have found the secret of our strange visitors dread of all human intercourse the seasoned practitioner was not easily thrown off his balance wait a minute and get your breath said the doctor are you not a little overstating his peculiarity it is not quite so bad as that he keeps a man to serve him he was civil with the people at the old tavern he was affable enough i understand with the young fellow he pulled out of the water or rescued somehow i dont believe be avoids the whole human race he does not look as if he hated them so far as i have remarked his expression i passed a few words with him when his man was ailing and found him polite enough no i dont believe it is much more than an extreme case of shyness connected perhaps with some congenital or other personal repugnance to which has been given the name of an antipathy lurida could hardly keep still while the doctor was speaking when he finished she began the account of her discovery i do certainly believe i have found an account of his case in an italian medical journal of about fourteen years ago i met with a reference which led me to look over a file of the giornale degli ospitali lying among the old pamphlets in the medical section of the library i have made a translation of it which you must read and then tell me if you do not agree with me in my conclusion tell me what your conclusion is and i will read your paper and see for myself whether i think the evidence justifies the conviction you seem to have reached luridas large eyes showed their whole rounds like the two halves of a map of the world as she said i believe that maurice kirkwood is suffering from the effects of the bite of a tarantula the doctor drew a long breath he remembered in a vague sort of way the stories which used to be told of the terrible apulian spider but he had consigned them to the limbo of medical fable where so many fictions have clothed themselves with a local habitation and a name he looked into the round eyes and wide pupils a little anxiously as if he feared that she was in a state of undue excitement but true to his professional training he waited for another symptom if indeed her mind was in any measure off its balance i know what you are thinking lurida said but it is not so i am not mad most noble festus you shall see the evidence and judge for yourself read the whole case you can read my hand almost as if it were print and tell me if you do not agree with me that this young man is in all probability the same person as the boy described in the italian journal one thing you might say is against the supposition the young patient is spoken of as signorino m chbut you must remember that ch is pronounced hard in italian like k which letter is wanting in the italian alphabet and it is natural enough that the initial of the second name should have got changed in the record to its italian equivalent before inviting the reader to follow the details of this extraordinary case as found in a medical journal the narrator wishes to be indulged in a few words of explanation in order that he may not have to apologize for allowing the introduction of a subject which may be thought to belong to the professional student rather than to the readers of this record there is a great deal in medical books which it is very unbecoming to bring before the general public a great deal to repel to disgust to alarm to excite unwholesome curiosity it is not the men whose duties have made them familiar with this class of subjects who are most likely to offend by scenes and descriptions which belong to the physicians private library and not to the shelves devoted to polite literature goldsmith and even smollett both having studied and practised medicine could not by any possibility have outraged all the natural feelings of delicacy and decency as swift and zola have outraged them but without handling doubtful subjects there are many curious medical experiences which have interest for every one as extreme illustrations of ordinary conditions with which all are acquainted no one can study the now familiar history of clairvoyance profitably who has not learned something of the vagaries of hysteria no one can read understandingly the life of cowper and that of carlyle without having some idea of the influence of hypochondriasis and of dyspepsia upon the disposition and intellect of the subjects of these maladies i need not apologize therefore for giving publicity to that part of this narrative which deals with one of the most singular maladies to be found in the records of bodily and mental infirmities the following is the account of the case as translated by miss vincent for obvious reasons the whole name was not given in the original paper and for similar reasons the date of the event and the birthplace of the patient are not precisely indicated here giornale degli ospitali luglio remarkable case of tarantism the great interest attaching to the very singular and exceptional instance of this rare affection induces us to give a full account of the extraordinary example of its occurrence in a patient who was the subject of a recent medical consultation in this city signorino m ch is the only son of a gentleman travelling in italy at this time he is eleven years of age of sanguinenervous temperament light hair blue eyes intelligent countenance well grown but rather slight in form to all appearance in good health but subject to certain peculiar and anomalous nervous symptoms of which his father gives this history nine years ago the father informs us he was travelling in italy with his wife this child and a nurse they were passing a few days in a country village near the city of bari capital of the province of the same name in the division compartamento of apulia the child was in perfect health and had never been affected by any serious illness on the th of july he was playing out in the field near the house where the family was staying when he was heard to scream suddenly and violently the nurse rushing to him found him in great pain saying that something had bitten him in one of his feet a laborer one tommaso ran up at the moment and perceived in the grass near where the boy was standing an enormous spider which he at once recognized as a tarantula he managed to catch the creature in a large leaf from which he was afterwards transferred to a widemouthed bottle where he lived without any food for a month or more the creature was covered with short hairs and had a pair of nipperlike jaws with which he could inflict an ugly wound his body measured about an inch in length and from the extremity of one of the longest limbs to the other was between two and three inches such was the account given by the physician to whom the peasant carried the great spider the boy who had been bitten continued screaming violently while his stocking was being removed and the foot examined the place of the bite was easily found and the two marks of the clawlike jaws already showed the effects of the poison a small livid circle extending around them with some puffy swelling the distinguished dr amadei was immediately sent for and applied cups over the wounds in the hope of drawing forth the poison in vain all his skill and efforts soon ataxic irregular nervous symptoms declared themselves and it became plain that the system had been infected by the poison the symptoms were very much like those of malignant fever such as distress about the region of the heart difficulty of breathing collapse of all the vital powers threatening immediate death from these first symptoms the child rallied but his entire organism had been profoundly affected by the venom circulating through it his constitution has never thrown off the malady resulting from this toxic poisonous agent the phenomena which have been observed in this young patient correspond so nearly with those enumerated in the elaborate essay of the celebrated baglivi that one might think they had been transcribed from his pages he is very fond of solitude of wandering about in churchyards and other lonely places he was once found hiding in an empty tomb which had been left open his aversion to certain colors is remarkable generally speaking he prefers bright tints to darker ones but his likes and dislikes are capricious and with regard to some colors his antipathy amounts to positive horror some shades have such an effect upon him that he cannot remain in the room with them and if he meets any one whose dress has any of that particular color he will turn away or retreat so as to avoid passing that person among these purple and dark green are the least endurable he cannot explain the sensations which these obnoxious colors produce except by saying that it is like the deadly feeling from a blow on the epigastrium pit of the stomach about the same season of the year at which the tarantular poisoning took place he is liable to certain nervous seizures not exactly like fainting or epilepsy but reminding the physician of those affections all the other symptoms are aggravated at this time in other respects than those mentioned the boy is in good health he is fond of riding and has a pony on which he takes a great deal of exercise which seems to do him more good than any other remedy the influence of music to which so much has been attributed by popular belief and even by the distinguished professor to whom we shall again refer has not as yet furnished any satisfactory results if the graver symptoms recur while the patient is under our observation we propose to make use of an agency discredited by modern skepticism but deserving of a fair trial as an exceptional remedy for an exceptional disease the following extracts from the work of the celebrated italian physician of the last century are given by the writer of the paper in the giornale in the original latin with a translation into italian subjoined here are the extracts or rather here is a selection from them with a translation of them into english after mentioning the singular aversion to certain colors shown by the subject of tarantism baglivi writes as follows et si astantes incedant vestibus eo colore difusis qui tarantatis ingrates est necesse est ut ab illorum aspectu recedant nam ad intuitum molesti coloris angore cordis et symptomatum recrudescantia stating corripiuntur g baglivi op omnia page lugduni that is if the persons about the patient wear dresses of the color which is offensive to him he must get away from the sight of them for on seeing the obnoxious color he is at once seized with distress in the region of the heart and a renewal of his symptoms as to the recurrence of the malady baglivi says dam calor solis ardentius exurere incip at quod contingit circa initia julii et augusti tarantati lente venientem recrudescentiam veneni percipiunt ibid page which i render when the heat of the sun begins to burn more fiercely which happens about the beginning of july and august the subjects of tarantism perceive the gradually approaching recrudescence returning symptoms of the poisoning among the remedies most valued by this illustrious physician is that mentioned in the following sentence laudo magnopere equitationes in aere rusticano factas singulis diebus hord potissimum matutina quibus equitationibus morbos chronicos pene incurabiles protanus eliminavi or in translation i commend especially riding on horseback in country air every day by preference in the morning hours by the aid of which horseback riding i have driven off chronic diseases which were almost incurable miss vincent read this paper aloud to dr butts and handed it to him to examine and consider he listened with a grave countenance and devout attention as she finished reading her account she exclaimed in the passionate tones of the deepest conviction there doctor have nt i found the true story of this strange visitor have nt i solved the riddle of the sphinx who can this man be but the boy of that story look at the date of the journal when he was eleven years old it would make him twentyfive now and that is just about the age the people here think he must be of what could account so entirely for his ways and actions as that strange poisoning which produces the state they call tarantism i am just as sure it must be that as i am that i am alive oh doctor doctor i must be right this signprino m ch was the boy maurice kirkwood and the story accounts for everything his solitary habits his dread of people it must be because they wear the colors he cant bear his morning rides on horseback his coming here just as the season was approaching which would aggravate all his symptoms does nt all this prove that i must be right in my conjecture no my conviction the doctor knew too much to interrupt the young enthusiast and so he let her run on until she ran down he was more used to the rules of evidence than she was and could not accept her positive conclusion so readily as she would have liked to have him he knew that beginners are very apt to make what they think are discoveries but he had been an angler and knew the meaning of a yielding rod and an easyrunning reel he said quietly you are a most sagacious young lady and a very pretty prima facie case it is that you make out i can see no proof that mr kirkwood is not the same person as the m ch of the medical journal that is if i accept your explanation of the difference in the initials of these two names even if there were a difference that would not disprove their identity for the initials of patients whose cases are reported by their physicians are often altered for the purpose of concealment i do not know however that mr kirkwood has shown any special aversion to any particular color it might be interesting to inquire whether it is so but it is a delicate matter i dont exactly see whose business it is to investigate mr maurice kirkwoods idiosyncrasies and constitutional history if he should have occasion to send for me at any time he might tell me all about himself in confidence you know these old accounts from baglivi are curious and interesting but i am cautious about receiving any stories a hundred years old if they involve an improbability as his stories about the cure of the tarantula bite by music certainly do i am disposed to wait for future developments bearing in mind of course the very singular case you have unearthed it wouldnt be very strange if our young gentleman had to send for me before the season is over he is out a good deal before the dew is off the grass which is rather risky in this neighborhood as autumn comes on i am somewhat curious i confess about the young man but i do not meddle where i am not asked for or wanted and i have found that eggs hatch just as well if you let them alone in the nest as if you take them out and shake them every day this is a wonderfully interesting supposition of yours and may prove to be strictly in accordance with the facts but i do not think we have all the facts in this young mans case if it were proved that he had an aversion to any color it would greatly strengthen your case his antipatia as his man called it must be one which covers a wide ground to account for his selfisolation and the color hypothesis seems as plausible as any but my dear miss vincent i think you had better leave your singular and striking hypothesis in my keeping for a while rather than let it get abroad in a community like this where so many tongues are in active exercise i will carefully study this paper if you will leave it with me and we will talk the whole matter over it is a fair subject for speculation only we must keep quiet about it this long speech gave luridas perfervid brain time to cool off a little she left the paper with the doctor telling him she would come for it the next day and went off to tell the result of this visit to her bosom friend miss euthymia tower xv dr butts calls on euthymia the doctor was troubled in thinking over his interview with the young lady she was fully possessed with the idea that she had discovered the secret which had defied the most sagacious heads of the village it was of no use to oppose her while her mind was in an excited state but he felt it his duty to guard her against any possible results of indiscretion into which her eagerness and her theory of the equality almost the identity of the sexes might betray her too much of the woman in a daughter of our race leads her to forget danger too little of the woman prompts her to defy it fortunately for this last class of women they are not quite so likely to be perilously seductive as their more emphatically feminine sisters dr butts had known lurida and her friend from the days of their infancy he had watched the development of luridas intelligence from its precocious nurserylife to the full vigor of its trained faculties he had looked with admiration on the childish beauty of euthymia and had seen her grow up to womanhood every year making her more attractive he knew that if anything was to be done with his selfwilled young scholar and friend it would be more easily effected through the medium of euthymia than by direct advice to the young lady herself so the thoughtful doctor made up his mind to have a good talk with euthymia and put her on her guard if lurida showed any tendency to forget the conventionalities in her eager pursuit of knowledge for the doctors horse and chaise to stop at the door of miss euthymia towers parental home was an event strange enough to set all the tongues in the village going this was one of those families where illness was hardly looked for among the possibilities of life there were other families where a call from the doctor was hardly more thought of than a call from the baker but here he was a stranger at least on his professional rounds and when he asked for miss euthymia the servant who knew his face well stared as if he had held in his hand a warrant for her apprehension euthymia did not keep the doctor waiting very long while she made ready to meet him one look at her glass to make sure that a lock had not run astray or a ribbon got out of place and her toilet for a morning call was finished perhaps if mr maurice kirkwood had been announced she might have taken a second look but with the good middleaged married doctor one was enough for a young lady who had the gift of making all the dresses she wore look well and had no occasion to treat her chamber like the laboratory where an actress compounds herself euthymia welcomed the doctor very heartily she could not help suspecting his errand and she was very glad to have a chance to talk over her friends schemes and fancies with him the doctor began without any roundabout prelude i want to confer with you about our friend lurida does she tell you all her plans and projects why as to that doctor i can hardly say positively but i do not believe she keeps back anything of importance from me i know what she has been busy with lately and the queer idea she has got into her head what do you think of the tarantula business she has shown you the paper she has written i suppose indeed she has it is a very curious case she has got hold of and i do not wonder at all that she should have felt convinced that she had come at the true solution of the village riddle it may be that this young man is the same person as the boy mentioned in the italian medical journal but it is very far from clear that he is so you know all her reasons of course as you have read the story the times seem to agree well enough it is easy to conceive that ch might be substituted for k in the report the singular solitary habits of this young man entirely coincide with the story if we could only find out whether he has any of those feelings with reference to certain colors we might guess with more chance of guessing right than we have at present but i dont see exactly how we are going to submit him to examination on this point if he were only a chemical compound we could analyze him if he were only a bird or a quadruped we could find out his likes and dislikes but being as he is a young man with ways of his own and a will of his own which he may not choose to have interfered with the problem becomes more complicated i hear that a newspaper correspondent has visited him so as to make a report to his paper do you know what he found out certainly i do very well my brother has heard his own story which was this he found out he had got hold of the wrong person to interview the young gentleman he says interviewed him so that he did not learn much about the sphinx but the newspaper man told willy about the sphinxs library and a cabinet of coins he had and said he should make an article out of him anyhow i wish the man would take himself off i am afraid luridas love of knowledge will get her into trouble which of the men do you wish would take himself off i was thinking of the newspaper man she blushed a little as she said i cant help feeling a strange sort of interest about the other mr kirkwood do you know that i met him this morning and had a good look at him full in the face well to be sure that was an interesting experience and how did you like his looks i thought his face a very remarkable one but he looked very pale as he passed me and i noticed that he put his hand to his left side as if he had a twinge of pain or something of that sort spasm or neuralgia i dont know what i wondered whether he had what you call angina pectoris it was the same kind of look and movement i remember as you trust too in my uncle who died with that complaint the doctor was silent for a moment then he asked were you dressed as you are now yes i was except that i had a thin mantle over my shoulders i was out early and i have always remembered your caution what color was your mantle it was black i have been over all this with lucinda a black mantle on a white dress a straw hat with an old faded ribbon there cant be much in those colors to trouble him i should think for his man wears a black coat and white linen more or less white as you must have noticed and he must have seen ribbons of all colors often enough but lurida believes it was the ribbon or something in the combination of colors her head is full of tarantulas and tarantism i fear that she will never be easy until the question is settled by actual trial and will you believe it the girl is determined in some way to test her supposition believe it euthymia i can believe almost anything of lurida she is the most irrepressible creature i ever knew you know as well as i do what a complete possession any ruling idea takes of her whole nature i have had some fears lest her zeal might run away with her discretion it is a great deal easier to get into a false position than to get out of it i know it well enough i want you to tell me what you think about the whole business i dont like the look of it at all and yet i can do nothing with the girl except let her follow her fancy until i can show her plainly that she will get herself into trouble in some way or other but she is ingenious full of all sorts of devices innocent enough in themselves but liable to be misconstrued you remember how she won us the boatrace to be sure i do it was rather sharp practice but she felt she was paying off an old score the classical story of atalanta told like that of eve as illustrating the weakness of woman provoked her to make trial of the powers of resistance in the other sex but it was audacious i hope her audacity will not go too far you must watch her keep an eye on her correspondence the doctor had great confidence in the good sense of luridas friend he felt sure that she would not let lurida commit herself by writing foolish letters to the subject of her speculations or similar indiscreet performances the boldness of young girls who think no evil in opening correspondence with idealized personages is something quite astonishing to those who have had an opportunity of knowing the facts lurida had passed the most dangerous age but her theory of the equality of the sexes made her indifferent to the bylaws of social usage she required watching and her two guardians were ready to check her in case of need xvi miss vincent writes a letter euthymia noticed that her friend had been very much preoccupied for two or three days she found her more than once busy at her desk with a manuscript before her which she turned over and placed inside the desk as euthymia entered this desire of concealment was not what either of the friends expected to see in the other it showed that some project was under way which at least in its present stage the machiavellian young lady did not wish to disclose it had cost her a good deal of thought and care apparently for her wastebasket was full of scraps of paper which looked as if they were the remains of a manuscript like that at which she was at work copying and recopying probably thought euthymia but she was willing to wait to learn what lurida was busy about though she had a suspicion that it was something in which she might feel called upon to interest herself do you know what i think said euthymia to the doctor meeting him as he left his door i believe lurida is writing to this man and i dont like the thought of her doing such a thing of course she is not like other girls in many respects but other people will judge her by the common rules of life i am glad that you spoke of it answered the doctor she would write to him just as quickly as to any woman of his age besides under the cover of her office she has got into the way of writing to anybody i think she has already written to mr kirkwood asking him to contribute a paper for the society she can find a pretext easily enough if she has made up her mind to write in fact i doubt if she would trouble herself for any pretext at all if she decided to write watch her well dont let any letter go without seeing it if you can help it young women are much given to writing letters to persons whom they only know indirectly for the most part through their books and especially to romancers and poets nothing can be more innocent and simplehearted than most of these letters they are the spontaneous outflow of young hearts easily excited to gratitude for the pleasure which some story or poem has given them and recognizing their own thoughts their own feelings in those expressed by the author as if on purpose for them to read undoubtedly they give great relief to solitary young persons who must have some ideal reflection of themselves and know not where to look since protestantism has taken away the crucifix and the madonna the recipient of these letters sometimes wonders after reading through one of them how it is that his young correspondent has managed to fill so much space with her simple message of admiration or of sympathy lurida did not belong to this particular class of correspondents but she could not resist the law of her sex whose thoughts naturally surround themselves with superabundant drapery of language as their persons float in a wide superfluity of woven tissues was she indeed writing to this unknown gentleman euthymia questioned her pointblank are you going to open a correspondence with mr maurice kirkwood lurida you seem to be so busy writing i can think of nothing else or are you going to write a novel or a paper for the society do tell me what you are so much taken up with i will tell you euthymia if you will promise not to find fault with me for carrying out my plan as i have made up my mind to do you may read this letter before i seal it and if you find anything in it you dont like you can suggest any change that you think will improve it i hope you will see that it explains itself i dont believe that you will find anything to frighten you in it this is the letter as submitted to miss tower by her friend the bold handwriting made it look like a mans letter and gave it consequently a less dangerous expression than that which belongs to the tinted and often fragrant sheet with its delicate thready characters which slant across the page like an april shower with a south wind chasing it arrowhead village august my dear sir you will doubtless be surprised at the sight of a letter like this from one whom you only know as the secretary of the pansophian society there is a very common feeling that it is unbecoming in one of my sex to address one of your own with whom she is unacquainted unless she has some special claim upon his attention i am by no means disposed to concede to the vulgar prejudice on this point if one human being has anything to communicate to another anything which deserves being communicated i see no occasion for bringing in the question of sex i do not think the homo sum of terence can be claimed for the male sex as its private property on general any more than on grammatical grounds i have sometimes thought of devoting myself to the noble art of healing if i did so it would be with the fixed purpose of giving my whole powers to the service of humanity and if i should carry out that idea should i refuse my care and skill to a suffering fellowmortal because that mortal happened to be a brother and not a sister my whole nature protests against such onesided humanity no i am blind to all distinctions when my eyes are opened to any form of suffering to any spectacle of want you may ask me why i address you whom i know little or nothing of and to whom such an advance may seem presumptuous and intrusive it is because i was deeply impressed by the paper which i attributed to you that on ocean river and lake which was read at one of our meetings i say that i was deeply impressed but i do not mean this as a compliment to that paper i am not bandying compliments now but thinking of better things than praises or phrases i was interested in the paper partly because i recognized some of the feelings expressed in it as my own partly because there was an undertone of sadness in all the voices of nature as you echoed them which made me sad to hear and which i could not help longing to cheer and enliven i said to myself i should like to hold communion with the writer of that paper i have had my lonely hours and days as he has had i have had some of his experiences in my intercourse with nature and oh if i could draw him into those better human relations which await us all if we come with the right dispositions i should blush if i stopped to inquire whether i violated any conventional rule or not you will understand me i feel sure you believe do you not in the insignificance of the barrier which divides the sisterhood from the brotherhood of mankind you believe do you not that they should be educated side by side that they should share the same pursuits due regard being had to the fitness of the particular individual for hard or light work as it must always be whether we are dealing with the stronger or the weaker sex i mark these words because notwithstanding their common use they involve so much that is not true stronger yes to lift a barrel of flour or a barrel of cider though there have been women who could do that and though when john wesley was mobbed in staffordshire a woman knocked down three or four men one after another until she was at last overpowered and nearly murdered talk about the weaker sex go and see miss euthymia tower at the gymnasium but no matter about which sex has the strongest muscles which has most to suffer and which has most endurance and vitality we go through many ordeals which you are spared but we outlast you in mind and body i have been led away into one of my accustomed trains of thought but not so far away from it as you might at first suppose my brother are you not ready to recognize in me a friend an equal a sister who can speak to you as if she had been reared under the same roof and is not the sky that covers us one roof which makes us all one family you are lonely you must be longing for some human fellowship take me into your confidence what is there that you can tell me to which i cannot respond with sympathy what saddest note in your spiritual dirges which will not find its chord in mine i long to know what influence has cast its shadow over your existence i myself have known what it is to carry a brain that never rests in a body that is always tired i have defied its infirmities and forced it to do my bidding you have no such hindrance if we may judge by your aspect and habits you deal with horses like a homeric hero no wild indian could handle his bark canoe more dexterously or more vigorously than we have seen you handling yours there must be some reason for your seclusion which curiosity has not reached and into which it is not the province of curiosity to inquire but in the irresistible desire which i have to bring you into kindly relations with those around you i must run the risk of giving offence that i may know in what direction to look for those restorative influences which the sympathy of a friend and sister can offer to a brother in need of some kindly impulse to change the course of a life which is not which cannot be in accordance with his true nature i have thought that there may be something in the conditions with which you are here surrounded which is repugnant to your feelings something which can be avoided only by keeping yourself apart from the people whose acquaintance you would naturally have formed there can hardly be anything in the place itself or you would not have voluntarily sought it as a residence even for a single season there might be individuals here whom you would not care to meet there must be such but you cannot have a personal aversion to everybody i have heard of cases in which certain sights and sounds which have no particular significance for most persons produced feelings of distress or aversion that made them unbearable to the subjects of the constitutional dislike it has occurred to me that possibly you might have some such natural aversion to the sounds of the street or such as are heard in most houses especially where a piano is kept as it is in fact in almost all of those in the village or it might be i imagined that some color in the dresses of women or the furniture of our rooms affected you unpleasantly i know that instances of such antipathy have been recorded and they would account for the seclusion of those who are subject to it if there is any removable condition which interferes with your free entrance into and enjoyment of the social life around you tell me i beg of you tell me what it is and it shall be eliminated think it not strange o my brother that i thus venture to introduce myself into the hidden chambers of your life i will never suffer myself to be frightened from the carrying out of any thought which promises to be of use to a fellowmortal by a fear lest it should be considered unfeminine i can bear to be considered unfeminine but i cannot endure to think of myself as inhuman can i help you my brother believe me your most sincere wellwisher lurida vincent euthymia had carried off this letter and read it by herself as she finished it her feelings found expression in an old phrase of her grandmothers which came up of itself as such survivals of early days are apt to do on great occasions well i never then she loosened some button or string that was too tight and went to the window for a breath of outdoor air then she began at the beginning and read the whole letter all over again what should she do about it she could not let this young girl send a letter like that to a stranger of whose character little was known except by inference to a young man who would consider it a most extraordinary advance on the part of the sender she would have liked to tear it into a thousand pieces but she had no right to treat it in that way lurida meant to send it the next morning and in the mean time euthymia had the night to think over what she should do about it there is nothing like the pillow for an oracle there is no voice like that which breaks the silence of the stagnant hours of the night with its sudden suggestions and luminous counsels when euthymia awoke in the morning her course of action was as clear before her as if it bad been dictated by her guardian angel she went straight over to the home of lurida who was just dressed for breakfast she was naturally a little surprised at this early visit she was struck with the excited look of euthymia being herself quite calm and contemplating her project with entire complacency euthymia began in tones that expressed deep anxiety i have read your letter my dear and admired its spirit and force it is a fine letter and does you great credit as an expression of the truest human feeling but it must not be sent to mr kirkwood if you were sixty years old perhaps if you were fifty it might be admissible to send it but if you were forty i should question its propriety if you were thirty i should veto it and you are but a little more than twenty how do you know that this stranger will not show your letter to anybody or everybody how do you know that he will not send it to one of the gossiping journals like the household inquisitor but supposing he keeps it to himself which is more than you have a right to expect what opinion is he likely to form of a young lady who invades his privacy with such freedom ten to one he will think curiosity is at the bottom of it and come dont be angry at me for suggesting it may there not be a little of that same motive mingled with the others no dont interrupt me quite yet you do want to know whether your hypothesis is correct you are full of the best and kindest feelings in the world but your desire for knowledge is the ferment under them just now perhaps more than you know luridas pale cheeks flushed and whitened more than once while her friend was speaking she loved her too sincerely and respected her intelligence too much to take offence at her advice but she could not give up her humane and sisterly intentions merely from the fear of some awkward consequences to herself she had persuaded herself that she was playing the part of a protestant sister of charity and that the fact of her not wearing the costume of these ministering angels made no difference in her relations to those who needed her aid i cannot see your objections in the light in which they appear to you she said gravely it seems to me that i give up everything when i hesitate to help a fellowcreature because i am a woman i am not afraid to send this letter and take all the consequences will you go with me to the doctors and let him read it in our presence and will you agree to abide by his opinion if it coincides with mine lurida winced a little at this proposal i dont quite like she said showing this letter to to she hesitated but it had to come out to a man that is to another man than the one for whom it was intended the neuter gender business had got a pretty damaging sidehit well never mind about letting him read the letter will you go over to his house with me at noon when he comes back after his morning visits and have a talk over the whole matter with him you know i have sometimes had to say must to you lurida and now i say you must go to the doctors with me and carry that letter there was no resisting the potent monosyllable as the sweet but firm voice delivered it at noon the two maidens rang at the doctors door the servant said he had been at the house after his morning visits but found a hasty summons to mr kirkwood who had been taken suddenly ill and wished to see him at once was the illness dangerous the servantmaid did nt know but thought it was pretty bad for mr paul came in as white as a sheet and talked all sorts of languages which she couldnt understand and took on as if he thought mr kirkwood was going to die right off and so the hazardous question about sending the letter was disposed of at least for the present xvii dr buttss patient the physician found maurice just regaining his heat after a chill of a somewhat severe character he knew too well what this meant and the probable series of symptoms of which it was the prelude his patient was not the only one in the neighborhood who was attacked in this way the autumnal fevers to which our country towns are subject in the place of those agues or intermittents so largely prevalent in the south and west were already beginning and maurice who had exposed himself in the early and late hours of the dangerous season must be expected to go through the regular stages of this always serious and not rarely fatal disease paolo his faithful servant would fain have taken the sole charge of his master during his illness but the doctor insisted that he must have a nurse to help him in his task which was likely to be long and exhausting at the mention of the word nurse paolo turned white and exclaimed in an agitated and thoroughly frightened way no no nuss no woman she kill him i stay by him day and night but don let no woman come near him if you do he die the doctor explained that he intended to send a man who was used to taking care of sick people and with no little effort at last succeeded in convincing paolo that as he could not be awake day and night for a fortnight or three weeks it was absolutely necessary to call in some assistance from without and so mr maurice kirkwood was to play the leading part in that drama of natures composing called a typhoid fever with its regular bedchamber scenery its properties of phials and pillboxes its little company of stock actors its gradual evolution of a very simple plot its familiar incidents its emotional alternations and its denouement sometimes tragic oftener happy it is needless to say that the sympathies of all the good people of the village residents and strangers were actively awakened for the young man about whom they knew so little and conjectured so much tokens of their kindness came to him daily flowers from the woods and from the gardens choice fruit grown in the open air or under glass for there were some fine houses surrounded by wellkept grounds and greenhouses and graperies were not unknown in the small but favored settlement on all these luxuries maurice looked with dull and languid eyes a faint smile of gratitude sometimes struggled through the stillness of his features or a murmured word of thanks found its way through his parched lips and he would relapse into the partial stupor or the fitful sleep in which with intervals of slight wandering the slow hours dragged along the sluggish days one after another with no violent symptoms but with steady persistency the disease moved on in its accustomed course it was at no time immediately threatening but the experienced physician knew its uncertainties only too well he had known fever patients suddenly seized with violent internal inflammation and carried off with frightful rapidity he remembered the case of a convalescent a young woman who had been attacked while in apparently vigorous general health who on being lifted too suddenly to a sitting position while still confined to her bed fainted and in a few moments ceased to breathe it may well be supposed that he took every possible precaution to avert the accidents which tend to throw from its track a disease the regular course of which is arranged by nature as carefully as the route of a railroad from one city to another the most natural interpretation which the common observer would put upon the manifestations of one of these autumnal maladies would be that some noxious combustible element had found its way into the system which must be burned to ashes before the heat which pervades the whole body can subside sometimes the fire may smoulder and seem as if it were going out or were quite extinguished and again it will find some new material to seize upon and flame up as fiercely as ever its coming on most frequently at the season when the brush fires which are consuming the dead branches and withered leaves and all the refuse of vegetation are sending up their smoke is suggestive sometimes it seems as if the body relieved of its effete materials renewed its youth after one of these quiet expurgating internal fractional cremations lean pallid students have found themselves plump and blooming and it has happened that one whose hair was straight as gnat of an indian has been startled to behold himself in his mirror with a fringe of hyacinthine curls about his rejuvenated countenance there was nothing of what medical men call malignity in the case of maurice kirkwood the most alarming symptom was a profound prostration which at last reached such a point that he lay utterly helpless as unable to move without aid as the feeblest of paralytics in this state he lay for many days not suffering pain but with the sense of great weariness and the feeling that he should never rise from his bed again for the most part his intellect was unclouded when his attention was aroused he spoke only in whispers a few words at a time the doctor felt sure by the expression which passed over his features from time to time that something was worrying and oppressing him something which he wished to communicate and had not the force or the tenacity of purpose to make perfectly clear his eyes often wandered to a certain desk and once he had found strength to lift his emaciated arm and point to it the doctor went towards it as if to fetch it to him but he slowly shook his head he had not the power to say at that time what he wished the next day he felt a little less prostrated and succeeded in explaining to the doctor what he wanted his words so far as the physician could make them out were these which follow dr butts looked upon them as possibly expressing wishes which would be his last and noted them down carefully immediately after leaving his chamber i commit the secret of my life to your charge my whole story is told in a paper locked in that desk the key is put your hand under my pillow if i die let the story be known it will show that i was human and save my memory from reproach he was silent for a little time a single tear stole down his hollow cheek the doctor turned his head away for his own eyes were full but he said to himself it is a good sign i begin to feel strong hopes that he will recover maurice spoke once more doctor i put full trust in you you are wise and kind do what you will with this paper but open it at once and read i want you to know the story of my life before it is finished if the end is at hand take it with you and read it before you sleep he was exhausted and presently his eyes closed but the doctor saw a tranquil look on his features which added encouragement to his hopes xviii maurice kirkwoods story of his life i am an american by birth but a large part of my life has been passed in foreign lands my father was a man of education possessed of an ample fortune my mother was considered a very accomplished and amiable woman i was their first and only child she died while i was yet an infant if i remember her at all it is as a vision more like a glimpse of a prenatal existence than as a part of my earthly life at the death of my mother i was left in the charge of the old nurse who had enjoyed her perfect confidence she was devoted to me and i became absolutely dependent on her who had for me all the love and all the care of a mother i was naturally the object of the attentions and caresses of the family relatives i have been told that i was a pleasant smiling infant with nothing to indicate any peculiar nervous susceptibility not afraid of strangers but on the contrary ready to make their acquaintance my father was devoted to me and did all in his power to promote my health and comfort i was still a babe often carried in arms when the event happened which changed my whole future and destined me to a strange and lonely existence i cannot relate it even now without a sense of terror i must force myself to recall the circumstances as told me and vaguely remembered for i am not willing that my doomed and wholly exceptional life should pass away unrecorded unexplained unvindicated my nature is i feel sure a kind and social one but i have lived apart as if my heart were filled with hatred of my fellowcreatures if there are any readers who look without pity without sympathy upon those who shun the fellowship of their fellow men and women who show by their downcast or averted eyes that they dread companionship and long for solitude i pray them if this paper ever reaches them to stop at this point follow me no further for you will not believe my story nor enter into the feelings which i am about to reveal but if there are any to whom all that is human is of interest who have felt in their own consciousness some stirrings of invincible attraction to one individual and equally invincible repugnance to another who know by their own experience that elective affinities have as their necessary counterpart and as it were their polar opposites currents not less strong of elective repulsions let them read with unquestioning faith the story of a blighted life i am about to relate much of it of course received from the lips of others my cousin laura a girl of seventeen lately returned from europe was considered eminently beautiful it was in my second summer that she visited my fathers house where he was living with his servants and my old nurse my mother having but recently left him a widower laura was full of vivacity impulsive quick in her movements thoughtless occasionally as it is not strange that a young girl of her age should be it was a beautiful summer day when she saw me for the first time my nurse had me in her arms walking back and forward on a balcony with a low railing upon which opened the windows of the second story of my fathers house while the nurse was thus carrying me laura came suddenly upon the balcony she no sooner saw me than with all the delighted eagerness of her youthful nature she rushed toward me and catching me from the nurses arms began tossing me after the fashion of young girls who have been so lately playing with dolls that they feel as if babies were very much of the same nature the abrupt seizure frightened me i sprang from her arms in my terror and fell over the railing of the balcony i should probably enough have been killed on the spot but for the fact that a low thornbush grew just beneath the balcony into which i fell and thus had the violence of the shock broken but the thorns tore my tender flesh and i bear to this day marks of the deep wounds they inflicted that dreadful experience is burned deep into my memory the sudden apparition of the girl the sense of being torn away from the protecting arms around me the frantic effort to escape the shriek that accompanied my fall through what must have seemed unmeasurable space the cruel lacerations of the piercing and rending thorns all these fearful impressions blended in one paralyzing terror when i was taken up i was thought to be dead i was perfectly white and the physician who first saw me said that no pulse was perceptible but after a time consciousness returned the wounds though painful were none of them dangerous and the most alarming effects of the accident passed away my old nurse cared for me tenderly day and night and my father who had been almost distracted in the first hours which followed the injury hoped and believed that no permanent evil results would be found to result from it my cousin laura was of course deeply distressed to feel that her thoughtlessness had been the cause of so grave an accident as soon as i had somewhat recovered she came to see me very penitent very anxious to make me forget the alarm she had caused me with all its consequences i was in the nursery sitting up in my bed bandaged but not in any pain as it seemed for i was quiet and to all appearance in a perfectly natural state of feeling as laura came near me i shrieked and instantly changed color i put my hand upon my heart as if i had been stabbed and fell over unconscious it was very much the same state as that in which i was found immediately after my fall the cause of this violent and appalling seizure was but too obvious the approach of the young girl and the dread that she was about to lay her hand upon me had called up the same train of effects which the moment of terror and pain had already occasioned the old nurse saw this in a moment go go she cried to laura go or the child will die her command did not have to be repeated after laura had gone i lay senseless white and cold as marble for some time the doctor soon came and by the use of smart rubbing and stimulants the color came back slowly to my cheeks and the arrested circulation was again set in motion it was hard to believe that this was anything more than a temporary effect of the accident there could be little doubt it was thought by the doctor and by my father that after a few days i should recover from this morbid sensibility and receive my cousin as other infants receive pleasantlooking young persons the old nurse shook her head the girl will be the death of the child she said if she touches him or comes near him his heart stopped beating just as when the girl snatched him out of my arms and he fell over the balcony railing once more the experiment was tried cautiously almost insidiously the same alarming consequences followed it was too evident that a chain of nervous disturbances had been set up in my system which repeated itself whenever the original impression gave the first impulse i never saw my cousin laura after this last trial its result had so distressed her that she never ventured again to show herself to me if the effect of the nervous shock had stopped there it would have been a misfortune for my cousin and myself but hardly a calamity the world is wide and a cousin or two more or less can hardly be considered an essential of existence i often heard lauras name mentioned but never by any one who was acquainted with all the circumstances for it was noticed that i changed color and caught at my breast as if i wanted to grasp my heart in my hand whenever that fatal name was mentioned alas this was not all while i was suffering from the effects of my fall among the thorns i was attended by my old nurse assisted by another old woman by a physician and my father who would take his share in caring for me it was thought best to keep me perfectly quiet and strangers and friends were alike excluded from my nursery with one exception that my old grandmother came in now and then with her it seems that i was somewhat timid and shy following her with rather anxious eyes as if not quite certain whether or not she was dangerous but one day when i was far advanced towards recovery my father brought in a young lady a relative of his who had expressed a great desire to see me she was as i have been told a very handsome girl of about the same age as my cousin laura but bearing no personal resemblance to her in form features or complexion she had no sooner entered the room than the same sudden changes which had followed my cousins visit began to show themselves and before she had reached my bedside i was in a state of deadly collapse as on the occasions already mentioned some time passed before any recurrence of these terrifying seizures a little girl of five or six years old was allowed to come into the nursery one day and bring me some flowers i took them from her hand but turned away and shut my eyes there was no seizure but there was a certain dread and aversion nothing more than a feeling which it might be hoped that time would overcome those around me were gradually finding out the circumstances which brought on the deadly attack to which i was subject the daughter of one of our near neighbors was considered the prettiest girl of the village where we were passing the summer she was very anxious to see me and as i was now nearly well it was determined that she should be permitted to pay me a short visit i had always delighted in seeing her and being caressed by her i was sleeping when she entered the nursery and came and took a seat at my side in perfect silence presently i became restless and a moment later i opened my eyes and saw her stooping over me my hand went to my left breast the color faded from my cheeks i was again the cold marble image so like death that it had wellnigh been mistaken for it could it be possible that the fright which had chilled my blood had left me with an unconquerable fear of woman at the period when she is most attractive not only to adolescents but to children of tender age who feel the fascination of her flowing locks her bright eyes her blooming cheeks and that mysterious magnetism of sex which draws all life into its warm and potently vitalized atmosphere so it did indeed seem the dangerous experiment could not be repeated indefinitely it was not intentionally tried again but accident brought about more than one renewal of it during the following years until it became fully recognized that i was the unhappy subject of a mortal dread of woman not absolutely of the human female for i had no fear of my old nurse or of my grandmother or of any old wrinkled face and i had become accustomed to the occasional meeting of a little girl or two whom i nevertheless regarded with a certain illdefined feeling that there was danger in their presence i was sent to a boys school very early and during the first ten or twelve years of my life i had rarely any occasion to be reminded of my strange idiosyncrasy as i grew out of boyhood into youth a change came over the feelings which had so long held complete possession of me this was what my father and his advisers had always anticipated and was the ground of their confident hope in my return to natural conditions before i should have grown to mature manhood how shall i describe the conflicts of those dreamy bewildering dreadful years visions of loveliness haunted me sleeping and waking sometimes a graceful girlish figure would so draw my eyes towards it that i lost sight of all else and was ready to forget all my fears and find myself at her side like other youths by the side of young maidens happy in their cheerful companionship while i i under the curse of one blighting moment looked on hopeless sometimes the glimpse of a fair face or the tone of a sweet voice stirred within me all the instincts that make the morning of life beautiful to adolescence i reasoned with myself why should i not have outgrown that idle apprehension which had been the nightmare of my earlier years why should not the rising tide of life have drowned out the feeble growths that infested the shallows of childhood how many children there are who tremble at being left alone in the dark but who a few years later will smile at their foolish terrors and brave all the ghosts of a haunted chamber why should i any longer be the slave of a foolish fancy that has grown into a half insane habit of mind i was familiarly acquainted with all the stories of the strange antipathies and invincible repugnances to which others some of them famous men had been subject i said to myself why should not i overcome this dread of woman as peter the great fought down his dread of wheels rolling over a bridge was i alone of all mankind to be doomed to perpetual exclusion from the society which as it seemed to me was all that rendered existence worth the trouble and fatigue of slavery to the vulgar need of supplying the waste of the system and working at the task of respiration like the daughters of danaus toiling day and night as the wornout sailor labors at the pump of his sinking vessel why did i not brave the risk of meeting squarely and without regard to any possible danger some one of those fair maidens whose faroff smile whose graceful movements at once attracted and agitated me i can only answer this question to the satisfaction of any really inquiring reader by giving him the true interpretation of the singular phenomenon of which i was the subject for this i shall have to refer to a paper of which i have made a copy and which will be found included with this manuscript it is enough to say here without entering into the explanation of the fact which will be found simple enough as seen by the light of modern physiological science that the nervous disturbance which the presence of a woman in the flower of her age produced in my system was a sense of impending death sudden overwhelming unconquerable appalling it was a reversed action of the nervous centres the opposite of that which flushes the young lovers cheek and hurries his bounding pulses as he comes into the presence of the object of his passion no one who has ever felt the sensation can have failed to recognize it as an imperative summons which commands instant and terrified submission it was at this period of my life that my father determined to try the effect of travel and residence in different localities upon my bodily and mental condition i say bodily as well as mental for i was too slender for my height and subject to some nervous symptoms which were a cause of anxiety that the mind was largely concerned in these there was no doubt but the mutual interactions of mind and body are often too complex to admit of satisfactory analysis each is in part cause and each also in part effect we passed some years in italy chiefly in rome where i was placed in a school conducted by priests and where of course i met only those of my own sex there i had the opportunity of seeing the influences under which certain young catholics destined for the priesthood are led to separate themselves from all communion with the sex associated in their minds with the most subtle dangers to which the human soul can be exposed i became in some degree reconciled to the thought of exclusion from the society of women by seeing around me so many who were selfdevoted to celibacy the thought sometimes occurred to me whether i should not find the best and the only natural solution of the problem of existence as submitted to myself in taking upon me the vows which settle the whole question and raise an impassable barrier between the devotee and the object of his dangerous attraction how often i talked this whole matter over with the young priest who was at once my special instructor and my favorite companion but accustomed as i had become to the forms of the roman church and impressed as i was with the purity and excellence of many of its young members with whom i was acquainted my early training rendered it impossible for me to accept the credentials which it offered me as authoritative my friend and instructor had to set me down as a case of invincible ignorance this was the loophole through which he crept out of the prisonhouse of his creed and was enabled to look upon me without the feeling of absolute despair with which his sterner brethren would i fear have regarded me i have said that accident exposed me at times to the influence which i had such reasons for dreading here is one example of such an occurrence which i relate as simply as possible vividly as it is impressed upon my memory a young friend whose acquaintance i had made in rome asked me one day to come to his rooms and look at a cabinet of gems and medals which he had collected i had been but a short time in his library when a vague sense of uneasiness came over me my heart became restless i could feel it stirring irregularly as if it were some frightened creature caged in my breast there was nothing that i could see to account for it a door was partly open but not so that i could see into the next room the feeling grew upon me of some influence which was paralyzing my circulation i begged my friend to open a window as he did so the door swung in the draught and i saw a blooming young woman it was my friends sister who had been sitting with a book in her hand and who rose at the opening of the door something had warned me of the presence of a woman that occult and potent aura of individuality call it personal magnetism spiritual effluence or reduce it to a simpler expression if you will whatever it was it had warned me of the nearness of the dread attraction which allured at a distance and revealed itself with all the terrors of the lorelei if approached too recklessly a sign from her brother caused her to withdraw at once but not before i had felt the impression which betrayed itself in my change of color anxiety about the region of the heart and sudden failure as if about to fall in a deadly faintingfit does all this seem strange and incredible to the reader of my manuscript nothing in the history of life is so strange or exceptional as it seems to those who have not made a long study of its mysteries i have never known just such a case as my own and yet there must have been such and if the whole history of mankind were unfolded i cannot doubt that there have been many like it let my reader suspend his judgment until he has read the paper i have referred to which was drawn up by a committee of the royal academy of the biological sciences in this paper the mechanism of the series of nervous derangements to which i have been subject since the fatal shock experienced in my infancy is explained in language not hard to understand it will be seen that such a change of polarity in the nervous centres is only a permanent form and an extreme degree of an emotional disturbance which as a temporary and comparatively unimportant personal accident is far from being uncommon is so frequent in fact that every one must have known instances of it and not a few must have had more or less serious experiences of it in their own private history it must not be supposed that my imagination dealt with me as i am now dealing with the reader i was full of strange fancies and wild superstitions one of my catholic friends gave me a silver medal which had been blessed by the pope and which i was to wear next my body i was told that this would turn black after a time in virtue of a power which it possessed of drawing out original sin or certain portions of it together with the evil and morbid tendencies which had been engrafted on the corrupt nature i wore the medal faithfully as directed and watched it carefully it became tarnished and after a time darkened but it wrought no change in my unnatural condition there was an old gypsy who had the reputation of knowing more of futurity than she had any right to know the story was that she had foretold the assassination of count rossi and the death of cavour however that may have been i was persuaded to let her try her black art upon my future i shall never forget the strange wild look of the wrinkled hag as she took my hand and studied its lines and fixed her wicked old eyes on my young countenance after this examination she shook her head and muttered some words which as nearly as i could get them would be in english like these fair lady cast a spell on thee fair ladys hand shall set thee free strange as it may seem these words of a withered old creature whose palm had to be crossed with silver to bring forth her oracular response have always clung to my memory as if they were destined to fulfilment the extraordinary nature of the affliction to which i was subject disposed me to believe the incredible with reference to all that relates to it i have never ceased to have the feeling that sooner or later i should find myself freed from the blight laid upon me in my infancy it seems as if it would naturally come through the influence of some young and fair woman to whom that merciful errand should be assigned by the providence that governs our destiny with strange hopes with trembling fears with mingled belief and doubt wherever i have found myself i have sought with longing yet halfaverted eyes for the elect lady as i have learned to call her who was to lift the curse from my ruined life three times i have been led to the hope if not the belief that i had found the object of my superstitious belief singularly enough it was always on the water that the phantom of my hope appeared before my bewildered vision once it was an english girl who was a fellow passenger with me in one of my ocean voyages i need not say that she was beautiful for she was my dream realized i heard her singing i saw her walking the deck on some of the fair days when seasickness was forgotten the passengers were a social company enough but i had kept myself apart as was my wont at last the attraction became too strong to resist any longer i will venture into the charmed circle if it kills me i said to my father i did venture and it did not kill me or i should not be telling this story but there was a repetition of the old experiences i need not relate the series of alarming consequences of my venture the english girl was very lovely and i have no doubt has made some one supremely happy before this but she was not the elect lady of the prophecy and of my dreams a second time i thought myself for a moment in the presence of the destined deliverer who was to restore me to my natural place among my fellow men and women it was on the tiber that i met the young maiden who drew me once more into that inner circle which surrounded young womanhood with deadly peril for me if i dared to pass its limits i was floating with the stream in the little boat in which i passed many long hours of reverie when i saw another small boat with a boy and a young girl in it the boy had been rowing and one of his oars had slipped from his grasp he did not know how to paddle with a single oar and was hopelessly rowing round and round his oar all the time floating farther away from him i could not refuse my assistance i picked up the oar and brought my skiff alongside of the boat when i handed the oar to the boy the young girl lifted her veil and thanked me in the exquisite music of the language which sounds as if it should be writ on satin she was a type of italian beauty a nocturne in flesh and blood if i may borrow a term certain artists are fond of but it was her voice which captivated me and for a moment made me believe that i was no longer shut off from all relations with the social life of my race an hour later i was found lying insensible on the floor of my boat white cold almost pulseless it cost much patient labor to bring me back to consciousness had not such extreme efforts been made it seems probable that i should never have waked from a slumber which was hardly distinguishable from that of death why should i provoke a catastrophe which appears inevitable if i invite it by exposing myself to its too well ascertained cause the habit of these deadly seizures has become a second nature the strongest and the ablest men have found it impossible to resist the impression produced by the most insignificant object by the most harmless sight or sound to which they had a congenital or acquired antipathy what prospect have i of ever being rid of this long and deepseated infirmity i may well ask myself these questions but my answer is that i will never give up the hope that time will yet bring its remedy it may be that the wild prediction which so haunts me shall find itself fulfilled i have had of late strange premonitions to which if i were superstitious i could not help giving heed but i have seen too much of the faith that deals in miracles to accept the supernatural in any shape assuredly when it comes from an old witchlike creature who takes pay for her revelations of the future be it so though i am not superstitious i have a right to be imaginative and my imagination will hold to those words of the old zingara with an irresistible feeling that sooner or later they will prove true can it be possible that her prediction is not far from its realization i have had both waking and sleeping visions within these last months and weeks which have taken possession of me and filled my life with new thoughts new hopes new resolves sometimes on the bosom of the lake by which i am dreaming away this season of bloom and fragrance sometimes in the fields or woods in a distant glimpse once in a nearer glance which left me pale and tremulous yet was followed by a swift reaction so that my cheeks flushed and my pulse bounded i have seen her who how do i dare to tell it so that my own eyes can read it i cannot help believing is to be my deliverer my saviour i have been warned in the most solemn and impressive language by the experts most deeply read in the laws of life and the history of its disturbing and destroying influences that it would be at the imminent risk of my existence if i should expose myself to the repetition of my former experiences i was reminded that unexplained sudden deaths were of constant of daily occurrence that any emotion is liable to arrest the movements of life terror joy good news or bad news anything that reaches the deeper nervous centres i had already died once as sir charles napier said of himself yes more than once died and been resuscitated the next time i might very probably fail to get my return ticket after my visit to hades it was a rather grim stroke of humor but i understood its meaning full well and felt the force of its menace after all what had i to live for if the great primal instinct which strives to make whole the half life of lonely manhood is defeated suppressed crushed out of existence why not as well die in the attempt to break up a wretched servitude to a perverted nervous movement as in any other way i am alone in the world alone save for my faithful servant through whom i seem to hold to the human race as it were by a single filament my father who was my instructor my companion my dearest and best friend through all my later youth and my earlier manhood died three years ago and left me my own master with the means of living as might best please my fancy this season shall decide my fate one more experiment and i shall find myself restored to my place among my fellowbeings or as i devoutly hope in a sphere where all our mortal infirmities are past and forgotten i have told the story of a blighted life without reserve so that there shall not remain any mystery or any dark suspicion connected with my memory if i should be taken away unexpectedly it has cost me an effort to do it but now that my life is on record i feel more reconciled to my lot with all its possibilities and among these possibilities is a gleam of a better future i have been told by my advisers some of them wise deeply instructed and kindhearted men that such a lifedestiny should be related by the subject of it for the instruction of others and especially for the light it throws on certain peculiarities of human character often wrongly interpreted as due to moral perversion when they are in reality the results of misdirected or reversed actions in some of the closely connected nervous centres for myself i can truly say that i have very little morbid sensibility left with reference to the destiny which has been allotted to me i have passed through different stages of feeling with reference to it as i have developed from infancy to manhood at first it was mere blind instinct about which i had no thought living like other infants the life of impressions without language to connect them in series in my boyhood i began to be deeply conscious of the infirmity which separated me from those around me in youth began that conflict of emotions and impulses with the antagonistic influence of which i have already spoken a conflict which has never ceased but to which i have necessarily become to a certain degree accustomed and against the dangers of which i have learned to guard myself habitually that is the meaning of my isolation you young man if at any time your eyes shall look upon my melancholy record you at least will understand me does not your heart throb in the presence of budding or blooming womanhood sometimes as if it were ready to crack with its own excess of strain what if instead of throbbing it should falter flutter and stop as if never to beat again you young woman who with ready belief and tender sympathy will look upon these pages if they are ever spread before you know what it is when your breast heaves with uncontrollable emotion and the grip of the bodice seems unendurable as the embrace of the iron virgin of the inquisition think what it would be if the grasp were tightened so that no breath of air could enter your panting chest does your heart beat in the same way young man when your honored friend a venerable matron of seventy years greets you with her kindly smile as it does in the presence of youthful loveliness when a pretty child brings you her doll and looks into your eyes with artless grace and trustful simplicity does your pulse quicken do you tremble does life palpitate through your whole being as when the maiden of seventeen meets your enamored sight in the glow of her rosebud beauty wonder not then if the period of mystic attraction for you should be that of agitation terror danger to one in whom the natural current of the instincts has had its course changed as that of a stream is changed by a convulsion of nature so that the impression which is new life to you is death to him i am now twentyfive years old i have reached the time of life which i have dreamed nay even ventured to hope might be the limit of the sentence which was pronounced upon me in my infancy i can assign no good reason for this anticipation but in writing this paper i feel as if i were preparing to begin a renewed existence there is nothing for me to be ashamed of in the story i have told there is no man living who would not have yielded to the sense of instantly impending death which seized upon me under the conditions i have mentioned martyrs have gone singing to their flaming shrouds but never a man could hold his breath long enough to kill himself he must have rope or water or some mechanical help or nature will make him draw in a breath of air and would make him do so though he knew the salvation of the human race would be forfeited by that one gasp this paper may never reach the eye of any one afflicted in the same way that i have been it probably never will but for all that there are many shy natures which will recognize tendencies in themselves in the direction of my unhappy susceptibility others to whom such weakness seems inconceivable will find their scepticism shaken if not removed by the calm judicial statement of the report drawn up for the royal academy it will make little difference to me whether my story is accepted unhesitatingly or looked upon as largely a product of the imagination i am but a bird of passage that lights on the boughs of different nationalities i belong to no flock my home may be among the palms of syria the olives of italy the oaks of england the elms that shadow the hudson or the connecticut i build no nest today i am here tomorrow on the wing if i quit my native land before the trees have dropped their leaves i shall place this manuscript in the safe hands of one whom i feel sure that i can trust to do with it as he shall see fit if it is only curious and has no bearing on human welfare he may think it well to let it remain unread until i shall have passed away if in his judgment it throws any light on one of the deeper mysteries of our nature the repulsions which play such a formidable part in social life and which must be recognized as the correlatives of the affinities that distribute the individuals governed by them in the face of impediments which seem to be impossibilities then it may be freely given to the world but if i am here when the leaves are all fallen the programme of my life will have changed and this story of the dead past will be illuminated by the light of a living present which will irradiate all its saddening features who would not pray that my last gleam of light and hope may be that of dawn and not of departing day the reader who finds it hard to accept the reality of a story so far from the common range of experience is once more requested to suspend his judgment until he has read the paper which will next be offered for his consideration xix the report of the biological committee perhaps it is too much to expect a reader who wishes to be entertained excited amused and does not want to work his passage through pages which he cannot understand without some effort of his own to read the paper which follows and dr buttss reflections upon it if he has no curiosity in the direction of these chapters he can afford to leave them to such as relish a slight flavor of science but if he does so leave them he will very probably remain sceptical as to the truth of the story to which they are meant to furnish him with a key of course the case of maurice kirkwood is a remarkable and exceptional one and it is hardly probable that any readers experience will furnish him with its parallel but let him look back over all his acquaintances if he has reached middle life and see if he cannot recall more than one who for some reason or other shunned the society of young women as if they had a deadly fear of their company if he remembers any such he can understand the simple statements and natural reflections which are laid before him one of the most singular facts connected with the history of maurice kirkwood was the philosophical equanimity with which he submitted to the fate which had fallen upon him he did not choose to be pumped by the interviewer who would show him up in the sensational columns of his prying newspaper he lived chiefly by himself as the easiest mode of avoiding those meetings to which he would be exposed in almost every society into which he might venture but he had learned to look upon himself very much as he would upon an intimate not himself upon a different personality a young man will naturally enough be ashamed of his shyness it is something which others believe and perhaps he himself thinks he might overcome but in the case of maurice kirkwood there was no room for doubt as to the reality and gravity of the long enduring effects of his first convulsive terror he had accepted the fact as he would have accepted the calamity of losing his sight or his hearing when he was questioned by the experts to whom his case was submitted he told them all that he knew about it almost without a sign of emotion nature was so peremptory with him saying in language that had no double meaning if you violate the condition on which you hold my gift of existence i slay you on the spot that he became as decisive in his obedience as she was in her command and accepted his fate without repining yet it must not be thought for a moment it cannot be supposed that he was insensible because he looked upon himself with the coolness of an enforced philosophy he bore his burden manfully hard as it was to live under it for he lived as we have seen in hope the thought of throwing it off with his life as too grievous to be borne was familiar to his lonely hours but he rejected it as unworthy of his manhood how he had speculated and dreamed about it is plain enough from the paper the reader may remember on ocean river and lake with these preliminary hints the paper promised is submitted to such as may find any interest in them account of a case of gynophobia with remarks being the substance of a report to the royal academy of the biological sciences by a committee of that institution the singular nature of the case we are about to narrate and comment upon will we feel confident arrest the attention of those who have learned the great fact that nature often throws the strongest light upon her laws by the apparent exceptions and anomalies which from time to time are observed we have done with the lusus naturae of earlier generations we pay little attention to the stories of miracles except so far as we receive them readymade at the hands of the churches which still hold to them not the less do we meet with strange and surprising facts which a century or two ago would have been handled by the clergy and the courts but today are calmly recorded and judged by the best light our knowledge of the laws of life can throw upon them it must be owned that there are stories which we can hardly dispute so clear and full is the evidence in their support which do notwithstanding tax our faith and sometimes leave us sceptical in spite of all the testimony which supports them in this category many will be disposed to place the case we commend to the candid attention of the academy if one were told that a young man a gentleman by birth and training well formed in apparently perfect health of agreeable physiognomy and manners could not endure the presence of the most attractive young woman but was seized with deadly terror and sudden collapse of all the powers of life if he came into her immediate presence if it were added that this same young man did not shrink from the presence of an old withered crone that he had a certain timid liking for little maidens who had not yet outgrown the company of their dolls the listener would be apt to smile if he did not laugh at the absurdity of the fable surely he would say this must be the fiction of some fanciful brain the whim of some romancer the trick of some playwright it would make a capital farce this idea carried out a young man slighting the lovely heroine of the little comedy and making love to her grandmother this would of course be overstating the truth of the story but to such a misinterpretation the plain facts lend themselves too easily we will relate the leading circumstances of the case as they were told us with perfect simplicity and frankness by the subject of an affection which if classified would come under the general head of antipathy but to which if we give it a name we shall have to apply the term gynophobia or fear of woman here follows the account furnished to the writer of the paper which is in all essentials identical with that already laid before the reader such is the case offered to our consideration assuming its truthfulness in all its particulars it remains to see in the first place whether or not it is as entirely exceptional and anomalous as it seems at first sight or whether it is only the last term of a series of cases which in their less formidable aspect are well known to us in literature in the records of science and even in our common experience to most of those among us the explanations we are now about to give are entirely superfluous but there are some whose chief studies have been in different directions and who will not complain if certain facts are mentioned which to the expert will seem rudimentary and which hardly require recapitulation to those who are familiarly acquainted with the common textbooks the heart is the centre of every living movement in the higher animals and in man furnishing in varying amount or withholding to a greater or less extent the needful supplies to all parts of the system if its action is diminished to a certain degree faintness is the immediate consequence if it is arrested loss of consciousness if its action is not soon restored death of which fainting plants the white flag remains in possession of the system how closely the heart is under the influence of the emotions we need not go to science to learn for all human experience and all literature are overflowing with evidence that shows the extent of this relation scripture is full of it the heart in hebrew poetry represents the entire life we might almost say not less forcible is the language of shakespeare as for instance in measure for measure why does my blood thus muster to my heart making it both unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness more especially is the heart associated in every literature with the passion of love a famous old story is that of galen who was called to the case of a young lady long ailing and wasting away from some cause the physicians who had already seen her were unable to make out the shrewd old practitioner suspected that love was at the bottom of the young ladys malady many relatives and friends of both sexes all of them ready with their sympathy came to see her the physician sat by her bedside during one of these visits and in an easy natural way took her hand and placed a finger on her pulse it beat quietly enough until a certain comely young gentleman entered the apartment when it suddenly rose infrequency and at the same moment her hurried breathing her changing color pale and flushed by turns betrayed the profound agitation his presence excited this was enough for the sagacious greek love was the disease the cure of which by its like may be claimed as an anticipation of homoeopathy in the frontispiece to the fine old junta edition of the works of galen you may find among the woodcuts a representation of the interesting scene with the title amantas dignotio the diagnosis or recognition of the lover love has many languages but the heart talks through all of them the pallid or burning cheek tells of the failing or leaping fountain which gives it color the lovers at the brookside could hear each others hearts beating when genevieve in coleridges poem forgot herself and was beforehand with her suitor in her sudden embrace t was partly love and partly fear and partly t was a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart always the heart whether its hurried action is seen or heard or felt but it is not always in this way that the deceitful organ treats the lover faint heart never won fair lady this saying was not meant perhaps to be taken literally but it has its literal truth many a lover has found his heart sink within him lose all its force and leave him weak as a child in his emotion at the sight of the object of his affections when porphyro looked upon madeline at her prayers in the chapel it was too much for him she seemed a splendid angel newly drest save wings for heaven porphyro grew faint she knelt so pure a thing so free from earthly taint and in balzacs novel cesar birotteau the hero of the story fainted away forjoy at the moment when under a lindentree at sceaux constancebarbejosephine accepted him as her future husband one who faints is dead if he does not i come to and nothing is more likely than that too susceptible lovers have actually gone off in this way everything depends on how the heart behaves itself in these and similar trying moments the mechanism of its actions becomes an interesting subject therefore to lovers of both sexes and to all who are capable of intense emotions the heart is a great reservoir which distributes food drink air and heat to every part of the system in exchange for its waste material it knocks at the gate of every organ seventy or eighty times in a minute calling upon it to receive its supplies and unload its refuse between it and the brain there is the closest relation the emotions which act upon it as we have seen govern it by a mechanism only of late years thoroughly understood this mechanism can be made plain enough to the reader who is not afraid to believe that he can understand it the brain as all know is the seat of ideas emotions volition it is the great central telegraphic station with which many lesser centres are in close relation from which they receive and to which they transmit their messages the heart has its own little brains so to speak small collections of nervous substance which govern its rhythmical motions under ordinary conditions but these lesser nervous centres are to a large extent dominated by influences transmitted from certain groups of nervecells in the brain and its immediate dependencies there are two among the special groups of nervecells which produce directly opposite effects one of these has the power of accelerating the action of the heart while the other has the power of retarding or arresting this action one acts as the spur the other as the bridle according as one or the other predominates the action of the heart will be stimulated or restrained among the great modern discoveries in physiology is that of the existence of a distinct centre of inhibition as the restraining influence over the heart is called the centre of inhibition plays a terrible part in the history of cowardice and of unsuccessful love no man can be brave without blood to sustain his courage any more than he can think as the german materialist says not absurdly without phosphorus the fainting lover must recover his circulation or his lady will lend him her smellingsalts and take a gallant with blood in his cheeks porphyro got over his faintness before he ran away with madeline and cesar birotteau was an accepted lover when he swooned with happiness but many an officer has been cashiered and many a suitor has been rejected because the centre of inhibition has got the upper hand of the centre of stimulation in the wellknown cases of deadly antipathy which have been recorded the most frequent cause has been the disturbed and depressing influence of the centre of inhibition fainting at the sight of blood is one of the commonest examples of this influence a single impression in a very early period of atmospheric existence perhaps indirectly before that period as was said to have happened in the case of james the first of england may establish a communication between this centre and the heart which will remain open ever afterwards how does a footpath across a field establish itself its curves are arbitrary and what we call accidental but one after another follows it as if he were guided by a chart on which it was laid down so it is with this dangerous transit between the centre of inhibition and the great organ of life if once the path is opened by the track of some profound impression that same impression if repeated or a similar one is likely to find the old footmarks and follow them habit only makes the path easier to traverse and thus the unreasoning terror of a child of an infant may perpetuate itself in a timidity which shames the manhood of its subject the case before us is an exceptional and most remarkable example of the effect of inhibition on the heart we will not say that we believe it to be unique in the history of the human race on the contrary we do not doubt that there have been similar cases and that in some rare instances sudden death has been the consequence of seizures like that of the subject of this report the case most like it is that of colone townsend which is too well known to require any lengthened description in this paper it is enough to recall the main facts he could by a voluntary effort suspend the action of his heart for a considerable period during which he lay like one dead pulseless and without motion after a time the circulation returned and he does not seem to have been the worse for his dangerous or seemingly dangerous experiment but in his case it was by an act of the will that the hearts action was suspended in the case before us it is an involuntary impulse transmitted from the brain to the inhibiting centre which arrests the cardiac movements what is like to be the further history of the case the subject of this anomalous affliction is now more than twenty years old the chain of nervous actions has become firmly established it might have been hoped that the changes of adolescence would have effected a transformation of the perverted instinct on the contrary the whole force of this instinct throws itself on the centre of inhibition instead of quickening the heartbeats and sending the rush of youthful blood with fresh life through the entire system to the throbbing fingertips is it probable that time and circumstances will alter a habit of nervous interactions so long established we are disposed to think that there is a chance of its being broken up and we are not afraid to say that we suspect the old gypsy woman whose prophecy took such hold of the patients imagination has hit upon the way in which the spell as she called it is to be dissolved she must in all probability have had a hint of the antipatia to which the youth before her was a victim and its cause and if so her guess as to the probable mode in which the young man would obtain relief from his unfortunate condition was the one which would naturally suggest itself if once the nervous impression which falls on the centre of inhibition can be made to change its course so as to follow its natural channel it will probably keep to that channel ever afterwards and this will it is most likely be effected by some sudden unexpected impression if he were drowning and a young woman should rescue him it is by no means impossible that the change in the nervous current we have referred to might be brought about as rapidly as easily as the reversal of the poles in a magnet which is effected in an instant but he cannot be expected to throw himself into the water just at the right moment when the fair lady of the gitanas prophecy is passing on the shore accident may effect the cure which art seems incompetent to perform it would not be strange if in some future seizure he should never come back to consciousness but it is quite conceivable on the other hand that a happier event may occur that in a single moment the nervous polarity may be reversed the whole course of his life changed and his past terrible experiences be to him like a scarceremembered dream this is one of those cases in which it is very hard to determine the wisest course to be pursued the question is not unlike that which arises in certain cases of dislocation of the bones of the neck shall the unfortunate sufferer go all his days with his face turned far round to the right or the left or shall an attempt be made to replace the dislocated bones an attempt which may succeed or may cause instant death the patient must be consulted as to whether he will take the chance the practitioner may be unwilling to risk it if the patient consents each case must be judged on its own special grounds we cannot think that this young man is doomed to perpetual separation from the society of womanhood during the period of its bloom and attraction but to provoke another seizure after his past experiences would be too much like committing suicide we fear that we must trust to the chapter of accidents the strange malady for such it is has become a second nature and may require as energetic a shock to displace it as it did to bring it into existence time alone can solve this question on which depends the wellbeing and it may be the existence of a young man every way fitted to be happy and to give happiness if restored to his true nature xx dr butts reflects dr butts sat up late at night reading these papers and reflecting upon them he was profoundly impressed and tenderly affected by the entire frankness the absence of all attempt at concealment which maurice showed in placing these papers at his disposal he believed that his patient would recover from this illness for which he had been taking care of him he thought deeply and earnestly of what he could do for him after he should have regained his health and strength there were references in maurices own account of himself which the doctor called to mind with great interest after reading his brief autobiography some one person some young woman it must be had produced a singular impression upon him since those earlier perilous experiences through which he had passed the doctor could not help thinking of that meeting with euthymia of which she had spoken to him maurice as she said turned pale he clapped his hand to his breast he might have done so if he had met her chambermaid or any straggling damsel of the village but euthymia was not a young woman to be looked upon with indifference she held herself like a queen and walked like one not a stage queen but one born and bred to selfreliance and command of herself as well as others one could not pass her without being struck with her noble bearing and spirited features if she had known how maurice trembled as he looked upon her in that conflict of attraction and uncontrollable dread if she had known it but what even then could she have done nothing but get away from him as fast as she could as it was it was a long time before his agitation subsided and his heart beat with its common force and frequency dr butts was not a male gossip nor a matchmaking gobetween but he could not help thinking what a pity it was that these two young persons could not come together as other young people do in the pairing season and find out whether they cared for and were fitted for each other he did not pretend to settle this question in his own mind but the thought was a natural one and here was a gulf between them as deep and wide as that between lazarus and dives would it ever be bridged over this thought took possession of the doctors mind and he imagined all sorts of ways of effecting some experimental approximation between maurice and euthymia from this delicate subject he glanced off to certain general considerations suggested by the extraordinary history he had been reading he began by speculating as to the possibility of the personal presence of an individual making itself perceived by some channel other than any of the five senses the study of the natural sciences teaches those who are devoted to them that the most insignificant facts may lead the way to the discovery of the most important allpervading laws of the universe from the kick of a frogs hind leg to the amazing triumphs which began with that seemingly trivial incident is a long a very long stride if madam galvani had not been in delicate health which was the occasion of her having some frogbroth prepared for her the world of today might not be in possession of the electric telegraph and the light which blazes like the sun at high noon a commonlooking occurrence one seemingly unimportant which had hitherto passed unnoticed with the ordinary course of things was the means of introducing us to a new and vast realm of closely related phenomena it was like a key that we might have picked up looking so simple that it could hardly fit any lock but one of like simplicity but which should all at once throw back the bolts of the one lock which had defied the most ingenious of our complex implements and open our way into a hitherto unexplored territory it certainly was not through the eye alone that maurice felt the paralyzing influence he could contemplate euthymia from a distance as he did on the day of the boatrace without any nervous disturbance a certain proximity was necessary for the influence to be felt as in the case of magnetism and electricity an atmosphere of danger surrounded every woman he approached during the period when her sex exercises its most powerful attractions how far did that atmosphere extend and through what channel did it act the key to the phenomena of this case he believed was to be found in a fact as humble as that which gave birth to the science of galvanism and its practical applications the circumstances connected with the very common antipathy to cats were as remarkable in many points of view as the similar circumstances in the case of maurice kirkwood the subjects of that antipathy could not tell what it was which disturbed their nervous system all they knew was that a sense of uneasiness restlessness oppression came over them in the presence of one of these animals he remembered the fact already mentioned that persons sensitive to this impression can tell by their feelings if a cat is concealed in the apartment in which they may happen to be it may be through some emanation it may be through the medium of some electrical disturbance what if the nervethrills passing through the whole system of the animal propagate themselves to a certain distance without any more regard to intervening solids than is shown by magnetism a sieve lets sand pass through it a filter arrests sand but lets fluids pass glass holds fluids but lets light through wood shuts out light but magnetic attraction goes through it as sand went through the sieve no good reasons can be given why the presence of a cat should not betray itself to certain organizations at a distance through the walls of a box in which the animal is shut up we need not disbelieve the stories which allege such an occurrence as a fact and a not very infrequent one if the presence of a cat can produce its effects under these circumstances why should not that of a human being under similar conditions acting on certain constitutions exercise its specific influence the doctor recalled a story told him by one of his friends a story which the friend himself heard from the lips of the distinguished actor the late mr fechter the actor maintained that rachel had no genius as an actress it was all samsons training and study according to him which explained the secret of her wonderful effectiveness on the stage but magnetism he said magnetism she was full of he declared that he was made aware of her presence on the stage when he could not see her or know of her presence otherwise by this magnetic emanation the doctor took the story for what it was worth there might very probably be exaggeration perhaps high imaginative coloring about it but it was not a whit more unlikely than the catstories accepted as authentic he continued this train of thought into further developments into this series of reflections we will try to follow him what is the meaning of the halo with which artists have surrounded the heads of their pictured saints of the aureoles which wraps them like a luminous cloud is it not a recognition of the fact that these holy personages diffuse their personality in the form of a visible emanation which reminds us of miltons definition of light bright effluence of bright essence increate the common use of the term influence would seem to imply the existence of its correlative effluence there is no good reason that i can see the doctor said to himself why among the forces which work upon the nervous centres there should not be one which acts at various distances from its source it may not be visible like the glory of the painters it may not be appreciable by any one of the five senses and yet it may be felt by the person reached by it as much as if it were a palpable presence more powerfully perhaps from the mystery which belongs to its mode of action why should not maurice have been rendered restless and anxious by the unseen nearness of a young woman who was in the next room to him just as the persons who have the dread of cats are made conscious of their presence through some unknown channel is it anything strange that the larger and more powerful organism should diffuse a consciousness of its presence to some distance as well as the slighter and feebler one is it strange that this mysterious influence or effluence should belong especially or exclusively to the period of complete womanhood in distinction from that of immaturity or decadence on the contrary it seems to be in accordance with all the analogies of nature analogies too often cruel in the sentence they pass upon the human female among the many curious thoughts which came up in the doctors mind was this which made him smile as if it were a jest but which he felt very strongly had its serious side and was involved with the happiness or suffering of multitudes of youthful persons who die without telling their secret how many young men have a mortal fear of woman as woman which they never overcome and in consequence of which the attraction which draws man towards her as strong in them as in others oftentimes in virtue of their peculiarly sensitive organizations more potent in them than in others of like age and conditions in consequence of which fear this attraction is completely neutralized and all the possibilities of doubled and indefinitely extended life depending upon it are left unrealized think what numbers of young men in catholic countries devote themselves to lives of celibacy think how many young men lose all their confidence in the presence of the young woman to whom they are most attracted and at last steal away from a companionship which it is rapture to dream of and torture to endure so does the presence of the beloved object paralyze all the powers of expression sorcerers have in all time and countries played on the hopes and terrors of lovers once let loose a strong impulse on the centre of inhibition and the warrior who had faced bayonets and batteries becomes a coward whom the welldressed hero of the ballroom and leader of the german will put to ignominious flight in five minutes of easy audacious familiarity with his ladylove yes the doctor went on with his reflections i do not know that i have seen the term gynophobia before i opened this manuscript but i have seen the malady many times only one word has stood between many a pair of young people and their lifelong happiness and that word has got as far as the lips but the lips trembled and would not could not shape that little word all young women are not like coleridges genevieve who knew how to help her lover out of his difficulty and said yes before he had asked for an answer so the wave which was to have wafted them on to the shore of elysium has just failed of landing them and back they have been drawn into the desolate ocean to meet no more on earth love is the masterkey he went on thinking love is the masterkey that opens the gates of happiness of hatred of jealousy and most easily of all the gate of fear how terrible is the one fact of beauty not only the historic wonder of beauty that burnt the topless towers of ilium for the smile of helen and fired the palaces of babylon by the hand of thais but the beauty which springs up in all times and places and carries a torch and wears a serpent for a wreath as truly as any of the eumenides paint beauty with her foot upon a skull and a dragon coiled around her the doctor smiled at his own imposing classical allusions and pictorial imagery drifting along from thought to thought he reflected on the probable consequences of the general knowledge of maurice kirkwoods story if it came before the public what a piece of work it would make among the lively youths of the village to be sure what scoffing what ridicule what embellishments what fables would follow in the trail of the story if the interviewer got hold of it how the peoples perennial and household inquisitor would blaze with capitals in its next issue the young fellows of the place would be disposed to make fun of the whole matter the young girlsthe doctor hardly dared to think what would happen when the story got about among them the sachem of the solitary canoe the bold horseman the handsome hermit handsome so far as the glimpses they had got of him went must needs be an object of tender interest among them now that he was ailing suffering in danger of his life away from friends poor fellow little tokens of their regard had reached his sickchamber bunches of flowers with dainty little notes some of them pinkish some threecornered some of them with brief messages others crisscrossed were growing more frequent as it was understood that the patient was likely to be convalescent before many days had passed if it should come to be understood that there was a deadly obstacle to their coming into any personal relations with him the doctor had his doubts whether there were not those who would subject him to the risk for there were coquettes in the village strangers visitors let us hope who would sacrifice anything or anybody to their vanity and love of conquest xxi an intimate conversation the illness from which maurice had suffered left him in a state of profound prostration the doctor who remembered the extreme danger of any overexertion in such cases hardly allowed him to lift his head from the pillow but his mind was gradually recovering its balance and he was able to hold some conversation with those about him his faithful paolo had grown so thin in waiting upon him and watching with him that the village children had to take a second look at his face when they passed him to make sure that it was indeed their old friend and no other but as his master advanced towards convalescence and the doctor assured him that he was going in all probability to get well paolos face began to recover something of its old look and expression and once more his pockets filled themselves with comfits for his little circle of worshipping three and four year old followers how is mr kirkwood was the question with which he was always greeted in the worst periods of the fever be rarely left his master when he did and the question was put to him he would shake his head sadly sometimes without a word sometimes with tears and sobs and faltering words more like a brokenhearted child than a stalwart man as he was such a man as soldiers are made of in the great continental armies he very bad he no eat nothing he no say nothing he never be no better and all his southern nature betrayed itself in a passionate burst of lamentation but now that he began to feel easy about his master his ready optimism declared itself no less transparently he better every day now he get well in few weeks sure you see him on hoss in little while the kindhearted creatures life was bound up in that of his master as he loved to call him in sovereign disregard of the comments of the natives who held themselves too high for any such recognition of another as their better they could not understand how he so much their superior in bodily presence in air and manner could speak of the man who employed him in any other way than as kirkwood without even demeaning himself so far as to prefix a mr to it but my master maurice remained for paolo in spite of the fact that all men are born free and equal and never was a servant more devoted to a master than was paolo to maurice during the days of doubt and danger since his improvement maurice insisted upon his leaving his chamber and getting out of the house so as to breathe the fresh air of which he was in so much need it worried him to see his servant returning after too short an absence the attendant who had helped him in the care of the patient was within call and paolo was almost driven out of the house by the urgency of his masters command that he should take plenty of exercise in the open air notwithstanding the fact of maurices improved condition although the force of the disease had spent itself the state of weakness to which he had been reduced was a cause of some anxiety and required great precautions to be taken he lay in bed wasted enfeebled to such a degree that he had to be cared for very much as a child is tended gradually his voice was coming back to him so that he could hold some conversation as was before mentioned with those about him the doctor waited for the right moment to make mention of the manuscript which maurice had submitted to him up to this time although it had been alluded to and the doctor had told him of the intense interest with which he had read it he had never ventured to make it the subject of any long talk such as would be liable to fatigue his patient but now he thought the time had come i have been thinking the doctor said of the singular seizures to which you are liable and as it is my business not merely to think about such cases but to do what i can to help any who may be capable of receiving aid from my art i wish to have some additional facts about your history and in the first place will you allow me to ask what led you to this particular place it is so much less known to the public at large than many other resorts that we naturally ask what brings this or that new visitor among us we have no illtasting natural spring of bad water to be analyzed by the state chemist and proclaimed as a specific we have no great gamblinghouses no racecourse except that fox boats on the lake we have no coachingclub no great balls few lions of any kind so we ask what brings this or that stranger here and i think i may venture to ask you whether any special motive brought you among us or whether it was accident that determined your coming to this place certainly doctor maurice answered i will tell you with great pleasure last year i passed on the border of a great river the year before i lived in a lonely cottage at the side of the ocean i wanted this year to be by a lake you heard the paper read at the meeting of your society or at least you heard of it for such matters are always talked over in a village like this you can judge by that paper or could if it were before you of the frame of mind in which i came here i was tired of the sullen indifference of the ocean and the babbling egotism of the river always hurrying along on its own private business i wanted the dreamy stillness of a large tranquil sheet of water that had nothing in particular to do and would leave me to myself and my thoughts i had read somewhere about the place and the old anchor tavern with its paternal landlord and motherly landlady and oldfashioned household and that though it was no longer open as a tavern i could find a restingplace there early in the season at least for a few days while i looked about me for a quiet place in which i might pass my summer i have found this a pleasant residence by being up early and out late i have kept myself mainly in the solitude which has become my enforced habit of life the season has gone by too swiftly for me since my dream has become a vision the doctor was sitting with his hand round maurices wrist three fingers on his pulse as he spoke these last words he noticed that the pulse fluttered a little beat irregularly a few times intermitted became feeble and thready while his cheek grew whiter than the pallid bloodlessness of his long illness had left it no more talk now he said you are too tired to be using your voice i will hear all the rest another time the doctor had interrupted maurice at an interesting point what did he mean by saying that his dream had become a vision this is what the doctor was naturally curious and professionally anxious to know but his hand was still on his patients pulse which told him unmistakably that the heart had taken the alarm and was losing its energy under the depressing nervous influence presently however it recovered its natural force and rhythm and a faint flush came back to the pale cheek the doctor remembered the story of galen and the young maiden whose complaint had puzzled the physicians the next day his patient was well enough to enter once more into conversation you said something about a dream of yours which had become a vision said the doctor with his fingers on his patients wrist as before he felt the artery leap under his pressure falter a little stop then begin again growing fuller in its beat the heart had felt the pull of the bridle but the spur had roused it to swift reaction you know the story of my past life doctor maurice answered and i will tell you what is the vision which has taken the place of my dreams you remember the boatrace i watched it from a distance but i held a powerful operaglass in my hand which brought the whole crew of the young ladies boat so close to me that i could see the features the figures the movements of every one of the rowers i saw the little coxswain fling her bouquet in the track of the other boat you remember how the race was lost and won but i saw one face among those young girls which drew me away from all the rest it was that of the young lady who pulled the bow oar the captain of the boats crew i have since learned her name you know it well i need not name her since that day i have had many distant glimpses of her and once i met her so squarely that the deadly sensation came over me and i felt that in another moment i should fall senseless at her feet but she passed on her way and i on mine and the spasm which had clutched my heart gradually left it and i was as well as before you know that young lady doctor i do and she is a very noble creature you are not the first young man who has been fascinated almost at a glance by miss euthymia tower and she is well worth knowing more intimately the doctor gave him a full account of the young lady of her early days her character her accomplishments to all this he listened devoutly and when the doctor left him he said to himself i will see her and speak with her if it costs me my life xxii euthymia the wonder of the corinna institute had never willingly made a show of her gymnastic accomplishments her feats which were so much admired were only her natural exercise gradually the dumbbells others used became too light for her the ropes she climbed too short the clubs she exercised with seemed as if they were made of cork instead of being heavy wood and all the tests and meters of strength and agility had been strained beyond the standards which the records of the school had marked as their historic maxima it was not her fault that she broke a dynamometer one day she apologized for it but the teacher said he wished he could have a dozen broken every year in the same way the consciousness of her bodily strength had made her very careful in her movements the pressure of her hand was never too hard for the tenderest little maiden whose palm was against her own so far from priding herself on her special gifts she was disposed to be ashamed of them there were times and places in which she could give full play to her muscles without fear or reproach she had her special costume for the boat and for the woods she would climb the rugged old hemlocks now and then for the sake of a wide outlook or to peep into the large nest where a hawk or it may be an eagle was raising her little brood of airpirates there were those who spoke of her wanderings in lonely places as an unsafe exposure one sometimes met doubtful characters about the neighborhood and stories were told of occurrences which might well frighten a young girl and make her cautious of trusting herself alone in the wild solitudes which surrounded the little village those who knew euthymia thought her quite equal to taking care of herself her very look was enough to ensure the respect of any vagabond who might cross her path and if matters came to the worst she would prove as dangerous as a panther but it was a pity to associate this class of thoughts with a noble specimen of true womanhood health beauty strength were fine qualities and in all these she was rich she enjoyed all her natural gifts and thought little about them unwillingly but overpersuaded by some of her friends she had allowed her arm and hand to be modelled the artists who saw the cast wondered if it would be possible to get the bust of the maiden from whom it was taken nobody would have dared to suggest such an idea to her except lurida for lurida sex was a trifling accident to be disregarded not only in the interests of humanity but for the sake of art it is a shame she said to euthymia that you will not let your exquisitely moulded form be perpetuated in marble you have no right to withhold such a model from the contemplation of your fellowcreatures think how rare it is to see a woman who truly represents the divine idea you belong to your race and not to yourself at least your beauty is a gift not to be considered as a piece of private property look at the socalled venus of milo do you suppose the noble woman who was the original of that divinely chaste statue felt any scruple about allowing the sculptor to reproduce her pure unblemished perfections euthymia was always patient with her imaginative friend she listened to her eloquent discourse but she could not help blushing used as she was to luridas audacities the terrors brain had run away with a large share of the blood which ought to have gone to the nourishment of her general system she could not help admiring almost worshipping a companion whose being was rich in the womanly developments with which nature had so economically endowed herself an impoverished organization carries with it certain neutral qualities which make its subject appear in the presence of complete manhood and womanhood like a deafmute among speaking persons the deep blush which crimsoned euthymias cheek at luridas suggestion was in a strange contrast to her own undisturbed expression there was a range of sensibilities of which lurida knew far less than she did of those many and difficult studies which had absorbed her vital forces she was startled to see what an effect her proposal had produced for euthymia was not only blushing but there was a flame in her eyes which she had hardly ever seen before is this only your own suggestion euthymia said or has some one been putting the idea into your head the truth was that she had happened to meet the interviewer at the library one day and she was offended by the long searching stare with which that individual had honored her it occurred to her that he or some such visitor to the place might have spoken of her to lurida or to some other person who had repeated what was said to lurida as a good subject for the art of the sculptor and she felt all her maiden sensibilities offended by the proposition lurida could not understand her excitement but she was startled by it natures which are complementary of each other are liable to these accidental collisions of feeling they get along very well together none the worse for their differences until all at once the tender spot of one or the other is carelessly handled in utter unconsciousness on the part of the aggressor and the exclamation the outcry or the explosion explains the situation altogether too emphatically such scenes did not frequently occur between the two friends and this little flurry was soon over but it served to warn lurida that miss euthymia tower was not of that class of selfconscious beauties who would be ready to dispute the empire of the venus of milo on her own ground in defences as scanty and insufficient as those of the marble divinity euthymia had had admirers enough at a distance while at school and in the long vacations near enough to find out that she was anything but easy to make love to she fairly frightened more than one rash youth who was disposed to be too sentimental in her company they overdid flattery which she was used to and tolerated but which cheapened the admirer in her estimation and now and then betrayed her into an expression which made him aware of the fact and was a discouragement to aggressive amiability the real difficulty was that not one of her adorers had ever greatly interested her it could not be that nature had made her insensible it must have been because the man who was made for her had never yet shown himself she was not easy to please that was certain and she was one of those young women who will not accept as a lover one who but half pleases them she could not pick up the first stick that fell in her way and take it to shape her ideal out of many of the good people of the village doubted whether euthymia would ever be married there s nothing good enough for her in this village said the old landlord of what had been the anchor tavern she must wait till a prince comes along the old landlady said in reply shed make as pretty a queen as any of them thats born to it wouldnt she be splendid with a gold crown on her head and dimonds a glitterin all over her d you remember how handsome she looked in the tableau when the fair was held for the dorcas society she had on an old dress of her grandmas they dont make anything half so handsome nowadays and she was just as pretty as a pictur but whats the use of good looks if they scare away folks the young fellows think that such a handsome girl as that would cost ten times as much to keep as a plain one she must be dressed up like an empress so they seem to think it aint so with euthymy shed look like a great lady dressed anyhow and she has nt got any more notions than the homeliest girl that ever stood before a glass to look at herself in the humbler walks of arrowhead village society similar opinions were entertained of miss euthymia the freshwater fisherman represented pretty well the average estimate of the class to which he belonged i tell ye said he to another gentleman of leisure whose chief occupation was to watch the coming and going of the visitors to arrowhead village i tell ye that girl aint a gon to put up with any o them slabsided fellahs that you see hangin raound to look at her every sunday when she comes aout o meetin its one o them big gents from boston or new york thatll step up an kerry her off in the mean time nothing could be further from the thoughts of euthymia than the prospect of an ambitious worldly alliance the ideals of young women cost them many and great disappointments but they save them very often from those lifelong companionships which accident is constantly trying to force upon them in spite of their obvious unfitness the higher the ideal the less likely is the commonplace neighbor who has the great advantage of easy access or the boardinghouse acquaintance who can profit by those vacant hours when the least interesting of visitors is better than absolute loneliness the less likely are these undesirable personages to be endured pitied and if not embraced accepted for want of something better euthymia found so much pleasure in the intellectual companionship of lurida and felt her own prudence and reserve so necessary to that independent young lady that she had been contented so far with friendship and thought of love only in an abstract sort of way beneath her abstractions there was a capacity of loving which might have been inferred from the expression of her features the light that shone in her eyes the tones of her voice all of which were full of the language which belongs to susceptible natures how many women never say to themselves that they were born to love until all at once the discovery opens upon them as the sense that he was born a painter is said to have dawned suddenly upon correggio like all the rest of the village and its visitors she could not help thinking a good deal about the young man lying ill amongst strangers she was not one of those who had sent him the threecornered notes or even a bunch of flowers she knew that he was receiving abounding tokens of kindness and sympathy from different quarters and a certain inward feeling restrained her from joining in these demonstrations if he had been suffering from some deadly and contagious malady she would have risked her life to help him without a thought that there was any wonderful heroism in such selfdevotion her friend lurida might have been capable of the same sacrifice but it would be after reasoning with herself as to the obligations which her sense of human rights and duties laid upon her and fortifying her courage with the memory of noble deeds recorded of women in ancient and modern history with euthymia the primary human instincts took precedence of all reasoning or reflection about them all her sympathies were excited by the thought of this forlorn stranger in his solitude but she felt the impossibility of giving any complete expression to them she thought of mungo park in the african desert and she envied the poor negress who not only pitied him but had the blessed opportunity of helping and consoling him how near were these two human creatures each needing the other how near in bodily presence how far apart in their lives with a barrier seemingly impassable between them xxiii the meeting of maurice and euthymia these autumnal fevers which carry off a large number of our young people every year are treacherous and deceptive diseases not only are they liable as has been mentioned to various accidental complications which may prove suddenly fatal but too often after convalescence seems to be established relapses occur which are more serious than the disease had appeared to be in its previous course one morning dr butts found maurice worse instead of better as he had hoped and expected to find him weak as he was there was every reason to fear the issue of this return of his threatening symptoms there was not much to do besides keeping up the little strength which still remained it was all needed does the reader of these pages ever think of the work a sick man as much as a well one has to perform while he is lying on his back and taking what we call his rest more than a thousand times an hour between a hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand times a week he has to lift the bars of the cage in which his breathing organs are confined to save himself from asphyxia rest there is no rest until the last long sigh tells those who look upon the dying that the ceaseless daily task to rest from which is death is at last finished we are all galleyslaves pulling at the levers of respiration which rising and falling like so many oars drive us across an unfathomable ocean from one unknown shore to another no never was a galleyslave so chained as we are to these four and twenty oars at which we must tug day and night all our life long the doctor could not find any accidental cause to account for this relapse it presently occurred to him that there might be some local source of infection which had brought on the complaint and was still keeping up the symptoms which were the ground of alarm he determined to remove maurice to his own house where he could be sure of pure air and where he himself could give more constant attention to his patient during this critical period of his disease it was a risk to take but he could be carried on a litter by careful men and remain wholly passive during the removal maurice signified his assent as he could hardly help doing for the doctors suggestion took pretty nearly the form of a command he thought it a matter of life and death and was gently urgent for his patients immediate change of residence the doctor insisted on having maurices books and other movable articles carried to his own house so that he should be surrounded by familiar sights and not worry himself about what might happen to objects which he valued if they were left behind him all these dispositions were quickly and quietly made and everything was ready for the transfer of the patient to the house of the hospitable physician paolo was at the doctors superintending the arrangement of maurices effects and making all ready for his master the nurse in attendance a trustworthy man enough in the main finding his patient in a tranquil sleep left his bedside for a little fresh air while he was at the door he heard a shouting which excited his curiosity and he followed the sound until he found himself at the border of the lake it was nothing very wonderful which had caused the shouting a newfoundland dog had been showing off his accomplishments and some of the idlers were betting as to the time it would take him to bring back to his master the various floating objects which had been thrown as far from the shore as possible he watched the dog a few minutes when his attention was drawn to a light wherry pulled by one young lady and steered by another it was making for the shore which it would soon reach the attendant remembered all at once that he had left his charge and just before the boat came to land he turned and hurried back to the patient exactly how long he had been absent he could not have said perhaps a quarter of an hour perhaps longer the time appeared short to him wearied with long sitting and watching it had seemed when he stole away from maurices bedside that he was not in the least needed the patient was lying perfectly quiet and to all appearance wanted nothing more than letting alone it was such a comfort to look at something besides the worn features of a sick man to hear something besides his labored breathing and faint halfwhispered words that the temptation to indulge in these luxuries for a few minutes had proved irresistible unfortunately maurices slumbers did not remain tranquil during the absence of the nurse he very soon fell into a dream which began quietly enough but in the course of the sudden transitions which dreams are in the habit of undergoing became successively anxious distressing terrifying his earlier and later experiences came up before him fragmentary incoherent chaotic even but vivid as reality he was at the bottom of a coalmine in one of those long narrow galleries or rather wormholes in which human beings pass a large part of their lives like so many larvae boring their way into the beams and rafters of some old building how close the air was in the stifling passage through which he was crawling the scene changed and he was climbing a slippery sheet of ice with desperate effort his foot on the floor of a shallow niche his hold an icicle ready to snap in an instant an abyss below him waiting for his foot to slip or the icicle to break how thin the air seemed how desperately hard to breathe he was thinking of mont blanc it may be and the fearfully rarefied atmosphere which he remembered well as one of the great trials in his mountain ascents no it was not mont blanc it was not any one of the frozen alpine summits it was hecla that he was climbing the smoke of the burning mountain was wrapping itself around him he was choking with its dense fumes he heard the flames roaring around him he felt the hot lava beneath his feet he uttered a faint cry and awoke the room was full of smoke he was gasping for breath strangling in the smothering oven which his chamber had become the house was on fire he tried to call for help but his voice failed him and died away in a whisper he made a desperate effort and rose so as to sit up in the bed for an instant but the effort was too much for him and he sank back upon his pillow helpless he felt that his hour had come for he could not live in this dreadful atmosphere and he was left alone he could hear the crackle of fire as the flame crept along from one partition to another it was a cruel fate to be left to perish in that way the fate that many a martyr had had to face to be first strangled and then burned death had not the terror for him that it has for most young persons he was accustomed to thinking of it calmly sometimes wistfully even to such a degree that the thought of selfdestruction had come upon him as a temptation but here was death in an unexpected and appalling shape he did not know before how much he cared to live all his old recollections came before him as it were in one long vivid flash the closed vista of memory opened to its far horizonline and past and present were pictured in a single instant of clear vision the dread moment which had blighted his life returned in all its terror he felt the convulsive spring in the form of a faint impotent spasm the rush of air the thorns of the stinging and lacerating cradle into which he was precipitated one after another those paralyzing seizures which had been like deadening blows on the naked heart seemed to repeat themselves as real as at the moment of their occurrence the pictures passed in succession with such rapidity that they appeared almost as if simultaneous the vision of the inward eye was so intensified in this moment of peril that an instant was like an hour of common existence those who have been very near drowning know well what this description means the development of a photograph may not explain it but it illustrates the curious and familiar fact of the revived recollections of the drowning mans experience the sensitive plate has taken one look at a scene and remembers it all every little circumstance is there the hoof in air the wing in flight the leaf as it falls the wave as it breaks all there but invisible potentially present but impalpable inappreciable as if not existing at all a wash is poured over it and the whole scene comes out in all its perfection of detail in those supreme moments when death stares a man suddenly in the face the rush of unwonted emotion floods the undeveloped pictures of vanished years stored away in the memory the vast panorama of a lifetime and in one swift instant the past comes out as vividly as if it were again the present so it was at this moment with the sick man as he lay helpless and felt that he was left to die for he saw no hope of relief the smoke was drifting in clouds into the room the flames were very near if he was not reached and rescued immediately it was all over with him his past life had flashed before him then all at once rose the thought of his future of all its possibilities of the vague hopes which he had cherished of late that his mysterious doom would be lifted from him there was something then to be lived for something there was a new life it might be in store for him and such a new life he thought of all he was losing oh could he but have lived to know the meaning of love and the passionate desire of life came over him not the dread of death but the longing for what the future might yet have of happiness for him all this took place in the course of a very few moments dreams and visions have little to do with measured time and ten minutes possibly fifteen or twenty were all that had passed since the beginning of those nightmare terrors which were evidently suggested by the suffocating air he was breathing what had happened in the confusion of moving books and other articles to the doctors house doors and windows had been forgotten among the rest a window opening into the cellar where some old furniture had been left by a former occupant had been left unclosed one of the lazy natives who had lounged by the house smoking a bad cigar had thrown the burning stump in at this open window he had no particular intention of doing mischief but he had that indifference to consequences which is the next step above the inclination to crime the burning stump happened to fall among the straw of an old mattress which had been ripped open the smoker went his way without looking behind him and it so chanced that no other person passed the house for some time presently the straw was in a blaze and from this the fire extended to the furniture to the stairway leading up from the cellar and was working its way along the entry under the stairs leading up to the apartment where maurice was lying the blaze was fierce and swift as it could not help being with such a mass of combustibles loose straw from the mattress dry old furniture and old warped floors which had been parching and shrinking for a score or two of years the whole house was in the common language of the newspaper reports a perfect tinderbox and would probably be a heap of ashes in half an hour and there was this unfortunate deserted sick man lying between life and death beyond all help unless some unexpected assistance should come to his rescue as the attendant drew near the house where maurice was lying he was horrorstruck to see dense volumes of smoke pouring out of the lower windows it was beginning to make its way through the upper windows also and presently a tongue of fire shot out and streamed upward along the side of the house the man shrieked fire fire with all his might and rushed to the door of the building to make his way to maurices room and save him he penetrated but a short distance when blinded and choking with the smoke he rushed headlong down the stairs with a cry of despair that roused every man woman and child within reach of a human voice out they came from their houses in every quarter of the village the shout of fire fire was the chief aid lent by many of the young and old some caught up pails and buckets the more thoughtful ones filling them the hastier snatching them up empty trusting to find water nearer the burning building is the sick man moved this was the awful question first asked for in the little village all knew that maurice was about being transferred to the doctors house the attendant white as death pointed to the chamber where he had left him and gasped out he is there a ladder a ladder was the general cry and men and boys rushed off in search of one but a single minute was an age now and there was no ladder to be had without a delay of many minutes the sick man was going to be swallowed up in the flames before it could possibly arrive some were going for a blanket or a coverlet in the hope that the young man might have strength enough to leap from the window and be safely caught in it the attendant shook his head and said faintly he cannot move from his bed one of the visitors at the village a millionaire it was said a kindhearted man spoke in hoarse broken tones a thousand dollars to the man that will bring him from his chamber the freshwater fisherman muttered i should like to save the man and to see the money but it aint a thaousan dollars nor ten thaousan dollars thatll pay a fellah for burnin to death or even chokin to death anyhaow the carpenter who knew the framework of every house in the village recent or old shook his head the stairs have been shored up he said and when the fists that holds em up goes down theyll come it aint safe for no man to go over them stairs hurry along your ladder thats your only chance all was wild confusion around the burning house the ladder they had gone for was missing from its case a neighbor had carried it off for the workmen who were shingling his roof it would never get there in time there was a fireengine but it was nearly half a mile from the lakeside settlement some were throwing on water in an aimless useless way one was sending a thin stream through a garden syringe it seemed like doing something at least but all hope of saving maurice was fast giving way so rapid was the progress of the flames so thick the cloud of smoke that filled the house and poured from the windows nothing was heard but confused cries shrieks of women all sorts of orders to do this and that no one knowing what was to be done the ladder the ladder five minutes more and it will be too late in the mean time the alarm of fire had reached paolo and he had stopped his work of arranging maurices books in the same way as that in which they had stood in his apartment and followed in the direction of the sound little thinking that his master was lying helpless in the burning house some chimney afire he said to himself but he would go and take a look at any rate before paolo had reached the scene of destruction and impending death two young women in boating dresses of decidedly bloomerish aspect had suddenly joined the throng the wonder and the terror of their schooldays miss euthymia rower and miss lurida vincent had just come from the shore where they had left their wherry a few hurried words told them the fearful story maurice kirkwood was lying in the chamber to which every eye was turned unable to move doomed to a dreadful death all that could be hoped was that he would perish by suffocation rather than by the flames which would soon be upon him the man who had attended him had just tried to reach his chamber but had reeled back out of the door almost strangled by the smoke a thousand dollars had been offered to any one who would rescue the sick man but no one had dared to make the attempt for the stairs might fall at any moment if the smoke did not blind and smother the man who passed them before they fell the two young women looked each other in the face for one swift moment how can he be reached asked lurida is there nobody that will venture his life to save a brother like that i will venture mine said euthymia no no shrieked lurida not you not you it is a mans work not yours you shall not go poor lurida had forgotten all her theories in this supreme moment but euthymia was not to be held back taking a handkerchief from her neck she dipped it in a pail of water and bound it about her head then she took several deep breaths of air and filled her lungs as full as they would hold she knew she must not take a single breath in the choking atmosphere if she could possibly help it and euthymia was noted for her power of staying under water so long that more than once those who saw her dive thought she would never come up again so rapid were her movements that they paralyzed the bystanders who would forcibly have prevented her from carrying out her purpose her imperious determination was not to be resisted and so euthymia a willing martyr if martyr she was to be and not saviour passed within the veil that hid the sufferer lurida turned deadly pale and sank fainting to the ground she was the first but not the only one of her sex that fainted as euthymia disappeared in the smoke of the burning building even the rector grew very white in the face so white that one of his vestrymen begged him to sit down at once and sprinkled a few drops of water on his forehead to his great disgust and manifest advantage the old landlady was crying and moaning and her husband was wiping his eyes and shaking his head sadly she will nevar come out alive he said solemnly nor dead neither added the carpenter ther wont be nothing left of neither of em but ashes and the carpenter hid his face in his hands the freshwater fisherman had pulled out a rag which he called a hangkercher it had served to carry bait that morning and was making use of its best corner to dry the tears which were running down his cheeks the whole village was proud of euthymia and with these more quiet signs of grief were mingled loud lamentations coming alike from old and young all this was not so much like a succession of events as it was like a tableau the lookerson were stunned with its suddenness and before they had time to recover their bewildered senses all was lost or seemed lost they felt that they should never look again on either of those young faces the rector not unfeeling by nature but inveterately professional by habit had already recovered enough to be thinking of a text for the funeral sermon the first that occurred to him was this vaguely of course in the background of consciousness then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire the village undertaker was of naturally sober aspect and reflective disposition he had always been opposed to cremation and here was a funeral pile blazing before his eyes he too had his human sympathies but in the distance his imagination pictured the final ceremony and how he himself should figure in a spectacle where the usual centre piece of attraction would be wanting perhaps his own services uncalled for blame him not you whose gardenpatch is not watered with the tears of mourners the string of selfinterest answers with its chord to every sound it vibrates with the funeralbell it finds itself trembling to the wail of the de profundis not always not always let us not be cynical in our judgments but common human nature we may safely say is subject to those secondary vibrations under the most solemn and soulsubduing influences it seems as if we were doing great wrong to the scene we are contemplating in delaying it by the description of little circumstances and individual thoughts and feelings but linger as we may we cannot compress into a chapter we could not crowd into a volume all that passed through the minds and stirred the emotions of the awestruck company which was gathered about the scene of danger and of terror we are dealing with an impossibility consciousness is a surface narrative is a line maurice had given himself up for lost his breathing was becoming every moment more difficult and he felt that his strength could hold out but a few minutes longer robert he called in faint accents but the attendant was not there to answer paolo paolo but the faithful servant who would have given his life for his master had not yet reached the place where the crowd was gathered oh for a breath of air oh for an arm to lift me from this bed too late too late he gasped with what might have seemed his dying expiration not too late the soft voice reached his obscured consciousness as if it had come down to him from heaven in a single instant he found himself rolled in a blanket and in the arms of a woman out of the stifling chamber over the burning stairs close by the tongues of fire that were lapping up all they could reach out into the open air he was borne swiftly and safely carried as easily as if he had been a babe in the strong arms of the wonder of the gymnasium the captain of the atalanta who had little dreamed of the use she was to make of her natural gifts and her schoolgirl accomplishments such a cry as arose from the crowd of onlookers it was a sound that none of them had ever heard before or could expect ever to hear again unless he should be one of the last boatload rescued from a sinking vessel then those who had resisted the overflow of their emotion who had stood in white despair as they thought of these two young lives soon to be wrapped in their burning shroud those stern men the old seacaptain the hardfaced moneymaking castiron tradesmen of the city countingroom sobbed like hysteric women it was like a convulsion that overcame natures unused to those deeper emotions which many who are capable of experiencing die without ever knowing this was the scene upon which the doctor and paolo suddenly appeared at the same moment as the fresh breeze passed over the face of the rescued patient his eyes opened wide and his consciousness returned in almost supernatural lucidity euthymia had sat down upon a bank and was still supporting him his head was resting on her bosom through his awakening senses stole the murmurs of the living cradle which rocked him with the wavelike movements of respiration the soft susurrus of the air that entered with every breath the double beat of the heart which throbbed close to his ear and every sense and every instinct and every reviving pulse told him in language like a revelation from another world that a womans arms were around him and that it was life and not death which her embrace had brought him she would have disengaged him from her protecting hold but the doctor made her a peremptory sign which he followed by a sharp command do not move him a hairs breadth he said wait until the litter comes any sudden movement might be dangerous has anybody a brandy flask about him one or two members of the local temperance society looked rather awkward but did not come forward the freshwater fisherman was the first who spoke i hant got no brandy he said but theres a drop or two of old medford rum in this here that youre welcome to if itll be of any help i alliz kerry a little on t in case o gettin wet n chilled so saying he held forth a flat bottle with the word sarsaparilla stamped on the green glass but which contained half a pint or more of the specific on which he relied in those very frequent exposures which happen to persons of his calling the doctor motioned back paolo who would have rushed at once to the aid of maurice and who was not wanted at that moment so poor paolo in an agony of fear for his master was kept as quiet as possible and had to content himself with asking all sorts of questions and repeating all the prayers he could think of to our lady and to his holy namesake the apostle the doctor wiped the mouth of the fishermans bottle very carefully take a few drops of this cordial he said as he held it to his patients lips hold him just so euthymia without stirring i will watch him and say when he is ready to be moved the litter is near by waiting dr butts watched maurices pulse and color the old medford knew its business it had knocked over its tens of thousands it had its redeeming virtue and helped to set up a poor fellow now and then it did this for maurice very effectively when he seemed somewhat restored the doctor had the litter brought to his side and euthymia softly resigned her helpless burden which paolo and the attendant robert lifted with the aid of the doctor who walked by the patient as he was borne to the home where mrs butts had made all ready for his reception as for poor lurida who had thought herself equal to the sanguinary duties of the surgeon she was left lying on the grass with an old woman over her working hard with fan and smellingsalts to bring her back from her long fainting fit xxiv the inevitable why should not human nature be the same in arrowhead village as elsewhere it could not seem strange to the good people of that place and their visitors that these two young persons brought together under circumstances that stirred up the deepest emotions of which the human soul is capable should become attached to each other but the bond between them was stronger than any knew except the good doctor who had learned the great secret of maurices life for the first time since his infancy he had fully felt the charm which the immediate presence of youthful womanhood carries with it he could hardly believe the fact when he found himself no longer the subject of the terrifying seizures of which he had had many and threatening experiences it was the doctors business to save his patients life if he could possibly do it maurice had been reduced to the most perilous state of debility by the relapse which had interrupted his convalescence only by what seemed almost a miracle had he survived the exposure to suffocation and the mental anguish through which he had passed it was perfectly clear to dr butts that if maurice could see the young woman to whom he owed his life and as the doctor felt assured the revolution in his nervous system which would be the beginning of a new existence it would be of far more value as a restorative agency than any or all of the drugs in the pharmacopoeia he told this to euthymia and explained the matter to her parents and friends she must go with him on some of his visits her mother should go with her or her sister but this was a case of life and death and no maidenly scruples must keep her from doing her duty the first of her visits to the sick perhaps dying man presented a scene not unlike the picture before spoken of on the titlepage of the old edition of galen the doctor was perhaps the most agitated of the little group he went before the others took his seat by the bedside and held the patients wrist with his finger on the pulse as euthymia entered it gave a single bound fluttered for an instant as if with a faint memory of its old habit then throbbed full and strong comparatively as if under the spur of some powerful stimulus euthymias task was a delicate one but she knew how to disguise its difficulty here is a flower i have brought you mr kirkwood she said and handed him a white chrysanthemum he took it from her hand and before she knew it he took her hand into his own and held it with a gentle constraint what could she do here was the young man whose life she had saved at least for the moment and who was yet in danger from the disease which had almost worn out his powers of resistance sit down by mr kirkwoods side said the doctor he wants to thank you if he has strength to do it for saving him from the death which seemed inevitable not many words could maurice command he was weak enough for womanly tears but their fountains no longer flowed it was with him as with the dying whose eyes may light up but rarely shed a tear the river which has found a new channel widens and deepens it it lets the old watercourse fill up and never returns to its forsaken bed the tyrannous habit was broken the prophecy of the gitana had verified itself and the ill a fair woman had wrought a fairer woman bad conquered and abolished the history of maurice kirkwood loses its exceptional character from the time of his restoration to his natural conditions his convalescence was very slow and gradual but no further accident interrupted its even progress the season was over the summer visitors had left arrowhead village the chrysanthemums were going out of flower the frosts had come and maurice was still beneath the roof of the kind physician the relation between him and his preserver was so entirely apart from all common acquaintances and friendships that no ordinary rules could apply to it euthymia visited him often during the period of his extreme prostration you must come every day the doctor said he gains with every visit you make him he pines if you miss him for a single day so she came and sat by him the doctor or good mrs butts keeping her company in his presence he grew stronger began to sit up in bed and at last euthymia found him dressed as in health and beginning to walk about the room she was startled she had thought of herself as a kind of nurse but the young gentleman could hardly be said to need a nurse any longer she had scruples about making any further visits she asked lurida what she thought about it think about it said lurida why should nt you go to see a brother as well as a sister i should like to know if you are afraid to go to see maurice kirkwood i am not afraid at any rate if you would rather have me go than go yourself i will do it and let people talk just as much as they want to shall i go instead of you euthymia was not quite sure that this would be the best thing for the patient the doctor had told her he thought there were special reasons for her own course in coming daily to see him i am afraid she said you are too bright to be safe for him in his weak state your mind is such a stimulating one you know a dull sort of person like myself is better for him just now i will continue visiting him as long as the doctor says it is important that i should but you must defend me lurida i know you can explain it all so that people will not blame me euthymia knew full well what the effect of luridas penetrating headvoice would be in a convalescents chamber she knew how that active mind of hers would set the young mans thoughts at work when what he wanted was rest of every faculty were not these good and sufficient reasons for her decision what others could there be so euthymia kept on with her visits until she blushed to see that she was continuing her charitable office for one who was beginning to look too well to be called an invalid it was a dangerous condition of affairs and the busy tongues of the village gossips were free in their comments free but kindly for the story of the rescue had melted every heart and what could be more natural than that these two young people whom god had brought together in the dread moment of peril should find it hard to tear themselves asunder after the hour of danger was past when gratitude is a bankrupt love only can pay his debts and if maurice gave his heart to euthymia would not she receive it as payment in full the change which had taken place in the vital currents of maurice kirkwoods system was as simple and solid a fact as the change in a magnetic needle when the boreal becomes the austral pole and the austral the boreal it was well perhaps that this change took place while he was enfeebled by the wasting effects of long illness for all the longdefeated disturbed perverted instincts had found their natural channel from the centre of consciousness to the organ which throbs in response to every profound emotion as his health gradually returned euthymia could not help perceiving a flush in his cheek a glitter in his eyes a something in the tone of his voice which altogether were a warning to the young maiden that the highway of friendly intercourse was fast narrowing to a lane at the head of which her womans eye could read plainly enough dangerous passing you look so much better today mr kirkwood she said that i think i had better not play sister of charity any longer the next time we meet i hope you will be strong enough to call on me she was frightened to see how pale he turned he was weaker than she thought there was a silence so profound and so long that mrs butts looked up from the stocking she was knitting they had forgotten the good womans presence presently maurice spoke very faintly but mrs butts dropped a stitch at the first word and her knitting fell into her lap as she listened to what followed no you must not leave me you must never leave me you saved my life but you have done more than that more than you know or can ever know to you i owe it that i am living with you i live henceforth if i am to live at all all i am all i hope will you take this poor offering from one who owes you everything whose lips never touched those of woman or breathed a word of love before you what could euthymia reply to this question uttered with all the depth of a passion which had never before found expression not one syllable of answer did listening mrs butts overhear but she told her husband afterwards that there was nothing in the tableaux they had had in september to compare with what she then saw it was indeed a pleasing picture which those two young heads presented as euthymia gave her inarticulate but infinitely expressive answer to the question of maurice kirkwood the goodhearted woman thought it time to leave the young people down went the stocking with the needles in it out of her lap tumbled the ball of worsted rolling along the floor with its yarn trailing after it like some village matron who goes about circulating from hearth to hearth leaving all along her track the story of the new engagement or of the arrival of the last little stranger not many suns had set before it was told all through arrowhead village that maurice kirkwood was the accepted lover of euthymia tower postscript afterglimpses miss lurida vincent to mrs euthymia kirkwood arrowhead village may my dearest euthymia who would have thought when you broke your oar as the atalanta flashed by the algonquin last june that before the roses came again you would find yourself the wife of a fine scholar and grand gentleman and the head of a household such as that of which you are the mistress you must not forget your old arrowhead village friends what am i saying you forget them no dearest i know your heart too well for that you are not one of those who lay aside their old friendships as they do last years bonnet when they get a new one you have told me all about yourself and your happiness and now you want me to tell you about myself and what is going on in our little place and first about myself i have given up the idea of becoming a doctor i have studied mathematics so much that i have grown fond of certainties of demonstrations and medicine deals chiefly in probabilities the practice of the art is so mixed up with the deepest human interests that it is hard to pursue it with that even poise of the intellect which is demanded by science i want knowledge pure and simple i do not fancy having it mixed neither do i like the thought of passing my life in going from one scene of suffering to another i am not saintly enough for such a daily martyrdom nor callous enough to make it an easy occupation i fainted at the first operation i saw and i have never wanted to see another i dont say that i wouldnt marry a physician if the right one asked me but the young doctor is not forthcoming at present yes i think i might make a pretty good doctors wife i could teach him a good deal about headaches and backaches and all sorts of nervous revolutions as the doctor says the french women call their tantrums i dont know but i should be willing to let him try his new medicines on me if he were a homeopath i know i should for if a billionth of a grain of sugar wont begin to sweeten my tea or coffee i dont feel afraid that a billionth of a grain of anything would poison me no not if it were snakevenom and if it were not disgusting i would swallow a handful of his lachesis globules to please my husband but if i ever become a doctors wife my husband will not be one of that kind of practitioners you may be sure of that nor an eclectic nor a faithcure man on the whole i dont think i want to be married at all i dont like the male animal very well except such noble specimens as your husband they are all tyrants almost all so far as our sex is concerned and i often think we could get on better without them however the creatures are useful in the society they send us papers some of them well worth reading you have told me so often that you would like to know how the society is getting on and to read some of the papers sent to it if they happened to be interesting that i have laid aside one or two manuscripts expressly for your perusal you will get them by and by i am delighted to know that you keep paolo with you arrowhead village misses him dreadfully i can tell you that is the reason people become so attached to these servants with southern sunlight in their natures i suppose life is not long enough to cool their blood down to our northern standard then they are so childlike whereas the native of these latitudes is never young after he is ten or twelve years old mother says you know mothers oldfashioned notions and how shrewd and sensible she is in spite of them mother says that when she was a girl families used to import young men and young women from the country towns who called themselves helps not servants no that was scriptural but they did nt know everything down in judee and it is not good american language she says that these people would live in the same household until they were married and the women often remain in the same service until they died or were old and worn out and then what with the money they had saved and the care and assistance they got from their former employers would pass a decent and comfortable old age and be buried in the family lot mother has made up her mind to the change but grandmother is bitter about it she says there never was a country yet where the population was made up of ladies and gentlemen and she does nt believe there can be nor that putting a spread eagle on a copper makes a gold dollar of it she is a pessimist after her own fashion she thinks all sentiment is dying out of our people no loyalty for the sovereign the kingpost of the political edifice she says no deep attachment between employer and employed no reverence of the humbler members of a household for its heads and to make sure of continued corruption and misery what she calls universal suffrage emptying all the sewers into the great aqueduct we all must drink from universal suffrage i suppose we women dont belong to the universe wait until we get a chance at the ballotbox i tell grandma and see if we dont wash out the sewers before they reach the aqueduct but my pen has run away with men i was thinking of paolo and what a pleasant thing it is to have one of those childlike warmhearted attachable cheerful contented humble faithful companionable but never presuming grownup children of the south waiting on one as if everything he could do for one was a pleasure and carrying a look of content in his face which makes every one who meets him happier for a glimpse of his features it does seem a shame that the charming relation of master and servant intelligent authority and cheerful obedience mutual interest in each others welfare thankful recognition of all the advantages which belong to domestic service in the better class of families should be almost wholly confined to aliens and their immediate descendants why should hannah think herself so much better than bridget when they meet at the polls together as they will before long they will begin to feel more of an equality than is recognized at present the native female turns her nose up at the idea of living out does she think herself so much superior to the women of other nationalities our women will have to come to it so grandmother says in another generation or two and in a hundred years according to her prophecy there will be a new set of old miss pollys and miss betseys who have lived half a century in the same families respectful and respected cherished cared for in time of need citizens as well as servants holding a ballot as well as a broom i tell her and bringing back to us the lowly underfoot virtues of contentment and humility which we do so need to carpet the barren and hungry thoroughfare of our unstratified existence there i have got agoing and am forgetting all the news i have to tell you there is an engagement you will want to know all about it came to pass through our famous boatrace which you and i remember and shall never forget as long as we live it seems that the young fellow who pulled the bow oar of that mens college boat which we had the pleasure of beating got some glimpses of georgina our handsome stroke oar i believe he took it into his head that it was she who threw the bouquet that won the race for us he was as you know greatly mistaken and ought to have made love to me only he did nt well it seems he came posting down to the institute just before the vacation was over and there got a sight of georgina i wonder whether she told him she didnt fling the bouquet anyhow the acquaintance began in that way and now it seems that this young fellow goodlooking and a bright scholar but with a good many months more to pass in college is her captive it was too bad just think of my bouquets going to another girls credit no matter the old atalanta story was paid off at any rate you want to know all about dear dr butts they say he has just been offered a professorship in one of the great medical colleges i asked him about it and he did not say that he had or had not but said be suppose that i had been offered such a place do you think i ought to accept it and leave arrowhead village let us talk it over said he just as if i had had such an offer i told him he ought to stay there are plenty of men that can get into a professors chair i said and talk like solomons to a class of wondering pupils but once get a really good doctor in a place a man who knows all about everybody whether they have this or that tendency whether when they are sick they have a way of dying or a way of getting well what medicines agree with them and what drugs they cannot take whether they are of the sort that think nothing is the matter with them until they are dead as smoked herring or of the sort that send for the minister if they get a stomachache from eating too many cucumbers who knows all about all the people within half a dozen miles all the sensible ones that is who employ a regular practitioner such a man as that i say is not to be replaced like a missing piece out of a springfield musket or a waltham watch dont go said i stay here and save our precious lives if you can or at least put us through in the proper way so that we neednt be ashamed of ourselves for dying if we must die well dr butts is not going to leave us i hope you will have no unwelcome occasion for his services you are never ill you know but anyhow he is going to be here and no matter what happens he will be on hand the village news is not of a very exciting character item a new house is put up over the ashes of the one in which your husband lived while he was here it was planned by one of the autochthonous inhabitants with the most ingenious combination of inconveniences that the natural man could educe from his original perversity of intellect to get at any one room you must pass through every other it is blind or nearly so on the only side which has a good prospect and commands a fine view of the barn and pigsty through numerous windows item we have a small fireengine near the new house which can be worked by a man or two and would be equal to the emergency of putting out a bunch of firecrackers item we have a new ladder in a bog close to the new fireengine so if the new house catches fire like its predecessor and there should happen to be a sick man on an upper floor he can be got out without running the risk of going up and down a burning staircase what a blessed thing it was that there was no fireengine near by and no ladder at hand on the day of the great rescue if there had been what a change in your programme of life you remember that cup of tea spilt on mrs mashams apron which we used to read of in one of everetts orations and all its widereaching consequences in the affairs of europe i hunted up that cup of tea as diligently as ever a boston matron sought for the last leaves in her old caddy after the teachests had been flung overboard at griffins wharf but no matter about that now that is the way things come about in this world i must write a lecture on lucky mishaps or more elegantly fortunate calamities it will be just the converse of that odd essay of swifts we read together the awkward and stupid things done with the best intentions perhaps i shall deliver the lecture in your city you will come and hear it and bring him wont you dearest always your loving lurida miss lurida vincent to mrs euthymia kirkwood it seems forever since you left us dearest euthymia and are you and is your husband and paolo good paolo are you all as well and happy as you have been and as you ought to be i suppose our small village seems a very quiet sort of place to pass the winter in now that you have become accustomed to the noise and gayety of a great city for all that it is a pretty busy place this winter i can tell you we have sleighing parties i never go to them myself because i cant keep warm and my mind freezes up when my blood cools down below or deg fahrenheit i had a great deal rather sit by a good fire and read about arctic discoveries but i like very well to hear the bells jingling and to see the young people trying to have a good time as hard as they do at a picnic it may be that they do but to me a picnic is purgatory and a sleighride that other place where as my favorite milton says frost performs the effect of fire i believe i have quoted him correctly i ought to for i could repeat half his poems from memory once if i cannot now you must have plenty of excitement in your city life i suppose you recognized yourself in one of the society columns of the household inquisitor mrs e k very beautiful in an elegant etc etc with pearls etc etc as if you were not the ornament of all that you wear no matter what it is i am so glad that you have married a scholar why should not maurice you both tell me to call him so take the diplomatic office which has been offered him it seems to me that he would find himself in exactly the right place he can talk in two or three languages has good manners and a wife who well what shall i say of mrs kirkwood but that she would be good company for a queen as our old friend the quondam landlady of the anchor tavern used to say i should so like to see you presented at court it seems to me that i should be willing to hold your train for the sake of seeing you in your court feathers and things as for myself i have been thinking of late that i would become either a professional lecturer or head mistress of a great school or college for girls i have tried the first business a little last month i delivered a lecture on quaternions i got three for my audience two came over from the institute and one from that mens college which they try to make out to be a university and where no female is admitted unless she belongs among the quadrupeds i enjoyed lecturing but the subject is a difficult one and i dont think any one of them had any very clear notion of what i was talking about except rhodora and i know she did nt to tell the truth i was lecturing to instruct myself i mean to try something easier next time i have thought of the basque language and literature what do you say to that the society goes on famously we have had a paper presented and read lately which has greatly amused some of us and provoked a few of the weaker sort the writer is that crabbed old professor of belleslettres at that mens college over there he is dreadfully hard on the poor poets as they call themselves it seems that a great many young persons and more especially a great many young girls of whom the institute has furnished a considerable proportion have taken to sending him their rhymed productions to be criticised expecting to be praised no doubt every one of them i must give you one of the sauciest extracts from his paper in his own words it takes half my time to read the poems sent me by young people of both sexes they would be more shy of doing it if they knew that i recognize a tendency to rhyming as a common form of mental weakness and the publication of a thin volume of verse as prima facie evidence of ambitious mediocrity if not inferiority of course there are exceptions to this rule of judgment but i maintain that the presumption is always against the rhymester as compared with the less pretentious persons about him or her busy with some useful calling too busy to be tagging rhymed commonplaces together just now there seems to be an epidemic of rhyming as bad as the dancing mania or the sweating sickness after reading a certain amount of manuscript verse one is disposed to anathematize the inventor of homophonous syllabification this phrase made a great laugh when it was read this that is rhyming must have been found out very early where are you adam here am i madam but it can never have been habitually practised until after the fall the intrusion of tintinnabulating terminations into the conversational intercourse of men and angels would have spoiled paradise itself milton would not have them even in paradise lost you remember for my own part i wish certain rhymes could be declared contraband of written or printed language nothing should be allowed to be hurled at the world or whirled with it or furled upon it or curled over it all eyes should be kept away from the skies in spite of os homini sublime dedit youth should be coupled with all the virtues except truth earth should never be reminded of her birth death should never be allowed to stop a mortals breath nor the bell to sound his knell nor flowers from blossoming bowers to wave over his grave or show their bloom upon his tomb we have rhyming dictionaries let us have one from which all rhymes are rigorously excluded the sight of a poor creature grubbing for rhymes to fill up his sonnet or to cram one of those voracious rhymeswallowing rigmaroles which some of our drudging poetical operatives have been exhausting themselves of late to satiate with jingles makes my head ache and my stomach rebel work work of some kind is the business of men and women not the making of jingles no no no i want to see the young people in our schools and academies and colleges and the graduates of these institutions lifted up out of the little dismal swamp of selfcontemplating and selfindulging and selfcommiserating emotionalism which is surfeiting the land with those literary sandwiches thin slices of tinkling sentimentality between two covers looking like hardbaked gilt gingerbread but what faces these young folks make up at my good advice they get tipsy on their rhymes nothing intoxicates one like his or her own verses and they hold on to their metreballadmongering as the fellows that inhale nitrous oxide hold on to the gasbag we laughed over this essay of the old professor though it hit us pretty hard the best part of the joke is that the old man himself published a thin volume of poems when he was young which there is good reason to think he is not very proud of as they say he buys up all the copies he can find in the shops no matter what they say i cant help agreeing with him about this great flood of poetry as it calls itself and looking at the rhyming mania much as he does how i do love real poetry that is the reason hate rhymes which have not a particle of it in them the foolish scribblers that deal in them are like bad workmen in a carpenters shop they not only turn out bad jobs of work but they spoil the tools for better workmen there is hardly a pair of rhymes in the english language that is not so dulled and hacked and gapped by these prentice hands that a master of the craft hates to touch them and yet he cannot very well do without them i have not been besieged as the old professor has been with such multitudes of wouldbepoetical aspirants that he could not even read their manuscripts but i have had a good many letters containing verses and i have warned the writers of the delusion under which they were laboring you may like to know that i have just been translating some extracts from the greek anthology i send you a few specimens of my work with a dedication to the shade of sappho i hope you will find something of the greek rhythm in my versions and that i have caught a spark of inspiration from the impassioned lesbian i have found great delight in this work at any rate and am never so happy as when i read from my manuscript or repeat from memory the lines into which i have transferred the thought of the men and women of two thousand years ago or given rhythmical expression to my own rapturous feelings with regard to them i must read you my dedication to the shade of sappho i cannot help thinking that you will like it better than either of my last two the song of the roses or the wail of the weeds how i do miss you dearest i want you i want you to listen to what i have written i want you to hear all about my plans for the future i want to look at you and think how grand it must be to feel ones self to be such a noble and beautifulcreature i want to wander in the woods with you to float on the lake to share your life and talk over every days doings with you alas i feel that we have parted as two friends part at a port of embarkation they embrace they kiss each others cheeks they cover their faces and weep they try to speak goodby to each other they watch from the pier and from the deck the two forms grow less and less fainter and fainter in the distance two white handkerchiefs flutter once and again and yet once more and the last visible link of the chain which binds them has parted dear dear dearest euthymia my eyes are running over with tears when i think that we may never never meet again dont you want some more items of village news we are threatened with an influx of stylish people buttons to answer the doorbell in place of the chambermaid butler in place of the hired man footman in topboots and breeches cockade on hat arms folded a la napoleon tandems drags dogcarts and gocarts of all sorts it is rather amusing to look at their ambitious displays but it takes away the good old country flavor of the place i dont believe you mean to try to astonish us when you come back to spend your summers here i suppose you must have a large house and i am sure you will have a beautiful one i suppose you will have some fine horses and who would nt be glad to but i do not believe you will try to make your old arrowhead village friends stare their eyes out of their heads with a display meant to outshine everybody else that comes here you can have a yacht on the lake if you like but i hope you will pull a pair of oars in our old boat once in a while with me to steer you i know you will be just the same deareuthymia you always were and always must be how happy you must make such a man as maurice kirkwood and how happy you ought to be with him a man who knows what is in books and who has seen for himself what is in men if he has not seen so much of women where could he study all that is best in womanhood as he can in his own wife only one thing that dear euthymia lacks she is not quite pronounced enough in her views as to the rights and the wrongs of the sex when i visit you as you say i shall i mean to indoctrinate maurice with sound views on that subject i have written an essay for the society which i hope will go a good way towards answering all the objections to female suffrage i mean to read it to your husband if you will let me as i know you will and perhaps you would like to hear it only you know my thoughts on the subject pretty well already with all sorts of kind messages to your dear husband and love to your precious self i am ever your lurida dr butts to mrs euthymia kirkwood my dear euthymia my pen refuses to call you by any other name sweetsouled you are and your latinized greek name is the one which truly designates you i cannot tell you how we have followed you with what interest and delight through your travels as you have told their story in your letters to your mother she has let us have the privilege of reading them and we have been with you in steamer yacht felucca gondola nileboat in all sorts of places from crowded capitals to deserts where no men abide everywhere keeping company with you in your natural and pleasant descriptions of your experiences and now that you have returned to your home in the great city i must write you a few lines of welcome if nothing more you will find arrowhead village a good deal changed since you left it we are discovered by some of those overrich people who make the little place upon which they swarm a kind of rural city when this happens the consequences are striking some of them desirable and some far otherwise the effect of wellbuilt wellfurnished wellkept houses and of handsome grounds always maintained in good order about them shows itself in a large circuit around the fashionable centre houses get on a new coat of paint fences are kept in better order little plots of flowers show themselves where only ragged weeds had rioted the inhabitants present themselves in more comely attire and drive in handsomer vehicles with more carefully groomed horses on the other hand there is a natural jealousy on the part of the natives of the region suddenly become fashionable they have seen the land they sold at farm prices by the acre coming to be valued by the foot like the corner lots in a city their simple and humble modes of life look almost povertystricken in the glare of wealth and luxury which so outshines their plain way of living it is true that many of them have found them selves richer than in former days when the neighborhood lived on its own resources they know how to avail themselves of their altered position and soon learn to charge city prices for country products but nothing can make people feel rich who see themselves surrounded by men whose yearly income is many times their own whole capital i think it would be better if our rich men scattered themselves more than they do buying large country estates building houses and stables which will make it easy to entertain their friends and depending for society on chosen guests rather than on the mob of millionaires who come together for social rivalry but i do not fret myself about it society will stratify itself according to the laws of social gravitation it will take a generation or two more perhaps to arrange the strata by precipitation and settlement but we can always depend on one principle to govern the arrangement of the layers people interested in the same things will naturally come together the youthful heirs of fortunes who keep splendid yachts have little to talk about with the oarsman who pulls about on the lake or the river what does young dives who drives his fourinhand and keeps a stable full of horses care about lazarus who feels rich in the possession of a horserailroad ticket you know how we live at our house plainly but with a certain degree of cultivated propriety we make no pretensions to what is called style we are still in that social stratum where the article called a napkinring is recognized as admissible at the dinnertable that fact sufficiently defines our modest pretensions the napkinring is the boundary mark between certain classes but one evening mrs butts and i went out to a party given by the lady of a worthy family where the napkin itself was a newly introduced luxury the conversation of the hostess and her guests turned upon details of the kitchen and the laundry upon the best mode of raising bread whether with emptins emptyings yeast or baking powder about bluing and starching and crimping and similar matters poor mrs butts she knew nothing more about such things than her hostess did about shakespeare and the musical glasses what was the use of trying to enforce social intercourse under such conditions incompatibility of temper has been considered ground for a divorce incompatibility of interests is a sufficient warrant for social separation the multimillionaires have so much that is common among themselves and so little that they share with us of moderate means that they will naturally form a specialized class and in virtue of their palaces their picturegalleries their equipages their yachts their large hospitality constitute a kind of exclusive aristocracy religion which ought to be the great leveller cannot reduce these elements to the same grade you may read in the parable friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment the modern version would be how came you at mrs billions ball not having a dress on your back which came from paris the little church has got a new stained window a saint who reminds me of hamlets uncle a thing of shreds and patches but rather pretty to look at with an inscription under it which is supposed to be the name of the person in whose honor the window was placed in the church smith was a worthy man and a faithful churchwarden and i hope posterity will be able to spell out his name on his monumental window but that old english lettering would puzzle mephistopheles himself if he found himself before this memorial tribute on the inside you know he goes to church sometimes if you remember your faust the rector has come out in a quiet way as an evolutionist he has always been rather broad in his views but cautious in their expression you can tell the three branches of the motherisland church by the way they carry their heads the lowchurch clergy look down as if they felt themselves to be worms of the dust the highchurch priest drops his head on one side after the pattern of the mediaeval saints the broadchurch preacher looks forward and round about him as if he felt himself the heir of creation our rector carries his head in the broadchurch aspect which i suppose is the least open to the charge of affectation in fact is the natural and manly way of carrying it the society has justified its name of pansophian of late as never before lurida has stirred up our little community and its neighbors so that we get essays on all sorts of subjects poems and stories in large numbers i know all about it for she often consults me as to the merits of a particular contribution what is to be the fate of lurida i often think with no little interest and some degree of anxiety about her future her body is so frail and her mind so excessively and constantly active that i am afraid one or the other will give way i do not suppose she thinks seriously of ever being married she grows more and more zealous in behalf of her own sex and sterner in her judgment of the other she declares that she never would marry any man who was not an advocate of female suffrage and as these gentlemen are not very common hereabouts the chance is against her capturing any one of the hostile sex what do you think i happened just as i was writing the last sentence to look out of my window and whom should i see but lurida with a young man in tow listening very eagerly to her conversation according to all appearance i think he must be a friend of the rector as i have seen a young man like this one in his company who knows affectionately yours etc dr butts to mrs butts my beloved wife this letter will tell you more news than you would have thought could have been got together in this little village during the short time you have been staying away from it lurida vincent is engaged he is a clergyman with a mathematical turn the story is that he put a difficult problem into one of the mathematical journals and that lurida presented such a neat solution that the young man fell in love with her on the strength of it i dont think the story is literally true nor do i believe that other report that he offered himself to her in the form of an equation chalked on the blackboard but that it was an intellectual rather than a sentimental courtship i do not doubt lurida has given up the idea of becoming a professional lecturer so she tells me thinking that her future husbands parish will find her work enough to do a certain amount of daily domestic drudgery and unexciting intercourse with simpleminded people will be the best thing in the world for that brain of hers always simmering with some new project in its least fervid condition all our summer visitors have arrived euthymia mrs maurice kirkwood and her husband and little maurice are here in their beautiful house looking out on the lake they gave a grand party the other evening you ought to have been there but i suppose you could not very well have left your sister in the middle of your visit all the grand folks were there of course lurida and her young man gabriel is what she calls him were naturally the objects of special attention paolo acted as majordomo and looked as if he ought to be a majorgeneral nothing could be pleasanter than the way in which mr and mrs kirkwood received their plain country neighbors that is just as they did the others of more pretensions as if they were really glad to see them as i am sure they were the old landlord and his wife had two armchairs to themselves and i saw miranda with the servants of the household looking in at the dancers and out at the little groups in the garden and evidently enjoying it as much as her old employers it was a most charming and successful party we had two sensations in the course of the evening one was pleasant and somewhat exciting the other was thrilling and of strange and startling interest you remember how emaciated poor maurice kirkwood was left after his fever in that first season when he was among us he was out in a boat one day when a ring slipped off his thin finger and sunk in a place where the water was rather shallow jake you know jake everybody knows jake was rowing him he promised to come to the spot and fish up the ring if he could possibly find it he was seen poking about with fishhooks at the end of a pole but nothing was ever heard from him about the ring it was an antique intaglio stone in an etruscan setting a wild goose flying over the campagna mr kirkwood valued it highly and regretted its loss very much while we were in the garden who should appear at the gate but jake with a great basket inquiring for mr kirkwood come said maurice to me let us see what our old friend the fisherman has brought us what have you got there jake what i ve got wall i ll tell y what ive got i ve got the biggest pickerel thats been ketched in this pond for these ten year an i ve got somethin else besides the pickerel when i come to cut him open what do you think i faound in his insides but this here ring o yourn and he showed the one maurice had lost so long before there it was as good as new after having tried jonahs style of housekeeping for all that time there are those who discredit jakes story about finding the ring in the fish anyhow there was the ring and there was the pickerel i need not say that jake went off well paid for his pickerel and the precious contents of its stomach now comes the chief event of the evening i went early by special invitation maurice took me into his library and we sat down together i have something of great importance he said to say to you i learned within a few days that my cousin laura is staying with a friend in the next town to this you know doctor that we have never met since the last almost fatal experience of my early years i have determined to defy the strength of that deadly chain of associations connected with her presence and i have begged her to come this evening with the friends with whom she is staying several letters passed between us for it was hard to persuade her that there was no longer any risk in my meeting her her imagination was almost as deeply impressed as mine had been at those alarming interviews and i had to explain to her fully that i had become quite indifferent to the disturbing impressions of former years so as the result of our correspondence laura is coming this evening and i wish you to be present at our meeting there is another reason why i wish you to be here my little boy is not far from the age at which i received my terrifying almost disorganizing shock i mean to have little maurice brought into the presence of laura who is said to be still a very handsome woman and see if he betrays any hint of that peculiar sensitiveness which showed itself in my threatening seizure it seemed to me not impossible that he might inherit some tendency of that nature and i wanted you to be at hand if any sign of danger should declare itself for myself i have no fear some radical change has taken place in my nervous system i have been born again as it were in my susceptibilities and am in certain respects a new man but i must know how it is with my little maurice imagine with what interest i looked forward to this experiment for experiment it was and not without its sources of anxiety as it seemed to me the evening wore along friends and neighbors came in but no laura as yet at last i heard the sound of wheels and a carriage stopped at the door two ladies and a gentleman got out and soon entered the drawing room my cousin laura whispered maurice to me and went forward to meet her a very handsome woman who might well have been in the thirties one of those women so thoroughly constituted that they cannot help being handsome at every period of life i watched them both as they approached each other both looked pale at first but maurice soon recovered his usual color and lauras natural rich bloom came back by degrees their emotion at meeting was not to be wondered at but there was no trace in it of the paralyzing influence on the great centres of life which had once acted upon its fated victim like the fabled head which turned the lookeron into a stone is the boy still awake said maurice to paolo who as they used to say of pushee at the old anchor tavern was everywhere at once on that gay and busy evening what mahser maurice asleep an all this racket going on i hear him crowing like young cockerel when he fus smell daylight tell the nurse to bring him down quietly to the little room that leads out of the library the child was brought down in his nightclothes wide awake wondering apparently at the noise he heard which he seemed to think was for his special amusement see if he will go to that lady said his father both of us held our breath as laura stretched her arms towards little maurice the child looked for an instant searchingly but fearlessly at her glowing cheeks her bright eyes her welcoming smile and met her embrace as she clasped him to her bosom as if he had known her all his days the mortal antipathy had died out of the soul and the blood of maurice kirkwood at that supreme moment when he found himself snatched from the grasp of death and cradled in the arms of euthymia in closing the new portfolio i remember that it began with a prefix which the reader may by this time have forgotten namely the first opening it was perhaps presumptuous to thus imply the probability of a second opening i am reminded from time to time by the correspondents who ask a certain small favor of me that as i can only expect to be with my surviving contemporaries a very little while longer they would be much obliged if i would hurry up my answer before it is too late they are right these delicious unknown friends of mine in reminding me of a fact which i cannot gainsay and might suffer to pass from my recollection i thank them for recalling my attention to a truth which i shall be wiser if not more hilarious for remembering no i had no right to say the first opening how do i know that i shall have a chance to open it again how do i know that anybody will want it to be opened a second time how do i know that i shall feel like opening it it is safest neither to promise to open the new portfolio once more nor yet to pledge myself to keep it closed hereafter there are many papers potentially existent in it some of which might interest a reader here and there the records of the pansophian society contain a considerable number of essays poems stories and hints capable of being expanded into presentable dimensions in the mean time i will say with prospero addressing my old readers and my new ones if such i have if you be pleased retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two ill walk to still my beating mind when it has got quiet i may take up the new portfolio again and consider whether it is worth while to open it consider whether it is worth while to open it
