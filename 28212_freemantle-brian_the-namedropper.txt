dismiss as a gross underestimate a cabinet office study estimating the uk cost at billion a year one harvey jordan always chose an aisle seat disinterested in looking out at ploughed clouds at feet so it wasnt until the plane banked over the sea for its customary descent into nice that he got his first sight of the boatsailedandpropellerspumed mediterranean and coming rapidly closer the regimented squads of private jets parked at ease on their parade ground as always on his arrival in such a familiar welcoming environment in which he could unusually be harvey jordan there was the immediate and professional recognition of the easy and openly available opportunities spread out before him even before getting off the aircraft just as quickly came the objective refusal as harvey jordan the genuine name by which he had been christened and officially registered in st michael and all angels in paddington forty years ago this was forbidden ground a positively prohibited working zone he was legally and therefore necessarily above suspicion harvey jordan and this was a vacation even though he considered what he now did for a living more a permanent holiday than work but it was work and the living had been good very good indeed so far this year jordan had operated twice in new york once in los angeles and three times in london currently the profit was nudging with no irritating pre or after tax qualifications and hed already planned three new hits when he got back from france which should comfortably take his income beyond the million the only uncertainty was whether to try to fit in something else after that which couldnt be decided until he got to the end of his carefully calculated schedule jordan ignored the scramblingtostand bustle behind the business class separation the moment the plane stopped smiling his thanks at the flight attendants approach with his carryon luggage and instinctively allowed three of the other passengers in the section to disembark ahead of him just as instinctively he isolated the cctv cameras inside the terminal again immersing himself among the concealment of preceding arrival passengers with no checkedin luggage to collect jordan passed unchallenged through the customs hall smiling expectantly at the timeconsuming melee around the car rental desks the nice city bus left within minutes of his boarding and it cost a ten euro tip for the driver to make an unscheduled stop directly outside the negresco hotel the concierge smiled in recognition at jordans entry took his luggage and assured him the prebooked hire car was waiting in its parking space the primed duty manager was already at the reception desk by the time jordan reached it the registration only needing jordans unaccustomed but genuine signature only staying two nights this time mr jordan said the duty manager moving around as always i might ask to come back while im in the area said jordan who rarely made any long term commitment theres always accommodation available for regular guests smiled the man in reply i know jordan said and smiled back it was refreshing and the purpose of his vacations to be able to relax and be recognized for who he really was and not to have to constantly remember and react to the identity he had assumed two that afternoon as he always did upon relocating to different towns or cities no matter how well he already knew them jordan set out to reorientate himself jordan operated to a number of selfinvented and imposed rules one of which was never to take anything for granted no matter how familiar or predictable the situation or surroundings before quitting the hotel he put the intrusion traps in place in his seafronting suite hanging his clothes with pocket flaps and trouser lengths arranged in such a way and shirts in such an order in partially withdrawn or fully closed drawers that he would have known instantly if they had been disturbed during his absence downstairs at the caisse he rented a safe deposit facility for the bulk of his money genuine passport standby letter of credit and emergenciesonly again genuine credit cards like most successful professional thieves harvey jordan took the greatest care protecting his own finances and possessions hed lost everything including a wife once and was determined never to do so again the most necessary and basic essentials put into force jordan strolled into the town as far as the railway station reestablishing its layout in his mind and isolating new constructions and shops since his last visit he walked in a gradual familiarizing loop via the park to a corner cafe hed enjoyed during a previous visit for coffee and pastries gazing out over the sunstarred water he calculated that it would only take three months four at the most for his last victim a flamboyant frequently gossipcolumned london investment banker to restore his credit rating harvey jordan prided himself upon his robin hood integrity always establishing the financial resources of those whose identity he stole and used another working rule was that with only ever one exception he never stripped them to the monetary bone as he had been stripped with pirhranalike efficiency it had taken harvey jordan two years after crawling almost literally out of the vomitridden gutter to discover the identity of the man who had first stolen his identity and along with it his legitimate computer programming business then it took a further year using the mans genuine identity to recover financially everything and more of what had been taken from him he hadnt of course been able to recover rebecca or the bankrupt business it was a matter of integrity he reassured himself that having personally learned it the hardest way imaginable he provided a very necessary lesson to those from whom he stole to never again be so careless with their personal details and information it wouldnt jordan knew be a defence if he were ever caught which he was equally determined never to be but he considered the money he took not so much illegally obtained as justifiable and wellearned tuition fees if he didnt do it who else was there to teach them in the early evening jordan drove the anonymous rented renault to monaco and ate at one of his favourite restaurants in the principality a specialist fish bistro overlooking the harbour and the pinkpainted royal palace and afterwards climbed the hill for coffee and brandy on the hotel de paris terrace watching the early arrivals at the casino jordan himself crossed the square just after ten and bought worth of chips on holiday just as when he was following his chosen profession tax exempting casino winning receipts legally proved his income legitimately came from gambling he started out with chemin de fer and at the end of an hour he was showing a profit of which he much more quickly quadrupled at the roulette table throughout jordan remained constantly alert to everything and everyone around him twice moving to a different position at the roulette table to prevent people getting close enough to either pickpocket or steal his chips even though he was confident he would have instantly detected any attempt at either the need as always was to avoid attracting attention he was aware too of two unaccompanied women who had seen his success at the card table and were now attentively standing on the other side of the roulette wheel he identified both professional recognizing professional as working girls he decided against either this early on in his vacation because of how he lived jordan accepted that any permanent relationship certainly another marriage was impossible but sex was as essential as the best food and finest hotels during such periods of necessary relaxation but jordan preferred equally casual but uninvolving holiday romances to financial practitioners no matter how adept there was often an added frisson from amateur enthusiasm jordan concluded his evening just before midnight with a profit of the essential casino receipt confirming the gambling winnings for later tax submission proof and a feeling of total satisfaction at his first nonworking day for three months he decided it was an omen that aurgured well for the rest of the trip which it proved to be as he drove the following day into the mountain hills to st paul de vence he decided to extend his stay in nice to allow more time to reexplore the surrounding countryside momentarily doubting his decision when he reached the village which was full of too many milling jostling tourists in very narrow streets the uncertainty seeped away when he reached the colombe dor to savour both the luncheon menu and the display of original impressionist art jordan considered the small chagall protectively stored in one of his well hidden bank vaults probably the best investment hed ever made twice once in london and again during his most recent new york expedition hed felt sufficiently confident of his specific impressionist knowledge to have successfully passed himself off as an expert on the subject under two separately assumed identities jordan telephoned the hotel from the colombe dor to lengthen his stay in nice and to alter the already confirmed reservation in cannes because jordan never did anything even as mundane as moving from one place to another without guaranteeing the most appropriate accommodation sure there would be no difficulty in his arranging either which there wasnt the years and the period had been years not months over which jordan had worked to protect and preserve his now near perfect existence was finally paying the highest dividends and it was a good feeling he wanted always to preserve that nights gambling was at the beaulieu casino in which jordan finished ahead which provided another useful tax receipt an equally satisfying success was in confirming his previous nights judgement there was a mutual facial recognition between both of them she was the second of the two professionals hed isolated in monaco tonights simple black tube dress the only jewellery a single rope of pearls better showing off both her figure and blonde attractiveness than the earlier more full skirted red she smiled at their initial eye contact and he briefly nodded back in acknowledgement she made her approach as jordan had anticipated she would when he was having his farewell brandy after hed cashed up you gamble well she opened luckily jordan qualified how did you know i was english such attention to detail was always important you talked more in english than french to the croupier her own minimal accent wasnt french and you dont gamble you didnt last night or tonight he wanted to establish his own awareness not at the tables she slightly moved the chair at which she was standing may i join you jordan nodded politely rising as she sat youd like champagne that would be very pleasant my name is ghilane john responded jordan gesturing for a waiter it was the christian name of his most recent victim and that to which he was therefore most accustomed it would have been unthinkable amatuerish to have given her his real name even though this was going to be the most fleeting of encounters you are here on vacation john jordan hesitated while her wine was served i enjoy the south of france so you know it well well enough he wondered by how much the fulness of her breasts was helped by the uplift of her bra but decided against paying to find out she grimaced extravagantly pulling down the corners of her mouth which means i cant offer to show you places you havent seen before she was very good and very enticing acknowledged jordan refusing the heavily intended double entendre he said its quite late not too late to be too tired she misunderstood i was thinking of you as i was of you an hour from now only sad losschasers will still be here without any money left i dont want it to be a lost evening for you her face tightened imperceptibly but quickly relaxed opening into a smile you sure about that im sure i dont usually get a response like this get so immediately recognized like this i think we could have had fun together more interesting fun than normal for both of us im sure we could said jordan meaning it but at the same time discomfited by her reaction to his rejection hed never known a hooker anywhere in the world and hed known enough in a lot of the world who wasnt or didnt easily become a willing police informant to protect themself which professionally again he totally understood and accepted youre right said ghilane looking briefly around her it is late and theres a lot of desperately perspiring men around the tables maybe tomorrow night will turn out better jordan knew she hadnt given up and admired her for it he touched her champagne flute with his brandy snifter and said heres to a more successful tomorrow but not with you but not with me echoed jordan it had been a passing even entertaining interlude but it was time it ended perhaps ill see you again im often here or in monaco im moving on tomorrow said jordan gesturing for his bill she shrugged philosophically my loss both our loss said jordan gallantly jordans excursion the following day took him away from the coast just beyond mougins to where picasso once crafted his ceramics of which there were still a lot of photographs but with most of which jordan was unimpressed as he was with some although by no means all of the artists various period experimentation particularly picassos female genitalia obsession the eating choice had obviously to be the moulin de mougins even though jordan knew the legend of picasso settling bills there with sketches instead of cash to be untrue jordan didnt hurry the short descent to the carlton at cannes timing his arrival perfectly for a late lunch on the terrace although as far back from the trafficthronged promenade as possible his placement perfect for when the heat went out of the day he wasnt aware of her when he first sat but almost at once registered the carefully pagemarked but set aside book as well as the solitaire engagement ring he conservatively estimated to be at least five carats overwhelming the surprisingly slim adjoining wedding band she was remarkably similar to the blondehaired heavily busted girl who had called herself ghilane although younger probably little more than thirty there was a handbag too small to contain a cell phone a protective widebrimmed hat on the same side chair as the discarded book no longer necessary because of the table umbrella the shade of which made it impossible for jordan to make out her features despite the shade she still wore sunglasses she was already on her coffee the single glass of wine only half drunk jordan smiled when she turned to look across the intervening four tables in his direction he could see enough of her face to know that she didnt smile back but looked immediately away towards the sea time to move on from impressionists jordan concluded it really was developing into the sort of vacation hed hoped it would be as in previous years it had invariably proved to be three over months eventually stretching into years harvey jordan had learned every trick and manoeuvre to access uncover and utilize the identity of unwitting victims none of which had to be employed to discover all he needed to know about the blonde disdainful woman this was pleasure an amusement to pass the afternoon not work upon which he had to concentrate directly after making his deposit box arrangements and setting the intrusion traps in his suite jordan quit the carlton to stroll along the croisette towards the port to indicate his own disinterest although frequently pausing to ensure that she was not coincidentally taking the same exercise behind him wanting the intended encounter to be at his choosing not by accident using his knowledge of the hotel he timed his return to the carlton for the beginning of their afternoon tea service confident that he entered the lounge without her awareness and gained a seat sufficiently close behind her to easily overhear the waiter address her as madam appleton and to detect the american accent when she ordered he was also close enough to see that the book in which she was now engrossed was pride and prejudice jordan declined tea himself needing to be in position in the lobby he didnt hurry selecting the right place disappointed there wasnt an unobtrusive spot from which he had a complete view of the roomkey pigeon holes as well as a sufficient warning of her approach into the lounge he settled for the best available combination and hid himself behind the herald tribune raising it higher at the first sight of her before she actually came into the reception area he was doubly lucky as she did precisely what hed hoped by going straight to the desk for her key which jordan immediately recognized to be at the suite level upon which he had his own five rooms further along the same corridor an unexpected but welcome bonus because he was not working and sought recognition rather than his usual anonymity jordan had ensured his immediate acknowledgement by heavily tipping upon his arrival the valet parking supervisor at the top of the hotels sweeping entrance into the underground facility and so was greeted by name as he approached knowing from his previous visits that vehicle spaces were allocated by room number he gave that of the woman not his own shaking his head when the supervisor frowned as he looked up from his occupation list and said thats mrs appletons suite she doesnt have a car here stupid of me not concentrating apologized jordan giving his own number jordan drove contentedly along the croisette in the direction hed earlier walked leaving the renault in the underground public car park adjoining the port and choosing the restaurant with a firstfloor overview of the marina and its yachts reflecting upon what it had been so easy to learn about the dismissive mrs appleton she was an abstemious american woman about thirty years old who liked classic english literature with so few friends or acquaintances she didnt even bother with a cell phone staying alone and without transport in one of the best hotels in the south of france sufficiently wealthy to wear a fivecarat diamond ring and be able to afford a beachfronting suite although unlikely to venture out too long upon it from the umbrella and sun hatted care she took to protect her complexion and she was hopefully lonely or bored or both the ice maiden melted the following day although initially only very slightly but still enough by the time she emerged from the elevator just before eleven jordan had bought a paperback edition of jane austins sense and sensibility from the english language bookshop near the railway terminus and was back ensconced in the lounge the book and its title positioned on the table in front of him to be obvious to anyone entering from the lobby jordan himself was once more hidden behind his raised newspaper awaiting her arrival he kept the herald tribune uncomfortably high his arms beginning to ache until the coffee service began thankfully lowering it to order and establish that she was deeper within the room writing at an upright table whatever it was appeared to be a long letter several thick pages not a holiday postcard she was wearing a bare shouldered day dress but with a matching patterned bolero her book widebrimmed hat and sunglasses carefully beside her on the other chair better able to see her without the glare of yesterdays sun jordan decided she was very much younger than the casino professional and her hair a much more natural blonde the darkrimmed reading spectacles it seemed necessary for her to wear added rather than detracted from her attractiveness it was going to be an interesting distraction trying to establish whether she was a genuinely natural blonde hed give himself today maybe going over into tomorrow if there hadnt been sufficient progress by then hed move on maybe even go back to one of the casinos to find the more approachable ghilane jordan waited until she finished whatever it was she was writing and was reading through it before rising to make his way out into the lobby choosing a path to take him directly by her table he did not look in her direction nor was aware of her looking in his and he was past before she said excuse me the satisfaction coursed through him im sorry your book youve left your book jordan frowned turning to where he had been sitting i have a call to make im coming back im sorry i thought the words were stumbled but she didnt colour with embarrassment closer he saw that she was blueeyed so maybe she was genuinely blonde thank you will you stand guard while im gone im embarrassed she still didnt blush an east coast accent the vowels hard judged jordan expertly youve no reason to be jordan continued on before she could reply building in the time for his absence by going up to his suite and remaining at the window for a few minutes watching the beach filling up beneath its parasols from the attention with which the sunbathers were creaming and oiling themselves jordan guessed it was hotter out on the beach than it had been the previous day she was waiting for his return smiling up at once her thick manila envelope sealed it was automatic for jordan to try to read the address but it was very positively turned against him which would have made his interest too obvious if hed tried harder my book is untouched as i left it he said and smiled the spectacles were back in their case now along with everything else on the chair beside her i misunderstood im sorry im not said jordan maintaining the momentum now were talking instead of being on the opposite sides of the room from each other standing above her he could see the dark beginning of a deep and enticing cleavage i didnt intend to intrude but she began again i didnt think that you did jordan stopped her i think it was a fortunate misunderstanding she shifted uncertainly looking down at the only available chair full of her belongings gesturing to where he had been sitting earlier jordan said theres more room where i am lets have an aperitif there my things she said making her own gesture they can stay where they are or be brought to us if you want them she hesitated they can stay here it was going to work as it invariably did jordan decided harvey jordan whose vocation was seduction in every sense and definition of the word didnt hurry he never did once the first barrier was breached the initial isolation and pursuit of a victim was as much an orgasmic pleasure as its culmination either sexual or financial and he had a lot of mental foreplay to savour here remembering her half glass abstinence the previous lunchtime he chose a single glass not even a half bottle of champagne for their aperitif and distanced himself from her at the furthest end of the couch he gave her his real name christian as well as family and learned that hers was alyce with a y just to be different and that it was her first visit to france she hadnt yet felt confident enough to try the french in which shed graduated as well as in spanish both with a plus from smith college she admired the ease with which he spoke french to their waiter ordering the drinks and asking for the luncheon menu and for a table not outside on the open terrace but directly inside the better shaded floortoceiling veranda doors which still imposing his own pace jordan did without inviting her in advance she accepted at once when he belatedly apologized for his feigned presumption jordan felt a fleeting jump of unease at her mention of the parkview appartment because his last identity sting had been in manhattan quickly dismissed by the selfassurance that small though the island was the likelihood of her knowing anyone with whom hed had a chance encounter was remote particularly after her reference to a weekend house in the hamptons which she preferred to the city and he hadnt been using his own name then anyway there was no reference to a job or a profession or to the husband who had presumably provided the diamond and the wedding band and jordan held back from any curiosity it was a not infrequent reflection of his that so easily did he find it to encourage people to unprompted disclose their life histories that had he chosen a legitimate profession he could have lived well although not as well as he did now by setting himself up as a psychologist or an endofthepier fortune teller complete with crystal ball jordans restricted offering was well rehearsed and faultlessly delivered in the hope of encouraging further disclosures from her hed been fortunate with a family inheritance which hed used to develop a so far sufficiently successful career as a venture capitalist it enabled him to travel extensively although that freedom brought with it personal restrictions chief among them a difficulty in establishing permanent relationships there had been someone a few years earlier with whom he believed himself to have been in love although now he was no longer sure but against whom he felt no resentment or disappointment for refusing to put up with his too frequent absences and abandoning him for someone else to whom he believed and certainly hoped she was now very happily married they still exchanged christmas cards last years had featured a family photograph that included a baby girl in reality it had been the drunken selfpity that rebecca had refused to put up with hed seen the announcement of her second marriage in the daily telegraph and the birth announcement he certainly didnt feel any resentment against her walking out on him as she had hed have done the same in her circumstances thats sad responded alyce although not offering an explanation for the wedding band now covered by her other hand not for rebecca that was her name further tempted jordan shes got a husband and a baby and a proper life not someone whose existence is regulated by airline schedules or after the bankruptcy the availability of a gin bottle he remembered sad for you she insisted still without volunteering more but not today declared jordan briskly today i am on vacation and were having lunch together and i am no longer lonely alyce hesitated and for the briefest moment jordan thought she was going to change her mind and decline the belated invitation instead she said no now neither of us are lonely jordan did order a whole bottle of wine a grand cru chablis and took time consulting the menu with alyce who followed his recommendations hed seen a film version of pride and prejudice and speedskimmed enough of sense and sensibility to maintain a conversation about jane austen and her books his familiar neveryetfailed technique now fully on track and went easily into his well practised repertoire of fictitious venture capitalist and investment anecdotes she laughed on cue but once more brought him up short after the third story by saying your experiences seem much more amusing than my husbands hes in the business queried jordan his stomach lurching wall street hes the appleton of appleton and drake the commodity traders different sort of finance altogether insisted jordan the alarm receding all far too clever for me and me she said as she smiled i dont understand any of it thank god he hadnt gone on to his two new york inventions jordan thought ive visited new york of course great city but i havent done any business there i prefer the hamptons she repeated shed opened the subject at last jordan said is your husband joining you here no alyce said sharply im sorry hurried jordan feigning the embarrassment to match hers earlier i didnt forgive me lets talk about something else lets agreed jordan anxious to maintain his selfimposed schedule have you read dumas alyce frowned confused by such an abrupt switch i tried him in the original french but ended up with the translation which book the man in the iron mask what else it was like winding a clockwork toy knowing how it would respond when the catch was released have you any plans for tomorrow the frown returned at the further apparent switch no will you trust me to take you on a mystery journey should i the first hint of flirtation jordan recognized thats for you to decide she made as if to consider it ill take the risk youll need sun protection something to cover your arms as well as oil or cream not the sort of hat youve got over there a bill cap a swimming costume if you decide to swim bring one anyway are those all the clues i get its too many already i like mystery so do i she really was quite beautiful jordan decided should he cool things down before things even got started jordan asked himself observing the familiar precaution he would certainly stage the promised now inescapable excursion but then move on further along the coast which had always been the intention but not with alyce appleton as a companion which objectively she might not be persuaded or want to be anyway jordan had worked often and successfully in new york but knew there was no way his path could have crossed or intertwined with that of alyces husband if they had he would have immediately recognized her name even before she identified her husband and she was hardly going to mention him or his name when she got back to america there couldnt be the slightest risk of any professional difficulty arising from her husband being in commodity trading which really was a quantum leap from any company identity theft with which he might involve himself in the future doubly so now by his knowing the name of her husbands firm the more jordan rationalized it the more he accepted his concern at learning what her husband did had been exaggerated too early to abandon his pursuit of alyce he determined just something to keep in mind jordan excused himself immediately after lunch talking of prior arrangements that were going to keep him busy for the rest of the day and into the evening sure he detected her disappointment at their not spending more of the day and perhaps dinner together dont forget what youll need tomorrow its a boat right maybe you dont like the sea i told you ive lived in the hamptons remember lived in the past tense isolated jordan much rougher there than here so im right she demanded wait and see what time ten ill call you if theres any change not wanting to use those of previous expeditions jordan got the names of three new yacht charterers from the concierge on his way upstairs and fixed meetings with the two most convenient both with boats available in the port a man of instinctive attention to detail jordan checked the following days predicted wind strength and chose the twinhulled catamaran instead of the older mahoganyfitted single hull he would have preferred in calmer conditions it took longer to decide the food and wine he wanted even for a oneday charter than it did to choose between the two yachts the departure was confirmed for ten oclock which meant he didnt have to alter their already agreed schedule jordan could easily have got back to the carlton for dinner but guessed she would be eating there so he ate again in the restaurant dominating the marina from his balcony table he could easily see the catamaran hed hired being prepared for the following day jordans am call was a test to assess her tone is there a problem she asked at once none at all im just checking its still all right with you shed been worried prepared for disappointment im looking forward to it you got everything everything ill see you in the lobby at nine fortyfive she carried a small duffel bag and wore jeans a white shirt with a thin anorak looped around her shoulders her blonde hair in a ponytail under the bill cap confident without any makeup and jordan thought she looked good enough to eat and hoped he would be doing just that very shortly he definitely wouldnt be moving on soon hed ordered a hotel car rather than bother with the hired renault pleased to see that the previously tipped crew of two men and one woman were already waiting for their arrival the catamaran open and ready to sail as they cleared the marina on engine alyce said its time i knew where were going to see the cell in which the man in the iron mask was actually held announced jordan her reaction was exactly the same as that of the two other women one english the other australian hed taken on the same trip hopefully this time with the same uncomplicated result of the previous two what alexander dumass story is based on fact one of the fictions was that the mask was iron it wasnt it was black velvet i cant believe what youre telling me the catamaran cleared the immediate harbour and the sails billowed out above them jordan said why dont you relax in the webbing between the hulls because i want you to tell me what youre talking about its not really true is it totally true what no one has ever established is his real identity although hes buried as m de marshiel he was a state prisoner of louis xiv for forty years he was held in jails all over france he died in the bastille in november whenever he was moved from jail to jail he had to wear the velvet mask to prevent anyone ever recognizing who he really was jordan waved his hand beyond her and one of those prisons was on the ile st marguerite where were going alyce swivelled to look at the undulating smudge on the horizon were going to see the actual cell the actual cell echoed jordan it was going to work it always had i dont believe it she said again you can use your schoolgirl french to read the memorial plaque theres a pamphlet too what horrendous crime did he commit yet escape execution no one knows that either theres a lot of legends one is that he was the due de vermandois an illegitimate son of louis although on the face of it thats an extreme way to treat your own son in his book if you remember dumas copied voltaire in suggesting the man was an illegitimate elder brother of louis fathered by cardinal mazarin theres also a lot of historical insistence that he was a count mattiolo a minister of the duke of mantua who tried to trick louis during diplomatic negotiations and was punished with a totally unknown and unrecognized living death alyce shuddered kept locked up for forty years a non person for forty years someone whose face was never again seen except by his jailers theres even a story that he had to wear the mask before he was given food so that even the jailers wouldnt know what he looked like if he defied them and refused to put it on he wasnt fed jordan thought she was remarkably agile disembarking at the island as she had been boarding the catamaran she slowly read the memorial plaque and collected the pamphlet and in the bare cell which was very cold compared to the outside near midday heat she shuddered again several times whatever he did he didnt deserve what was done to him she insisted it had to be bad it doesnt make any difference by the time they returned to the anchored catamaran the crew had erected a sun awning alyce didnt refuse the champagne but stopped at the second glass of chablis and didnt need any urging to eat the lobster with her fingers they let the strongest heat go out of the day before swimming off the port fin jordan delaying his climb back on to the boat because of his momentary and too obvious excitement at seeing her surprisingly unashamed in the briefest of bikinis when they got back to cannes she said she wanted to walk back rather than call for the hotel car or a taxi and did so almost immediately taking his hand moving her fingers over his she said she wasnt hungry when he suggested dinner but that the sea air had tired her and that she thought shed go directly to bed but not alone she added jordan thought it was far more exciting than ghilane might have made it discovering that alyce was indeed a natural blonde and very eager and proud to prove it they checked out of the carlton together the following morning alyce leaving the american express office in cannes as her forwarding address for any mail and despite the inevitable traffic congestion on the meander to st tropez once they got off the autoroute they managed to get to the residence de la pinade and their comer tower room in perfect time for lunch on the seabordering terrace even after hed organized the necessary safe deposit box held by the excitement of discovery they spent the afternoon in bed in fresh exploration and decided they didnt want the additional exertion of walking into the town in the evening nor to eat anything other than each other she didnt enjoy the following days bustle of the town or the clutter of polished harley davidson motorcycles looped like a necklace around the harbour edge so they escaped by taxi over the hill to pampalon plage and the tahiti restaurant the first of several they visited over succeeding days judging the tahiti their favourite except for the day jordan chartered another yacht traditionally hulled this time to sail the coastline to the carfree lies de porquerolles that was the day or rather the night as they lay side by side naked recovering from their lovemaking that alyce suggested extending her vacation by another week and jordan said he thought she should tell him about the status of her marriage there isnt one she replied status or any longer a marriage that day we met the envelope it was divorce papers i couldnt wait to sign im sorry i shouldnt its not important she said dismissively she looked steadily at him across their table mad at me jordan hesitated searching for the right response tit for tat to balance your betrayal something like that in fact exactly that why should i be mad i used you you didnt make any secret about being married she smiled i started out feeling a shit guilty i guess on several levels i dont any more i feel great so do i no hangups no regrets no hangups no regrets what about my extending for an extra week it sounds good they made their way slowly back along the coast stopping at cagnes and le saintpaul and on the night before her flight from nice stayed at the hermitage in monte carlo and gambled in the high stakes room in the casino where alyce won to his as they left the caisse jordan carefully pocketing the french certificate recording his winnings alyce said whats the benefit of that in england gambling winnings arent taxable this is proof of where the money came from it makes you sound very rich its the law i always try to obey the law said jordan at the airport the following morning alyce said its been great youve been great everythings great theres been a lot of times weve thought and spoken in echoes like now best i dont offer my new york address no he agreed nor mine in london to you he hadnt intended to anyway keep safe and stay happy and you they didnt kiss goodbye he stood watching her go through the departure gates alyce didnt turn as she did so jordan stayed that night at the negresco and the following day brought forward his return flight to london deciding as the plane climbed out over the sea that it had been his best vacation yet but that it was time to get back to work and briefly although profitably be someone other than harvey jordan someone like the targeted peter wightman four i dentity stealing harvey jordans dedicated profession is an overcrowded activity for a variety of reasons all of them to the thiefs benefit and favour it is a crime almost childishly and mostly legally easy to commit and therefore so prevalent that law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed reducing the risk of detection and even less of arrest virtually to zero people supposedly clever financially savvy people appear to ignore every piece of advice and warning given by every financial organization or adviser and those same financial organizations and advisers despite that advice and those warnings keep showering the headinthesand birdbrains with ever more credit facilities and cashgaining opportunities to be milked like a milch cow by ever ready suckling predators of whom harvey jordan judged himself the most adept if not the most financially successful single operator jordan could have doubled maybe trebled his income even gained the ultimate position of being the most financially successful but that would have required his masterminding and controlling a gang as so many others in the business did multiplying their id stealing and profits tenfold or more which did not attract or tempt harvey jordan in the slightest if he ran a gang its profit would obviously have to be divided by its number which while increasing his personal income by as much as another taxfree million a year correspondingly increased among one or more of that number the likelihood of error incompetence or idiotic mistake resulting in his being caught despite the odds against that occurring remaining in his and their favour harvey jordan knew he was good what he didnt know and wasnt interested in finding out was how consistently good others were nor did he imagine others for their part would have the patience to operate with the care and attention to detail that he did and upon which he would have insisted in any extended partnership it had taken him three months to prepare himself fully to impersonate peter thomas wightman a yearold newly elevated senior partner in the legal firm of jackson pendlebury richardson and wright in chancery lane in the holborn district of london hed learned the mans name and that of the firm within which hed been promoted from the legal notices of the daily telegraph and further researched it from the publicly available bar directory issued by the general council of the bar and waterlows solicitors and barristers directory in which the names of all solicitors and barristers in england are listed whos who gave jordan the prep school downside and balliol college oxford at which wightman had read law from the main office of the company house register at crown way maindy cardiff he legally obtained details of the after tax profit of jackson pendlebury richardson and wright and the individual income and dividends to all its partners including wightman jordan discovered wightmans age but far more importantly for his eventual purposes the maiden name of the mans mother by paying a series of tenpound search fees for details of births deaths and marriages from the family records centre ecl london the maiden name of wightmans mother had been norma snook on the marriage certificate to john wightman an accountant she was described as a solicitor peter wightman had married jean maidment eighteen years earlier at st thomass church maidstone there were three children and from the voters register records at the british library hed found the family lived in kitchener road richmond middlesex and by memorizing the number plate as he drove past the detached property and then checking at the national car registration office in gwent wales purporting to have been involved in a slight traffic accident with someone who had not stopped confirmed that wightmans car was a dark green twoyearold jaguar the detail of jordans research was continued in the form of the final precaution he always took just prior to embarking upon a new operation this was never to work from the address of the flat in marylebone which he owned under his own genuine name but always from another apartment rented in the name of his intended victim that for his assault upon peter wightman was in sydney street in chelsea from which he worked countrywide and with his usual untroubled and undetected success for a month which ended with a somewhat disappointing profit of his final role for sydney street was to use it as the base for his next rental in hans crescent knightsbridge under the name of paul maculloch a harley street cosmetic plastic surgeon whose al credit rating jordan intended to use to its full and hopefully increased advantage hed telephoned ahead to warn the marylebone concierge of his return and when he arrived the man john blake already had his accumulated mail bundled and waiting for him a good trip mr jordan enquired the man ive known better admitted jordan picking up his letters five attorneysatlaw was stridently displayed in red beneath the identifying letterhead of brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein recorded in black typescript the madison avenue new york ny address of the firm was in black too so running down the righthand side of the covering letter were the names of the fifteen lawyer partners headed by those of the three company founders the man who had in legibly rounded letters signed jordans letter david bartle was the fifth in the list presumably indicating his seniority the letter dated three weeks earlier announced itself to be a summary of the official documents that were enclosed couched in stiffly formal legalese harvey william jordan was cited under ncg s section as defendant in the forthcoming preliminary hearing date still to be negotiated and agreed between all involved parties in the crosspetitioned divorce action between alfred jerome appleton and alyce louise appleton nee bellamy alfred jerome appleton was bringing suit against harvey william jordan claiming substantial damages for alienation of affection and criminal conversations resulting in the initiation of divorce proceedings coupled and enjoined in those proceedings were further but separately itemised claims brought by alfred jerome appleton for stress loss of earnings resulting from that stress public humiliation and derision resulting from that stress damages and loss of commercial earnings and public confidence in the firm of appleton and drake from the forthcoming divorce proceedings and medical and counselling expenses resulting from each and every aspect and condition arising from each several or all of those allegations against harvey william jordan david bartle sought immediate written acknowledgement of receipt of his letter and its accompanying formal claims together with the name street and city address email and telex contacts with harvey william jordans attorney with whom all further and future correspondence leading up to the indeterminate hearing date could be conducted it was difficult for jordan to think as cold as he was shivering as he was which had nothing to do with how cold he felt there was too much to coordinate to put into the order in which he had to deal with it get out of it how to get out of it the wrong question he corrected himself the shaking subsiding how had he got into it been found discovered and by whom a private enquiry agent a private detective obviously jordan felt a fresh sweep of unreality snatching out for the discarded papers shuffling through until he found the itemised statements of claim it was all there his suite number at the carlton hotel in cannes registered as a solitary occupancy but pointedly separated by only a short distance along the same corridor from that of alyce and then their odyssey their room number as mr and mrs jordan at the residence de la pinade at st tropez and the hotels at cagnes and at le saintpaul and the hermitage in monaco as well as all the restaurants in which theyd eaten the name of the catamaran as well as that of the chartering company in which theyd sailed to the prison of the man in the iron mask and to porqerolles even astonishingly their individual winnings that last night at the monaco casino not a private detective acknowledged jordan an expert himself in the gathering of facts and information jordan knew it would have needed a squad to have assembled all this and it wouldnt be confined to just specific times against specific dates in individually identified hotels and places there would be photographs possibly dozens of photographs an engulfing mud slide of identifying collages the coldness melted under a burn of personal anger how to someone supposedly so professional at always being and remaining mr invisible could it have happened to him how could he have remained so blissfully blindly stupidly unaware of his every move being tracked and recorded as intimately by not one but perhaps several several so obvious they not only kept him and alyce under constant twentyfourhour surveillance but doubtless took albums of supporting claimincriminating photographs everything his carefully hidden and absolutely protected offshore fortune his mr invisible anonymity his very existence was threatened he had to find a way out an escape he finished the first glass of wine and immediately poured himself a second but then stared at it untouched not again not this time he warned himself hed never been a true alcoholic not able to function without it hed just needed the escape from reality that booze provided what where was his escape now was he subject to the jurisdiction of american divorce and civil courts he didnt think he was or could be but hed need legal advice the word legal echoed in his mind like a cracked bell harvey jordans absolute and essential necessity the watchword by which he drew breath to survive was always to avoid the very thought of contact with any legal authority now today his name and his address god only knew how much else from all the legally and publicly accessible sources jordan himself so assiduously pursued was now legally traceably recorded displaying him to everyone and everything it was right for him to feel so cold he was figuratively at least naked exposed for all to see and know and to dissect as and how they chose not quite came the faintly too faintly welcoming contradiction theyd restricted themselves to france to alyce appletons carefully noted and recorded departure from nice airport on the official legal documents before him american not english private detectives then hired to follow alyce from new york and watch her and anyone with whom she came into contact if theyd continued to keep him under observation stayed with him all the way back to england they would have followed him to sydney street and after that all over england not here to marylebone where the papers had been delivered jordan snatched out again not for the documents but for the envelope in which theyd been delivered the recorded delivery sticker belatedly registering now as brightly as if it were in multicoloured neon attomeyatlaw david bartle from brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein had documentary proof of his having received the accusations made against him he couldnt deny the claims had been delivered how had the law firm got this correct address his mind momentarily blocked again then cleared it had to be the carlton hotel not just an hotel a grand hotel in every definition of the accolade one of whose services was permanently holding in its files the names personal details and preferences of its regular clients from their first and succeeding visits a source of information harvey jordan had himself utilized in the past if hed been followed on the return flight from nice instead of being abandoned there and to chelsea his assumed name of peter wightman would have been discovered against comparison with the inevitable french photographs and british police possibly brought in to resolve the mystery of conflicting identities so hed been lucky with a partial escape jordan decided trying to rationalize his problems but partial escape wasnt enough it had to be complete jordan was waiting in the apartment lobby for the arrival the following morning of the attentive doorman john blake who at once confirmed his signing for the recorded delivery of the american letter i guessed it was important thats why i put it on the top of your pile as i told you reminded the doorman they took a note of my name and home address too it was all right my signing for it wasnt it the man had told him remembered jordan and hed tossed the letter along with everything else in a jumbled mess on top of the bureau without bothering to look at it they there was more than one man the balding man shook his head im sorry mr jordan i meant the post office it was the normal postman but id never before seen the receipt form he asked me to sign he said it was important that i had to because it was a legal document shit thought jordan when was that when was it delivered five days ago i did do the right thing didnt i of course you did assured jordan with difficulty where had the package been to whom had it gone for onward delivery in the intervening days from the letterhead date why hadnt the french surveillance carried on to england so much he didnt know couldnt protect himself against im very sorry if i told you nothings wrong stopped jordan could he risk going on hinting at the apprehension he didnt have any alternative so much and so quickly did he have to catch up has anyone more than one person maybe been asking about me john blake frowned uncertainly no youre sure id have remembered mr jordan you know i would yes i do know you would what shall i do say if anyone does come asking questions he had to close the conversation end it tell them that youre not sure about anything that you need to think but get some method of contact like a visiting card and let me have it of course mr jordan you know you can trust me i know that john insisted the man who didnt trust anybody and wasnt sure he could any longer trust himself were not talking anything world shattering i just dont want to miss out on a business deal thats looking good im caught up in a competition i want to win just as they do i understand said the man nodding sagely at the imagined confidence back in his apartment jordan made coffee he didnt want merely occupying the time until offices woke up and became occupied looking down at the bureau and its sleeping so far unused computer tempted to access the appleton and drake website not without more preparation and planning he cautioned himself hed already made too many mistakes allowed too much carelessness every step he took every move he made from now on had to be the correct one thought out and evaluated the thin ice was already creaking underfoot jordan stifled his impatience until nine thirty before telephoning the american embassy in grosvenor square ignoring the recorded single digit invitations to selfselect what he wanted until a human voice came on the line his impatience flared again at the pedantic questioning for his reason to be put through to the legal department but he curbed it again eventually getting a connection without disclosing his name already having a false one ready if he was repeatedly pressed which he wasnt it was a softly spoken southernaccented woman who picked up the receiver frowning at his own realization of the threadbare coverup jordan said he was calling on behalf of an english friend whom it appeared likely was about to become involved in maybe more than one although definitely linked court cases in north carolina he was seeking the name of a london legal firm with experience of american law to which his friend could approach for guidance im afraid we are not allowed to provide that sort of recommendation for the obvious reasons said the woman if the advice of such a recommendation were flawed or in error the american government could lay itself open to separate legal action for damages all im seeking is the name of a legal firm which could provide guidance in a divorce situation pressed jordan sir ive already told you we cannot provide recommendations for any legal opinion of any kind and for that reason we dont hold the names of any english firms qualified to help you the pause was timed or your friend im sorry wait pleaded jordan fearing that the woman was about to ring off do you know any other agency or organization that could help the same caveat applies im afraid youll have to proceed through english legal or government sources there must surely be american law firms with english affiliates like you im sure there must be agreed the woman im afraid we dont have a list of them before replacing the telephone she said have a nice day jordan didnt imagine he would and it was not yet ten in the morning her name was lesley corbin she wore a severe black business suit black framed glasses but no wedding ring which in the circumstances of the meeting didnt interest harvey jordan any more than her suppressed attractiveness the appointment had been arranged by a secretary who hadnt indicated a gender hed wrongly assumed lesley corbin to be a man not a woman yet another mistake to add to his increasing selfcriticising list after further refusals to recommend a suitable law firm for the same reason as the american embassy from the law society and the angloamerican society jordan had chosen the womans firm from waterlows solicitor and barristers directory from which hed chosen his most recent identity theft victim he would have felt more comfortable if lesley corbin had been a man after the briefest of preliminary introductions it took her a full ten minutes which he timed from the sonorously ticking clock on the mantle above an unlit fire to go through the contents of the american letter frequently referring back and forth between the different statements of claim it seemed much longer i expect you to be completely honest answering all my questions she began when she finally looked up of course i will be lied jordan and understand that i am not legally qualified to offer advice on american divorce law that was made clear when i made the appointment what im really seeking is a reference to a firm or a lawyer who can help me in waterlows this firm is described as being international when i called i was told you were their foremost divorce specialist it is and i am but not in divorce matters in the united states with the added complications of linked damages claims in america divorce legislation varies from state to state with state by state bar examinations i know what alienation of affections is but ive no idea what criminal conversation means there was just the slightest of lisps all im seeking is guidance a reference to someone who can help me the woman looked down at the papers strewn around her desk are you married no are you in a relationship that could be construed as a common law marriage no did you seduce alyce appleton no did you sleep with alyce appleton yes we had a brief affair a holiday romance so you seduced her no again refused jordan that makes it sound as if i pursued her persuaded her against her will i didnt force myself upon her she was quite willing eager in fact as you were as i was agreed jordan he hadnt so far had to lie did you know she was married jordan hesitated yes she wore a wedding ring as well as an engagement ring but she told me she was getting a divorce from her husband did she tell you before or after you slept together jordan had to think after she made it sound as if she initiated proceedings against him for his adultery and was getting her own back interrupted the lawyer exactly that he gestured to the papers lying between them on the desk that claim makes it look as if shes the guilty party and im the cause thats precisely what it looks like as its supposed to appear the husbands lawyers are making him out the innocent party its not true before we even got together she spent one morning reading stuff she later told me were divorce papers everything had already been started did she show the divorce papers to you did you read them of course not so she could have been lying the question brought jordan up short no she wouldnt were not talking love here are we were talking a holiday romance of what one two weeks three said jordan with difficulty just over three you plan to keep in touch exchange addresses no so she could have been lying the woman repeated setting you up he didnt get set up thought jordan he had been once but never again he was the person who set other people up i dont think shed do that you got to know her trust her that well in just over three weeks at the end of which you didnt exchange addresses i thought so he was sounding like a complete and utter idiot had been a complete and utter idiot whose idea was it not to exchange addresses hers or yours hers but it couldnt have been a setup could it demanded jordan gesturing again to the papers we were being watched every minute of every day people had to be there already in place ready and waiting which is exactly what they would have been doing if she and her husband planned the whole thing in advance all they needed was the willing victim and you were it no mentally refused jordan he was always the cheater not the cheated it couldnt have happened the other way round why whats the gain lesley shrugged make your own list alyce getting her divorce if she set it up on her own both of them bleeding you dry as well as alyce getting her divorce if they were working together she didnt know if i had any money or not when you met you were staying in a suite at one of the best and most expensive hotels in the south of france and went on staying in them and eating in the best restaurants as mr and mrs jordan with you paying for everything its a reasonable supposition that youve got money i cant believe thats how it is im not saying that it is im just putting it forward as one of several possibilities youre a divorce lawyer an expert challenged jordan yes questioned the woman how many times have you come across the sort of situation youve just suggested three the woman answered at once and im not saying its whats happened to you maybe alfred appleton is vindictive to the point of paranoia ive known that too ok said jordan forcing himself on i accept you cant give me specific advice about american divorce law from state to state but what about jurisdiction what if i ignore that letter and those claims what could a north carolina court do to me against me if you ignore it all you mean queried the woman thats exactly what i mean why did lawyers need the same things said three different ways you got any assets in america property bank accounts anything upon which a lien could be imposed none declared jordan lesley corbin began shuffling the documentation back into order you certainly couldnt in my opinion be forced to respond as if it was something extradictable youll need an american lawyer one whos passed the north carolina bar exams qualifying him to practise in a court there to tell you what happens to the actual divorce application if you dont turn up what worries me is what in this country would be considered contempt of court which gets judges very angry by not turning up the inference is guilt with the detail contained in all these papers weve got to assume that theyve not only got a lot of photographs of you two together but copies of hotel bills affidavits from hotel staff and statements from the yacht charterers further proof of guilt if you dont contest the allegation sufficient maybe for the financial compensation claims to be pursued in your absence whatever happens or doesnt happen to the actual divorce i dont think any judgement against you could be pursued in an english court i need to check but it would certainly be registered in every enforcement authority throughout the entire united states which would mean your never again being able to visit america be on a plane that just touches down on american soil in transit there could be countries canada is the most obvious where there might be civil action reciprocity that would mean you couldnt go to any of those countries either whoever and wherever they are what about publicity public identification broke in jordan impatient again and anxious to resolve his most pressing concern lesley corbin smiled as well as nodding her head precisely what i was leading up to publicity is their his if its not a conspiracy and alfred appleton is acting alone hydrogen bomb you dont go to enter a defence a total refutation they dont just blow you to smithereens they evaporate you again we need american law guidance but ive seen youve seen im sure enough publicity exposures on television and in newspapers here in england to know you could face the equivalent of being hanged drawn and quartered by publicity the physical reaction had long gone beyond shivering coldness harvey jordan now felt empty disembowelled as if just such medieval justice had been exacted upon him without sufficient consideration he blurted out and too late realized this was another mistake im trapped no way out theres always a way out said the more controlled woman were talking now about maximum damage limitation avoiding if we can the sackcloth and ashes exposure thats going to make you a public humiliated figure in england and america thats got to be a gross exaggeration jordan protested you want to expose yourself to as little as a fifth of it not a tenth of it what do you want me to do stop it happening stop any of it happening insisted jordan god does miracles i just do the best i can do the very best you can in his worst nightmare jordan had never imagined come close to contemplating that he could be trapped like this again but hed recovered before hed recover again and not just recover punish again too six the following day continued to be unreal jordan remaining aware of watching everything around him but having no contributory part or involvement in any of it as if he were part of a ghost movie in which the character can see and hear and participate but cant be seen or heard by anyone else which was in fact how he wished his life could revert to how it was before but couldnt any longer by the day after he was a long way towards recovery harvey jordan reborn the all thinking all calculating aheadofthegame operator but not totally recovered to have believed that and tried to convince himself of it would have been ridiculous absurd to have even begun to think that hed become complacent careless not thinking clearly or properly enough just because hed had it too easy for too long not any more this was his wakeup call at klaxondecibel level hed get out of it even if he didnt at this precise moment know how hed minimize it to the point of no longer being dangerously exposed and hed never again relax as he had relaxed maybe even cut himself away from places he knew so well where too many people knew him so well to find a new and different vacation spot not just one several move around the caribbean and the far east and the pacific not bother any more just briefly being known and favoured and wherever it was enjoy the readily and always available ghilanes of the world this was all reassuring necessary thinking for the future but there were more immediately pressing and essential practicalities his antennae tuned to its maximum sensitivity despite every indication that the surveillance had stopped in france jordan set out to once more become and remain mr invisible it was instinct to set his intrusion traps but he did not emerge on to the pavement from his apartment block until he could see the yellow flag of an empty taxi to take him to the rail terminal at waterloo alert to everyone in the queue behind him to buy a ticket to basingstoke he disembarked just two stops down the line at clapham remaining on the platform until it cleared of the four others who got off there as well recognizing no one from the earlier queue he took a waiting taxi to sloane square a long enough journey upon which to isolate any following cab which he didnt and went underground there but only took one station west changing from the district to the piccadilly line at victoria to loop east as far as green park for lunch at the wolseley at a table specifically reserved for its uninterrupted view of the only public entrance into the restaurant he did not suspect anyone of showing any specific interest in him throughout the meal conscious of how many observers must have been involved in the surveillance of himself and alyce in france jordan didnt detect any brief signals between people entering or leaving the restaurant during what might be a change of possible observation shifts he had the bell captain order a taxi that was waiting for him at the kerbside when he left altering the given destination of euston as the taxi was travelling north up regent street and reached the newly rented service apartment in hans crescent just before pm waiting there for him were all the credit and store cards one from harrods which he could see from the apartment window credit reference file replies and pin and atm withdrawal numbers everything hed applied for in the name of plastic surgeon paul maculloch jordan put it all in his combinationlocked briefcase pausing at the moment of leaving to look around the flat he was never going to use thinking how comfortable his brief stay there might have been john blake hurried from behind his reception desk the moment jordan entered the marylebone apartment block no ones enquired after you all day the man reported at once there havent been any telephone calls either im hoping to hear something soon said jordan caught by how honest he was continuing to be all the intrusion traps inside the apartment were undisturbed jordan was on the verge of shredding everything in paul macullochs name when a sudden need to keep the rental overtook him a warming and satisfying confirmation that he had definitely recovered from the understandable shock of the recent news it still took the increasingly confident jordan an hour to minutely shred most of what hed accumulated to pass himself off as paul maculloch and which now had a very important although quite different purpose at the end of that hour he was left with a copy of the mans birth certificate parental marriage certificates passport proof of rental occupancy of the hans crescent apartment and a single al credit reference file with difficulty he managed to get it all into the already overcrammed bedroom concealed safe in the closet containing in varying denominations the profit from his countrywide tour as peter wightman there would be substantial inroads into that jordan accepted his mind now fully concentrated upon the financial cost with which he was confronted the short let and now very necessary rental of hans crescent would amount to which objectively he didnt begrudge as a complete loss the further hed spent getting all the maculloch credit information wasnt totally wasted either the big uncertainty although objectively again perhaps not the biggest was how much all the legal advice was going to cost him this was why he had to bury the taxfree profit from fifteen years of identity stealing as deeply and as untraceably as possible harvey jordan had left lesley corbin with the understanding that she would find an american attorney fully licensed and qualified to protect and if necessary represent him at every degree and level of every linked north carolina claim and as he insisted on the best he would have to wait for her to come back to him after a careful selection jordan hadnt waited upon the convenience of others for more years than he could remember and had already decided not to allow lesley corbin more than one more full day before calling her back irrespective of any agreement but now he needed the time maybe even more than one day to keep things in the satisfactorily protective sequence he had to establish while he was still at school jordan had mentally tested himself and invariably won against chipspeeded computers to work out complicated arithmetical percentages and currency fluctuations and aggregates and from his early programming career concentrating on internet gambling games he knew to the last penny the amount of his carefully hoarded and hopefully totally hidden fortune the majority of it was beyond investigative reach in the taxavoiding and secret haven of jersey the largest of the channel islands to which he could literally carry cases of cash on the short sea crossing from england without any danger from putting hand baggage through xray airport security checks the current untraceable amount in safe deposit boxes in the islands capital st helier was in addition in separate boxes was the chagall painting an assortment of seventeen uncut and unset but officially provenanced diamonds and three diamondset antique bracelets which conservatively building in the fluctuations of jewellery prices brought the stash up to jordan intended this stash short of physical imprisonment which lesley corbin insisted impossible to remain untouched and officially unplundered whatever the outcome of his current predicament the risk despite leslie corbins assurances was closer to home in london at coutts lloyds tsb and natwest there were bank accounts none of which exceeded maintained for the access to safe deposit facilities at all three and in which was spread close to which hed looked forward to increasing to more than by distributing among them the profit from the most recent sting but jordan didnt think he could do this any longer because all three accounts and safe deposit facilities were in his genuine name against his genuine marylebone address which was known to the litigious alfred jerome appleton and his bulldozing legal team of brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein all this had to be kept from appleton and his lawyers despite whatever financial recovery opinion was offered by lesley corbin who had already freely admitted being unqualified in americanenglish exchange agreement law jordan quit his boobytrapped apartment even earlier the following morning using the rushhour congestion to ensure he was not followed he spent an entire cabandtube dodging hour before finally arranging from a public street telephone a meeting in the name of paul maculloch with royston and jones a private bank in leadenhall street in the financial square mile of the city of london it was the sort of interview with which jordan was thoroughly familiar every document supporting his maculloch identity ready when it was demanded he opened the maculloch account with below the amount legally required to be officially reported under drug trafficking legislation from his most recent expedition and was promised that the safe deposit facilities would be available as early as the following day because of the advantages of it being a private bank which was precisely why jordan had chosen it his personally appointed manager hoped it was the beginning of a long association and jordan said he hoped so too there was still no waiting message from lesley corbin when he returned to marylebone for which jordan was grateful and from which he left the following morning again before recognized office hours by ten jordan was sure once more that he remained unaccompanied and unwatched and by eleven opened the first of his deposit boxes at royston and jones with the contents of all but each from what had been in safe deposit in lloyds tsb and natwest he left in coutts in the second exchange that afternoon he was back in marylebone in time to return lesley corbins waiting message telling her he had an early appointment the following day and couldnt get to her until the afternoon which she said would be perfect because shed set up a conference call exchange with a lawyer in new york where it would still only be morning i finally managed to get the names of two lawyers qualified to appear in north carolina courts oddly both now have firms working in new york the first was daniel beckwith the other is david bartle who dan knows has been engaged to represent appleton so we dont have a choice no how good is beckwith the recommendation said he was very good thats all ive got to go by if he wasnt i guess hed still be practising in north carolina i hope youre right accepted jordan will you run the best check you can on him of course unsure how much ready cash he might need in the immediate future the next morning jordan broke an until now unbreakable rule and left in his apartment safe putting the rest as well as all the paul maculloch identity documents and passport in the royston and jones vaults before noon it left him enough time for lunch at the conveniently close joe allens in covent garden where he drank one gin martini and ordered a hamburger wondering if it would be a diet to which he would become accustomed in the coming weeks he hoped not but it easily could have been if jordan chose jordan arrived early to be told that daniel beckwith to whom he was going to talk by telephone linkup was the senior partner in the firm of beckwith pryke and samuelson whose offices on lexington avenue were two block across and two down from those of david bartle on madison avenue lesley corbin insisted that beckwith was one of the best attorneys in manhattan and therefore one of the most expensive an hour with additional daily courtroom refreshers i didnt ask about with a ninety percent success rate for his clients im looking for a percent in my case ive already emailed him a full account of our discussion said the woman who was again dressed in black which jordan decided had to be her working uniform im grateful for what youre doing thanked jordan sincerely an unusual emotion for him its what you engaged me to do she reminded what did he say think i mean he knows the other lawyer which is hardly surprising as they both qualified in raleigh north carolina when dan and i spoke he said he and bartle liked to play hardball id already worked that out for myself did he think that appleton had a case all hes got is what i told him which obviously isnt enough to give an opinion it wont be until you hire him if you hire him and he gets all the papers from the other side we havent really begun yet maybe even wasnt going to be enough jordan thought did he say he started but was stopped by the jar of the telephone lesley corbin cupped the receiver with a hand and said its the new york call the switchboard are holding it the speaker phones are in the boardroom jordan followed her into the adjoining room and took the seat she indicated the red light on the speaker in front of him clicked on when she fitted her telephone receiver into its master holder set up in front of where she sat she said morning dan harveys here with me afternoon lesley afternoon harv came a relaxed american voice good morning said jordan it was the first time he had ever used such equipment and he felt selfconscious on it he hated the abbreviation of his name ive read what lesley mailed me might need to expand upon it a little today thisll be pro bono the timer starts if you decide to engage me beckwiths voice was very measured every word carefully enunciated seeing the frown on the face of the man who had always avoided any contact with the law lesley corbin mouthed no charge jordan said thats very good of you im very anxious to sort it all out it reads like theyre driving an express train at me thats exactly what its meant to read like said the american dont let it frighten you which is also what its meant to do lets go through a few things alienation of affection i understand although i dont think i am guilty of it said jordan what the hell is criminal conversations potentially the most expensive lay you ever had said beckwith it used to be on every statute in every state and made the female spouse a chattel of the husband which was why its been struck off in most states now your bad luck is that it still exists in north carolina the state in which appleton and alyce were married and therefore the state in which appleton is bringing suit because it still exists there obviously said beckwith how much is potentially very expensive thousands or millions millions youre joking theres nothing amusing about being accused of alienation of affections and criminal conversation in north carolina what can i do talk some more said the american lesleys notes told me these divorce proceedings had already been initiated before you began this affair with alyce thats what alyce told me but you had slept together before she told you jordan felt hot with embarrassment aware of the woman studying him from across the table and wondered if he was actually colouring yes but before it started id seen her writing upon signing i suppose a lot of documents she later told me were divorce papers but you didnt actually see them know for yourself that they were divorce papers no lesley told me you thought of it as a vacation romance that you didnt even exchange addresses when she flew back here to new york thats what i did still do regard it as and no we didnt exchange addresses you often have vacation romances harv jordan hesitated ive had them before yes often jordan shifted uncomfortably in his seat lesley corbin was expressionless on the other side of the table two or three times its not a crime is it according to section of north carolina law thats exactly what it is reminded the american lawyer you never kept in touch with any of the others no lets hope alfred appletons detective agency hasnt found any of them remarked beckwith why demanded jordan i dont see how they could have found anyone with whom i had an affair in the past but i dont see the point of your saying what you just have youre probably not going to see the point of a hell of a lot youre going to be asked before all this is over harv youve read the claims you know where theyre coming from youre accused of being a home wrecker a womanizing rich guy it would help appletons case a whole lot if he could produce another wronged abandoned woman i didnt abandon alyce appleton or anyone else i met in the circumstances were discussing it was a passing thing for both of us thats why we didnt swop numbers or addresses its not the way it happens youre sounding angry harv indignant i am indignant and angry ok and angry something that happens all the time not hurting anyone is being blown up out of all proportion into my being responsible for the crime of this or any other century ok harv i think weve taken it far enough maybe it was a little unfair what the ive been testing you out in case you do engage me and if you do weve got a whole bunch of work to do getting you ready it took me about thirty seconds sixty tops to make you lose your temper and start trying to justify yourself you lose your temper in a court in which youre accused of wrecking another guys marriage try to justify what you did and say its no big deal because no one got hurt youre a dead man you understand what im telling you yes said jordan meek voiced but still angry i still think it was a shitty trick beckwith laughed sounding genuinely amused us lawyers got bagfuls of shitty tricks if we go forwards youre going to have to learn every one of them so you dont get caught out again and what ive just done wasnt entirely a trick you sounded just right to convince me that you believe yourself the fall guy lesley set out some questions youd raised about jurisdiction can you answer them asked jordan eagerly in a nutshell i hope any decision or verdict reached in a north carolina divorce court couldnt be exacted against you personally in england if you chose to ignore the claims and didnt turn up the inference however would be that everything alleged against you has a basis of truth and i know lesley has warned you how judges feel if they consider they are being treated with contempt yes and lesleys right about the possible use of publicity you duck and run you stand the very real almost inevitable chance of having your skin nailed to the barn door for everyone to see you fight it and we knock away the foundations of every claim and allegation one by one youre a guy whos done what thousands of married guys and married gals are doing right now even as we speak and appleton loses not you but heres a very necessary warning this particular divorce legislation in this particular state is an absolute bastard everything in favour of the plaintiff if i contest it i have to come to new york and north carolina to face everything down like the wrongly accused man that you are id like you to represent me and defend me against this action decided jordan formally and id like to do it accepted beckwith i want all the original correspondence from bartle couriered to me today if possible so that i can issue an official response ill courier my contractual terms and conditions back to be completed with you by lesley who can also take a preliminary personal statement telling me all about you and when weve got the wheels turning we can meet here in new york everything will obviously be decided in raleigh the capital of north carolina ill handle everything from this end promised the woman i think its been a good meeting so do i said the american dont you harvey she encouraged very good indeed said jordan recognizing his first lie but knowing there were going to be a lot more i really did think it went well said lesley corbin as she disconnected the telephone link i wasnt very comfortable admitted jordan men never are when theyre caught in public with their trousers down women neither she said and smiled youd better get used to it harvey its going to get a hell of a lot more embarrassing what youve got to hope is that its contained within the four walls of a closed divorce court seven after the constant bustle of the weeks beginning particularly the dodging and weaving that started off each day harvey jordan welcomed his first opportunity to remain the following morning in his flat his next appointment with lesley corbin not until the afternoon but it wasnt a chance to relax the opposite in fact the forthcoming meeting was to provide the personal information the american lawyer had asked for during their transatlantic telephone conversation and jordan recognized how well and how carefully he had to evaluate but most importantly of all not to forget anything and everything he told the woman jordan worked hard to convince himself that after going through most of his life successfully being somebody else it shouldnt be overwhelmingly difficult for him to keep his story straight but it had been a bad mistake not to realize how he was being ensnared in france and he was determined against any further disasters most definitely in any courtroom setting where any information he provided today could be publicly challenged and shown to be a lie overnight questions that he should have asked were essential he ask daniel beckwith or at least obtain guidance from lesley corbin crowded in upon him and jordan spent the morning listing them prompted as he did so to add others the biggest imponderable factor was what exactly the american enquiries in france had discovered and which could be put to him it was also vital that he remember everything he had told alyce appleton whom it was logical to assume would have told her legal team and with which he could be confronted either by her or her husbands lawyers thered been his lie that he was independently wealthy from a family inheritance which he successfully utilized as a venture capitalist investor and the sympathyseeking improvization built around his divorce beckwith hadnt minimized the financial implications of the damages claims which made his income and its source directly relevant none of which jordan could substantiate beyond the returns accepted by the british inland revenue as a professional gambler jordan couldnt imagine the lost love of his life nonsense being introduced in any court examination or record except for its connection with his supposed occupation and income but it was something not to ignore but rather to be explained away if it were raised he couldnt think of any awkward personal information in the south of france apart from his address lodged at the carlton hotel in cannes which appletons side appeared already to have obtained by which he could be confronted neither did he imagine any of his previous conquests about whom beckwith had questioned him being traced he couldnt himself remember all of their names and hed determinedly avoided being photographed with or by any of them alyce hadnt carried a camera and shunned the approaches from any of the restaurant photographers as forcefully as he had although there were those that hed already anticipated having been snatched of them together and hed paid every bill in cash the deposit for the car rental going against his hotel bill jordan was at lesley corbins chancery lane office fifteen minutes before the appointed time his query list memorized but in his inside pocket if he needed any reminders together with all the official personal documents shed asked him the previous day to bring which he had although reluctantly professionally aware of their illegal usefulness the package daniel beckwith had couriered from new york appeared the same size as he remembered alyce appleton completing at the hotel although substantially thicker topped by a copy of the lawyers terms and conditions of engagement ive never heard of agreeing contracts with lawyers said jordan it was one of the questions on his list the woman shrugged its sometimes done here between solicitors and barristers on behalf of clients maybe its to do with the particular circumstances of this situation different jurisdictions and regulations in different countries in addition to different american states being involved ive gone through it i didnt find any reason why you shouldnt sign its as much for your protection in an american court as it is for his being paid his fees you think theyre reasonable seized jordan wanting to concentrate on finance as quickly as possible i warned you about costs reminded the woman the court refreshers are a day what cant be quantified at the moment from what beckwith provided or what he hasnt yet been provide with from the other sides is exactly how many days the case might take its obviously a contested case you contesting the claims against you presumably as alyce will be doing even if they are conniving so it definitely wont be a short hearing give me a ballpark figure demanded jordan impossible refused the lawyer you want to do some sums on the back of an envelope allow a month she paused a minimum of a month presuming the court wont sit on a saturday or sunday that will be something like in court refreshers alone and theres the hourly for all the preliminary consultations added lesley therell also be search fees impossible at this stage to estimate and if youre going to have to go back and forth possibly several times and pay hotel bills while youre in new york and raleigh youve got to calculate travel and living expenses also impossible to estimate and my fees and expenses which i havent got around to thinking about yet thats why i cant give you a ballpark guess but i did warn you that it wasnt going to be cheap what if all the claims are dismissed that ive been forced to defend myself against marriage destroying allegations that arent justified in this country a judge would have the discretion to apportion costs according to culpability ill raise it with dan when i respond to all the stuff hes sent over for us to complete today but youve got to bear in mind that you did sleep with her and that you knew she was a married woman that was surely her decision i said ill raise it with dan you ready to start on his stuff thats what im here for the woman isolated a document several pages thick and said ok lets learn all we can about harvey william jordan she smiled up you brought your birth certificate as i asked you his hesitation at handing it across the desk to her was instinctive at parting with such an essential tool of his trade what is it she frowned i dont particularly like surrendering personal documents the frown remained itll be copied here today like all the other stuff he wants and couriered in the possession of a messenger from the time it leaves here until its handed over to dans firm in new york another silly lapse jordan thought selfcritically sure stupid of me ive not been involved in anything like this before we have to know with supporting details what you do for a living she went on i need to understand something said jordan coming to the most highlighted note on his reminder list therell be lawyers acting separately for alyce as well as those acting for appleton and dan acting for me right yes the woman agreed curiously i read somewhere that statements are exchanged between lawyers in advance of cases beginning jordan was inwardly churning at having a lie to explain away thats the system are facts checked before cases begin so that they can be contested in court if theyre doubted the frown came back sometimes whats your problem i told alyce i was a venture capitalist from a family inheritance and youre not im a gambler announced jordan the vocation long accepted by the british tax authorities you mean you dont have a job an occupation or a business that thats all you do gamble professionally yes but its not as easy as you seem to imagine to succeed as a professional gambler youve got to win more than you lose as i do why didnt you tell her what you really did i thought venture capitalist sounded better i guess jordan said as he shrugged wishing what he was telling lesley corbin sounded better the agreement with the british tax authorities had taken almost three years but always through correspondence never personal encounters like this verbally it didnt sound very convincing jordan had perfected a method of providing what the british inland revenue finally recognized as legal proof of income but needed to know if it would be accepted by an american court and american lawyers even if it was it was going to require great more physical effort and a lot more dodging and weaving to avoid it being discovered that he was duplicating to satisfy two not just one demand he wished he could better gauge lesley corbins thoughts from the quizzical expression on her face you make enough from gambling to live at the best hotels for months at a time as you did in france she pressed it fluctuates i havent starved so far because i very rarely wager any actual money he thought she was never going to accept it shed see through it as a lie and a bad one at that as if through polished glass dan wants some financial information she said flatly i guessed he might said jordan constantly bemused by his unusual honesty heavily he went on i cant produce audited books if you know what i mean the woman smiled as jordan hoped she would or income tax returns i could produce copies of those jordan promised glad hed taken duplicates to remind himself from year to year so there are tax accepted records if theyre demanded id prefer them not to be admitted jordan edging forward lets leave official interest for the moment she said i could accept a cash deposit to be held in a client account she wasnt going to challenge him it was going to work information of which will be made available only to america its only applicable and required by america she pointed out i will accept your cash deposit as i am verbally accepting your instructions i am not required to know anything more about a source of that cash thats dans responsibility i will talk personally by telephone to dan not set out the question by letter and when you get to new york youll need to talk in more detail to him weve got to keep in mind how important it is to minimize any publicity do you understand very clearly assured jordan as im sure you understood my concern how much will you want that deposit to be thats what ill talk to dan about im glad were having this conversation to cover as many eventualities as possible is why were having this conversation im feeling more comfortable about it now how easily those who practised law were prepared to bend it maybe becoming a lawyer would be his next career change when i speak to dan hell want to know if you can adequately defend the action financially i mean i can because ultimately i wont be paying the money thought jordan the decision hardening in his mind he had a lot to set up as soon as he got to america if he got to america well need to meet meet not even talk on the phone after ive spoken to him i understand hed been lucky finding lesley corbin jordan hoped it was another omen lesley flicked the edge of the document from which she was working this is very much a pro forma dan will need more in these new circumstances how do you gamble on what i mean professional gamblers dont gamble lectured jordan they only ever put their money on certainties dont go polemic on me what do you gamble on where do you gamble high stake rooms at casinos poker blackjack roulette backgammon he said reciting the games hed been one of the first to programme for internet use horses too ive got the maximum premium bond block which in the four years ive held it has produced a return of an additional i consider that a gamble but definitely not the lottery the odds arent good for anyone i think it would be wise for us to be careful said lesley lecturing in return the law is that receipted proof of casino profits can be issued for tax purposes i presume you provide those with your tax returns jordan only just stopped himself laughing outright at being told of the system hed bled dry for so long some the woman smiled again well maybe need some as many as you can produce insisted lesley supported by dates places and amounts for horse race winnings well need courses the actual names of horses winning slips if they can be kept the duplication of which jordan had anticipated im sure i can manage that start collecting them from now on i dont want you unable to face a challenge about income source i will see if ive got anything hanging around as well promised the man who never left anything financial hanging around what weve talked about so far makes a lot of dans other questions irrelevant at this time decided the woman going back to her list im going to leave the occupation question blank until ive talked to dan youre the lawyer and am i glad he thought you are not married lesley started again briskly no have you ever been divorced a long time ago youve got the papers to prove that yes said jordan uneasily children no are you in a relationship that makes you responsible for any dependants no do you suffer any permanent illness or disease what questioned jordan surprised you had sexual relations with a married woman according to what dan has set out here if you are suffering from aids or any sexually transmittable disease you didnt tell alyce about before you entered into a relationship you could be criminally charged with assault as well as giving alfred appleton grounds for several additional claims murder or manslaughter even if alyce becomes infected with aids from which she subsequently died i am not suffering from aids or any other sexually transmitted disease that will have to be attested by a sworn medical statement youre joking i thought wed agreed there is nothing amusing about the circumstances in which you find yourself ill arrange the tests ive already made your appointment for eleven oclock tomorrow in harley street a dr preston thank you how close jordan wondered would dr prestons consulting rooms be to those of plastic surgeon paul maculloch whose stolen identity was proving to be so useful although not in the way originally intended did you give or exchange gifts with alyce appleton no exchange addresses you know we didnt for the record no did she provide any details of her husbands business she told me he was a commodity dealer the rest was for him to find out jordan promised himself thats a generalization she didnt specify just told me the name of the firm appleton and drake did you independently enquire into what they specifically traded i had no reason i wasnt interested but now i am mentally added jordan how long would it take him to find out all that he needed about appleton and drake did you have any prior knowledge of or about alyce appleton i dont understand that question protested jordan its not difficult retorted lesley corbin the common thread through every claim appleton is making is that youve intentionally stolen his wife jordan was momentarily halted by the irony i do not steal other mens wives neither am i a gigolo that wasnt part of the question but ill include it in your answer it might be apposite did you know before you began the affair that alyce appleton was rich harvey jordans hesitation now was to keep his reply as honest as possible following the golden precept that the fewer the lies the fewer there were to remember and by which to be trapped cautiously he replied her jewellery was obviously expensive and she was staying in a suite in an expensive hotel but then so was i i didnt pick her out for either of those reasons i didnt pick her out at all we got into conversation things developed as things developed with other women before according to what youve already told me already told dan youre making me sound like a gigolo remember what dan said about training you to respond properly to questions look upon this as an early lesson questions can be phrased to make you lose your temper which you came close to doing there i did not get into conversation with alyce appleton because i thought she was rich nor to take advantage if she were rich said jordan pedantically i paid for every hotel room meal and yacht trip we shared you got receipted bills in your name for christs sake thats not an answer no i do not have receipted bills in my name credit card counterfoils i paid for everything in cash i thought id already told you that the woman looked up from her documents everything in cash that surprises me in this day and age of convenient plastic im not part of this day and age of convenient plastic only other peoples plastic came the thought she grinned briefly at the continuing pedantry which brings me to a financial question i forgot what debts outstanding or unpaid credit or store card liabilities or financial court orders do you have against you none lesley came up to him again none thats what i said what about a mortgage or car finance or overdrafts i own my apartment in marylebone outright i do not have a car or any overdrafts she shook her head thats amazing thats how it is how i choose to live professional gamblers really dont gamble do they not this one lesley corbin moved on to another document in the american pack as well as the birth certificate weve already talked about dan wants at least three photographs of you a copy of your parents marriage certificate and a copy of your passport and now weve got to add your divorce papers she looked up again have you brought it all as i asked ive brought them but i want to know why he wants it all im just relaying the request lesley said dan wouldnt have asked if it wasnt necessary like i said its all going to be couriered so it will all be safe as he handed each item over jordan said the exchange of statements from the other sides will i be shown them before the case inevitably dan will take you through them thats the whole purpose of an exchange to isolate factual errors or outright lies so well be able to gauge whether theyre working together to set me up i only mentioned that as a possibility and im beginning to wish i hadnt because thats all it is and quite an unlikely one at that said the lawyer if it is and dan can prove it thats you off any divorce or alienation of affection hook and all the other damages claims which is the good news the bad news could be that it would establish a case for attempted deception which would make it a crime to be heard in a criminal court with you as the major prosecution witness and would almost inevitably attract the publicity back here you want to avoid jordan walked directly down chancery lane crossed fleet street into el vino and huddled himself into the furthest corner of the back bar with a large glass of chablis not so much to drink as to justify his occupation of the secluded table his feelings during the conference with lesley cordin had gone up and down like an elevator finishing at ground or even basement level he realistically supposed that it didnt even come close to the exchanges that were to follow his first lesson the woman had called it but it had been far worse than hed expected his high point had been lesleys acceptance of where his income came from but as their conversation and her demands for evidence progressed hed objectively realized that lawyers representing someone as determined as alfred appleton appeared to be wouldnt believe it so readily as she had whether or not there was any connivance between the commodity trader and his wife despite lesleys repeated insistence that she had been offering the most outside of all outside possibilities which she now regretted jordan had clung to the hope of it being dramatically proven in court to provide his absolute guiltfree salvation which now it couldnt be his lowest point was lesley corbins easy but unarguable illustration of how a finding of collusion could result in a criminal prosecution with an even greater risk of the publicity he was so desperate to avoid the worst feeling of all was of being incarcerated in an evertightening constricting straightjacket from which he couldnt and wouldnt be able to escape suffocation harvey jordan immediately recognized the selfpity that had brought him down before and didnt want wouldnt allow again he hoped lesley corbin had been right about there always being a way out and that the way he had in mind would materialize he really did have a lot to do to make it work eight since the legal tightening up of the moneylaundering legislation demanding proof of cash receipts and profits most directly targeted against the proceeds from drug trafficking it had become much more difficult for harvey jordan to operate his well established and so far foolproof scheme to obtain tax evidence of his supposed income when he had first embarked upon his career casinos had been far more casual than they were now monitoring the big chip purchases against money paid out when those same chips were cashed in in the much mourned early days jordan had been able to buy worth of chips with the stolen identity money then move from the most crowded tables too frequently for any one croupier or pit boss to remember the minimal stakes he placed against what he won or lost he would then return to the caisse to get a tax receipt for all but a little of what hed changed in the first place jordan estimated he actually did win on fifty percent of his casino outings always betting evens and every time he did it represented a bonus since the legislation jordan believed he had isolated the casinos that noted the chippurchasing amounts against the money reclaimed which had greatly reduced his choice and made getting the necessary paperwork that much harder and now he was confronted with a demand to at least double possibly even treble his receipt collecting to satisfy not just his well organized and regulated return to the english inland revenue but an american court and its assembled lawyers if a source were demanded for the cash he was to deposit with lesley corbins firm for the forthcoming divorce hearing jordan reassurred himself that he could overcome the casino difficulties from horse racing by visiting some courses without making any effort to evade the still feared surveillance he could also actually prove to the opposing american legal teams that he genuinely was a professional gambler by buying betting slips from oncourse bookmakers in full public and hopefully photographed view and milling around them again at the end of a race he would appear to be collecting his winnings whether there were any or not and which was immaterial all he needed was the date place race title and name of the winning horse and to insist if he were challenged that he hadnt been able to retain the slip he would though keep those with which he did coincidentally win it was going to involve a lot of late nights and a considerable amount of travelling even if he restricted himself to race meetings conveniently around london which he couldnt do all the time because as hed told lesley a professional gambler only followed certainties and until the american ordeal was over his role had to be that of a very visible and successful professional punter not that of someone whose identity he had stolen that reflection physically stopped jordan half dressed in preparation for another unwelcome and unwanted day realistically nothing was more important than what was happening or about to happen in america and his doing everything possible to reduce whatever damage might come from it but he had no idea how long it was going to be before it was resolved however whenever it might be resolved to his benefit but until it was he couldnt begin to think about any further identity thefts it could he supposed be as long as a year which made it the most frightening uncertainty of all and it hadnt even been on his list of questions to ask lesley corbin or daniel beckwith again unsettlingly harvey jordan felt the tightness of the slowly crushing straightjacket he now found himself in dr james preston was a small electrichaired man who fussed nervously around his disordered office his unbuttoned white coat flapping about him like startled wings head jerking constantly about him in an apparent search for something mislaid or forever lost not looking at jordan he said youve got some notes samples neither said jordan the appointment was made by my solicitor lesley corbin its for a legal case legal case demanded the venerealogist frowning directly at jordan for the first time in america offered jordan the man flustered through a hamsters den of papers on his desk finally coming up with a confirming official letter from lesley corbin looking up again he said hiv negative or positive any venereal infection to prove i am not suffering from anything jordan supposed he should be amused by the shambling mad doctor imagery but he wasnt as lesley had reminded him the previous day there was nothing amusing in the situation in which he found himself preston stared from beneath his upright shock of pure white hair you think you have caught something its to guarantee that i havent infected someone anyone ah exclaimed the man in final understanding he went back to the appointment slip it doesnt say he said as if offering an explanation of his own thats what its for you suffered from anything in the past no its possible for me to find a trace if you have i havent insisted jordan youre sure positive have you got any discharge irritation rashes need to pass water frequently no no symptoms if those are the symptoms you sure positive sighed jordan again why the hell had lesley corbin picked this man whens the last time you had a full medical examination ive never had a full medical examination whos your regular doctor from whom i can obtain your records and case notes ill need you to sign the authority for me to ask for them of course i dont have a regular doctor the whitehaired head came up again what do you do if you are ill im never ill if i were id go to a hospital to have a regular doctor meant records being created and invisible men didnt have records this is for court purposes yes ill need to give you a full medical as well as giving you the specific examination thats been asked for i cant do one without the other why dont you do that and get it over with demanded jordan impatiently jordan later decided he wouldnt have agreed so readily if hed known it was going to take almost three hours he had to supply five phials for all the necessary blood tests and two for urine examination as well as a faeces sample there were two sets of chest and lower body xrays and his blood pressure and rate was tested not just by an arm cuff but on a treadmill meter his lung capacity was measured by his blowing into an asthma tube and his vision to the very bottom line of the alphabet chart although a prostrate assessment was ticked on one of the blood test cards the doctor also insisted upon a rubber gloved anal examination which was a great deal more uncomfortable than with the later narrower colostomy probe the final fortyfive minutes was a verbal exchange to discover any illnesses or complaints jordan could have conceivably suffered during his remembered childhood up to that day whether or not it had required doctor or hospital consultation followed by a determined effort by preston to complete a medical history of jordans parents at the end the doctor said i think youre the only person ive ever examined who never suffered a single childhood illness nor has needed any medical advice since i guess ive been lucky and youre sure you cant remember a single illness from which your parents suffered seems ive inherited their healthy genes what were the causes of their deaths they died together in a car crash said jordan which was a lie his father had died first of cancer and his alzheimersafflicted mother of pneumonia but jordan was bored and impatient to end the pointless encounter youre responsible for payment i assume wrongly said jordan whod anticipated the approach your secretary will have the name and address of the lawyer who booked this if its not on the note youve got there send your account to her along with the results preston was on the internal phone before jordan finished speaking his face clouding at the confirmation of what jordan had told him the doctor said solicitors are very dilatory in settling their accounts will you please tell ms corbin that i expect payment within the period stipulated upon my invoice of course said jordan without any intention of doing so you didnt tell me how my examination went i have obviously to wait for all the tests results but theres every indication of your being remarkably fit nothing obviously wrong at all apart from you knowing and a record now existing of every physical detail about me thought jordan the irritating medical examination for which hed allowed only an hour completely disrupted jordans schedule leaving him with only thirty minutes to keep the afternoon appointment with the photographer in the taxi taking him there jordan decided to abandon until the following morning the intended visit to hans crescent to check for any further correspondence in his paul maculloch name he was anxious to begin at once his moneymanipulating casino tour jordan had booked for passport photographs waiting until he got to the studio to add three larger prints and agreed at once to the obviously increase fee interested only in getting the picture session over as quickly as possible he was back in the marylebone apartment by six and out showered changed and with from the bedroom closet safe to begin the chipsforcash receipt switch by eight for an hour he played poker at the high stakes table of one of his favourite gambling clubs in brook street mayfair before quitting ahead to move to the roulette room there he moved between three tables increasing his winnings by another before dropping in an unstoppable consistent slide by the time it did stop he was down to his poker profit it took him another hour playing blackjack to take his winnings up a further he cashed in and got his tax receipt for winnings of throughout jordan remained constantly alert but failed to isolate anyone paying any particular attention or interest in him jordan hesitated for a moment as he left the club turning to the doorman for a taxi but abruptly deciding without any reason to walk into park lane when he reached park street the darkened interior of the last car in the parking line at the corner was briefly illuminated in the headlight beam of an approaching taxi perfectly enabling jordan to see a man he remembered at every table at which hed played that night nine b eing followed lesley corbin frowned but smiled very slightly as well the combination made her nose wrinkle i believe so said jordan discomfited by her doubting expression when how did you come to believe that three nights ago id been gambling in mayfair when i came out of the club i saw a man waiting in his car hed been in every room in which id played during the evening watching you i hadnt been aware inside i only recognized him outside in the car what else thats it said jordan further discomfited by the emptiness of what he was saying he had abandoned the intention to go to hans crescent and that night returned to the same mayfair club where hed lost almost he didnt see the man in the club or isolate anyone waiting in a car when hed left to take the same route to park lane for a taxi the woman wasnt frowning any more but the smile was hovering you havent thought youve been followed since i havent been aware of it qualified jordan they watched me pretty effectively in france without my suspecting it dont forget do you think theyve begun some sort of surveillance here lesley humped her shoulders they could have although i would have thought theyve already got all they need for their case as far as the adultery is concerned so im becoming paranoid the smile widened i didnt say that or think it they might have decided its necessary now that dans got involved and confirmed youre going to contest the accusations could you ask him what he thinks i dont like the idea of my every move being watched she hunched her shoulders again theres nothing we can really do about it if they are its an unsettling feeling hed have to check hans crescent tomorrow jordan realized by now thered probably be something from his new city bank if nothing else in the name of paul maculloch its not actually against the law although if you could prove it we could apply for a harassment order proving it would be a problem and attract publicity to the case in america which we dont really want do we well leave it decided jordan thats probably best agreed the lawyer ive got more from dan and ive got the medical report and the photographs and i very definitely want to talk about preston declared jordan i want to talk about preston too said lesley youd better listen to me first you first about everything agreed jordan he saw that lesley corbin had several separated sets of paper arranged in front of her on her desk she selected the smallest of the files dans emails therell definitely need to be what he calls a financial lodgement in view of what you do for a living hes talking of an initial tranche of which ive roughly converted to around she looked up is that all right if you mean can i provide that much in cash the answers yes but on the understanding we reached earlier not just a trip to hans crescent jordan thought hed need to get more out of the safe deposits at the royston and jones bank what was set aside in marylebone was gambling stake money and at the moment it amounted to less than hed started out with his resentment against alfred appleton was building by the day i talked personally with dan said the woman our understanding is acceptable as far as hes concerned but he stressed its only an initial tranche what if im not found to be responsible for the marriage collapse again roughly as we thought an american judge would have discretion but were not denying that you slept with alyce appleton it comes down to whether or not you or rather dan can satisfy the judge youre not a marriage wrecker dan thinks he can on our exchanges so far so might be sufficient initial was the word dan used insisted lesley how long the hearing lasts as far as you are concerned will again depend upon the judges view of your personal responsibility and culpability i think at this stage dans going to try to argue you out of the case at the beginning in chambers if possible but if the judge who hasnt been selected yet wont agree that schedule and wants to hear the actual divorce evidence first youll go to the back of the queue in that event it could last the month maybe longer if i made the initial deposit i would have some living and travelling money too wouldnt i im not sure that would come within the acceptible provisions of the arrangement can you ask of course what about publicity asked jordan inevitably coming to his overriding concern lesley corbin extended her hands palm upwards in a who knows gesture if youre dismissed from the case before it starts in a chambers hearing dan doubts therell be any youre no more than a name dan hasnt got as far as any detailed exchange papers to discover if any other men are being cited as well as you or if there are whether theyre contesting the allegations as well whether or not there is any publicity is really dependent upon appleton and the sort of case his side intends and what the judge permits so were not much further forward the main purpose of this meeting is to fix when you can go out for your first meeting in new york announced lesley as soon as possible to get it all over as quickly as i can said jordan at once i thought id made that clear i needed to check with your first she said detecting the irritation in jordans voice give me a day ill fly out on saturday give myself sunday to get over the jet lag and see dan on monday that gave him the rest of the week to check hans crescent get at least from the new leadenhall street bank and hand it over to lesley corbin that sounds good ill check with dan fix a time for monday tell me about preston demanded jordan lesley went to the pile on her left your blood pressures over which he says is too high and your cholesterol level is it should be well under you should get treatment for both according to him on the plus side youre not hiv positive nor are you suffering any sexual disease she looked up expectantly and hes invoked medicolegal consultation rates and put in a bill for what thats in line with whats charged by medical experts for legal cases hes claiming he should have been told by me got a price agreed hes a robbing conning bastard said jordan the hypocrisy never occurring to him he wasnt asked and didnt need to carry out such an examination it does appear youve got some medical problems you should get treated however ill argue with him about the fee of course get it reduced reduced a hell of a lot insisted jordan and heres the photographs she said offering an envelope across the desk jordan had always kept any type of identifying document to an absolute minimum and in his judgement these photos approached a dangerous level of identification his immediate decision was very definitely to stick with the pictures in his current passport of which he still had a substantial supply which were already three years old and would hopefully misrepresent him further when it needed renewal in another seven years if he were dismissed from the american case hed do whatever he could to get beckwith to recover these current images for him to destroy the short schoolboycut sandy blond hair normally so easy to gel into a different style for various identities here was too recognizable and the contact lenses hed uncomfortably used to accentuate the blueness of his eyes were too blue making him starreyeyed he didnt either consider hed sufficiently distorted his mouth by sucking back his top and bottom lip as he had in his previous photographs i think they could have been better criticised the lawyer so do i better at disguising my features thought jordan did you ask dan why photographs were necessary we left it for you to ask him yourself she reminded as i said its got to be for comparison against photographs of you and alyce in france i would have thought my being in court was a good enough comparison prior exchange of documents lesley said i need to hand over the deposit yes you do she agreed ill have it ready by friday lesley corbin looked at her open diary on the far left of the desk three thirty three thirtys fine what are you going to do about the blood pressure and the cholesterol nothing you sure thats wise believing anything that that bastard says isnt wise anything else any uncertainty still on your mind if i think of anything ill mention it on friday there were in fact more uncertainties on jordans mind more than he could count and most of which he couldnt talk about to lesley corbin or anybody else he was straightjacketed by frustration and impotence and and by no longer being in charge of himself and whatever was happening to him he wanted immediately now to hit back fight back cause alfred jerome fucking appleton as much and as many problems as alfred jerome appleton was causing him no jordan contradicted himself at once more problems far more he wanted to fuck appleton in every way but physically far worse and far more painfully than hed ever been screwed before worse even than the retribution he exacted against the man whod stolen his own company and in effect destroyed his marriage abruptly anxiously jordan wanted to see a photograph of the man ingrain every line and feature of his face of everything about the man as he ingrained every detail about his victims before embarking upon another identitystealing operation for the first time since being overwhelmed by so much he didnt understand and couldnt control harvey jordan smiled decisions clearing in his otherwise cluttered mind he didnt understand everything and couldnt anticipate how anything could or would turn out not yet but he would eventually as he always did and when he did as soon as he did alfred jerome appleton would learn what an implacable unrelenting enemy hed made what about alyce louise appleton came the abrupt prodding question jordan couldnt believe didnt want to believe that alyce was the promiscuous part of some conspiracy jordan a professional himself was sure he would have recognized it picked up the alarmsounding clue which he hadnt but he couldnt be sure he accepted objectively he had to keep an open but not a vindictive revengeful mind until he got to new york and learned a great deal more which he would hed search and probe and discover everything and when he had hed reach his own verdict and exact his own punishment upon everyone whod decided harvey jordan was a ripe easytopluck victim it had taken a long time too long for him to flesh out the decision now that he had he felt encouraged confident sure he could win whatever it took that night harvey jordan won slightly over and finished the evening feeling even more confident alert as he permanently was he didnt pick out anyone either inside or outside the casino whom he suspected of watching him either maybe he had been paranoid after all ten thered been the familiar quickening of his hearbeat upon landing at jfk going through the airport formalities and choosing the triboro bridge route in preference to the tunnel to get into manhattan there was never an alternative to entering new york above ground to see the snaggletoothed skyline sketched out before him as he crossed the east river but today harvey jordan felt different from how he had felt before on this trip hopefully he was going to regain some control of and over his life his anonymity instead of being jerked constantly around at the end of someone elses demanding manipulating strings dear god how much he wanted that he guessed he was wishing too much too soon but he couldnt prevent himself hoping jordan believed hed finished the week ahead which was where he always had to be ahead choosing the moves and the routes instead of following those where others tried to lead him hed ducked and dived for more than two hours after his last meeting with lesley to reach hans crescent where he found two bank documents from royston and jones that needed his immediate signature and believing he remained unwatched after so much evasion carried them at once to leadenhall street to handdeliver them and to have any further correspondence held until his return from america then hed crossed from the administration to the securities division to collect in full the advance to which the american lawyer had agreed he hadnt been able to fit all of it into the marylebone safe so hed taken the overflow with him to gamble that night in a much more downmarket but conveniently myopic casino in tottenham court road and added to what he was increasingly regarding as a war chest when hed delivered the to lesley corbin she said she wished she was coming to new york with him and fleetingly jordan wished she were too although his current entrapment had driven even the remotest thought of personal relationships out of his mind more so than he usually felt when he was working he considered himself to be working now as hard harder even as he had had to before in order to rebuild his first destroyed life hed asked lesley why she didnt come some other time because this looked like the first of several trips and shed said maybe if she could gain access to the court when the actual hearings began to experience an american court in action and jordan regretted his glib responses not having initially believed she was serious he regretted too talking to her about the man in the car outside the mayfair club because he hadnt had the slightest suspicion in the tottenham court road casino or anywhere else certainly not on the outward flight to america that he was being watched and feared now hed made himself look stupid having restored his pride harvey jordan hated making himself look stupid jordans tripleglazed suite at the carlyle was further distanced from the donkeybray wail of emergency sirens by being back from east th street and although he didnt then feel tired having fitfully dozed in his firstclass sleeperbed during the last ba flight of the day out of london jordan went directly to bed after an omelette from room service not having eaten on the plane he was determined against any overhanging jet lag during his monday meeting with daniel beckwith despite his noise precautions jordan slept badly subconsciously always aware of where he was and why since the stomachlurching letter from brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein hed actually thought little of alyce appleton beyond her ever present name but in a dreamcluttered half sleep his mind perfectly pictured her hunched over the officiallooking papers in the carlton lounge in cannes and again in the bikini wisp that had made it necessary for him to briefly remain in the sea off the he st marguerite and most vividly of all of her lounged naked languorously offering herself on the bed of their tower suite at the st tropez hotel shed said something to him then something he couldnt now remember but wanted to because he thought it was important and therefore something that he should recall jordan finally awoke completely still trying to recollect the remark shed made but couldnt daniel beckwith was a towering hardbodied man well over six feet tall whose blond hair jordan guessed to be longer than lesley corbins a thrownaside tie lay on top of a carelessly discarded jacket puddled in a side chair to expose on the lawyer a check shirt more at home on the ranch than a lawyers office the large threepinned oval buckle of the mans embossed leather belt was actually centred with the head of an animal a bison maybe and jordan wondered if there were stables somewhere in the building for the lawyers horse the man was halfway across the office as jordan entered hand already outstretched in greeting jordan tensed expectantly and just managed to avoid a wince at the knucklecracking shake good of you to come harv very good got a lot talk about after speaking tc lesley and you i didnt think i had much of a choice said jordan taking the chair to which the lawyer gestured jordan thought there was a tinge of an unidentifiable accent in the laidback measured voice jordans right hand actually ached there was a choice and you made the right one assured beckwith you want to toss your coat make yourself comfortable go right ahead he jabbed an intercom key declared when youre ready suzie and clicked off before there was any response from the other end he smiled a perfectly sculpted whitetoothed smile and said coffee to help you stay awake after your trip over drink it all the time myself im ok with my jacket coffee would be good though jordan had begun work immediately after the bad night at the carlyle walking the length of wall street to identify conveniently grouped banks for what he intended in the immediate future and avoided any alcohol and isolating three possible shortlease apartments his favourite was on west nd street despite the exertion hed slept badly again and been awake since five so he welcomed the coffee which arrived on a tray with two mugs and a pot holding at least two pints the titian haired girl whom jordan guessed to be suzie wore a clinging red sweater and a tight cream skirt to display pert breasts and rounded slim hips to their best and obvious advantages she said hi to jordan as she passed on her way out beckwith said we keep suzie on the payroll as a warning to clients what theyre allowed to think but not do jordan heard the girl laugh behind him at what he guessed to be a well rehearsed joke wondering if it didnt constitute sexual harassment he smiled because he knew he was expected to and accepted the coffee the lawyer poured mildly impatient at the irrelevance or was it irrelevant he asked himself remembering the americans warning against losing his temper beckwith patted the dossier on his desk with a heavy hand and said got all your stuff and lesley tells me shes set up an escrow account with the deposit i dont understand how you can move that much cash without fulfilling some financial regulations jordan hadnt expected to talk about money so soon but was glad the lawyer had introduced it early on as always it remained one of the foremost questions in his mind the more so after his bank identification the previous afternoon there are regulations and they will be fulfilled guaranteed beckwith and were not transferring it all at once i draw upon it as and when its necessary supported by a federal bank agreement to prove to your english authorities that its a bone fide government agreed exchange for legal purposes upon the sworn oath of lesleys firm and my own all expenditure and receipts have to be exchanged between the fed and your bank of england but its between firms not individuals so your name never appears its covered by multinational trade legislation but we qualify under it and theres nothing in the legislation requiring duplication with your inland revenue and our irs i guess there will be one day when the loopholes discovered but at the moment youre lucky we can utilize it im glad it exists for the moment and that i can draw on it id like an initial cash advance of the lawyer frowned that much im thinking of some working trips to atlantic city maybe las vegas even hed carried just short of into the country and wished it could have been more although the immediate intention didnt include casinos ok agreed beckwith reluctantly lets hope my luck holds jordan was sure that in addition to it preventing any discrepancy between his income tax submission and the money he was making available here was beckwiths need to ensure he could afford to pay for his defence jordan made a mental note to check the scheme when his current problems were finally over there might be an advantage he could use although he couldnt at that moment imagine what it might be youve got to depend more upon me than upon luck warned the lawyer i know that accepted jordan i cant believe how ive come to be caught up in all this people cant or dont until it happens to them can we cut to the chase right now urged jordan finally giving way to his impatience you know from lesley how it happened my side of the story what are my chances of being dismissed the action beckwith laughed at the question pouring more coffee there are too many things i still have to hear and learn and question before i could even begin to answer that and even after i do hear and learn and question i dont think id like to try an answer even then at this point i havent had the individual statements of claim from alfred appletons side specifying the grounds for those claims against you or what i need from alyce appletons lawyers this meeting is for us to get to know each other maybe exchange a few thoughts weve got a long way to go the same warning that lesley had given him jordan remembered how can we get any thoughts together until we know their case cases i said exchanging a few thoughts not finalizing our side beckwith reached to his right turning on a tape recorder so lets start doing that right now who made the first move down there in sunny france you or alyce you mean who spoke first you tell it your way jordan hesitated for a moment she spoke first id been reading in the hotel lounge remembered a phone call i had to make she stopped me as i was crossing the room and told me id left my book behind i said i was coming back did you make the call up in my room i thought you were in a suite i was up in my suite do we really need to be as pedantic as this harv i need to be so pedantic i know the colour of your underwear maybe alyces too if im going to be able to undermine what might be put against you i ask the questions any question you answer them ok ok so you made the call yes who to shit thought jordan anticipating the followup question a restaurant overlooking cannes harbour i wanted to eat there that night so therell be a record of the reservation in your name the restaurant will be able to confirm the call no said jordan seeing his way out the line was engaged i tried twice but then gave up i walked down that night and managed to get a table without a reservation with alyce no refused jordan again the relief moving through him at the unchallengable escape having given up trying to make a connection you went back downstairs yes what happened then i stopped on my way back to where id been sitting thanked her for trying to stop me losing my book on the way out i think id asked her to watch that it stayed safe and shed been writing earlier it looked like a lot of documents in a large envelope shed stopped by the time i got back the envelope was beside her in a chair along with a lot of her other stuff it was the only chair at her table so i invited her across to where i was sitting for a drink so she spoke to you first but you hit on her jordan sighed heavily i didnt hit on her shed tried to do me a favour i thought id buy her a drink to say thank you i dont care how long you stand in the box in court or how much youre exasperated i dont want to hear a sigh like that again fuck you thought jordan aloud he said im sorry you will be if you get caught out by another lawyer to make you lose your temper and it shows i warned you already i wont forget again im not going to let you forget what happened next with you and alyce wed talked about books the first day we began speaking i knew the man in the iron mask was based on a true story of a prisoner once being imprisoned on one of the islands off cannes and invited her on a trip the following day without telling her what it was or where it would be i rented a catamaran and took her there we stop demanded the lawyer where are we now first or second day jordan had to think second we spent all day together what about the night and the night this has got to be exactly how it happened so tell me exactly how it happened lets go back to the first day you began talking theres nothing much to tell about that first day after lunch i went into town had dinner alone at the harbour restaurant and then went back to the hotel was she there i didnt see her why didnt you invite her to dinner with you overlooking the harbour jordan shrugged i dont know i just didnt did you think something might develop between you not particularly i was alone she was alone everything was relaxed and easy the second day you went on the catamaran trip to the island yes confirmed jordan what time i dont stumbled jordan in the morning we had lunch on the boat after looking at the jail how did you manage that manage it questioned jordan confused when did you rent the catamaran the first afternoon after lunch i went into the town found some yacht charterers and booked the catamaran and had it provisioned for the trip so you set up a pretty big expedition i chartered a yacht for a oneday cruise to take alyce somewhere i thought shed be interested in seeing you went out on the catamaran you saw the jail where the man in the iron mask was held then what we swam naked beckwith asked in costumes the catamaran had a crew and a cabin of course it had a cabin did you change together separately who changed first jordan had to think again i did what sort of costume did you wear what queried jordan not understanding trunks boxers what boxer shorts what about alyce a bikini a brief bikini or a two piece a brief bikini how brief very brief said jordan remembering his delay in getting back on to the catamaran so she was coming on to you i guess you could say that harv were not guessing here were trying to keep your ass as far away from the burner as we can youre being accused of stealing al appletons wife literally from under him causing him physical and mental damage and making his business and income suffer from what you did there have been jury awards well over the million mark on just one such criminal conversation claim and youre looking at a damned sight more than just one and the courts and the judges have the power to add on punitive damages too you understand what im telling you how much it could cost you i understand jordan didnt welcome being treated like an idiot any more than he liked consistently being called harv but it certainly seemed that he needed training and much more help than hed imagined up to now go on ordered beckwith we got back to the harbour around six id taken the hotel car to get there but alyce said she wanted to walk back its not far i asked if she wanted dinner but she said she wasnt hungry after the lunch wed had on the boat that she was tired and wanted to go straight to bed beckwith came forward across his desk go to bed around six in the evening yes what did you do say i didnt finish telling you what she said she said she wanted to go to bed but not alone daniel beckwith began to smile tell me the actual words i want to go to bed but not alone quoted jordan why he wondered was he feeling uncomfortable embarrassed the smile widened alyce appleton spoke to you first in the hotel lounge alyce appleton wore the very briefest of bikinis to show you what was on offer and alyce appleton told you that she didnt want go to bed alone it didnt started jordan but stopped then he said yes thats how it was she chased you insisted beckwith you didnt chase her seduce her we both knew what was happening harv for fucks sake when are you going to start listening to me what youve just told me was that how it was how it happened that you came to be in bed with alyce appleton yes she made it easy for you invited you if you harv halted the lawyer warningly yes were getting there harv at the moment youre not making it easy for either of us but were getting there im not trying to make it difficult for either of us me most of all i didnt understand the direction you were coming from why hadnt he jordan demanded of himself it surely wasnt that obscure trying to stop you getting skinned alive is the direction im coming from harv lesley said she thought i might have been set up by alyce and her husband together said jordan you think i could have been jordan felt humiliated even by asking the question its a way i might be tempted to go depends on the papers when i get to see them even as it is youve got the beginnings of a defence if we can get the court to accept what youre telling me it was a holiday affair for christs sake this is a divorce with more damages accusations than ive ever encountered before said beckwith two very different things that so far you havent got your head around jordan was suddenly swept away by a disorienting tiredness for the briefest of moments his actual awareness ebbing and flowing is there any more coffee in that pot you ok enquired beckwith pouring the dregs im fine exaggerated jordan we havent talked about the actual hearing will the court be closed or open depends upon a request from the plaintiff or defendant there needs to be an application for a closed court from one or the other im a defendant arent i cant i make the application primary defendant qualified beckwith which youre not and i dont see it coming from appleton so were dependent upon alyce for the hearing to be private if she wants it to be how serious is your problem with an open court public hearing as serious as it damned well can be i dont want to be publicly identified as a wife stealer because im not the coffee was cold and too bitter and jordan put it aside i may get some indication from pretrial hearings what about those pretrial hearings seized jordan surely we can argue for my dismissal from the proceedings before it even gets to court im going to file for dismissal of course but im not going to hold out hopes that i dont have this is a fucking travesty exploded jordan despite all the warnings against losing his temper travesty is a word invented for the law said beckwith my job is ensuring youre not a victim of it more my job that yours thought jordan jordan was glad when almost at once beckwith closed the meeting by announcing that the first of the exchanges from the other lawyers had been promised by the middle of the week and suggested a second session on the thursday relieved too jordan didnt believe hed handled himself well maybe not even convincingly during this first encounter with the american the remaining disorientating jet lag might have contributed a little to how ineffectual he considered himself to have been but he couldnt find a reason or excuse for the rest he should jordan supposed be encouraged by beckwiths argument that alyce had been the instigator of the affair but he wasnt he hadnt had to exaggerate or lie answering the lawyer on how it had begun but there was no way of proving it to be the truth so it came down to his word against hers he wished he could remember what alyce had said lying naked on the hotel bed in st tropez and that the questions crowding in upon him at this moment had come to mind when hed been with beckwith instead of now when it was too late finally objectively jordan confronted a hovering feeling he could identify he hadnt regained control of or over his life today and he was scared shitscared eleven the lawyer skimmed the photographs across the desk and said heres the guy who hates your guts and wants all your money if appleton ever found out what more was going to happen to him which he never would he was going to hate his guts a whole lot more thought jordan picking up the prints alfred jerome appleton was a fleshy heavyfeatured prominentnosed man who combed his receding hair straight back giving himself a high forehead just above the left temple of which was a deep red strawberry mark they were portraits but showed enough of the mans shoulders to indicate a build to match his features jordan was sure even before meeting him in the flesh that appleton would tower over him although only ever physically and heres his reason said beckwith following with the photographs of alyce they reminded jordan of the sort of pictures police released of someone after they had been arrested charged with a crime and pictured for a criminal record file alyce was staring expressionlessly at the camera her hair brushed although not very well straight down jordan didnt think shed bothered with any makeup either apart maybe for a lip liner and she had worn her darkrimmed spectacles which she hadnt when they had been together except when shed needed to read her eyes were partially closed behind them she was wearing black jordan couldnt decide whether it was a dress or a sweater without any visible jewellery he was caught by the impression that while not as determinedly as hed tried alyce had posed to make herself as different as possible from how she normally looked that is alyce right asked beckwith formally doing her bag lady act on a bad day confirmed jordan appleton looks years older the lawyer went to the papers before him eleven years older to be precise appletons fortyone to alyces thirtyone theres a couple of months between the birthdays that makes it eleven months at the moment you got all the papers now demanded jordan the first of the formal exchanges yes it was a tossed aside blazer in a heap today the shirt less strident than before although the bison belt was the same alyces lawyer is a guy named bob reid dont remember him from when i practised down there hows it look as far as i am concerned on first reading i think theres enough for me to apply for a prehearing dismissal of some if not all of the damages claims said beckwith the dates are in your favour alyce is citing two gals by name a sharon borowski and a leanne jefferies and others unnamed all the adultery before you and alyce met in france and shes claiming the same sort of criminal conversation damages against one of them leanne jefferies why not sharon borowski broke in jordan i dont know at this stage tit for tat declared jordan suddenly ive been trying to remember something alyce said when we were together i asked outright about her marriage used a silly expression like whats the status of your marriage she said there wasnt one that it was over i suggested she was playing tit for tat she said something like that and asked if i was offended at being used by her i told her i wasnt beckwith concentrated on one of the document bundles on his desk before leaning eagerly forward over it as he had at their first meeting her exchange doesnt say anything like that but then i wouldnt expect it to its certainly something i can put to her if we ever get into a full divorce court hearing would it help like hell it would help insisted beckwith it fits with what you already told me of her coming on to you the woman scorned syndrome what does she say about her and me about what happened in france she doesnt contradict your account at all that it was a holiday thing with some revenge on her part that her marriage was over and that what happened between you was a nostrings situation certainly most importantly that nothing was prearranged the covering letter from her attorney wants a meeting asap what for undefined said beckwith with a shrug im guessing a cooperating defence id like to think that too said jordan meaning it my more immediate thought though is that it doesnt look as if this is a conspiracy between her and her husband mine too agreed beckwith but lets not get to feel too comfortable too soon i also dont think appletons case makes sense if theres chapter and verse in alyces divorce application with proof of appleton screwing two named women as well as various others before alyce and i even met where the hells his case against me its ridiculous i told you already that i know david bartle and his firm by reputation and that they play hardball at the moment i dont think it makes any more sense than you but bartle wouldnt be going this route if the judge might repeat your word ridiculous when he comes to make his judgement on the claims lesley told me in london the point of exchanging intended evidence is to prevent surprises in court questioned jordan it is agreed beckwith theyre making me work from the first gun so you think they might be holding something back theyll be doing so at their peril dramatic last presentation of evidence is ok for movie or television you try it in reality and youre likely to get it struck from the record which loses defeats in fact the whole nonsense of trying it in the first place you going to meet alyces lawyer he stopped not able to remember the name reid bob reid supplied the other lawyer talk certainly hear what he wants to discuss thats where the indication might come from of appletons game i want to know everything there is to know about alfred appleton himself announced jordan beckwith shuffled through his papers got the profile here he said not looking up well flesh it out further through our own people of course try to find the things he doesnt want us to know heres what there is so far hes a graduate from the harvard business school actually born in boston old family old money father was a banker set up his own commodity business shortly after his marriage to alyce when they settled in manhattan according to what his side have supplied predominantly trades in metals although theres a spread cereals pork belly on the chicago market some currency through others in the firm company turnover of in the last pretax year the lawyer looked up at the same time as making a note to himself on a yellow legal pad ill need to get in much more detail appletons personal trading history in view of the itemised claims hes filed beckwith made another note full medical history as well for the mental and physical suffering hes alleging you caused beckwith returned to the file supplied by appletons lawyer married alyce bellamy thats another old family old money north carolina name ten years ago no children a yachtsman sails out of east hampton manhattan address on west th he smiled and looked back up thats about it that didnt amount to even half of it judged jordan but beckwith had been encapsulating you think i could have my own copy of appletons personal details alyces too beckwith frowned although lightly you going to do the research or am i i want to know everything and more about a man you say hates my guts and who you describe as the reason for that hatred i read it all i might come up with something else something that fits like i did today remembering her tit for tat response i was trying to lighten things up a tad said beckwith of course you get your own copies i want you to have your own copies there are reasons now it was jordan who frowned not understanding what reasons read everything for yourself first take your time what about my being there at the meeting with alyces lawyer beckwith shook his head his uncertainty genuine now im not sure about that if i want it or if bob reid would want it let me speak to him first see what hes got in mind might be something i hadnt thought of i hope not said jordan too quickly although at the same time admiring the unexpected humility so do i replied the lawyer with a grin but youre still doing it speaking before you properly think jordan ignored the rebuke instead mocking he said i also think after full and proper consideration i should stay on until you see alyces guy dont you a day or two maybe allowed beckwith can i have my copies something to read through while im waiting and the advance i asked for suzies outfit today was an aquamarine tube dress with the same effect as the previous tight sweater and skirt she said hi as before after collecting what needed to be duplicated but this time there wasnt any flirtatious repartee beckwith said you got over the flight now totally assured jordan spent the last couple of days in atlantic city he had considered las vegas which he knew well against atlantic city which he didnt but decided upon somewhere to which he could conveniently commute from manhattan howd you make out dropped a little nothing disastrous but its why id like a cash infusion need to get the feel of the place jordan preferred european to american casinos believing that the electronic surveillance of the individual tables in the american ones in addition to the alertness of the croupier dealer and pit boss was far more likely to catch his minimal stake technique his two long nights on the atlantic coast had cost him close to which he philosophically accepted was about right for the all important pieces of paper losings an occupational hazard i guess suggested the lawyer it happens agreed jordan reluctantly but was soon to stop he thought as suzie reentered the room jordan objectively acknowledged that thered already been false starts and dents to his confidence but for the first time he decided that with the statements of alfred and alyce appleton tightly in his possession this really was the beginning of him regaining his lost control of actually setting his own agenda not conforming to that of others just as objectively he recognized that he would have to be more careful than hed ever been in or with anything hed ever tried to plan before if alfred appletons lawyers got the faintest hint of what he had in mind reid or beckwith as well jordan supposed the sky would come crashing down upon him but hed lived as an identity thief without once being caught out for the last fifteen years by his own hidden and extremely profitable agendas and could most definitely would do it again now just as successfully undetected as hed always been being ensnared as he had in france didnt come into any equation or conflict everything about france was totally different just as this new agenda would be completely different jordan accepted that he had far more to do and very differently than was usual in one of his identity frauds but then he was starting with a lot more he consoled himself gazing down at the copied divorce application statements of alfred and alyce appleton set out on the bureau of his locked carlyle suite the do not disturb sign displayed on the outside of his door the hotel telephone exchange under orders not to put through any calls no matter how persistent or convincingly argumentative the caller opening the thicker of the two files before him jordan decided that daniel beckwith had most definitely encapsulated the information although not in any obstructive way the personal material in the alfred jerome appleton dossier would not have appeared relevant to the lawyer to jordan it was an aladdins cave of treasure that would normally have taken him weeks to compile and still would not have been as comprehensive there was alfred jerome appletons copied birth certificate from which jordan learned that the maiden name of the mans mother had been channing there were the reproduced personally identifying pages from the mans passport still with three years to go before renewal the actual apartment number at west th street was accompanied by the unlisted personal telephone number the east hampton address was on atlantic avenue the mans internet address was also given the most unexpected bonus of all was the mans new york commodities trading licence appletons private bank details not only provided the account number but also the mans social security and private health care insurance numbers also listed were the clubs and organizations to which appleton belonged the most predictable of which was the commodity floor brokers and traders association he belonged predictable again to two long island yacht clubs and there were photographs not the posed formal ones that beckwith had produced in his office but a selection of amateur pictures several of appleton at the helm of a spinakerbloomed twelvemetre racing yacht its name obscured and others of the man receiving awards twice in sailing clothes at openair ceremonies yachts in the background three at dinnerjacketed banquets alyce smiling in admiration was close at hand in three of them in each the bullshouldered thickbodied man dwarfed her as jordan had already decided appleton would physically dominate him jordan eased back in his chair for what was to become the first of several reflections intentionally allowing the pages and his initial savouring of them to mist before his eyes so much detail he mused with more to follow once he read on because there would doubtless be spelled out perhaps literally the allegedly damaged marriage social health and financial loss to support the individual claims all to establish the severity of each and every loss he wasnt scared jordan recognized pleased with the awareness apprehensive perhaps because there was still so much more that he had to learn and there was still the hovering risk of public exposure which had to be prevented but not as scared as he had been those few short days ago nor when he realized he had been robbed of everything now he was thinking for himself letting the ideas germinate in his mind sufficiently independent of others necessary though legal representation was appletons personal statement was preceded by a legally phrased caveat that it was preliminary and therefore subject to revision or amendment there was an immediate reference annotation to the formal beginning which recorded the marriage having taken place on april th at the sacred heart cathedral at raleigh north carolina jordan at once turned to it to find a copy of a full twopage cutting from the raleigh news and observer describing the marriage as the bringing together of two historically established families there was a jeremiah bellamy among the early settlers colonizing the east coast and a jeremiah appleton was one of the boston rebels against the taxation demands of georgian england the wedding photographs showed a little changed alyce but a much slimmer appleton appletons statement recorded their setting up home on west th street after a honeymoon in hawaii he described his marriage to alyce as happy for the first four years with both he and alyce dismayed by a series of miscarriages that dismay increased with alyces failure to become pregnant despite a years ivf treatment neither considered adoption an acceptable alternative option the marriage came under increasing strain because of the amount of time and commitment appleton had to devote to his business in the early years of its establishment there were frequent sometimes violent disagreements between them appleton did not consider alyce sufficiently supportive she preferred east hampton where there was an inherited appleton family house and a pattern developed for alyce to spend the majority of her time there with his living most of the week alone in manhattan returning to long island at weekends in for the first time they discussed divorce which he neither wanted nor sought in an effort to avoid it appleton for varying periods of time commuted daily by seaplane service from sag harbour to the rd st facility on manhattans east river despite the strain involved he was a nervous reluctant flyer and it meant his not being able to devote as much time as he considered necessary to his business here there was another indexed reference in which when he turned to it jordan found a selection of financial statements starred to illustrate trading losses jordan made a quick mental calculation and estimated the acrosstheboard deficit from the submitted statements totalled close to two million appleton claimed that to stem those losses and get his personal trading back to the profit level hed achieved when he worked the necessary weekly hours in manhattan he would have to reduce his long island commuting to three days a week in january appleton claimed appleton and drake had suffered its largest threemonthly trading loss of he and alyce mutually agreed in that month to a trial separation appleton living in the manhattan apartment alyce remaining in east hampton during that period of separation he became involved in two brief affairs one of three weeks with sharon borowski and one of a month with leanne jefferies he terminated both and sought a reconciliation with alyce to which she agreed there was a short conjugal reunion of less than two months appleton once again commuting by seaplane in september alyce insisted on their sleeping separately and he began to suspect she was having an affair she denied it when he confronted her she initiated divorce proceedings citing the two women with whom he insisted he had ceased any contact with before returning to live as much as possible in east hampton it was during that reunion that hed admitted the affairs to her to wipe the slate clean he asked her to consult a marriage guidance counsellor with him to which she agreed but refused to continue after three joint sessions when she announced her intention of spending the summer in europe he became even more convinced that alyce was involved with another man and engaged the private detective agency that discovered her relationship with harvey william jordan the index reference here contained what was described as sample proof of a premeditated liaison further evidence of which would be produced at the divorce hearing from the samples jordan recognized three photographs one of them aboard the catamaran the second of their lunching together on the seafronting terrace at the residence de la pinade and the third at the cagnes hotel there were copies of mr and mrs jordans room registrations from the st tropez and cagnes hotels appleton claimed to have become depressed from the moment of alyces refusal to share the same bedroom the combination of psychiatric consultations loss of confidence mental distraction prescribed tranquillisers and medication to treat the mental and physical effects of his wifes behaviour had made it virtually impossible for him to run or control his business for the past several months there had been long periods when he had been unable to work at all he was still undergoing psychiatric and medical treatment there was no prognosis to indicate how long it would be necessary for him to continue either because the costs were therefore ongoing invoices up to the date of the hearing would be presented at the time of that hearing together with an estimate of likely expenditure in the future while openly admitting his now deeply regretted adultery appleton insisted he had done everything in his power to sustain and preserve his marriage to alyce his wife had never been subjected to physical violence she had enjoyed a personal allowance of a month unaffected by the financial upheavals of his business for which he considered her a contributory cause with appleton paying all the household bills and expenditures he provided alyce with a new personal mercedes every two years he also contributed towards the upkeep and staff costs of the bellamy family mansion at raleigh north carolina in which alyces widowed mother still lived appleton further insisted he was devastated by the collapse of his marriage and even as late as her return from france had been prepared to reengage in a marriage guidance programme and attempt a further reconciliation alyce had refused to discuss either with him having formally instigated the proceedings from france where she had been adulterously involved with harvey jordan from whom the statement concluded appleton sought exemplary and punitive recompense for each and every claimed damage jordan stretched back from the bureau for the second time surprised that it had grown dark outside without his noticing trying as objectively as possible to decide where he fitted into the mosaic and very quickly concluding that he wasnt part of it at all he wasnt denying the adultery in france but there was no proof or evidence because none existed of there having been a premeditated assignation which made it impossible for him to be held responsible in any way whatsoever for the collapse of an already collapsed marriage and if that accusation didnt stand which it couldnt he was sure he was not responsible for any damage commercial mental or physical for which appleton was demanding financial compensation he still had alyces initial submission to read jordan remembered her personal documentation matched that of appleton and included two addresses the north carolina colonial mansion on raleighs king george street and a manhattan apartment at west th street jordans immediate impression was that alyces account of her marriage was going to be remarkably similar to that of her husband until he reached the second page of her statement in it were named a long list of trusts and charitable organizations and a hospital and clinic in raleigh all financed and run by a bellamy foundation of which until a year after her marriage alyce had been executive director alyces marriage activated a twomilliondollar family trust in her favour when appleton announced his intention of setting up his own commodity trading business she loaned him on the clear understanding that it was a loan although no formal papers were legally drawn up or sworn over the following five years she loaned the company a further again with no formal papers being signed to establish it as such or of her being named as a director she received no repayments or dividends reflecting the total loan of one million dollars but upon appletons insistence that it minimized any tax liability she accepted mercedes cars in lieu under this wordofmouth arrangement she was given a total of four cars during the period of their marriage alyce used the same word as appleton dismay to describe her failure to become pregnant but attested that before entering the year long ivf treatment she underwent gynaecological examination to establish if she were capable of becoming pregnant and bearing a child the results were positive there were no problems appleton refused similar medical examination which caused arguments between them after the unsuccessful ivf treatment alyce suggested adoption but appleton was adamantly opposed which resulted in further arguments almost from the establishment of his commodity trading business appleton insisted it was necessary for him to work late into the evening frequently as often as twice a week she would be in bed before he returned despite the apparent dedication to work and some indications of success there was an indexed reproduction from the wall street journal describing appleton and drake as emerging stars in metal market dealings appleton repeatedly told her he was personally suffering substantial losses in his own tradings although he never showed her books or financial statements because of the amount of time she remained alone in the manhattan apartment alyce developed a preference for east hampton there she worked actively for local cystic fibrosis and breast cancer charities having by then resigned her position on the bellamy foundation and enjoyed sailing a mutual interest through which she and appleton met alyce asserted that it was she who suggested they divorce so little time did they spend together during that discussion she made it clear she wanted the return of her one million dollars appleton argued against divorce but suggested a trial separation of six months to which she agreed towards the end of that six months appleton further suggested that he return to live in east hampton and commute during the week she agreed but regarded it as a continuation of a trial particularly after his confession of affairs with sharon borowski and leanne jefferies appleton was adamant that both had been totally unimportant and that he was making the confession to restore their marriage his confession supported her belief that there had been many other sexual liaisons there was renewed discussion about their having children and they resumed conjugal relations he once more refused any fertility tests but alyce decided to undergo a second series of fertility examinations prior to taking gynaecological advice about further ivf the bombshell came when jordan turned to page five of alyces account on the second of her resumed examinations alyce received the results of tests taken at the first there was incontestable evidence that she was suffering from chlamydia a venereal infection that can render a woman sufferer infertile or result in severe eye conditions in any child she bears alyce declared that she had been a virgin at the time of her marriage to alfred appleton and had been involved with no other sexual partner during her marriage not even during their period of separation it was the discovery of her venereal infection that brought about her refusal to sleep with appleton and the reason for her beginning the divorce proceedings which she finally instituted on her vacation in france which she described as getting away from the awfulness of the deceit with which i have lived for so long during that vacation she had an affair with an englishman harvey jordan it was a casual entirely consensual relationship that was not premeditated and ended upon her return to the united states with neither of them intending any future contact or association she deeply regretted the affair to which she had succumbed from loneliness and selfsatisfying spite at the total betrayal of which she believed herself the victim jordans sank back into his seat as the fury churned through him his mind dominated by only one question how good a venerealogist was the moneygrabbing dr james preston twelve why the hell didnt you tell me yesterday about alyces infection demanded jordan still as angry as he had been when hed finished reading her statement the previous night hed been on the phone as nine oclock struck insisting upon an immediate meeting but had to wait until noon because i wanted you to read everything through for yourself responded beckwith calmly this way we can take it forward not spend hours talking back and forth because you didnt have everything in context what context shes got a venereal disease and i slept with her your choice not to ask her choice not to tell you reminded the lawyer still calm and youve got a medical report that says you havent got an infection is that why you had me undergo that examination in england that you already knew she had it no denied beckwith its regular practice with such damages claims in north carolina i didnt know about alyce until i got her exchange yesterday it surprised me as much as i guess it surprised you surprise doesnt cover it and i dont think you can feel the same way about it as i do refused jordan what about her medical report not part of the first exchange and if it helps i understand chlamydia responds to antibiotics the effect is worse in woman and their babies than it is in a man that assurance doesnt help a damn either refused jordan again she says she didnt have any other sexual partner except appleton before me ive read what she says and she knew she had it before we slept together yes so if he gave it to her and she knowingly passed it on to me ive got a claim against both of them havent i your report says youre clear i think the doctor who examined me was a robbing asshole maybe incompetent too i want another test a second opinion i do too said the man offering a paper across the desk just as lesley corbin had done in england dr abrahams is the venerealogist we use regularly suzies got you an appointment for this afternoon i guessed youd want it as soon as possible weve copied the english medical report abrahams wants to see it people making decisions for him again thought jordan what about me counterclaiming sure if you are infected you slept with anyone else since alyce no denied jordan what about what alyce says that appleton slept around admits himself to have done so with two different women but refused to have any examinations could a court order him to have one beckwith pursed his lips making an uncertain expression there could be a technical argument against it claiming assault thats what lesley told me you wanted my medical examination for that if a sexual infection is knowingly transmitted theres a criminal case to be made its been established in law with aids hasnt it were sure as hell getting an interesting case here with more and more potential for publicity thought jordan worriedly you had any contact yet with alyces lawyer speaking with him later today i want to be at any meeting insisted jordan i hadnt forgotten i think ive got more right now than before not if youre going to issue suit against her you havent we sue her you dont get within a million miles of her lawyer until we go into court jordan was getting that straitjacketed feeling again how longll it take abrahams to make his reports beckwith shrugged not knowing tell him youre in a hurry which i am why dont i talk things through generally with bob down there in raleigh suggested beckwith get a feel of where hes coming from hes seeking a meeting with us after all were in the driving seat do whatever youve got to do to push things along to get me off this fucking great hook from which i dont believe i should be hanging in the first place said jordan impatiently youre losing your temper accused beckwith youre damned right im losing my fucking temper and were in lexington avenue manhattan not in some halfassed court in raleigh north carolina that halfassed court in raleigh north carolina has the legal power upon each and every one of appletons claims to award against you a maximum of fifteen million dollars you didnt tell me that either accused jordan it didnt arise in the conversation until now and now it has i couldnt come anywhere near a figure like that protested jordan id increase my fees if i thought you could said beckwith for the moment youve got to remember the difference between where you are when you have to i will this was a juvenile whopuncheswhom first argument jordan acknowledged lets stop this shit shall we probably a good idea said the already smiling beckwith if i were you id be pissed too is this the way these things go upon so little this case is getting features all of its own admitted the lawyer can i call you again after youve talked to alyces lawyer and ive seen the venerealogist i think you should some things might be clearer then i hope so said jordan meaning it the difference was dramatic in each and every way george abrahams surgery on west th street was a spaceage comparison of chromegleaming germforbidden sterility against the saggedcushioned frayedcarpeted harley street townhouse conversion of james preston george abrahams was a closecropped rarely smiling man in a white jacketandtrouser clinical uniform so starched that jordan expected it audibly to crack when the man moved abrahams looked too young to have gained all the qualifications the framed testimonials which lined the walls and jordan was confident even before the man looked up from the english venerealogists report that if hed contracted something from a threethousandyearold egyptian burial pyramid abrahams could have diagnosed and cured it why do you want these findings confirmed asked the american when he did finally look up abrahams tone was as sterile as his surroundings we didnt know when that examination was carried out that the woman in whose divorce i am being cited had a sexual infection abrahams went back to the first report which sexual infection precisely the report here refers to hiv chlamydia abrahams said thats not signed off which is why i am here how long was your relationship with her jordan sighed without intending to at the familiarity of the questioning just short of a month we met on holiday in france she tell you she had an infection of course not i wouldnt have slept with her if she had would i probably not agreed the other man as flatvoiced as beckwith had been earlier what symptoms have you got jordan felt hot with a mixture of embarrassment and frustration at the conversation it was as if his penis was under permanent microscopic examination i dont have any symptoms the examination i had in london was because my lawyer asked for it apparently its a recognized need in the sort of case in which i am involved since i had the examination weve learned what she was suffering from now it was the american who sighed this doctor in london when you talked did he say he was examining you for nonspecific urethritis caused by something other than gonorrhoea no he did not mention that have you had any penile discharge he asked me that now im carrying out the examination reminded the specialist the irritation sounding in his voice whats the answer no lower abdominal pain or discomfort no irritation no genital inflammation rash no abrahams smiled up from the notes he was making so far so good now i want blood urine and sperm samples sperm queried jordan try to remember when we were kids and we all did it like a lot still do ive got photographs and movies if it will help it took jordan almost an hour to fulfil every test after abrahams physical pubic examination at one stage jordan even considered abrahams pornographic offer back in the venerealogists office jordan said id like the results as soon as possible sent direct to my lawyer thats what they will be returned as soon as possible no said jordan i really mean like tomorrow whatever it costs couriered direct from wherever theyre being analysed can you arrange that chlamydia is not a difficult disease to treat and cure theres no cause to panic the exasperated burn came again jordan said tomorrow ok whatever it costs tomorrow agreed the doctor if youre positive well arrange more appointments get it cleared up if you do need treatment youll either have to use a condom or abstain during any treatment at this precise moment i feel like staying celibate for the rest of my life said jordan friday beckwith told jordan on the telephone whats he want to talk about a combined strategy as i thought we didnt go into detail on the phone did you talk to him about my being with you no why not you know why not we dont know yet whether were going to sue alyce if we do then fridays meeting between bob and me will obviously be cancelled abrahams has promised to have his results by tomorrow theyre going to be couriered direct to you what did abrahams say that if ive contracted anything hell treat it that chlamydia responds well to treatment did you talk to reid about it i told you we didnt go into the details of anything on the telephone he did say alyce is sorry youve got dragged into this not as sorry as i am if abrahams keeps his promised schedule well know by tomorrow if we are going to sue her beckwith pointed out ive already worked that out if the results are ok i could come down to raleigh with you well see whats to see if im with you we can decide on the spot whether its going to be a joint strategy or not get things moving harv lets see what tomorrows report says were not in a race here i am im in a hurry in a race to get this whole bloody nonsense over and done with and if you cant help me ill find someone who can as well as being in a hurry to start the retribution i intend jordan thought there wasnt any time limit on his returning to england the only essential consideration was continuing the rental of hans crescent and there was still weeks to go before he needed to do that ill call you the moment i hear from abrahams promised the lawyer stiffly he added you get any thoughts about changing your legal representation in the meantime ill do all i can to find you the best lawyer with north carolina bar exam qualifications to take your case over itll probably mean your going down to raleigh for consultation of course ill think about it said jordan refusing to be bullied frustration remained jordans most persistent feeling that and having his penis and his bodily fluids so persistently and literally under a microscope like a rare specimen of humanity displayed on a slab should he call beckwiths bluff and change lawyers he was strongly tempted after the first few minutes from putting down the telephone on the lawyer hed reached out to call beckwith back to tell him he did want to change he had literally held back his hand hovering over the receiver fighting the anger which he now realized belatedly and with a fresh blip of frustration was what beckwith was constantly urging him to do he really didnt want to change despite beckwiths wild west affectation strangely incongruous for a man born and raised on the eastern seaboard state and the irritating christian name abbreviation jordan liked the man and believed he was a good lawyer despite there being no criteria upon which to judge he had to be surely swimming among the legal sharks of manhattan in preference to the calmer waters of north carolina hed let it go this time jordan decided and at once contradicted himself hed let it ride see how things developed if he were subsequently dissatisfied beckwiths offer to withdraw remained on the table between them jordans telephone rang just before ten the following morning beckwith said you havent got a problem theres not a trace of any venereal infection and ive spoken to bob hes happy for you to come along suzies already bought the tickets the furnished service apartment jordan had isolated on west nd on his second day in manhattan was still available and by just after pm jordan had secured a threemonth lease in the name of alfred jerome appleton with a full cash deposit covering both rental and charges he also paid cash for a telephone connection with an unlisted number he gave the name and address of the first national bank on wall street for a reference he was at that bank the first of those he had chosen an hour later he opened the account in appletons name with an initial cash deposit of and appletons genuine social security number so conveniently available from the exchanged court documents the bank official made a particular note that jordan would predominantly use electronic banking although he did need bank credit card and chequebook facilities and gave appletons mothers maiden name for the security reference jordan authorized all charges to be directly debited from his account and warned the man to expect a realtors bank reference request for west nd street the bank official hoped theyd have a mutually satisfacatory relationship and jordan said he was sure they would thirteen jordan wasnt at all surprised that daniel beckwiths vehicle was a personalized numberplated with extrawide wheels and special trim along with darktinted windows and coloured red when he got inside jordan saw it was equipped with satellite navigation which didnt surprise him either he hadnt expected to be able to see so clearly beyond the smoked glass though you all set greeted beckwith todays outfit was faded denim workshirt and jeans with tooled cowboy boots and the regulation big buckle belt the bison motif reminded jordan of the shoulderhunched photograph of alfred appleton youre in charge you tell me and then ill tell you jordan thought a decision already formulating beckwith snatched a glance across the car as he began the manoeuvre to get to the triboro bridge and the van wyke expressway for the airport whats the matter im where i dont want to be facing by your calculations a potential financial judgement against me of millions is whats the matter you got your head up your own ass harv declared beckwith taking the macho car up the ramp towards the bridge the traffic easier going out of manhattan than it appeared to be getting in from the unmoving trafficcongealed contra flow that cost estimate was before we got yesterdays squeaky clean medical report which turned your problems a hundred and eight degrees in your favour youre now back on the sunny side of the street sit back smile and enjoy the warmth no refused jordan there are things we need to get straight between us daniel and listen i use your full complete christian name dont try to abbreviate it you want to play out some macho fantasy with the way you dress and the car you drive thats fine thats your fantasy get your rocks off but i dont like being called harv when my name is harvey and i dont like having appointments made for me before i even know theyre being made what those appointments are for or why even theyre necessary ive wiped my own ass since i was about five without any help from anyone and hope i can go on doing it without leaving stains on my underwear for a long time in the future as i intend doing a lot more everything for myself in the future beckwith snatched another glance as they turned into the la guardia slip road sounds to me like youve made your decision about your legal representation so why you bothering to come down to raleigh with me today i have made my decision confirmed jordan my decision is that i want to be called harvey when we talk and that i want to be consulted in advance before arrangements are made on my behalf and that i dont want to be lectured about losing my temper because ive got that completely on board and totally under control but i want to continue with your representing me because were a long way down the track now and i really dont want to go back or down to raleigh to find somebody else to start all over again which isnt exactly an overwhelming vote of confidence which it wasnt intended to be it was intended to tell you how i felt and how id like things to be between us from now on otherwise otherwise well have another conversation very similar to this and i will go down to raleigh which brings us back to your choice beckwith took the car into the short stay parking lot ignoring three available spaces until he found one that he wanted close to a side wall he hesitated after they got out to walk side by side with jordan still unspeaking into the terminal when they reached the departure pier he handed jordan his ticket deferring to him to check in first the flight was already being called and they continued on into the aircraft on the plane beckwith stood back for jordan to choose his seat and as always jordan took the aisle finally when theyd settled in their seats beckwith said you travelled around america a lot harvey not a lot las vegas of course the west coast a few times new orleans before the hurricane disaster it would have been a mistake to acknowledge the name correction pity we couldnt have driven to raleigh and back in one day great country ive changed my mind about returning to england too quickly announced jordan ill have to go back sometime of course but i want first to make sure everything is on track here get a much clearer idea how its going to work out maybe a good idea its your decision based upon your guidance thats what youre paying me for how are we going to do this meeting with bob reid officially its between attorneys but theres no reason for you not joining in if you think youve got a point to make that weve missed ill keep that in mind hed corrected the situation to where it should have been from the beginning jordan decided it was a good feeling the best hed had for several days raleigh the first american state capital jordan had visited was hung with direction signs to the sites and events of its early settler history like flags at a victory celebration and jordan got a tourists commentary to each and every one of them from daniel beckwith as the lawyer drove their hire car in from the airport culminating in a brief detour to capitol square to see the horsemounted statues of the three north carolinaborn statesmen whod risen to become united states presidents they were only five minutes late getting to reids offices just two streets away from the square and were ushered directly in the first person jordan saw before the waiting lawyer was alyce appleton she wore a dark grey trouser suit brightened by a pink sweater but it still reminded jordan of lesley corbins official business uniform alyce had on the dark framed spectacles too but the thin wedding band was no longer next to the diamond engagement ring she wore little makeup but jordan remembered she hadnt in the south of france jordans initial thought was how difficult it was to imagine the antipathy he now felt towards someone with whom he had so recently no more than three months he guessed made such uninhibited love looking more towards the two lawyers than the woman jordan said i didnt understand this was how it was going to be neither did i frowned beckwith turning accusingly towards the other lawyer it was obviously necessary for me to inform my client what was happening began reid and i insisted on being here as well broke in alyce a hint of uncertainty in her voice i saw no legal bar finished the raleigh lawyer he was a plump redfaced jowly man who needed the tightness of the waistcoat as well as the fastened jacket of his black pinstriped suit to hold in his stomach to prevent himself looking fatter than he was the owlround glasses looked precarious on his button nose it might have been better if wed discussed it earlier between the two of us said beckwith cautiously i thought we already had if your client can be present so can mine said reid an asthmatic catch in his voice were both present to guard against conflicting problems which i dont anticipate there being he looked at jordan do you have any objection to alyce being here daniel beckwith outmanoeuvred before theyd crossed the threshold of a court thought jordan feeling wrongfooted himself not if it will achieve more quickly what i want to be achieved youre the lawyers to judge it legally i want a written without prejudice understanding between us insisted beckwith as i do said reid with the attachment of a memorandum of agreement from your client alyce has already signed hers ive taken the liberty of having the documentation prepared something else done for him without his knowledge or agreement jordan recognized looking at beckwith who nodded jordan said ok by me he signed first and while the two lawyers were completing the formality he said to alyce hello belatedly hello neither smiled jordan said so much for not exchanging addresses im sorry about all of it about everything i really didnt know suspect its awful and i really am very sorry embarrassed too extremely embarrassed i thought i was going to be sorrier than i already am until late yesterday afternoon alyce frowned shaking her head i dont understand it wasnt until late yesterday afternoon that i got the allclear from the venerealogist alyce flushed visibly you surely didnt think of course i surely thought jordan cut her off mocking her words close to letting the anger erupt you really surprised that i surely thought this wasnt set up as a fight broke in reid jordan switched his attention his anger locked down pleased the way the reactions were coming what exactly was it set up for i dont believe i should be involved in this situation at all and want to be out of it dont want to go anywhere near a courthouse thats how it is all of how it is as far as i am concerned now tell me how i feature as far as you are concerned hed listened intently to himself not just to the words but to his tone and was sure beckwith wouldnt be able to accuse him of either losing his temper or his control it was alyce who responded ahead of her lawyer i dont believe you should be involved or need to go anywhere near a courthouse either thats why i wanted to be here just and only to tell you that and to say sorry which i already have now ive said both and hope you believe me theres no need for me to stay any longer if its a problem for you she stirred in her seat as if to get up there was an abrupt silence in the room each man looking to the other to his client reid said youre here now agreed to the confidentiality you might as well stay get some idea beyond whats briefly already been said whats going to come from harveys side talking directly to jordan not to her lawyer alyce said what do you want me to do get out and stop embarrassing you more than ive already embarrassed both of us or stay the embarrassment did surge through jordan at the awareness of how hed behaved why not stay alyce flushed again what about my apology do you believe and accept i didnt imagine youd become involved or are you determined to stay tightassed jordan stared at her for a long time before saying thank you for your apology at my becoming involved which i accept now what about you alyce pushed on positively red faced now how about an apology from you for actually believing contemplating for a moment that id put you at risk from what my bastard of a husband exposed me to you know what that makes me your thinking that it makes me sick to my stomach maybe our coming down wasnt such a good idea after all intruded beckwith were not achieving anything here lets all calm down drink some coffee or something urged reid we break up like this the winners going to be alfred appleton with us the losers were on the same side arent we id hoped we would be said alyce now im not so sure coffee or what bustled reid lets cool down compose ourselves alyce had tea the three men chose coffee reid led them all away from any formal setting to an annex to his office it was fitted with easy chairs and sofas and polished longleafed plants that seemed to survive in pots filled with wood chippings not earth there was another brief although less awkward silence then looking between jordan and alyce beckwith said ok youve each read the others initial statement and weve got the medical problem out of the way so lets move on from there shall we jordan seized the moment a lot of questions already formulated what about the court whether itll be an open or closed hearing we want it closed replied reid at once ive already intimated that to appletons people and to the court to what response none positively not yet said reid but bartle inferred theyd oppose it scare tactics judged beckwith thats what i think agreed read we can support your applications even though we cant initiate it beckwith promised which we will if i dont succeed in a pretrial submission to get harvey dismissed from the case which well support you in said reid he looked directly at jordan thats at alyces insistence before she and i talked about anything else thats one of the main reasons for my asking her to be here today thank you said jordan uncomfortably looking between the woman and her lawyer youre closer to the ground here than i am said beckwith talking to reid you any indication yet who our judge might be not officially said reid im guessing at pullinger ah said beckwith that doesnt sound as if youre pleased questioned jordan gauging the tone in both lawyers voices judge hubert pullinger prides himself on having the strongest and loudest moral voice not just in the county but in the entire state of north carolina far beyond that even explained reid whom i remember from when i practised here makes early preconceived judgements from which he can rarely be persuaded by contrary evidence or argument cant you apply for an alternative judge asked alyce hes also the senior judge on the circuit said her lawyer it would be about the worst move politically or tactically to try to make if he gets the case we have to live with it why are you guessing hell get it asked jordan he has first pick and this is his sort of case said reid i want to know something something very important demanded jordan coming to another query on his long list weve gone past never touched upon even what the hell criminal conversations are will someone set it or them out for me beyond saying that theyre expensive before deferring to reid beckwith briefly but with a hardfaced stare looked at jordan and reid intercepted the look the local lawyer coughed a hollow cough and said i guess thats a question for me its a question to anyone who can answer it said jordan reid coughed again in laymans language criminal conversation is judged as an injury to the person appletons in this case committed by you its whats technically known as a short liability tort whereby it is only necessary to prove and establish that sexual intercourse took place which both of you admit its also necessary to establish that a valid marriage existed which it did and that the suit is brought within statutory limitations which once more it is it is not a defence that the defendant you did not know that alyce was married that alyce consented to the act of sex that alyce was separated from appleton that alyce seduced you or that the marriage was an unhappy one or that the spouse appleton had been unfaithful completed beckwith in a breathless rush anxious to prove he knew the legislation as well as the other lawyer it took several moments for jordan to absorb it all and when he spoke he was still not sure that he had not completely shaking his head in disbelief he said this should have been spelled out at the very beginning while i was still in england from what youve just told me the two of you ive got absolutely no defence whatsoever against the claims that are being brought against me you asked for the law which you got said beckwith my job bobs job in alyces case is to advance arguments that fit your specific circumstances and persuade the judge that my interpretation of that law is in your favour which i think i can as i think i can came in reid i sure as hell hope you can said alyce you havent set out the law as specifically as that to me either until now i think i have said reid i dont refused alyce appletons surely the guiltier party said jordan he looked hesitantly at alyce im sorry about this talking as if youre not here but he has to be the person who gave alyce chlamydia and admits to two affairs there were more im sure said alyce all that time he spent by himself in manhattan he wasnt by himself in bed my first pretrial submission is going to be a court order for appleton to undergo a venereal examination said reid and our enquiry people are trying to find other women the more we get the more pullinger will come towards us ive now undergone two medical examinations said jordan and ive been told by both specialists that its a curable infection what if hes had treatment that theres no trace of his ever having had it im also going to apply for an order that his side produce his complete medical records if they wont do it voluntarily said reid and ive already asked bartle for them to be volunteered what about sharon borowski and leanne jefferies demanded beckwith reid shifted in his seat at the insistence sharon borowskis dead killed in an auto smash eleven months ago she no longer features leanne jefferies is another commodity dealer although not with appletons firm works for sears rutlidge thirty single as far as our enquiry people can discover it really was a short relationship as appleton says it was no indication of their still being together but were issuing criminal conversation claims against her of course as soon as i get the name of her lawyer thats going to be another court application as soon as i get a judge the bank records are selective beckwith pointed out already noted said reid at once ive filed for consecutive statements what about the money you gave him beckwith queried looking at alyce there must be a paper trail from your statements withdrawn in cash handed over to him in cash in tranches of varying amounts not a lump sum said alyce like being repaid in mercedes cars he told me it was better taxably for it all to be done in cash didnt it ever occur to you that you were being conned asked jordan the expert let me tell you about my husband said alyce quietvoiced analytical when i married him i thought he loved me which i dont think he ever did not at any time its difficult now for me to believe that i loved him but i think i did hes got a good act i certainly trusted him another mistake it took me a while to recognize him as a manipulating bully realizing that he was a cheat a cheat in every way took even longer long after he persuaded me to relinguish my position as chief executive of the parent bellamy foundation you want the analogy its easy if youll allow the cliche alfred jerome appleton is a jekyll and hyde everybodys friend everybodys helper the first with the biggest charity cheque all for the big reputation and the big benefit itll bring him cross him and hell run right over you squash you into the ground and enjoy doing it but no one knows that suspects it even and wont believe that its possible for him ever to be like that if we dont get a closed court itll be all my fault all my lies thats why hell be happy with an open court itll be a stage for him to perform on thats what he does every day performs puts on an act to appear someone other than who he really is jordan stirred in selfrecognition and had another thought even more selfindulgent as he heard beckwith say no chance that pullinger might know appleton have had some social contact what the hell demanded jordan prior knowledge or awareness would be grounds for disbarment explained his lawyer absolutely not said alyce in boston the entire state of massachusetts he probably knows every judge there is to know every important person there is to know but not down here thats something to bear in mind insisted beckwith what about you any chance your familys come into contact with pullinger same exclusion would apply not that im aware said alyce todays the first time ive heard the name i could ask my mother im living with her at the moment what about appletons claim in his statement that he provided financial support for your mother asked reid total nonsense rejected alyce the bellamy foundation dwarfs the appleton wealth ten times over i think it was around that time just after we got back from hawaii that i told him of my trust inheritance he didnt know you were an heiress before you got married asked beckwith seemingly surprised i dont think so said alyce it was something that never came up and when it did he asked you to lend him to help start his commodity business pressed reid it wasnt like that a flat demand for a half million qualified alyce he said it would help if he had some cash infusions from time to time which of course i gave him was happy to give him and then he asked for more which grew into another half a million which you were still happy to give him lend him insisted alyce things werent going well by then beginning to break down although i dont think i properly recognized what was happening at the time jordan wasnt having any difficulty recognizing anything his concentration and retention was absolute but it didnt preclude his thinking in parallel the feeling of dismissive antipathy towards alyce had gone replaced by the undiminished earlier embarrassment alyce appleton was someone hed briefly known become briefly but pleasurably involved with but never imagined encountering again now he was reunited by unsought circumstances what about right now at this precise moment jordan couldnt decide it all sounded as he supposed it should sound the necessary first meeting of lawyers the initial strategy discussion that beckwith had described it as being but jordan couldnt actually discern any strategy evolving objectively jordan acknowledged his attitude was driven by his overwhelming impatience matched by his overwhelming need to be rid of it all but he couldnt recognize any forward planning being formulated it was all backward looking not forwards a closing remark of alyces i came genuinely to think of him being seriously paranoid brought jordan conveniently back into the conversation why should he have had you followed as he obviously did all the way to france for the information he gathered about us there he must have engaged an army of private detectives that was my final confirmation about his being paranoid stressed the woman colouring again as she spoke i suppose he must have engaged them when i announced i was going ahead with the divorce she hesitated i was not involved with anyone here im still not so there was nothing for him to find here in america she gave an uncertain movement france happened she looked at jordan i wish it hadnt wish you hadnt got caught before jordan could speak reid said thats a point to pursue and i will as you should picked up beckwith hell have to call the people he put on to you we can take them back before france he looked to the other lawyer you can establish on oath what alyce has just said that she wasnt cheating before france and from that i can establish that there was no prior contact between alyce and harvey until france but france still happened said alyce but not until after youd sent me in a letter with a date on it in an envelope with a french postal date on it both of which ill submit as evidence instructions to file for your divorce as far as you were concerned your marriage was over it wasnt when your husband had his two admitted mistresses isnt that covered excused by all the caveats you explained earlier in the criminal conversation statute cut in jordan depends how i argue it insisted reid maybe there was a benefit to the meeting after all thought jordan he said what about after france do you think appleton would have had the surveillance maintained it might be something to pursue when we get to court said reid i dont see the point or purpose of continuing the expense said beckwith he had his evidence by then didnt he it wasnt the reassurance hed wanted but realistically there was no way either lawyer could say any more accepted jordan if he has hell know alyce and i have met again here today in the presence of your lawyers both of whom have legally attested the meeting in the without prejudice documentation beckwith pointed out it cant be used in any court hearing to any benefit to appleton which is why it was drawn up in the presence of your lawyers echoed reid to emphasize his following point just in case there is continuing surveillance i dont think it would be a good idea for you and alyce to get together in anything other than in our presence with which i fully concur said beckwith alyce snorted a derisive laugh one of the few things that we can be assured of at this stage is that the likelihood of that being on either of our minds just doesnt exist i agree to everything said jordan im still waiting though said alyce openly challenging jordan i really am sorry for the way i behaved earlier said jordan i wish i believed you said alyce it was just after nine that night when reids home telephone jarred in his den but he was still there waiting he said i was beginning to get worried wondering what had happened to you there were delays at your end and then we got stacked at la guardia said beckwith it was a goddamned awful trip back howd you think it went better than i thought it would after the rocky start i certainly dont think they knew each other before france neither do i agreed reid i hope we dont get pullinger ill keep on the case until we find out for sure i think theyll do well in court i was worried about jordan as you know i thought he did ok i thought alyce did too cant have been easy for her as jordan said talking about her as if she wasnt there cute little gal i envy him france we need appletons medical report insisted beckwith if hes infected we can both blow appleton out the water im worried about that admitted alyces lawyer its too obvious a weakness in his case i wrote to bartle after you left demanding the production of a specific report as well as the medical history and to leanne jefferies i dont imagine shes going to be so fond of appleton now that shes going to be sued for criminal conversation you think appleton could have an actual mental condition as alyce intimated it could help as much as the proof of chlamydia and should show on his medical history if i dont get what i want from bartle im definitely going to file for a precourt hearing assured reid jordan really make that good a living from gambling seems like it said beckwith i thought your guy made a good point about surveillance said reid i wish my people had produced as much on appleton as his people did on jordan and alyce in france theres still time we dont have a court date yet im glad were working together so am i lets keep in touch lets do that fourteen h arvey jordan decided there was no reason for him to have considered as wasted time the frustrating day hed spent in the carlyle suite waiting for the results of the american venerealogists examination he would have been distracted then not devoting his absolute concentration upon what he wanted to do and the preparations necessary to do it and the trip to raleigh had been a useful interval to think things through as well as the opportunity to put things right between himself and daniel beckwith today was the moment to start putting into practice the several decisions hed reached and become proactive to start to work in fact with just the slightest variation from normal not wanting to risk being followed to all the places of public record and reference that he might need to visit despite having so much useful information already available from the legal exchanges between the lawyers jordans first priority was to resolve the surveillance uncertainty how to do that had come to him during the raleigh meeting the most compelling reason for staying in grand hotels was the comprehensiveness of their services which he utilized by having someone from the carlyles guest assistance go out to buy the laptop he needed which had the double benefit of him not being seen to make the purchase if he were still being watched and further distancing him from it by having its purchase price registered against the hotel and not charged by name against him personally it took jordan the entire morning to configure the machine and put it online not through an american provider but through the british telecom yahoo broadband server he set up his payments through england too from the paul maculloch account at the royston and jones private bank from his previous lawful career harvey jordan had brought an unrivalled computer expertise to his new illegal career in which phishing was essential the first requirement for successful hacking was never to initiate a direct intrusion into another system but to work through an intervening unwitting cut out server the reason for such caution was twofold computer protection had become extremely sophisticated since its inception with many preventative systems utilizing tracing facilities to identify the source of a detected illegal entry attempt it was this unknowing cut out buffer computer system that showed up if jordans cyber burglary got ensnared in a firewall not jordans laptop the second advantage was that jordan only got charged for the cost of accessing his cut out everything he did through it was billed against the unsuspecting host having penetrated the host system like an intrusive cuckoo jordan then installed what in the selfexplanatory vernacular of the trade is known as a trojan horse over his years as an identity borrower jordan had successfully stabled his trojan horses in a number of illegal sites throughout the world unknown to the genuine owner and while he religiously destroyed the individual computers he only ever used for one identity stealing operation hed left his secret entry doors open to all the host sites creating a bank upon which he could draw without having to hack in to a new system that day he chose to return to a long term cuckoos nest in the mainframe of a beerdistributing company in darwin australia that he hadnt used for five years he still worked as carefully as he always did with every new job alert for the first indication that his previous presence might have been discovered during a virus or illegal entry sweep during his absence but there was no telltale hindrance or unexpected entry denied flash on his screen and the mile connection was made in seconds continuing on was easier than normal because he already had not just the publicly available website address of appleton and drake a few blocks away from where he sat in manhattan but alfred appletons personal registration entry code supplied in the exchanged legal documents by appleton himself jordan was effectively and electronically looking over appletons shoulder in three minutes and by another five had tied up a new untraceable trojan horse within appletons computer through which he could monitor every incoming and outgoing email the man had stored in the past and was likely to save in the future which was only the beginning of what turned out to be a very successful and productive day like the gambler he was supposed to be but wasnt jordan had hoped appleton would have conducted his correspondence with david bartle at brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein through his office facilities and so it turned out to be it took jordan a further thirty minutes to get into the law firms main computer system from which he moved on to embed a separate monitor in the lawyers personal machine he scrolled patiently through the inbox and sent box of bartles email service to discover the name of the ultraefficient private enquiry agency called unoriginally watchdog whose offices were downtown on elizabeth street in little italy jordan had been surprised by how easy it had been penetrating the computer systems of both appleton and bartle despite the advantages hed had from the legal documents but expected more difficulty entering that of watchdog he was surprised once more than it only took him another thirty minutes to get through the companys firewall and a further fifteen to get his trojan horse and his own password in place in the personal computer station of patrick oneill the director with whom bartle had conducted all his email correspondence jordan was cramped physically aching from the concentration with which hed worked without a break into the middle of the afternoon he still only allowed himself the briefest pause just long enough to walk through the suite to the bathroom to wash his face and make himself a tall vodka and tonic from the well equipped icemaker and glassbacked permanent bar in the suites living room excited at the possibility of being able to answer the most persistently nagging question since the entire episode began it took him much longer than the previous hacking because he had constantly to switch back and forth between in and out emails between bartle and oneill to maintain a comprehensive continuity between the exchanges and even then there were gaps which jordan assumed to be caused by the two men on occasions preferring the telephone to their computers as jordans understanding grew he learned that oneill had acted as an onthespot supervisor in france with a staff that at its height grew to ten with the addition of two photographers once theyd established the affair between him and alyce two of the watchdog staff had actually flown on the same plane as alyce from new york and dated before that flight to europe was a lengthy memorandum from oneill explaining that despite an intense two months surveillance in manhattan and east hampton they had failed to uncover any evidence whatsoever of alyce being involved with another man there were several references to him in france as being someone of obvious wealth and as someone who is very familiar with this area of france and finally jordan found what he was specifically looking for he guessed it was an email response from bartle to a telephone call which would have had to have taken place on the day alyce flew back to new york from nice maybe even from the airport itself the lawyer had written that oneill was to maintain the surveillance on jordan while he remained in france but that it shouldnt be continued back to england in that email bartle had written there is incontrovertible evidence of adultery sufficient for proceedings to be initiated and the expense in obtaining it has already been substantial satisfied that he was no longer under watchdog surveillance jordan quit the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon opening four separate accounts at the four other already chosen wall street banks in the name of alfred jerome appleton as with the first national he specified that he would be predominantly using electronic banking and provided the west nd street apartment as the mailing address to which bank and credit cards and cheque books should be delivered he used cash ranging from between to to establish the accounts anxious now that they were set up to get back to the carlyle for the first of the many intended phishing expeditions he got back into appletons personal computer by five thirty and through it using appletons unopposed never rejected password had the key electronically to pass through every door to wander wherever he chose within the firm of appleton and drake a tour jordan both professionally and logically accepted was too much to attempt in one visit too much possibly to complete over a number of visits but there was no hurry the initial priority was to establish the value of the company which again at this first visit was impossible to calculate what wasnt impossible though was to confirm that it ran into millions of contracts bought short or long all set out like prizes in a raffle to which he held all the winning tickets apart from appleton and his partner peter drake there were five additional traders and between them after the briefest journey through the combined buy and sell portfolios jordan conservatively estimated there were more than already logged trades going through the entire gamut of the companys range from metals its major activity through its currency cereal and chicago meat subsidiaries jordan had only twice before stolen the identity of a commodity trader but from that experience he knew the basic trading operations the most important of which was that any buyorsell contracts agreed by traders were doublechecked and confirmed by the back office a secondary doublechecking filter to prevent any contract being overlooked beyond its regulated three month completion date but once it was checked and registered and most important of all dated it remained on the traders book until it was moved on which meant after the back office confirmation the lid to every cookie jar was open to him to plunder at will that night he limited his targetting stings concentrating upon currency contracts because of all the commodities they fluctuated the most sometimes by the hour and therefore were the most difficult to track he further limited himself on this first visit to a transfer to the first national bank account and even more strictly limited the amounts all of them less than five hundred dollars he electronically transferred from four twodayold currency trades each in excess of one million dollars from which five hundred dollars would not be detectable nor swell the initial fake appleton account beyond what the bank were legally required to automatically report to the financial regulating authorities the following day jordan determined the taps would be opened more fully to fill all five accounts at last closer to exhaustion that he could remember for a long time jordan closed down the laptop and pushed himself back from the bureau to go to the bar to make himself another celebratory drink putting on room lights as he did so he carried his glass to an easy chair needing its relaxing softness gazing out unseeingly over the jewellerybox glitter of the manhattan night he shook his head at the memories of all the unnecessary timewasting scurrying around london he did in order to avoid any potential surveillance when there had been nothing or no one to avoid or from whom to hide and then he laughed recognizing how frenetic he would have seemed if people had been watching him it might have all been unnecessary and timewasting and he didnt like being made to scurry like a frightened rabbit but he was glad hed taken the precautions there was even a positive benefit his own money was now far better hidden than it had been and pointless though most of it had proved to be it had been a useful if exhausting lesson as hed reflected before he had definitely become complacent dangerously believing things could never go wrong to upset his perfect life which he certainly didnt believe any longer but he was correcting the situation now jordan told himself looking across the room at the blankeyed computer proactive at last thinking for himself in charge in control of himself before this was all over there were going to be people appleton in particular whod fervently wish that he werent so in control jordan started work again early the following day first reentering the available golden goose of appleton and drake and again from the already dated currency trades spreading in transfers between his five appleton bank accounts next he got into his own law firms computer to leapfrog into daniel beckwiths personal station staying there long enough to read the exchanges about himself between beckwith and lesley corbin in london and then between beckwith and reid in raleigh he was intrigued to read lesleys early opinion of him as arrogant although knocked off his feet being caught with his pants around his ankles a position in which it is always difficult to remain upright and the correspondence between her and the american lawyer questioning the income possible from professional gambling it was lesley too who had first suggested he would need repeated instructions on how to conduct himself in court to avoid antagonizing a judge or jury shed again used the word arrogant jordans need for court training was referred to once more in the correspondence between beckwith and reid of more interest to jordan was the email discussion between the two american lawyers about potential damage awards with one suggestion from reid that if there were individual judgements against jordan on each listed claim the total adjudication could go as high as twelve million dollars reids qualification in reality i cant see it reaching half that figure if all awards go against him didnt do anything to reassure jordan neither did beckwiths response a sum in either of those amounts would inevitably attract national if not international publicity beckwith had written and from what we already know from our preliminary enquiries both the appleton and bellamy families have a recognized social and financial standing on the east coast which is an added publicity attraction my client is anxious to avoid publicity as you tell me your client is which makes it imperative we establish as soon as possible who the judge is going to be if it is someone who enjoys notoriety as i remember several did from the time of my practising in raleigh there might be a difficulty in you successfully arguing for a closed hearing we need to liaise closely on this point jordan was curious that there had been no exchange between the two men following the raleigh conference quickly correcting his impatience with the selfreminder of how recent it had been whenever it came and for as long as he required it in the future he had this permanently open window into their every thought into every thought of anyone with whom he found himself entangled except alyce he corrected himself sharply her lawyer would have been the obvious pathway but nowhere in the mans computer address book could jordan locate any email exchanges between reid and alyce and so successful and unobstructed had his entry been into all the other computer systems that there was a blip of positive disappointment at his not being able to worm his way into the last of his targets hed been wrong about all his suspicions of alyce jordan acknowledged not even having to force the unfamiliar honesty hed been wrong about believing she might in some way be complicit with her husband in trying to get money from him wrong in imagining that she would have exposed him to the sexual complaint with which shed been infected and wrong to have made his hostility so blatantly obvious towards her during the raleigh encounter objectively continuing the honesty jordan accepted that he had been as much the cause of alyces misfortune as she was guilty of being his judging from what he had just read of appletons efforts to uncover alyces infidelity to compensate for his own if he had not so deliberately set out to seduce her appleton would have wasted even more money having her pursued by the inappropriately named watchdog fully aware of the contradictions and inconsistencies there were in the vocation he followed jordan would have been the last to claim that he suffered a conscience from his actions and certainly didnt consider that conscience was part of what he was feeling now but there was at least a genuine regret at behaving as he had towards her in raleigh maybe he thought there would be other opportunities to apologize there had been several times in the past working as successfully in america as he had in england when jordan had actually considered relocating permanently to the united states everything he needed to adopt and take advantage of a new identity was so much more easily and publicly accessible in the states if a person knew how and where to look which jordan did upon application the essential and identityproving social security number was readily available so essential that it was more often than not printed as a guaranteed payee authenticity along with full addresses upon personal cheques which was why he had included appletons on all five accounts hed opened in the traders name as he knew from the legal exchanges it was on appletons bank record determined upon avoiding any conceivable error on this very particular occasion he confirmed it as he accessed all the social register entries in boston through the public library reference books and the archives of the boston globe through this he learned the appleton family history from the boston tax rebellion that was the incendiary to the war of independence to the marriage of alfred appletons parents from the records of which he doublechecked the family name of the commodity dealers mother from the same sources he got the names of the mans prep schools prior to harvard into which he phished to learn that precollege as well as at harvard appleton had been considered dilatory and disinterested in anything other than sailing through the harvard records jordan discovered three police references to drunken driving offences none with conclusions all presumably minimized into cautions due to his family money and influence it was while he was scrolling through the final harvard records crossreferencing dates wherever possible that jordan began to be troubled by an inconsistency that he could not immediately isolate but which remained in his mind as he forced himself on it was not until he had downloaded everything on to hard copy and was crossreferencing from all his various sources that it became obvious to him although the basic mystery remained even more tantalizing jordan realized that he had assembled virtually enough information about alfred jerome appleton to write the mans biography but missing from any publicly available source jordan had so far accessed was what appleton had done in the three years after his harvard graduation how where and doing what had appleton spent that time jordan wondered and wondered further how much it would benefit him to find out which he would jordan thought adding this to his list of determinations and then he thought that alyce would probably know fifteen but there again she might not jordan accepted he would still have liked to ask her in the hope she could provide a short cut to the information but didnt think he could or should so soon after the lawyers warning in raleigh against he and alyce meeting alone to which she might not have agreed anyway and there was the problem of providing a reason for asking the question although that was not insurmountable instead after his early morning and now regularly timed raid upon appleton and drakes easily available gold mine jordan escaped the entombment of the previous two days in his hotel room to take up the search in his preferred way of working by walking the corridors of the reference section of the new york public library beginning in its milstein genealogical division at first it appeared to be a good route because the library is the largest sourced library in the world the history of the appleton family of boston was far more extensive than any he had been able to access from his laptop particularly the details of appletons sailing prowess which was recorded with several indexed newspaper and yachting magazine reports jordan logged each and when he had completed primary source searches worked his way steadily through the miscrofiched copies of thirtyfive different publications from them alfred appleton began to emerge a world class yachtsman predicted not just as a potential us olympic team choice but also as an obvious selection for the american team that competed in the americas cup in the date rang an immediate bell in jordans mind was the second of the missing three years the final reference to alfred appleton was in the yacht in its february edition of that year the twoline item recorded appletons withdrawal for personal reasons from among those on the selection list jordan switched from where he was working to access the records of the new york yacht club the america cups governing body appleton was named four times in the selection procedures in late without explanation the mans name dropped out of the list in november of that year the only other mention was the same as that in the yacht of appletons withdrawal again there was no offered explanation other than the amorphous personal reasons was he trying too hard jordan asked himself so outraged at his entrapment that he was too eager to attach importance where none existed it was years although not too many before appletons marriage to alyce so those personal reasons were too far in the past to have any possible relevance now or did they still have relevance if the characteristics of honesty or integrity or moral rectitude or whatever other words covered personal behaviour appletons not his still applied jordan still wanted to know he still wanted a fully supplied and primed arsenal of every available weapon at his disposal for the battles wars even with which he might conceivably be confronted or have others declare against him but who to fire these supposed weapons he couldnt not yet he was the unwilling conscript pressganged on to a battlefield upon which he didnt want to be and upon which he couldnt officially shoot back at those who were shooting at him others beckwith or reid or both had to press the triggers which meant they had to be led to where the ammunition was hed come in at the end to fight his own already decided and increasingly wellplanned guerilla campaign not needing anyone elses help or company guerilla campaigns relied upon intelligence the sort of intelligence he was assembling he was sure there was still some maybe a lot that alyce could provide how really difficult would it be to seduce her a second time the difference being that they both kept their clothes on calling upon a sailing analogy jordan decided that he was stuck in the doldrums becalmed by circumstances with no forward movement after such an initial fair wind this was surely because it had been such a good beginning he acknowledged pleased at the quickness of the balancing awareness hed achieved so much because so much had been literally handed to him on a plate in days instead of his having to probe and scour for weeks or months so he consoled himself thoughts of doldrums and becalming was nothing more than stupid impatience he continued to access his strategic computer monitors disappointed but no longer impatient at the absence of any further traffic involving the impending divorce action it was an afterthought which surprised him for it not having occurred before to occupy some of the time towards the end of the week expanding what he already knew of the bellamy family which took him back to the new york librarys reference section what it lacked in terms of noted and recorded american history it compensated for in longevity with forefathers predating the appleton arrival in the new world by a good seventy years a nathaniel bellamy was recorded as having fought in the battle of yorktown in and a william bellamy briefly served on the personal staff of george washington although there was no cited historical event accredited to either man there were however substantial and continuing listings of over three hundred years of bellamys whod served in the north carolina legislature and five alyces grandfather being the most recent who had been elected senators to congress in washington it was the grandfather who had founded the bellamy foundation which was described as one of the largest charitable groupings in the country the printed records contained no reference apart from her birth to alyce until her marriage to appleton the concentration then had inevitably been on the bonding between the two american founding families all the details of which jordan already knew the one relevant and contradictory fact that did stand out to jordan was the substantial land holdings throughout the state predominantly in forsyth rowan macon allamance and durham counties of the bellamy family which made nonsense of appletons claimed offer of financially supporting alyces widowed mother jordan wondered if reid had picked up on that or had it properly pointed out by alyce to refute the need impudence even for such a suggestion when the case finally reached court on the friday morning with an empty weekend before him and no contact from daniel beckwith jordan decided to go again to atlantic city and during the drive there made up his mind to call the lawyer on his monday return if there was no likelihood of any active court movement he could use the following week to go back to england and ensure no problems had arisen with the paul maculloch identity and the rental of the hans crescent flat with the uncertainty of everything here in america it would be a sensible precaution to extend that lease for a further six months pullinger announced reid shit said beckwith its scarcely a surprise said the north carolina lawyer hope you dont mind my calling at a weekend instead of waiting until monday im glad you did no point in holding back said beckwith you got the official notification a friendly call from the circuit office im getting the formal notification in mondays mail i guess ill get one too you should do what about a hearing date still to be fixed i guess this puts me first out of the gate said beckwith i had pullingers record checked hes heard three alienation of affection and criminal conversation cases each time hes refused pretrial submissions for dismissal i ran the same checks said beckwith ive still got to try it of course you have agreed the other lawyer ill file for an attendance of interest obviously you heard any more from bartle id have passed it on if i had i might also apply to pullinger for a compliance of exchange order particularly over the medical records the more we can get pullinger irritated by the behaviour of the other side the better agreed beckwith what about leanne jefferies as soon as i get an attorneys response im issuing alyces claim for alienation of affections and criminal conversation said reid and a medical report for her prompted beckwith the demand will go with the other claims anything more from your enquiry people id have passed it on if there had been we should meet again sometime next week i guess its my turn to come up to you offered reid you going to include harvey hes very handson and the more hes included in things the better i think hell perform in court if the dismissal submission fails i might talk to the circuit office about availability for a closed hearing said reid its not dependent upon whether you succeed or not the sooner the better said beckwith the moment theres a public listing the media are going to be alerted you warned alyce against any public comment i have although it wasnt really necessary she wants to dig a hole and go hide in it how about your boy beckwiths snigger became a laugh hes a tetchy sonofabitch about what and how hes called to be referred to as my boy would send him ape he certainly doesnt need any warning about talking to the press hed like to go hide in the same hole as alyce which was the start of both their troubles reminded reid coarsely you got your diary with you to talk about next week your convenience offered beckwith wednesday chose the other lawyer i might stay over ill leave the evening free in case harveys at the carlyle incidentally high roller commented reid thats what he tells me he is lets hope he stays lucky lets hope we all stay lucky getting pullinger wasnt lucky reminded reid luckier beckwith corrected himself jordan picked up the waiting message slips as he checked back in to the carlyle and returned beckwiths call the moment he entered his suite beckwith said i tried to get you a couple of times i went to atlantic city howd you do finished up over the two days and got accredited receipts for a total of representing the money hed taken in to the casinos and switched back and forth between dollars and chips he reminded himself more than satisfied with the trip as he was more than satisfied with the accumulation in the five appleton accounts in the wall street banks which now stood at the following morning he intended withdrawing most of it to put into the waiting safedeposit boxes weve got pullinger the judge we didnt want declared beckwith i was going to call you today to tell you i was thinking of briefly going back to england see how things are there you still can nothings going to happen except bob coming up on wednesday to talk a few things through bring ourselves up to date ill put it back decided jordan at once id like to be with you i thought you would theres no real reason though ill be there insisted jordan and lay out as many leads as i can for you to pick up he thought your choice will alyce be there i dont know why just wondered dismissed jordan where on wednesday what time ill let you know he had a day and a half to get all his ideas together for the meeting thought jordan more than enough time sixteen the surprise wasnt that the new york meeting was in beckwiths office but that alyce was again ahead of him and that jordan was pleased to see her he said hello yet again and she smiled very briefly but didnt speak to the two lawyers jordan said im sorry to be late i allowed myself fortyfive minutes i dont know how you manage to work at all in manhattan its an art form said beckwith so how bad is it that we got pullinger asked jordan as he sat beckwith sighed you want coffee id rather catch up on what ive missed you havent missed anything said reid as irritated at jordans impatience as the other lawyer we smalltalked waiting for you jordan was aware of alyce smiling again and this time wished she hadnt thank you coffee would be good as well as his not appearing so anxious would have been good he realized hed been thoroughly pissed off by the gridlock and the time it had taken him to stash his bank account money into the safedeposit boxes neither of which were causes for him flustering in as he had he smiled his thanks to suzie when she came in with his coffee which he didnt really want wondering how she managed to breathe in her secondskin virginal white trousers and top so lets pick up on your question began beckwith were stuck with pullinger which is bad luck but something we have to live with what we really have to do is use the cantankerous old son of a bitch more to our advantage than to appletons he turned to alyce i guess weve already covered the ground but were going to have to talk about your husband as if hes the enemy ok as far as i am concerned he is the fucking enemy so lets stop apologizing for something that doesnt need or deserve apology responded alyce there was a brief although not actually shocked silence and jordan was glad that her impatience had risen to match his hoping she took his smile as appreciation not condescension as in raleigh they were away from an official working area there were more polished plants than in reids annex and a skyscraper view uptown towards the unseen park all the sepia photographs on the wall were of early american settlers and native americans most in full tribal regalia which jordan supposed was fitting for someone of alyces ancestry and beckwiths dress code lets do just that said beckwith recovering i got the formal notification on monday and the same day filed for a pretrial dismissal hearing on our part i havent yet got an acknowledgement obviously he paused gesturing to reid and ive filed for court acceptance to be party to each and every prehearing application as well as making our own applications the first is for court enforcement of our being supplied with appletons medical records the second again against appleton which is the only legal way open to me is to enforce leanne jefferies upon risk of contempt to comply with the demands of alyces damages claim by providing an attorney reference once i have her lawyer through whom to work i can apply for her medical records to establish if she was a sufferer from chlamydia what about the other admitted mistress sharon borowski broke in jordan his script as well he hoped as its presentation well prepared during the preceding day and a half reid frowned appearing irritated at having been interrupted i already told you shes dead the result of a car accident not a sexual disease broke in jordan again looking directly at the north carolina lawyer bad luck sharon rest in peace but if appleton caught it off her not leanne got himself fixed and leanne is provably clean who gave it to alyce i didnt which we can prove which leaves your case that alyce didnt have any lovers previous to me shot to bits before you even begin dont you think bob from the reaction from both lawyers jordan thought it was turning into a conference without words clearly it was a possibility neither had considered eventually beckwith said thats a damned good point i suppose pullinger could order the production of sharon borowskis medical records said reid although doubtfully there was an asthmatic catch in his voice do doctors keep medical records of people whove died asked alyce quietly i wouldnt have thought so what i do think is that it could be one great big problem for us finally admitted reid doctors might not keep medical records jordan pointed out police or coroners might if she died in a traffic accident there would have been an autopsy wouldnt there with a pathology report lets hope there was and that the medical examination went beyond finding the immediate cause of death said reid he was talking now with a discernible wheeze the lawyer was embarrassed by his oversight jordan knew as the man deserved to be jordan didnt expect any more criticism from his own attorney for playing amateur advocate could pullinger refuse to hear a dismissal submission if he did we could appeal over his head so he wont said beckwith he looked towards alyce im going to need to call you of course of course she accepted itll be an opportunity to bring out things that appletons attorney might object to being introduced during your full hearing picked up reid talking to his client thats why i want participation access like the missing three years questioned jordan seizing the obvious opening theyd judge him a total smartass after today but jordan didnt give a damn because it was his own ass he was trying to save and that was his only consideration there was none of the earlier initial irritation at jordans intervention from the two lawyers although beckwith said why do i think were going to be found wanting again ive got little else to do here but read the statement exchanges and think about whats there and whats not there said jordan weighing each word before he spoke determined against being caught out himself ive spent some time in the library reading reference books theres a lot about the appleton and bellamy families and their lineage appleton left harvard a golden boy no suggestion of a job apart from representing his country in the olympics and being part of the americas cup team it wasnt a question of if hed be selected it was a done deal except it didnt become that appleton withdrew for personal reasons from any consideration of selection for either the olympics or the americas cup jordan was talking to alyce now you any idea what those personal reasons were heres a guy always in the papers society superstar and then abruptly nothing for about three years until he joins his first wall street brokerage firm before breaking away to set up his own commodity businesses about six months before marrying you for several moments alyce remained looking contemplatively into her lap i didnt know him in the early nineties although i knew of him of course and youre right he was the golden boy and there was the expectation of him sailing in the olympics and for the cup no one ever really knew why he pulled out of either he pulled out pressed jordan werent there any rumours didnt you ever ask him after you got married i cant remember them all but there were a lot of rumours said alyce there was something about a girl but that was an obvious speculation he had the pick of the crop and i did ask him after we got married he said he didnt want to talk about it but that hed had a nervous breakdown that had to be kept under wraps that no one would trust a nut whod needed psychiatric treatment to handle their money whats the point youre getting to harvey queried beckwith as alyce says it was before she knew him wheres the relevance with what were dealing with now maybe there isnt any conceded jordan at once but doesnt character and morality and integrity feature a lot in what were dealing with now why would a man guaranteed to feature to represent his country in the two most outstanding events of his chosen sport abruptly back off because he got sick like alyce just said suggested reid jordan stared at the lawyer letting the seconds build into minutes dont you think its worth having your enquiry guys poke around a little ask questions find out if its true i do so do i for whatevers discovered said alyce youve forgotten the conversation we had in raleigh about my believing he had a mental problem it could account for a lot of his behaviour still could like suggesting alyces family might need his financial support when from what alyce tells us was the reverse when he set up on his own said jordan snatching for another point didnt he have family money of his own you establish hes a fantasist you establish he fantasized about alyce having affairs to excuse his own you seem to have been working hard on this accused reid irritation returning harder than me or the people i employ to find out things for me im not in any sort of contest with you or anyone you employ rejected jordan and im not trying to prove anything ive got every good reason to work harder than anyone else and you can count them all in dollars your enquiry people letting you down fire them and get better ones reid flushed his face hardening further im not trying to get into an argument with you here i just told you neither am i insisted jordan i thought this was a conference to exchange ideas to help all of us which it is beckwith hurried in you got any other specific thoughts or ideas nothing specific said jordan there might even be a benefit from upsetting reid assessed from the preceding hour the lawyer certainly needed to try harder than he appeared to have done so far weve started to get the media approaches disclosed reid anxious to move on ive had calls from the news and observer and from nbc theyve tried to reach me too at the house in raleigh said alyce i havent returned the calls obviously i told them it was a closed matter continued reid nothings appeared so far the uncertainty is what appletons side will say publicly ive told bartle im going to file for a closed court confirmed it in writing too in the hope that will restrict whatever appletons people might say if they make a statement ahead of my application knowing that im going to make it pullinger might consider it contempt which would be in our favour you spoke to bartle by phone first asked beckwith yes nodded reid didnt he give any indication if theyd oppose it he said he hadnt been called by the media but didnt know if appleton had that he hadnt heard from him and that theyre having a meeting today as we are theyve received notification of pullingers appointment as we have howd he sound asked jordan reid humped his shoulders frowning were on opposing sides he didnt sound like anything if you mean did we talk in any detail we didnt i made it sound like i was offering a favour warning him about pullingers possible reaction which i might reinforce said beckwith contemplatively i havent informed bartle im filing for dismissal pullinger could consider it contempt if either bartle or appleton spoke in advance of that hearing too he smiled around the room in fact thats what i will do telephone him today and follow it up with a couriered letter hell get before today ends hes meeting appleton today reminded jordan unnecessarily you do it right now you give him the opportunity to warn appleton off from saying anything now it was beckwith who let the seconds build before saying thanks for the prompt harvey were all of us anxious to button down on publicity right now was exactly when i was going to break off to make the call leave alyce and you and bob to maybe have some more coffee talk among yourselves fuck you thought jordan refusing the intended intimidation its good to hear were all moving in the same direction daniel ill pass on more coffee though as beckwith left the conference annex alyce said to her lawyer how long before we actually get to court get to the end of it all we get to the end when we get to the end said reid clumsily im not going to agree an actual hearing date i dont mind how many postponements i get because of appletons awkwardness because every difficulty he creates is to our advantage with a judge like pullinger i let one thing go because were in too much of a hurry he was talking not to his client but directly to jordan through impatience and the wish to get everything out of the way as quickly as possible the more youre at risk both of you of coming out the guilty parties and like youve already told me harvey youre counting that risk in dollar signs he had to allow the other man some recovery jordan decided take as much time as is necessary to get it absolutely right thats precisely what im going to do insisted reid what dan and i are going to do between us get everything absolutely right reid had recovered enough thought jordan to alyce he said you living permanently back in raleigh now mostly i might stay over a few days here having come up for this check the apartment out theres got to be a lot of mail i postponed going back to london because of today ill probably go back in a day or two and im sorry about before that day in raleigh i was out of order her obvious surprise matched that of her lawyer alyce said you already apologized for raleigh today its my idea to do so alyce smiled uncertainly thank you daniel beckwith returned noisily from his outer office his jacket discarded elsewhere yellow legal pad notes bunched in either hand bartle isnt seeing appleton until later this afternoon so the timing was perfect he took the point of the call several points in fact told me hed obviously be at the dismissal application anticipating that hed be instructed to oppose it he mention my call asked reid not a word about it said beckwith what impression did you get asked jordan inferring that this latest legal exchange had been more productive than that with reid that neither he nor appleton had expected you to defend the action replied beckwith smiling i played it for him to come to me which he did he seemed surprised that you were here in new york that i wasnt representing you in absentia so surveillance still hadnt been reestablished jordan immediately deduced is that good or bad good for us opens the door for me to challenge everything thats claimed against you as well as against alyce if my dismissal is rejected and the main hearing proceeds with leanne jefferies additionally brought into the action we dont actually have an outright defence youve both admitted the adultery but it strengthens the point provides the strong mitigation that bob hit on in raleigh that as far as you were both concerned alyces marriage to appleton was over jordan hesitated his mind on what hed illegally read in patrick oneills report of the watchdog agencys failure to find any evidence of alyce having lovers in manhattan or long island you know who appletons enquiry agency is still waiting to be told said reid jordan held out a calming hand towards the north carolina lawyer were not in competition remember but whoever they are they must have been watching alyce here in america and found nothing which they would have done if there was anything to find judging from the completeness of their observations in france thats surely in alyces favour part of the mitigation even im not sure it goes as far as the mitigation but its a point i thought wed already touched on said reid nothings going to go unchallenged but theres a danger in the very word you used completeness in what they achieved in france itll be a narrow path to walk but im obviously going to walk it the man paused looking at the other lawyer im not sure whether it does more harm than good to your case neither am i agreed beckwith philosophically but the rules are the rules your primary responsibility is to your client my primary responsibility is to mine we both do what we have to do that hadnt ended up as hed intended acknowledged jordan there was still more than enough time to improve upon it he was encouraged at appletons lawyer being wrongfooted by him personally contesting the claims if indeed bartle had been wrongfooted he only had beckwiths impressions from one end of a telephone conversation the two lawyers had continued talking during jordans reflections but to all practical purposes they were technically establishing between themselves although always consulting alyce and jordan on their availability the precedence of prehearing submissions and unfulfilled exchange demands to bartle to be made individually between the two of them twice when they werent part of any discussion alyce smiled at jordan on the first occasion mouthing thank you which jordan didnt understand it had gone six before they finally broke off jordan holding back for alyce and reid to leave the building separately and ahead of him still in the annex beckwith said i thought everything went very well i want everything to go better than very well said jordan i want everything to go completely in our favour hes an arrogant son of a bitch accused reid suddenly hes a trial lawyer i told you he was arrogant before you met reminded beckwith the points he made were valid though they were eating in a restaurant in little italy a cavern filled with noise making it difficult for them to hear each other and impossible to be overheard by others wed have got it covered insisted reid he covered it first said beckwith i prefer clients who think for themselves instead of expecting me to do everything for them you really think bartle was surprised at your thirdparty involvement i even thought at one stage he was going to suggest a pretrial consultation between us to slim down the claims to an agreed settlement guessed reid theres an argument for doing so as you said at the meeting the adultery is admitted do you think jordan would go for it hes made the point a few times that gamblers dont gamble if he got the possibility of millions pared down to a few thousand but with the guilt legally established it might appeal to him he gestured towards the other lawyer you just dropped spaghetti sauce down your tie reid scrubbed at himself with his napkin his head still bent he said that would kind of divide us wouldnt it and be a clever legal move for bartle to make what are you going to do nothing wait for him to come to me like i told you its only my guess when are you going to file your dismissal submission tomorrow everythings ready so we could get a submission date set as early as next week not if bartle hasnt complied with all the exchanges and were still waiting on leanne jefferies i really cant see why hes holding back on appletons medical stuff unless it proves appleton was or is infected if it does appletons case is holed below the waterline insisted beckwith it cant be that simple then why demanded reid i dont know admitted beckwith when i file for dismissal im going to make the point that if i lose the submission i cant proceed to full hearing until ive received everything thats legally got to be exchanged did you tell bartle that it was when i told him exactly that i thought he was going to offer negotiation maybe youve put a fox into the hen coop rather me doing it to him than the reverse his doing it to us you going to mention it to harvey not unless i get the approach from bartle theres no point until i do id like to hear the moment you do it could affect everything as far as i am concerned of course youll know if it happens beckwith pointed across the table youve dropped some more sauce jordan recognized alyces voice the moment he picked up the telephone in his carlyle suite hello he said in reply to her opening pleased the curiosity didnt sound in his voice i want to say thank you again for what you did today said today a lot of things wouldnt have been brought out if you hadnt been there change your lawyer if youre not happy offered jordan hes the best there is in raleigh which doesnt say much for raleigh from being with you in france i wouldnt have thought you were this ruthless this isnt france and were not having an adventure this is reality with blood on the floor i wish it wasnt alyce countered you and me both how did you know i was here at the carlyle bob told me he showed me your statement too why did you tell me you were an investment banker when youre not i thought it sounded better more respectable we werent being respectable jordan hesitated considering his reply and now look where we are if you dont get dismissed from the case i want to take full responsibility in court you discussed that with bob no dont you think you should it might screw up the way hes going to argue your case i did use you to get my own back on alfred and told me as much in france you didnt know all this was going to happen hed have to tell beckwith what she was saying offering it might do more to harm than help his defence although he couldnt think how well see you going to make the trip back to england i think so you going to stay on here in manhattan i think so when will you be back i dont know i shouldnt need more than a day in london i can fly back here on the last flight the second night i want it all to be over soon you said you dont mind my calling of course i dont im sorry you got caught up in everything like this alyce apologized you said that too more than once take care and you try to think more about the three years immediately after your husband left harvard there was a pause from alyces end of the line before she said you have this number no you have a pen yes she dictated it and added call me when you get back i will promised jordan he knew from accessing the computers of appleton and his enquiry agency that they werent under surveillance any more so they didnt have to bother about their lawyers warnings about being together seventeen harvey jordan extended his intended absence from new york by twelve hours getting back into manhattan by the middle of the third day there were three messages waiting for him at his carlyle suite which hed maintained to provide just such a contact point one was from daniel beckwith the other two were from alyce before responding to any of them jordan checked his intrusion traps which were undisturbed and after that settled before his laptop at the bureau and steadily worked his way through his illegal trojan horses none of which hed accessed from london adhering strictly to the unbreakable operational rule never to cast his phishing nets from more than one dedicated computer he was particularly careful going into the system of appleton and drake alert for any indication that his entry had been picked up on which there wasnt still preying on the currency trades he spread almost between his five accounts from beckwiths system jordan was easily able to infer contact from legal representation of both alfred appleton and leanne jefferies through the exchanges between his lawyer and alyces even though they were disjointed and incomplete because the two attorneys were obviously communicating irritatingly sometimes by email and on other occasions by telephone jordans further even more irritating discovery was that leanne jefferies was being represented by brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein the same firm engaged by appleton but by a different partner leannes lawyer was peter wolfson whose name was listed directly below that of appletons attorney david bartle on the company letterhead jordan ignored the immediate disappointment quickly switching to his trojan horse stabled in the brinkmeyer system in his search for electronic correspondence between wolfson and bartle as hed feard there wasnt any jordan finally allowed the frustration to burst over him physically hot if bartle and wolfson were going to discuss everything between themselves within their own madison avenue building which was clearly and most naturally what they would do apart from occasional but so far uninitiated email contact with either beckwith or reid there was no possibility of him eavesdropping on their thoughts or strategies objectively acknowledging his overexpectation jordan had still imagined he could sit upon the highest pinnacle overlooking everyones manoeuvrings and scrabblings always to be ahead of every opposing move what he had precisely with all his computer entries was the best spot in the foothills still sufficient still enough but only just not by any assessment as complete as he wanted his monitoring to be but then he hadnt yet accessed every site open to him still hopeful jordan followed his wellmarked trail into every other hidden observation point in every other invaded computer but found no further revelations finally slumping back in the overpadded chair hed hoped for so much more some closely guarded confidence confessions or admissions even between the lawyers and their clients that he could have turned to his advantage he at least knew things were moving forwards for the moment but not much more than a moment he had to be satisfied jordan was connected at once to daniel beckwith who said welcome back i hear theres more money in the pot more for my benefit than yours thought jordan he supposed he shouldnt be surprised by the quickness with which lesley corbin had alerted beckwith to his visit to chancery lane to deposit a further fifty thousand dollars she was the essential conduit after all but he was i thought it was a good idea whats happened here while i was away weve got our pretrial submission hearing next wednesday said the american we need to meet before then obviously and travel down on the tuesday there was a pause you want suzie to make your hotel reservation along with mine or do you want to do it yourself the hotel choice isnt great beckwith had been curbed jordan recognized well need to be together in the same hotel id be grateful for suzie doing it at the same time as she books yours what other developments have there been leanne is being represented by the same people who are looking after appleton although obviously not by the same attorney shes contesting bobs claim of criminal conversation why hadnt he found that on reids computer wondered jordan an official legal and lengthily argued rebuttal on original courtsubmitting papers he guessed he still thought there would have been some email reference he could have picked up upon jordan was discomfited at the possibility of more windows being shut against him hows that affect us it doesnt directly her lawyer is a guy named wolfson pete wolfson bob hasnt yet got their official response just a phone call telling him theyre opposing it what about medical records promised by the weeks end ive already filed for a court order demanding production in case it doesnt arrive by then even if it does itll form part of the record for pullinger to realize their reluctance there doesnt seem to be any point in our meeting until friday at the earliest then suggested jordan the medical stuff doesnt directly impact upon our application beckwith pointed out were not reliant upon it one way or the other at this stage i want to be as up to date as possible insisted jordan you will be assured beckwith he was appearing too anxious again accepted jordan what about media interest increasing replied beckwith i got a call from the london times the day before yesterday bobs hoping to get his closed court hearing next week too depending upon the length of ours which technically has to precede what bob does i dont see why we should need more than one day although pullinger could reserve judgement which shouldnt stand in bobs way even if pullinger refuses my submission did the times have my name demanded jordan alarmed thats all thats listed nothing else that could identify you said beckwith i refused to talk about anything answer any questions they must know im english to have called in the first place your being english wasnt the direction of their approach it was all about the breakup of two of the oldest american colonial families they could get the lead from appletons side said jordan more to himself than to the other man he should have warned the london concierge john blake he still could although not today it was pm in england blake would have left the building by now it had to be his first telephone call tomorrow i warned bartle about contempt reminded beckwith they wouldnt be risking that guiding people to me and i cant imagine the threat of it restraining british newspapers for a moment i cant do any more than ive already done to prevent your identity coming out said the lawyer the impatience obvious too anxious again accepted jordan lets wait until friday to meet you going to be at the carlyle all the time until then all the time promised jordan ill call you if anything comes up in between lets say eleven on friday ill have suzie make plane reservations to raleigh as well this time next week we should know where we are thats what i want to know said jordan exactly where we are the light on his telephone console began to flicker indicating a waiting call youre back just walked through the door jordan instantly knew the voice i was just going to return your calls how was london asked alyce i got done what i went there to do jordan hadnt expected it to take most of one day to extend the hans crescent lease sort out the query letters held for him at royston and jones bank and a spur of the moment decision despite what he was now accumulating in the accounts in new york to withdraw additional funds to deposit with lesley corbin all of which had delayed his return by those twelve hours you spoken to dan yet a minute or two ago this could so easily have been a casual howwasyourtrip conversation so you know leanne entering a defence he had to ignore the lawyers warnings against contact with alyce jordan decided without being able to intercept any computer correspondence between her and her lawyer she was his only access to her side of the case testingly he said only that dan didnt go into any detail were matching every claim alfred is making against you responded alyce without hesitation and intend inviting the jury to award punitive damages against leanne jefferies as well bob sent our detailed claim to her lawyer yesterday hes from the same firm representing alfred incidentally bob thinks thats a bad move on their part could be interpreted that alfred and leanne are still involved as this conversation could be interpreted against him and alyce jordan thought the idea came with that reflection as well as the awareness that the prompt to reid had to come from alyce he said the way to bring it out in court would be for bob to crossexamine her on who was paying for her defence yes it would wouldnt it agreed the woman just as quickly from the tone in which she talked jordan imagined the woman to be smiling maybe you should mention it to bob already decided said alyce the smile still in her voice you back in raleigh still in manhattan i had more to do here than i thought the application for my dismissal from the case is being heard next week i know im on standby to be a witness in your favour if necessary why didnt you tell me he had to lead her thinking into telling him everything i thought i did at the conference in raleigh that i would support the application in any way i could i hadnt appreciated it to be as positive as that i cant imagine how i could help as far as you are concerned but you know ill be there for you in whatever way i can i think you did tell me but thank you for telling me again lets do that urged jordan tell each other things at the risk of repetition he had to know everything i started alyce but abruptly stopped what demanded jordan nothing refused alyce newspapers the media in general are chasing me thats another reason the main reason i suppose for my not going back to raleigh theyre watching the estate virtually camped outside but not here in manhattan this is a new address since i got back from france what about alyce trailed to a halt again what my arms getting tired holding the phone up for so long he needed the continuing conduit jordan reminded himself again your guy and mine insisted we shouldnt meet unchaperoned which i think is bullshit thats what were employing them for advice i still think its bullshit were adults for christs sake looking at a lot of potential problems we dont want to make any worse i shouldnt have started this the smile had gone from her voice nothings started he needed her jordan recognized needed her as a source of information and needed her support if she had to be a witness at the dismissal hearing and he knew from accessing the watchdog computer less than an hour ago that neither he nor alyce remained under any surveillance lets forget it she said tightly what were you thinking of i dont know what i was thinking of its not important were each of us too dependent upon the other to fall out whos falling out it sounds to me like we could be the first time i made the mistake and i apologized twice it just seems so i dont know childish i guess that we cant talk to each other properly now the impatience had gone it would be better if you came here somewhere public and we had dinner very publicly in the restaurant rather than me coming to your apartment i wasnt inviting you to my apartment then my suggestion works ill make a reservation and be waiting for you in the lobby say seven seven thirty there was a brief silence from the other end of the line before alyce said ill be there at seven thered be a minimal insurance in telling daniel beckwith jordan supposed but not tonight afterwards alyce appleton came into the hotel lobby precisely at seven with the selfassurance of someone who knew her rightful place in such moneyed surroundings an impression that had come to jordan in france but which he had forgotten until now she saw him at once which hed intended unlike the initial subterfuge at the carlton and continued on without pause her face opening into a smile as she reached him the blonde hair was loose and he saw at once that the diamond ring had been discarded as well as the wedding ring the shawl over one shoulder matched the blue of her skirt and made the perfect contrast against the paler sweater and jordan was conscious of the looks that followed her from women as well as men she said hi quite like old times meeting in hotels again not quite the same though qualified jordan surprised by the lightness perhaps not she agreed falling into step as he led towards the bar she chose mineral water to his martini as they touched glasses she said you want to know a secret as many as there are to know jordan said meaning it i almost chickened out at the last minute about coming tonight i actually went back from the corridor into my apartment to think why didnt you alyce shrugged this is my call isnt it us meeting like grownups i thought about what we discussed on the phone about alfred and leanne still being together are they pounced jordan at once have bobs enquiry people come up with something she shrugged again i mean about what you said about their both being represented by the same firm bob hasnt told me anything of what his detectives have discovered thats what they are arent they detectives i guess dismissed jordan disinterested in an immaterial definition he knew from his earlier exploration of reids computer that there had been no email contact from any enquiry agency but you changed your mind again and now youre here and im glad what happened in france was wonderful and whats happened since is total awful shit and i like the idea of our being able to behave for a couple of hours as normal people as friends most definitely not lovers and now weve got it out of the way i want to stop talking about it there very positive judged jordan i used to be once before i married alfred he took me over mr svengali i didnt get the impression of you being beaten into submission in france in france id escaped i was free it was a good feeling one i hadnt known for far too long not since jordan waited and when she didnt continue said not since when alyce shook her head france really was wonderful immediately before that back here id actually tried therapy imagining it was my fault everything had gone wrong with the marriage this is beginning to sound just like one of those therapy sessions without the couch and with more noise i dont want to talk about it any more ok no its not ok thought jordan disappointed he said ok why dont we eat hed personally chosen a corner banquette table at which they could sit side by side but separated at its apex looking out over the dining room she deferred to him choosing the wine as he had in france and restricted herself to two glasses again as she had in france he accepted her suggestion of the chesapeake soft shelled crabs and they shared a chateaubriand jordan cut short alyces renewed apology for him becoming involved in the divorce action and they agreed that neither was looking forward to the following weeks court hearings whos ever heard of an affair being described as a criminal conversation for christs sake exclaimed alyce it must date from the time we burned witches everyone in north carolina has heard of it apparently replied jordan ignoring the rhetoric and i agree its unbelievable that laws like it still exist in the united states of america exist anywhere that imagines itself to be halfway civilized our problem is that theres nothing we can do about it except go with the system as halfassed as it is does dan really think he can get you dismissed from the case i guess he wouldnt be trying if he thought it would be a total waste of time when are you going down to raleigh somewhen over the weekend i suppose ive agreed to dan making the arrangements you the same i guess you know where youre staying jordan shook his head dan says there isnt a wide choice there isnt im glad i changed my mind tonight and came after all it reminds me a lot of france but for the differences weve already agreed but for the differences weve already agreed she echoed smiling that reminds me of france too saying the same things to each other no doubt whatsoever queried jordan although he accepted there couldnt be from what daniel beckwith had just told him read it for yourself suggested beckwith pushing the venerealogists report across the desk jordan did twice looking back up to the lawyer he said so how did alyce who says i was her only other sexual partner apart from her husband contract chlamydia thats what i asked bob before you got here this morning and what hes going to ask her what else did he say that alyce is thirtyone years old and if shes only ever had two lovers so far shes the next in line to the virgin mary thats not funny bob wasnt trying to be funny hes one big pissed off attorney alyce lied is lying decided jordan the awareness spreading through him he hadnt learned anything from the carlyle dinner making it a waste of time but hed had that time to waste and hed enjoyed being with her and talking to her again the following day when shed telephoned to thank him and now he knew shed been treating him like a fool treating all of them like fools shes got to be lying hasnt she said beckwith its knocked bobs case to hell and back hed just read leanne jefferies medical report when i spoke to him this morning shes clean too i met her this week suddenly declared jordan knowing that it was essential that he did the same day that i got back from london we had dinner together you met leanne jefferies frowned beckwith confused alyce corrected jordan she called me after i spoke to you that morning called it childish that we shouldnt meet you should know youre damned right i should know erupted the lawyer his face colouring we told you bob and i that you shouldnt be together without one of us being there as well why the fuck it did seem childish that we couldnt meet like two normal people said jordan defensively we had dinner talked stop right there right now ordered beckwith his face redder with anger holding up a hand did you sleep with her no i didnt sleep with her you sure what the fuck do you mean am i sure of course im sure how could i not be sure i want it all what you ate what you drank who you saw or who might have seen you every single thing you said and talked about to each other every fucking thing you did lets work your questioning backwards insisted jordan refusing the returning intimidation we didnt fuck the conversation came down to reminiscences of france apart from alyce telling me that during their marriage appleton psychologically controlled her we would have been seen by the hotel cctv always in public places we had one drink in the bar she drank water i had one martini we ate soft shelled crabs and steak with a vintage chateau margaux i got the concierge to call her a cab and personally put her into it all of which should be shown on the cctv and confirmed by the hotel staff we werent alone or out of sight for a minute and we can prove it ok no not ok rejected beckwith stridently you were told both of you not to get together in any way or circumstance that could be construed that your relationship was ongoing whether you considered that advice childish or stupid doesnt come into any calculation or thinking it doesnt matter a damn what you think or whether or not you agree with that advice thats what youre paying a whole bunch of money for me to provide and why youre stupid if you choose to ignore it we know now and the court is going to know that alyce has lied and the court is also going to know because ive got to tell them to avoid being made to look a jerk if i dont tell them and theres even more photos of you and alyce in a huggermugger hotel setting that youre still seeing each other which totally fucks my plan of insisting next week that there is no continuing relationship that youre not trying to alienate alyces affections and that youre not engaging in every definition of criminal conversation according to the relevant north carolina statute the man paused breathless recovering he said i dont think ive missed any of the important points of how well youve done blowing your defence to a multimilliondollar damages claim right out of the water do you harv you think ive overlooked something why dont you tell me its harvey my name is harvey not harv at this precise moment you name is cuntofthemonth alyce appleton has a string through your nose ring and you could end up a very poor man leanne jefferies attorney is from the same firm representing appleton argued jordan weakly doesnt that indicate theyre still together beckwith sat staring across the table at jordan unspeaking until finally jordan said exasperated what let me ask you what what the fuck has that got to do with anything its nothing whatsoever to do with you with us with our case if appleton is still fucking leannes brains out thats for bob to prove and get leanne to pay for for her criminal conversations im trying to get you off the hook and youve stuffed it right up your own ass you know what id like to do right now id like to withdraw from this case and from representing you i think youve put me into a nowin situation and im a win person not the other way round so why dont you withdraw because if i did id render you unrepresentable by any other attorney which would leave you swinging in the wind and ive got more integrity than that ill go on doing my absolute and very best and youll pay through the nose for every second that im doing it until today trying to help you was damage minimization now its damage limitation with whatever minimization i can work in as a bonus i suppose i should thank you ive had more than a gutful of what you suppose and i couldnt give a bag of rotting shit for your gratitude ill have to tell bob about your tryst obviously now well have to go down to raleigh tomorrow give ourselves as much time as possible to see what hes going to do and reassemble my submission the lawyer hesitated halted by an afterthought you got any more handholding assignations planned with alyce the forgetful virgin no and we didnt hold hands or anything else good said beckwith and dont not ever again eighteen there was a palpable tension between the three of them in reids office annex on that deserted saturday dividing them on reids desk were the finally supplied medical reports on alfred appleton and leanne jefferies as well as covering letters and copies of the womans rebuttals to alyces criminal conversation damages claim there were also for the first time photographs of appletons supposedly brief mistress jordan was not surprised that although older by six years leanne closely resembled alyce in appearance and physique confirming the adage that men always chose lovers that reminded them of their wives reid gestured towards the documentation and said so there it all is as far as my cases are concerned a heap of shit not helped by continuing cosy hotel meetings between you and alyce came in beckwith whose criticism of jordans carlyle dinner with alyce had concluded the review meeting in advance of the forthcoming court hearings theyd flown down on the first available flight and this time there hadnt been any tourist detours just a fifteenminute delay booking into the hilton hotel reid had alerted them that appleton intended to stay at the sheraton during the hearing lets right now get some of that unnecessary shit out of the way to concentrate on whats really important demanded jordan i dont see and wont concede that alyce and i having had an innocent dinner before or after which nothing occurred to resume our affair could be any great big deal neither do i see the necessity to volunteer it to the court i volunteered it to you so you wouldnt be caught out neither of you will be under oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth if this goes the whole way i will be alyce will be if it gets brought out it gets brought out lets deal with it then i didnt see any reason why i shouldnt meet her as i did and i still dont and i dont and wont believe either of you havent sat on your hands in the past about something you knew but didnt want to come out in court and therefore didnt say anything about you both still with me and wish i wasnt said reid im not your immediate problem insisted jordan waving his hand towards the separating desk and what was on it those medical reports are your immediate problem what does alyce say about them both lawyers had fixed expressions on their faces but only beckwith was visibly flushed what shes said from the beginning replied the heavily breathing reid that shes only had sexual relationships with her husband and with you which has ok stopped jordan so what do your enquiry people say i know youre employing them because youve told me what you havent told me is anything that theyve so far discovered to help in any way whatsoever appletons people failed to find any proof of alyces cheating until france at the moment your opposition snoops are doing more for you than your own people are doing for you dont you agree ive no reason nor cause to defend those im employing rejected reid awkwardly but as youve raised it again i certainly intend bringing out appletons failure to discover any lover other than you the man looked sideways to the other lawyer but i dont intend mentioning the carlyle dinner alyce hasnt told me about it you have were cooperating for mutual benefit not disadvantage and at this precise moment i dont need any more disadvantages than ive already got im listening to what everyones saying assured beckwith dully maybe i wont volunteer the carlyle episode either but can we establish here and now he turned to include reid and you get the specific undertaking from alyce that theres no more social meeting not even if the pope is in the same room with you i dont care if you think its a childish insistence or whether alyce thinks its a childish insistence or what the fuck either of you think about the divorce statutes of north carolina like it or not they are the statutes the rules by which youre being judged i think we went through this yesterday in new york dismissed jordan and before yesterday in new york we very specifically went through it down here in raleigh and you and she ignored the advice persisted beckwith it happens again im definitely withdrawing this time jordan didnt respond with the direct challenge of the previous day instead he said so what about the most immediate problem turning again to the other lawyer beckwith said to get harvey dismissed im obviously going to have to call alyce on wednesday and hit her as hard as is necessary to prove shes both promiscuous as well as being prepared to lie ive already told her that told her the impossible position these medical reports put her in said reid i thought it was the way to get an admission about who else she slept with and who gave her the infection what did she say asked jordan disregarding any professional protocol there was an incongruity yet another nagging inconsistency hovering in jordans mind but it wouldnt harden into a positive thought i already told you snapped reid she insists theres only ever been two men her husband and you she cant maintain that in court confronted with this medical evidence said beckwith i told her that too and late last night i heard from wolfson hes filed for leannes dismissal he told me hes subpoenaing alyce hes obviously going to use leannes medical report i think your clients going to be massacred said beckwith unsympathetically i think so too agreed reid isnt it your job to prevent that happening demanded jordan the moment she tells me the truth ill start trying said reid just as belligerently youve got two days to persuade her beckwith told the other lawyer until you do convince her your case isnt worth a bucket of piss it still wont be even if she does change her story said reid youve got three days corrected jordan she told me at the hotel she was coming down this weekend which gives you tomorrow sunday to talk to her if shes already arrived reid looked casually at his watch maybe ill give her a call when were through the man was giving up before any fight began looking for a mitigating escape just as he was jordan decided what about the carlyle meeting if you both decide not to mention it in court unless she or i are directly challenged youd better tell her not to say anything about it either hadnt you im definitely not going to mention it now confirmed beckwith talking not to jordan but to reid youd better do what harvey suggests of course ill warn her said reid irascibly what about those missing three years after appletons graduation pressed jordan already knowing there was no computer correspondence between the lawyer and any enquiry agency although accepting that it all could have been done by written letters formal reports and telephone calls he began concentrating upon what lay on the separating table as nothing there was directly linked to him he didnt have the automatic legal right to copies of his own reid had only paraphrased everything not offering facts he could study and memorize in detail all he could make out were the different names of the supplying venerealogists and their different addresses both of which were in boston what the hell good is anything that long ago going to provide demanded reid repeating his earlier objection you wont know until you find out and from where im sitting you dont seem particularly anxious to find out i dont need to share these conferences with you retorted reid get out you sure you dont said jordan not moving from his chair the way i recall it ive so far thrown most of the positive ideas into the pot you know fuck all erupted reid which is what youre complaining about knowing fuck all said jordan maybe you need to change the direction of your enquiries as well as changing the people you appoint to make them for you and maybe you need to do what ive just told you and get the hell out of my office and my building said reid were through all three of us that night the local television station finally broke the story of the divorce between the thirtyoneyearold member of one of north carolinas earliest settler dynasties and that of the scion of one of the founding new england families as well as still photographs of both alyce and appleton two from their wedding there was archival tv footage of appleton competing in yacht races off long island and at the cowes week regatta in englands isle of wight the story was based upon a court submission to be made in the coming week on behalf of a cited corespondent in alfred appletons case against his wife alleging criminal conversations harvey jordan was mentioned by name but there were no photographs jordan waited until after seven in the expectation that daniel beckwith might make contact but decided against calling the lawyers room in the floor above wanting an uninterrupted evening he ordered dinner from room service glad his photograph hadnt appeared on television reminding himself to call john blake again at the marylebone apartment block the following day to check once more about media approaches glad too that hed brought with him the laptop and all the copied correspondence to which he was entitled in addition to the names and boston addresses hed memorized that afternoon in reids office he didnt know but he guessed he was going to need it all to satisfy whatever it was that was nagging in his mind reid had promised it was the best seafood restaurant in raleigh one that he didnt know from when hed practised there but beckwith had been disappointed he was uncomfortable too that the local lawyer was already on his third gin martini very dry and straight up without any diluting ice beckwith was still on his first you should dump the motherfucker now insisted reid hes so fucking smart whats he need a qualified lawyer for the man had pushed his lobster aside scarcely touched you fully up to speed to argue against leannes dismissal i will be by the time it gets before pullinger jordans a pain in the ass and i suppose i should apologize for today as hes my client but nothing much nothing that seriously contradicts or undermines anything appletons filed against alyce seems to have been turned up tell me anything better that your guys have found demanded the other man with drunken truculence the cases are different beckwith pointed out all ive got to argue with is north carolina law and unfortunately the morals of your client now that weve got all the test reports were admitting the adultery we didnt have any alternative im going to speak with the enquiry agents on monday put a burr up their ass and seeing alyce tomorrow how the hell can i prepare any sort of a defence a case until she starts being straight with me shes the plaintiff who initiated the divorce proceedings for christs sake reid gestured with his empty martini glass for a refill when the waiter responded the man looked enquiringly at beckwith who ordered chardonnay a glass not a bottle beckwith said you dont have enough time if wolfson gets his hearing at the end of the coming week even if she comes straight tomorrow theres still whatever might come out under my crossexamination on wednesday which youll have to go through with her all over again you need to apply for a delay it was a sharp move for wolfson to file for dismissal right on the back of my application you think youll get judgement in your favour beckwith accepted his wine from the returning waiter reflectively cupping the glass between both hands to consider the question depends what i can bring out from alyce now weve got the medical proof that appleton and leanne cant have been the cause of alyces infection my strategy has got to be that alyce entrapped harvey as the fall guy intending to name him herself to cover up for her unknown lover whoever the hell he is or they are but didnt have to because of the entrapment appleton already had in place for her before the medical clearances i reckoned my chances of dismissal were less than fifty percent thirty tops now im still only giving myself fifty percent with a son of a bitch like judge herbert d pullinger everything depends on what alyce says or doesnt say said reid more maudlin than reflective what time are you seeing her we fixed ten tomorrows sunday we could brunch somewhere after youve met with her ill call harvey jordan continued to be troubled by the uncertainty that came to him during the acrimonious and therefore distracting meeting with the two lawyers and still hadnt resolved it by the time he finished the uninteresting room service meal which he abandoned halfeaten and pushed on its delivery trolley out into the corridor to give himself as much space as possible for what he intended to do regretting along with a lot of other things not having asked suzie to book a suite changing to one was his first priority on an already long list for the following day daniel beckwiths courtroom ability remained worringly untested although jordan was hopeful he wasnt at all hopeful about robert reid whom he suspected to have taken alyce appletons case more for its inherent benefit to his reputation for representing such a prestigious north carolina family than trying too hard contesting an incontestable case in an american state governed by archaic divorce statutes and jordans concern for alyce wasnt at all altruistic it was as always to save himself which was why he needed as harvey jordan always needed to know everything with which he might be challenged before any challenge occurred whatever was nagging him from that afternoons encounter had to have some connection with something that had preceded it but what he had first to examine the official printedout and accusing material jordan decided after that hed go through all the illegally accrued correspondence from each and every carefully collated source from all his invaded computers after that jordan wasnt sure where else he would look or explore apart as always his burgeoning appleton bank accounts and by then he didnt expect to still be as unsure as he was because by then he would have found the elusive inconsistency if he didnt find it the first time hed have to go back and back again until he did harvey jordan was a necessarily methodical analytical man and decided to begin his search in reverse setting out in sections upon his bed all that hed memorized from what had been haphazardly strewn over reids desk and continued moving backwards through all the court papers with which he had been formally supplied right back to the original stultifying stomachwrenching opening letter from david bartle at brinkmeyer hartley and bernstein informing him of his being cited as co respondent in a financial damagesseeking divorce action there was far more material than hed anticipated and aware that repeated reading of already familiar material could result in selfhypnotic oversights jordan further subdivided his already separated divisions he then settled unhurriedly to read he did so totally concentrated and without pause for an hour at the end of which hed failed to isolate any incongruity or anomaly irritated because he was sure the key to what he wanted had to be somewhere in there jordan started all over again creating further subdivisions until virtually all of the bed space was occupied and still he found nothing this time after searching for another full two hours jordan allowed himself a contemplative break moving from the uncleared bed to his laptop scrolling through every downloaded exchange from every invaded computer he was well into the initial correspondence between daniel beckwith in manhattan and lesley corbin in london insisting upon the first venereal examinations by the avaricious dr james preston when the longsought answer began to formulate in jordans mind he forced his cramped body up from his chair to walk stiffly to the bed display still not able to be completely sure because all hed been able to memorize that afternoon were the names and addresses of the boston examiners not their specific findings or conclusions but they were very definitely set out in the results of his own second examination in new york by george abrahams this convinced jordan that he was taking the right path just as he remembered now and didnt have the slightest doubt whatsoever that despite their detailed discussion about the medical findings there had been no reference to anything reid had done or rather hadnt done to get any medical or autopsy result analysis on sharon borowski to ascertain if she might have been a chlamydia sufferer jordan only realized the time had gone midnight when he saw it on his own watch as he reached out for the telephone halting the move to pick it up to ring beckwith on the floor above the fact that the following day or this day to be precise was sunday didnt preclude his hacking into the computers of the two boston venerealogists to counteract the still hovering uncertainty his challenge would be far more effective unchallengable in return if he could prove what he could only so far suspect jordan guessed the following day was going to be even more fractious than the one that had just passed and didnt give a fuck reid probably would though and beckwith hed funded his five new york banks from the accounts of appleton and drake that morning and didnt expect there to be anything he hadnt already read to have been added over the weekend so he decided the long postponed revisit could wait until the following day nineteen he was glad he did because what harvey jordan found when he logged on soon after am on the sunday morning he regarded as another auspcious beginning to the day in the correspondence attached to his five accounts he found three separate loan offers the largest from the bank of america up to a maximum of in total the loan offers each of which he intended accepting came to which added to what hed accumulated from his daily withdrawals from appleton and drakes account came just short of keeping that days transfers to each of the five below and subdividing those to avoid them appearing even as large as that jordan increased the pot to realizing that he had to return as soon as possible to new york to withdraw cash for his safe deposits again to avoid him exceeding the moneyreporting limit by the time he did he expected loan offers from the two outstanding banks by am jordan had obtained the computer addresses of the two boston clinics the specialist who had attested that alfred appleton was free of any venereal infection was mark chapman whose clinic was on boylston street leanne jefferies consultant jane lewell practised on haymarket square on the opposite side of the common both had personally dedicated laptops jordan set out to embed his trojan horses again through his undetected australian cutout ensuring any recorded trace of his entry would be wiped out by leaving an erasing virus activated the moment the main frames of both clinics were booted up on the monday morning it took jordan almost three full hours to hack past the protective firewalls a second immediately confronted him after he picked his way through the first into chapmans personal and dedicated desk top jordan presumed the double barrier was to ensure patient confidentiality which he was determined it wouldnt but it still surprised and mildly irritated him that it was more difficult to get into the doctors records than it had been to penetrate the other systems jordans patience was rewarded just after ten with the opening up on his screen of the detailed procedures and examinations appleton had undergone for the preparation of chapmans report it coincided to the minute by the jarring ring of jordans phone jordan hesitated momentarily tempted to ignore it before picking it up i had dinner with bob last night announced beckwith and prompted jordan i wish it had been more productive beckwith allowed i think hes ineffective and inefficient judged jordan i told you the medical stuff knocked his case from under him whats he doing about it seeing alyce the lawyer paused just about now in fact not with you shes his client not mine were cooperating thats all you must be thrilled with all the stuff youre getting from him mocked jordan we might be meeting later brunch maybe depending on what he gets from her we meaning you and i or we meaning you and reid bob and me hes still pretty sore about the way you spoke to him i would have thought hed be used to being spoken to like that by now dismissed jordan i might need to speak to you later what about im still sorting through stuff avoided jordan did you actually see read those medical reports on appleton and the woman yes why im curious about something you off playing amateur lawyer again demanded beckwith although without any irritation just curious repeated jordan hurrying on to avoid any further questioning he said and im changing rooms this one is too small ill leave a message with the new number when i get it if youre not around and ill call you when i get back from seeing bob if i see bob if i dont maybe we could lunch lets keep in touch agreed jordan now he was actually in to appletons records he could well be through by lunchtime jordan used his own written report from george abrahams as a rough template to check against the findings from appletons consultation his disappointment growing as the two appeared according to his laymans understanding to match with the exception of their haematology groupings jordans being o appletons a patiently jordan went through chapmans examination a second time alert for anything he might have missed on his first reading and again finished with the same understanding it did not take jordan as long to break into dr lewells computer at her haymarket square clinic at first reading her examination of leanne jefferies appeared the same as appletons with the exception of her blood group being ab jordan went through it a second time once more using abrahams report for a comparison and once more achieved what appeared to be a match as an afterthought he went through both comparing them to what dr preston had supplied in england with the same result there was a disparity jordan was sure of it sure that he just wasnt seeing it but what hed only been able to get the briefest look at both reports on reids desk too fleeting and too distant to absorb beyond the more prominently printed names and addresses of the two venerealogists but with abrahams document spread out directly in front of him jordans impression was that his own report was actually longer than those of either dr chapman or dr lewell there was an obvious reason for the apparent differences jordan realized his own completed and signed findings werent comparable precisely because those for appleton and jefferies werent completed and signed what hed read on his phishing visit into the computers of appleton and leannes doctors were still in note form not assembled into dictated documents hed wasted his time jordan acknowledged all three sets of information seemed factually comparable but he needed the presentations of the opposing venerealogists to decide the diagnoses reached from them not just the results of various tests despite it being well past noon and therefore obvious that beckwith and reid had met jordan still called his lawyers room but got no reply he was given the choice of three suites and chose the largest transferring everything and resetting his entry traps he left a message with the suite number as well as the fact that he was lunching in the hotel coffee shop which turned out to be unnecessary because the table he was allocated had a perfect view of the entrance through which a returning daniel beckwith would come the scrod with a side salad was hugely better than his previous nights dinner which proved the undeniable hotel lore that a hotel restaurant was always better than room service he still had something far more important to prove and hoped beckwith wouldnt be too long getting back something else he couldnt understand had just occurred to him the bitch wouldnt budge declared reid i had her read both medical reports and explained every which way that it made her denials of any other affairs completely untenable but she wouldnt change her story by as much as this he held up his hand with his forefinger and thumb too close together to show any intervening daylight the bloody mary he had in his other hand was his first and still only halfdrunk and beckwith was glad did you tell her id crossexamine her as hard as i could of course i did didnt that worry her reid shook his head she said she didnt care how tough you were that she was telling the truth and that was that and that the judge and jury could make up their minds whether to believe her or not which they wont of course they wont theyll decide shes promiscuous and that harvey was one of many which i might capitalize on broke in beckwith as the opportunity opened up to him if alyce is a serial adulteress harvey was just that one of many who shouldnt be made to pay for all the others he sipped his own bloody mary enjoying the drink and the abruptly occurring possibility its a dangerous argument warned the other lawyer itll still cost him but not as much as it might fighting every damned claim head on this way i get to show that harvey didnt alienate any affection that a lot of other unknowns did before him ok harvey screwed her but he isnt the marriage wrecker if pullinger finds in your favour that takes leanne off the financial hook and gives appleton the petition too what are you going to do asked beckwith what little i can which is very little indeed said reid argue mitigation in view of appletons admitted adultery thats all ive got what about wolfsons submission for leannes dismissal youre right that i should seek a postponement conceded reid itll be too close behind yours and theres no way of anticipating how much blood theres going to be on the carpet when youre through ill enter the postponement application tomorrow on what grounds more time for preparation in view of the lateness of their medical production what if pullinger demands details the medical stuff was late and left you with nothing and left me with practically nothing agreed reid you ever regret becoming a lawyer every time i lose said beckwith it doesnt last this time it will said reid this was my big one it still will be but for all the wrong reasons you want another drink invited beckwith his own glass empty it didnt help yesterday and it wont help today refused reid i already feel like shit without any outside help shes sticking to her story beckwith told jordan it loses the case for her but gives us a hell of a good mitigation argument thatll reduce any damages if pullinger wont dismiss you from the case altogether it was pm jordan saw glad of the extra time hed had to prepare his explanation to his lawyer without disclosing his computer hacking is bob still with you there was a momentary silence from the other end of the line no why didnt you hear what i just said i heard what you just said assured jordan impatiently did you actually read the results of appleton and leannes chlamydia consultations remember enough for a word for word comparison with what abrahams supplied about me what the fuck are we talking about now harvey did you youre not making a whole lot of sense protested the lawyer please answer what im asking you bob offered them to me as i already told you and i glanced at them but no i couldnt quote either of them word for word i wasnt given them to read bob paraphrased jordan pointed out theyre nothing to do with your part of the case they were lying on bobs desk and they were much shorter than what dr abrahams supplied in my case because i told him i wanted every detail that could possibly arise or be challenged thats what im trying to do prevent you stumbling into a bear trap which i think i now can because of alyces denials leave it for christs sake according to the depositions appleton ended his relationship with leanne jefferies when seven eight nine months ago persisted jordan coming to his prepared reason for talking about the chlamydia reports i dont have the papers before me eight i guess i can check from the stuff ive brought down with me and leanne lives in manhattan right i told you i dont have the papers before me everythings in my briefcases you want me to look it up i already have from whats been made available to me her apartments on east street we soon going to get to wherever it is youre heading harvey why does leanne jefferies who lives in apartment b east street manhattan and who hasnt had any relationship for eight months with alfred appleton go all the way up to haymarket square boston where the appletons are one of the most respected of founding families to undergo a medical examination to establish her sexual cleanliness the silence this time from beckwiths end of the telephone was much longer than before finally the lawyer conceded i dont know wouldnt it be a good idea for someone to ask her preferably in court and for us to compare everything abrahams said about me with what their specialists wrote about appleton and leanne ill call bob at home now arrange a meeting for tomorrow twenty harvey jordan isolated the discrepancy within fifteen minutes which was hardly surprising as he was the only one among the three of them to have studied the entire and detailed computer notes of dr mark chapman and dr jane lewell and knew his own venerealogists assessment practically verbatim antigens declared jordan straightening up from his comparison of the courtpresenting dossiers of the three american doctors the fourth prepared by the english specialist james preston was also on the table although to one side and not part of the main comparison what demanded beckwith antigens repeated jordan isolating the reference in george abrahams deposition copies of which were before both lawyers to compare against those on appleton and leanne jefferies which were also in front of them and doesnt that turn everything on its head it might if we understood what in gods name you were talking about complained reid beckwith had warned jordan of reids overnight resentment initially rejecting outright the suggestion of another meeting between them at the possibility of jordans further criticism and thered been a discernible hostility during the half an hour theyd already spent together uncaring jordan insisted see the mention in what abrahams wrote his finger traced the passage im there confirmed beckwith reid nodded without speaking now go on urged jordan quoting the patients blood which is group o was subjected to further microbiological haematological examination to establish the presence if any of chlamydia antigens which would have remained present if the patient had suffered the venereal infection but undergone successful antibiotic curative treatment there was a complete absence of chlamydia antigens which confirms the patient harvey jordan had never been a sufferer he looked up inviting a reaction none came from either lawyer both of whom were moving between the three separate papers he had to be careful not to give any indication of having seen the case notes jordan reminded himself he said theres no reference in the reports from either appleton or leannes specialists of antigens or of an examination of their blood to look for them appletons says haematological examination found no evidence of the chlamydia bacteria in the patients a blood grouping leannes specialist says the patients blood which is of the ab type was completely clear of any chlamydia infection but theres no indication of any microbiological tests to prove that neither appleton nor leanne didnt have antigens in their blood which would be the medical proof that they never suffered from it beckwith came up from his frowned comparison his face clearing youre right their depositions only prove that appleton and leanne are clear now and it does turn everything on its head agreed the finally smiling reid the most important being that alyce could be telling the truth after all beckwith wasnt smiling though to jordan he said you did well picking up on the omission well for alyce but not so well for yourself if alyce hasnt been sleeping around the defence i intended against your criminal conversation claims goes out the window does it demanded jordan what about what else weve already talked about this morning comparing the depositions which were so late being delivered that you bob think theyre grounds for a postponement arent you a tad curious that leannes medical report was prepared by a boston venerealogist not one far more conveniently located in manhattan i am the two lawyers looked at each other before reid picked up the english deposition your guy preston didnt list antigens clearance either preston was anything but my guy he was little more than a medical fraudster whose professional opinion inadmissible in an american court anyway was so inadequate that i had the second tests here by abrahams refuted jordan i think youre right said beckwith talking to jordan if pullinger thinks has the vaguest suspicion even that something is being withheld from him which isnt taking it as far as him thinking that hes being lied to were throwing the party how we going to do this demanded reid the resentment and resistance finally going these he lifted and let drop the boston depositions are part of my case not yours a stickler to the rules like pullinger wont let you introduce them into your submissions not a problem assured beckwith theres no north carolina rule against our cooperating is there reid considered the question none as far as im aware i need to check youve got a day and a half to do that and for us to work out a way around it if what i want to do is barred a day and a half as well to chase up all the other outstanding queries to be answered by your enquiry people said beckwith pointedly not looking at jordan i want to hit appleton as hard as i can first time it could determine the outcome of everything your case as well as mine wed all of us be home free reid did look towards jordan but still without any animosity thank you youve put in a lot of work more than any client should do be required to do i want to keep my hands on my money said jordan meaning it and i want to say i appreciate it said reid alyce should too you got a side office here that i could use beckwith cut across the apologies talking to the other lawyer i need to call a lot of people and go through a lot of law books i dont have down here with me you can take your pick of whatever you want offered reid whos going to talk to alyce tell her shes no longer facing an inquisition asked jordan i am said reid i was pretty tough on her yesterday lets not get too confident cautioned beckwith i still need to call her as my witness on wednesday and i wont have her holding back on me im not going to tell her that all her problems are over assured reid thats good because theyre not for any of us not yet said beckwith beckwith seemed passingly bemused by jordans announcment that he was returning to new york during the intervening thirtysix hours but didnt ask why instead warning jordan to be back in raleigh in more than good enough time to be in court for the opening of the submission application jordan caught the first flight that morning which got him into manhattan before ten he didnt go directly to the carlyle but detoured instead to west nd street where the three expected loan applications were waiting as well as another from the chase manhattan also with an initial maximum finally at the hotel jordan completed all four and hand delivered each along wall street at each stop completing forms for the monthly repayments to be directly debited against the account at each he also withdrew money from every account to spread between his various safedeposit boxes at all five banks he was greeted effusively but without any curiosity or suspicion by the managers with whom hed opened the accounts back once more at the hotel jordan spent a long time painstakingly going through every outlet at appleton and drake concentrating upon the accountancy and financial control divisions for any indication of his embezzlement having been discovered and found nothing he completed the visit by distributing a further for the first time moving from the companys currency division section to metals his most essential tasks completed jordan settled down to bring himself up to date from each of his other illegal entries going first to his own lawyer still in raleigh and found no additional material he did better with reid there was contact timed three hours earlier with an enquiry agency named ddk investigations in it reid complained at the lack of progress to a man identified as jack doyle in any of the enquiries they had previously discussed by telephone in the email reid repeated everything to which he wanted an urgent response the reason for appletons withdrawal from the americas cup selection and the threeyear gap after appletons graduation from harvard topped the list beckwith was not at the raleigh hotel when jordan first telephoned but picked up the phone on jordans second attempt just before nine it had been a hell of a day apologized the lawyer he wouldnt know until tomorrow if george abrahams could get to raleigh for the wednesday hearing to appear as an expert witness if the venerealogist couldnt rearrange his diary beckwith might ask for a postponement hed warned the court he didnt expect to conclude his dismissal submission in one day and that there was a possibility of it even extending to three hed advised the lawyers appearing for alfred appleton and leanne jefferies that sections of their depositions were likely to be questioned suggesting that drs chapman and lewell be put on standby to be called as witnesses beckwith had then been cautioned by pullingers court clerk that the judge was extremely intolerant of his sittings being disrupted by what he considered timewasting and inappropriate presentations which theres every likelihood of pullinger deciding from my calling so many witnesses concluded beckwith what about alyce questioned jordan intentionally switching the discussion bob told me she can hardly wait to confront appleton in court lets hope shes not disappointed lets hope none of us is disappointed said the lawyer heavily when are you getting back the planes scheduled for three tomorrow afternoon lets meet in the bar at six the plane was on time which gave jordan more than an hour to move that days tranche of money into his banks as well as again checking through the financial control and monitoring division to ensure he remained undetected jordan was in the bar waiting when beckwith arrived in jeans workshirt and cowboy boots the lawyer ordered a martini because i think weve got cause for a celebration and led jordan to a table out of the hearing of anyone else in the room george abrahams had rearranged his diary and was arriving on the first wednesday morning flight the lawyer reported a room had been reserved for abrahams at their hotel for the wednesday night as a precaution against the submission not being completed in one day there had also been further telephone calls from the lawyers representing appleton and leanne confirming their attendance but without any indication whether their venerealogists would accompany them if they didnt beckwith said he might apply for an adjournment depending upon how his application went primarily although it was essential he crossexamine both specialists to irritate judge pullinger at the other sides prevarication hed arranged with court officials as reid had for alyce for them both to enter the court precincts through back access points hopefully to prevent them being pictured by the expected tv cameramen and media photographers thered been several telephone approaches during the day from new york and local journalists even though as beckwiths application was pretrial it was automatically to be heard in camera that would give him the opportunity to pressure the other side with unspecified challenges and potential revelations into applying for the eventual full hearing to be private reid was attending as was his legal right as an observing attorney because alyce was listed as a witness and in any case intended applying for a closed court if the submission wasnt made on behalf of either appleton or leanne i think weve got them running scared said beckwith i cant remember a lot of times when i could have dropped everything to confront an unspecified outoftown court challenge like the other sides lawyers have done here neither can bob youre talking lawyers appearing said jordan what about appleton and leanne being here personally we wont know that until tomorrow when the court convenes if either were my clients id keep them away could you call them as witnesses if they do turn up i havent officially listed them if they do show i could apply for pullingers discretion which i might well do even on a minor point thered obviously and very definitely be a legal argument which im sure i could use to move pullinger into our favour what are our chances of a complete dismissal demanded jordan bluntly ive been through this with bob said beckwith i want you to go through it with me slightly less than fifty percent which as a gambler youve got to accept as pretty good odds for the briefest of seconds jordan was disorientated by the reminder of how he was supposed to make his living i try for better i cant offer you anything better it was a desultory dinner between two people brought together beneath the same roof who had already talked out all there was to discuss each striving for conversation until the very end when beckwith suddenly said to use an expression that youre more familiar with than me we could be on the home straight here i dont want any surprises ok whats that mean demanded jordan genuinely bewildered you havent had any contact with alyce not since that night in new york you know i havent i dont know you havent thats why im asking you i havent not even by telephone no youll be on a witness stand tomorrow on oath i dont want any outbursts if there was going to be an outburst if i didnt have the anger locked away id have already shouted you down for what youve just asked me about alyce bob thinks youre carrying a torch for her after the mess shes got me into youve got to be joking bob reids talking through his ass theres too much in what youve just said for me to handle all at one time ended beckwith getting up from the table breakfast tomorrow at eight ok twentyone having steadfastly and successfully avoided any criminal proceedings so far in his life harvey jordan had prepared himself for an understandable uncertainty at actually entering a court for the first time and was pleased as well as relieved that none came on their way from the hotel beckwith had talked expansively of courts being theatres in which people lawyers particularly performed but that wasnt jordans most positive impression although he conceded that there could be some comparisons there was certainly a formidable cast being assembled their fixed expressions befitting impending drama as the appellants on that initial day jordan and his lawyer had the first table to the left of the court just inside the separating rail directly behind that rail in the public section was george abrahams with whom beckwith was at that moment hunched in headbent muttered conversation the width of the entry gate through the rail separated jordan from the position of alfred appleton and his lawyer david bartle beyond them at another table were leanne jefferies and peter wolfson behind the rail on the right of the court were a group of motionless silent people among whom jordan presumed to be the boston venerealogists half turned in their direction as he was jordan was instantly aware of the entry into the court of alyce reid attentively at her arm alyce wore a neutral coloured tailored suit and very little makeup and came through the court and the final gate looking directly ahead to take her place at the separate table beside jordans on the far left of the court as she finally sat alyce looked at jordan but not as far as the opposite side of the court to her husband and his lover jordan smiled alyce didnt turning away reid leaned towards jordan and said you get in ok avoiding the photographers i think so you im sure we did alyce ok its the first time shes been near appleton since it all began shes a mess tell her its ok what on earth did that mean jordan wondered as he said it alyce looked very pale i have already she thought shed be all right shes not beckwith returned through the gate and asked jordan what was that about alyce is nervous so am i said beckwith jerking his head back towards the public area weve got a hell of a point to make choosing the moment to make it is the problem what the started jordan to be overridden by the loudly demanded all rise if this were theatre then judge hubert pullinger was already wearing his costume for the role thought jordan as the man upon whom so much depended entered the court pullingers ravenblack gown hung shapelessly around a stickthin desiccated frame an appearance denied by the scurrying quickness of his movements the head came forward though when he sat reminding jordan of a carnivorous hunting bird complete with the diseasewhitened face jordan remembered from a television documentary on vultures ripped off flesh hanging from its beak halfway through the court clerks official litany identifying the hearing there was an impatient head twitch towards beckwith an appropriately birdlike pecking gesture beckwith hesitated until the clerks recitation ended before rising with matching headnodding deference to name himself his client and his purpose in making his application under the provisions of statute section of the north carolina civil code which i do your honour with some difficulty and trepidation beckwith added the pause was perfectly timed to allow pullingers interception both of which problems i can understand from having read the advanced case papers said the man the voice was not birdlike but surprisingly strong from such a driedout body papers in which in my submission some of the facts are incomplete and because of which i am seeking the leniency of the court properly to provide picked up beckwith no satisfaction at his timing in his voice this is a procedural hearing on behalf of your client for dismissal as i understand it of both the claims for alienation of affections and for criminal conversations interrupted the judge yet again should i not hear and consider your applications before being asked to show leniency jordans concentration was more towards the right of the court than to the judge at once alert to the half smiled headtogether exchange between appleton and his lawyer to the judges persistent intercessions jordan acknowledged that despite the impression hed earlier formed from photographs of the man he had totally misjudged appletons size and appearance appleton seemed much taller than the stated six foot three inches the fleshy stature heightened by his overall clothesstretching heaviness there was no longer anything of the sportsman appleton had once been the weight oddly appeared to bunch at his shoulders and neck pushing his head forward actually bisonlike over a belly bulged beneath a double breasted jacket opened to release its constraint and enable the man to sit legs splayed again for comfort his face was red mottled by what jordan guessed to be blood pressure the fading hair receded far more than it had seemed in the photographs the marked difference in their appearance dictated that he restrict to the absolute minimum his personal visits to the banks in which he had opened accounts in appletons name jordan reminded himself the smiling headnodding david bartle was a large man too although physically overwhelmed by his client bartle had the sun weathered face indicating that he too might have been a yachtsman the colour emphasized by an unruly mop of prematurely white unrestrained hair it was not as long as beckwiths but it appeared to be because beckwith had his held at the nape of his neck by a securing band apart from the restrained hair there was nothing of the wild west imagery either beckwith wore a conservatively striped suit shoes and a striped club tie beneath the collar of a crisp white shirt there was a similar although more subdued reaction to the judges pressure from the furthermost table to the right of the court at which leanne jefferies and her lawyer sat heads also tightly together as close as she now was to him jordan decided that the apparent similarity between leanne and alyce was misleading to the point of there being no resemblance at all limited to the blondness of their hair colouring and the style in which both wore it leanne was much sharper featured and could not have risked the minimal makeup with which alyce succeeded leanne wore a powdered base and darkly shadowed eye mascara and the redness of the lipstick was close to being too harsh the woman looked every day of her five years seniority over alyce the age jordan knew the woman to be from his sessions with reid i fear i am inadequately expressing myself your honour for which i apologize most profusely said beckwith without the slightest indication of apology in his voice the leniency i seek is not out of the expected sequence that would normally govern a dismissal submission why should i be expected to agree to any such course pullinger broke in once more and jordan decided that his mental analogy of a constantly pecking flesh ripping vulture was an apposite one to prevent yourself and this court even at this early stage progressing further with such preliminary evidence which is in my contention inadequate and risks being misleading unless now addressed and which if not addressed seriously endangers the arguments i intend making on behalf of my client beckwiths pause was clearly timed as an invitation for another interruption which this time didnt come creating the silence that hung in the court like the belated rebuke that jordan was sure beckwith intended there were no longer any satisfied expressions from the tables on the other side of the court either mr beckwith prompted pullinger finally your honour i seek your guidance said beckwith refusing to expand and jordan felt a frisson of alarm that his lawyer was pushing his false humility too far a concern that was almost immediately confirmed by pullingers further silence breaking it as he had to do pullinger said are you moving towards inviting this court to find impropriety mr beckwith i am asking this court to allow me to proceed in a way different from a normal submission of its type avoided beckwith adeptly pullinger went to the opposite side of his court mr bartle can you help me with this set of circumstances the now seriousfaced bartle was on his feet before pullinger finished the question your honour i am at as much a loss as i fear you are i have not the slightest idea to what counsel is referring or alluding because of which i formally ask for the courts protection mr wolfson switched the judge i am equally at as much of a loss as my colleague your honour and ask as anxiously as he for the protection of the court responded wolfson he was a small man compared to those immediately adjacent to him with a moustache and van dyke beard so immaculately trimmed that both looked artificially stuck to his lip and chin furthering beckwiths earlier theatrical comparison looking between the two lawyers the judge said i give both of you the guarantee of such protection coming around to beckwith as he spoke and warn you mr beckwith of the irritation of this same court if the allowance you request emerges in any way whatsoever to be a frivolous manoeuvre i am grateful for such an allowance your honour responded beckwith who had remained standing throughout the exchanges remain extremely careful mr beckwith repeated the emaciated man extremely careful indeed which is precisely what i hope you will find i am being at the end of this consideration said beckwith jordan thought shut the fuck up dont gloat at having got what you wanted dr abrahams was at the rail gate before beckwith completed the summons not needing the prompt from the usher to complete the oath the man was equally well prepared listing his qualifications but beckwith stopped him halfway through the recital taking him back to identify in full every acronym particularly abrahams qualification as a veneralogist that established beckwith went with the mans impatience to record the length of his experience and the extent of his microbiological specialization qualified as you are as a microbiologist also means that you are equally qualified and practised as a serologist it does replied abrahams in his clipped formal manner for the benefit of the laymen among us in the court what is serology there was the vaguest sigh from the man technically the study of serum in practise the study of the blood to identify bacteria and viruses in effect identifying antibodies and antigens prevalent in communicable diseases and infections continuing in laymens terms infections caused by bacteria not always but predominantly virally created infections yes what are antibodies and antigens bodies that form in the blood to resist a toxin formed how by what i am sure the court is fascinated by this expedition into the mysteries of microbiology and serology broke in bartle noisily grating back his chair as he stood but is there to be a practical point to emerge from this dissertation a question that was beginning to exercise my mind said the judge mr beckwith a very practical and relevant point indeed your honour responded beckwith at once it is to establish the importance of the the pause was intentional a verbal marker as all the mans other theatrical hesitations had been omissions to which i wish to draw the courts attention my patience is limited mr beckwith reminded the judge and will not be stretched much further promised beckwith going back to abrahams the lawyer said you were about to help the court with an explanation of antibodies and antigens both are traceably formed created within the blood by a patients natural immunity or resistance to a disease or infection as well as by the induced resistance of antibiotics said abrahams there was a lot of movement now sufficient to attract the judges frowned attention between the two lawyers to the right of the court and the people directly behind them bartle finally getting up from where he sat to lean over the rail for closer consultation as aware of the activity as jordan beckwith stopped his examination looking between the animated groups and the judge and said your honour does the court require a recess here i do not intend a recess but i might very well require an explanation said the judge bartle turned startled back into the court standing fully i apologize if i have caused the court inconvenience your honour you have and it will not be tolerated again snapped pullinger the redness of his irritation pricking out on his bloodless cheeks any more than i will tolerate illprepared cases being prematurely brought before me or much more deviation from expected presentations you will precede mr beckwith with the limitations of my patience in the forefront of your mind dr abrahams resumed beckwith if an infection is resisted defeated by natural immunity or medication do such antibodies or antigens remain traceable within a patients blood for a time replied the doctor that length of time depends understandably upon the type of infection or disease and the treatment to defeat it let us come to sexually transmitted diseases and infections invited beckwith for the first time the lawyers pause was for breath not to tempt the judges impatience but pullinger seized it not a moment too soon mr beckwith observing as always your honours guidance responded beckwith just as swiftly to the doctor the lawyer continued you have extensive experience of the identification and treatment of sexually transmitted disease do you not dr abrahams i do is the manifestation of antibodies and antigens that you have described applicable in sexually transmitted diseases yes in syphilis yes in gonorrhoea yes what about chlamydia or to use its more accurate clinical name chlamydia trachomatis yes within the last month you examined the man i represent in court today harvey william jordan for venereal infection specifically chlamydia trachomatis did you not i did i also extended that examination to include syphilis and gonorrhoea can you describe as simply as possible for the courts benefit how you conducted those examinations i took invasive urogenital swabs as well as those from the throat and rectum i also took blood and urine samples what were your findings negative to every test for every possible infection specifically in the case of chlamydia the tests are clinically referred to as polymerase chain reaction pcp or ligase chain reaction lcr a sensitive detection method for chlamydia dna yes which were negative your expert witness has already attested to that came in pullinger i am anxious that there should be no doubt whatsoever of the findings your honour said beckwith you have established that to my satisfaction mr beckwith i am still waiting to discover the other point you have promised me dr abrahams returned beckwith had my client harvey jordan suffered any venereal infection that required medical treatment would the antibodies or antigens resulting from that treatment have been evident in his blood even though he had been successfully cured by treatment from a doctor or specialist other than yourself of which you had been unaware yes in the case of syphilis and hiv possibly in the case of chlamydia were there any such antibodies or antigens no what is the irrefutable medical conclusions from the absence of any antibodies or antigens from the blood of harvey jordan that he has never suffered or contracted a venereal infection which is very specifically spelled out and made clear in dr abrahams medical report already supplied to this court exploded the now very visibly flushed mr justice pullinger but not in any other medical report laid before this court those of alfred appleton and leanne jefferies both of which were delayed until the very last possible moment for presentation before your honour beckwith pointed out finally sitting beside jordan pullinger did recess the court from which bartle and wolfson hurried out trailed by their respective clients and the two venerealogists beckwith went through the rail for another although brief consultation with abrahams reid crossed from his table when beckwith returned and said that was brilliant i was flying by the seat of my pants from the conversation i had with dr abrahams admitted beckwith even more brilliant insisted reid id only heard of pullinger by reputation said beckwith i didnt imagine hed really be such a son of a bitch you think theres something to be found in the medical reports of the other side prodded jordan thats the way abrahams told me to go said beckwith im going to press as hard as i can to find out and im going to risk trying an application about sharon borowski as many applications as i can while i think pullinger will be favouring us disclosed reid if he slaps me down he slaps me down jordan saw that alyce was still staring straight ahead ignoring everybody when he pushed his chair back beckwith said where are you going stretch my legs say hello to alyce no reason why i shouldnt now that were in court is there beckwith shrugged reid said keep it brief alyce didnt look in his direction as jordan approached and there was a hesitation even when he reached her table and said hi hello how are you hating every moment of it i was looking forward to it facing him down but now im here i feel ashamed i suppose we had to sneak in there were television cameras it was awful did they get photographs of you bob doesnt think so she looked across at the two remaining lawyers whats going on i dont understand what dan is doing the medical reports on your husband and the woman are incomplete does it matter it could quiet a lot said jordan carefully is it to do with what bob said about you what did bob say about me said jordan only just keeping the demand out of his voice that you were clever and that youd found something that helped me about what i was telling him it could be lets see how the rest of the day goes i dont want to see how the rest of the day goes i want to run away and hide and not come out for a long time thats started jordan but stopped thats what jordans first thought had been to describe it as childish instead he said giving up with no reason to give up his mind butterflying beyond his conversation with alyce jordan thought it was difficult to conceive how someone like her could have gone to bed had grunting on top of her someone as heavy and animallike as the man hed just seen for the first time in court beckwith and reid were properly listening to what he said now despising him as well for being a smartass and he didnt give a damn about that and hed go on pushing if he had to until what hed read but obviously not expertly understood from the venereal case notes of alfred appleton and leanne jefferies was explained but what if the case notes didnt mean anything everything would rebound back upon them like beckwith jordan hadnt believed that the judge could be such a cantankerous old bastard whats she like who said jordan momentarily lost in his own thoughts the woman he fucked leanne i dont believe you havent looked at her i havent looked dont want to look jordan still didnt believe her much older than she really is compared to you doesnt compare at all as well with you perhaps she does things i wouldnt after france i cant imagine what that might have been alyce shook her head dismissing the memory im going to ask bob if its absolutely necessary for me to be in court would that be a good idea thats what i want why shouldnt it be all right it could look to the judge and the jury when its eventually convened as if youre the guiltier party which you arent i dont care what it looks like dont you care whos proved to be guilty if youre branded as the slut that hes trying to make you out to be not really i dont believe that i dont care what you believe jordan finished for her i dont want us to fight neither do i then lets not jordan turned at the sound of reids returning approach and saw that two of the men who had remained beyond the rail behind appletons table were starring at him and alyce when reid reached his table the lawyer said i told you to keep it brief why dont you worry more about the strain on alyce than our simply talking together said jordan aware as he spoke of the opposition entourage reentering the court i fear there has been created the possibility of a severe misunderstanding which i wish bartle turned to indicate the next table as well as my colleague mr wolfson wishes to make clear i am most anxious to correct and which i am even more anxious to have explained to me predictably broke in pullinger it is fortunate your honour that present in this court today are the two medical experts who conducted the required examinations upon my client and that of ms leanne jefferies who is enjoined in this matter how did that come about that they should be present persisted the judge bartle lowered his head not immediately replying which jordan decided to be in frustration at the constant intrusion beside him he saw beckwith was scribbling a soldiers battalion of exclamation marks on his yellow legal pad i was obliged as was my fellow attorney mr wolfson to have been alerted prior to todays hearing by mr beckwith that there was some disparity between the required medical assessments you had the evidence of mr beckwiths expert witness in your required prehearing presentations reminded pullinger why werent the omissions from your side corrected before today so that this whole matter could have been resolved without the timewasting disruption to which it has been subjected bartle turned pointedly to where beckwith sat i regret your honour that neither myself nor mr wolfson were specifically advised what the challenge was going to be had we been then this court would not have been caused the delay to which you are quiet rightly drawing attention my request sir with which my colleague mr wolfson is in full agreement to prevent any further delay in the proceedings is that this session be adjourned until tomorrow to enable the apparent discrepancies to be rectified with our deep and respectful apologies pullinger kept the lawyer standing for what seemed to be an age in the completely hushed court irritably waving the man back into his seat when the uncertain wolfson made as if to get to his feet imagining that the judged wanted a supporting request instead pullinger turned to where jordan sat with his lawyer and said mr beckwith i am as always at your honours disposal and would not seek any further to delay the progress of my submission or anything else that might be brought before the court said beckwith but i would draw your honours attention to the fact that had the omission not been brought to your honours early attention this entire case might have proceeded with insufficient evidence at the courts disposal which i am sure you would deplore a representation of the medical reports will i hope rectify that problem but i would respectfully request that your honour gives me the opportunity upon such representation to explore the matter further if those representations are applicable to the submission that i have not yet had the opportunity to pursue i certainly will wish to examine most carefully what is provided to this court tomorrow said pullinger and give you now the undertaking that you will be allowed to do the same as all three expert witnesses are present in court and as it is my wish that they so remain until the court decides otherwise the vultures head swivelled i expect to be provided by am tomorrow with the redrafted medical report upon your client mr bartle and yours mr wolfson and i will say at this point that i will not tolerate another single instance of expected court protocol being inadequately complied with it wouldnt have been right for me to have interceded declared reid youd won the point hands down if i had tried to add on more applications it would have defused everything i know thank you said beckwith theyd gathered in reids raleigh office after the local lawyer had smuggled alyce out of the court and into a waiting car i will do tomorrow if it all goes well persisted reid defensively you did the right thing assured beckwith i said im grateful any trouble getting alyce away asked jordan i dont think so i didnt see any cameras reid nodded to his telephone console thereve been four or five media enquiries asking me to call back im not sure that i will alyce told me she doesnt want to be in court said jordan reids face tightened irritably at jordans awareness she told me the same thing she wants the judge to excuse her you going to go to pullinger with that asked beckwith certainly not before the case has even properly started said reid i dont think it would be a wise application to make at any stage said beckwith you think shes up to it sitting through everything thats going to be said all the details likely to come out asked jordan reid shrugged uncertainly apparently theres a lot of family pressure building up disgrace and shame to the established dynasty that sort of shit being excused court to which i cant imagine pullinger agreeing in the first place isnt going to help is it said beckwith alyce is involved in a divorce action simple as that shes got to hope you get pullingers agreement to a closed hearing thatll give her the best protection she can hope for and each day shes got to scuttle about like a cornered animal to avoid being photographed said jordan harvey the media have got enough stock photographs of alyce to open a picture gallery if bob gets a closed hearing the media pressure will relax after a couple of days and shell settle down to the reality of what shes in and thatll be that medical reports are the focus of the moment said jordan looking between the two lawyers but stopping at reid youve still got to get pullingers order to try to get those of sharon borowski why cant you get a doctors request for alyce to be excused on the grounds of mental and physical stress hey hey hey protested beckwith loudly where the fuck are we going here you appointing yourself alyces champion defending her against all the woes of a collapsed marriage in which you are very much the exposed defendant youre still in the shit right up to your chin and if what we started today doesnt work out in our favour sinking down even further lets you and i worry about you and me and let bob worry about alyce and the reputation of her famous family ok she doesnt deserve to have to go through all this insisted jordan did you look at appleton today see what he looked like we havent sat through all the evidence yet dont know what alyce deserves or doesnt deserve to go through refused beckwith youve got to come back on course on board to why and how youre here what it could cost you and has already cost you and worry about your own ass nobody elses not even an ass as cute as alyces you hearing what im telling you harvey or are you going soft on me jesus harry christ thought jordan did he really need to hear what his lawyer was telling him it was as if he didnt want or need to know what it was what he needed as beckwith had just told him was to remember where he was why he was there and how much in the end it was likely to cost him i was just trying to be fair he said lamely fairness has got nothing to do with anything said beckwith start getting your priorities in order ok twentytwo harvey jordan was too experienced at performing at being someone else for there to be any outward indication of his shocked realization that he was showing the slightest concern for anyone other than himself certainly somebody however inadvertently who had turned his life on its head as alyce appleton had done he continued the review of the days events with the two lawyers in reids office and responded sufficiently in the car returning him and beckwith to the hotel but the moment he got there was relieved to escape into the seclusion of his locked suite uninterruptedly to examine and analyze what he started out regarding as an inexplicable lapse as such it was unthinkable virtually beyond comprehension and thered actually been previous warnings from beckwith before that days very necessary and positive rebuke but it didnt demand sackclothandashes penitence jordan reassured himself there was even a partial acceptable selfexplanation the situation into which hed been pitchforked wasnt one to which he was accustomed and professionally skilled unlike the environment the bank account fraud being the most obvious in which he knew practically by instinct every move and trick was able to recognize every manoeuvre it was because he knew every trick and manoeuvre that hed adjusted and now had all his electronic spyholes already drilled and because of them had that very day knocked appletons lawyer flat on his fat ass to end up so far at least hopefully with the judge tilting in beckwiths and therefore his favour but it was still different from what he normally did and how he did it apart from his dealings with the new york banks he wasnt playing a part pretending to be someone else whose identity he would shuck off like an unwanted skin when hed achieved all that he wanted in court he really was harvey william jordan doing everything and more to escape an entrapment and its potential cost under an incredible medieval law comparable to the rack or being hanged drawn and quartered financially if not physically so it made good and very practical sense to show consideration to alyce to protect her even because from todays behaviour she was doing very little to protect herself with the wheezing bob reid scarcely doing much more jordan had meant what hed told her today he didnt want to fight her didnt feel any animosity towards her for what had happened he didnt yet know and couldnt anticipate how he might need her but whatever and however that turned out to be it was essential that at all times she remained on his side essential too that she confirmed that france had been nothing more than a holiday dalliance ending with no commitments and no regrets but most importantly of all with no alienation of any affections he most certainly couldnt risk alyce turning against him and changing her story the true and genuinely honest story if things started to go wrong with her case and her defence and daniel beckkwith should recognize that jordan determined that beckwith definitely would if the lawyer started lecturing again at any time in the future about how he was treating alyce because hed spell out to the man the obvious reasons for doing so let beckwith know that what he was doing needed to be done solely for his own selfprotection maybe remind the thwarted cowboy even of everything hed done and suggested already to bring them out ahead in todays confrontations for reid or beckwith or both of them to imagine that he actually had some lingering interest in alyce beyond getting as far away from her and everything in which she had involved him was a load of crap hed tell beckwith that too if it ever came up between them again it had been good to think things through analyze everything in his mind and he had analyzed it subjectively as well as objectively the two lawyers had got it wrong perhaps understandably and he had acknowledged how easily it had been for them to make the mistake now it was over resolved in his mind which was the only consideration because his escape from each and every problem with which he was confronted was all that mattered jordan was first in the bar after his nightly laptop session freshly showered and changed ahead of either beckwith or george abrahams with whom theyd fixed dinner before quitting the court abrahams the next to arrive hadnt changed his clothes but he appeared more relaxed outside both the court and his consulting rooms beckwith arrived again in jeans and the bisonfigured belt and tooled cowboy boots hair flowing unrestrained the conversation was awkwardly stilted in the beginning jordan initially happy to leave the obvious effort to beckwith and the venerealogist waiting for something of relevance before intruding himself alert to an inviting opportunity it came as he was completing the second drinks order from a remark from abrahams there was an echo of something that had passed between the two lawyers during their earlier aftercourt conference but jordan seized it ahead of his own attorney isnt there an agreed format a template in which these types of medical reports are prepared for presentation to a court jordan asked i dont believe so said abrahams its not particularly common this is the first time in over a year fourteen months to be exact that ive been asked to prepare the sort of assessment i did upon you jordan looked between the doctor and his lawyer to beckwith he said i understood when i first arrived from england that it was far more frequent than that that dr abrahams was your regular consultant dr abrahams is the specialist ive called upon since i began practising in manhattan twice i think twice agreed the doctor so each specialist presents his assessments and findings on a casebycase basis in the form of his own choice persisted jordan i suppose so said abrahams in other situations im not asking you to betray any other lawyer or case confidentiality have you ever before encountered the sort of omission about antibodies or antigens that was thrown up today asked jordan who was unsure if the doctors pause following the question was for recall or the mans reflection upon confidentiality eventually abrahams said ive come across it once before it was the first time the venerealogist for the other side had prepared such a court assessment it was lack of experience not an intentional withholding what are you suggesting the fault is in this case seized beckwith im not suggesting anything bristled the man it sounded to me as if you were surprised in this particular case said beckwith dr chapman is a recognized microbiologist in the field of sexually communicable infections said abrahams hes published to some professional acclaim two specific papers one even more specifically upon chlamydia i would not have expected him to have ignored antibody reference or evidence either positive or negative surely a positive finding would be of the utmost significance pressed the lawyer of course it would finally confirmed abrahams his familiar testiness returning beckwith did not respond to jordans look although jordan was sure the other man was conscious of his attention as he was sure of several other things one was that abrahams had been reluctant without pressure to appear to criticize a colleague whose publicly acknowledged work the man admired another was that chapmans reputation beyond boston hadnt been established by either lawyer which yet again was more a failing of reid to whose case it was of more direct importance than beckwiths although after that mornings hearing that was now arguable and the third was that if he hadnt persevered although jordan accepted he hadnt started out with any targeted intention another potentially important discovery wouldnt have been made quickly he said what about dr lewell i know nothing of dr lewells work replied the man i did not know of her until this case the english examination that i underwent before coming here jordan asked abrahams what did you think of it professionally again abrahams hesitated before saying muddled completely inadequate which was why i arranged the second examination by dr abrahams stressed beckwith had you already exchanged that initial inadequate english report with the lawyers representing appleton and leanne jefferies now it was beckwith who hesitated recognizing the possible inference from the question at last he said yes thats why i had it carried out in england as part of the accepted precourt exchanges then i changed my mind and decided we needed something from an american specialist without telling the other side beckwith nodded but did not speak jordan said so until you officially exchanged the second report they would have thought you were proceeding upon the first english findings findings which dr abrahams has just told us were muddled and completely inadequate youve made your point harvey good said jordan why dont we go and eat jordan breakfasted in his room more interested in accessing his computer sites than eating he was disappointed that there was no email traffic but remembered that neither the opposing lawyers nor the boston venerealogists had local facilities and that any communication would have been restricted to telephone or possibly hotel faxes the overnight arrangement had been for jordan and the microbiologist to link up with the two lawyers at reids office although beckwith was alone when they reached it jordan hadnt bothered with television in his suite so the local newspaper coverage hed read in the taxi relegated to an inside page was the first hed seen of the previous days court opening the legal restrictions limited the account to the basic facts of the prehearing application being postponed on a procedural technicality to be reconvened that day the stock photograph of alfred appleton was from his yachting days which made the image virtually unrecognizable as the man whom jordan had seen in court the previous day and because of the way she had dressed herself down with practically no makeup the library picture of alyce wasnt a good representation either bob has had to go to persuade alyce to show up announced beckwith she called him last night saying her doctor was prepared to appear today and say the strain would be too much for her to be in court i dont want to be kept here another day protested abrahams at once i should have been back in new york today my diarys shot to hell you will be back tonight promised beckwith we can go on in her absence with the judges agreement shes not part of my application but bob thinks pullinger would consider it a spoilt girls copout and i agree i dont want to lose whatever we might have gained yesterday he looked at abrahams weve managed to get printouts of chapmans medical journal papers you talked about last night back at the hotel they could turn out to be very useful when will we know if alyce is going to show up asked jordan bobs going to call from his cellphone the lawyer looked very directly at jordan as if expecting him to say more but jordan didnt you think i could safely make a late afternoon reservation back to new york asked the doctor maybe wait a while give ourselves an hour in court to see how things go they rode unspeaking to the raleigh courthouse using the same entry route as the previous day through connected city buildings jordan looked intently through the windows as they walked but failed to detect any photographic ambush beckwiths cellphone went as they were ascending the inner steps leading up to their assigned court the lawyer hunched briefly over it his back to the flow of people up and down the stairs turning back to jordan he said alyce is coming sos her doctor alyce looked visibly ill walking falteringly but unaided and in total contrast to the striding confidence that jordan remembered from her entry into the carlyle hotel just a few days earlier there was no makeup at all and the plain black dress devoid of any jewellery accentuated the pallor of her face again she ignored everyone including jordan but when she reached her adjacent table she turned back for the reassurance of her doctors presence the man was about the same age as alyce bespectacled and blond haired hed taken a seat directly behind her nodding in reassurance at her look reid did not go directly to sit beside alyce but continued on to the court clerk gesturing as he talked to the blond newcomer the clerk in turn had a whispered conversation with pullinger after the judges arrival and pullinger said at once mr reid i should explain your honour that with your honours agreement the man sitting directly behind my client is dr walter harding the medical director of the bellamy foundation hospital here in raleigh introduced the lawyer mrs appleton is in court today with great difficulty brought on by the strain of this matter dr harding is prepared to testify before you should your honour require it as to mrs appletons physical condition he is also prepared to remain in court with your agreement to ensure mrs appletons condition does not deteriorate further the frowning judge looked invitingly to where bartle and wolfson sat bartle came at once to his feet and said it is regrettable that mrs appleton is feeling such strain but i would remind the court that distress and strain are inevitable consequences of proceedings such as these which have not in this case actually begun yet and that we hope mrs appleton recovers sufficiently to avoid any serious disruption or delay sentiments with which i fully concur said wolfson rising as bartle sat as do i said pullinger and with which i am sure you also agree mr reid absolutely your honour and thank you for the courts understanding jordan was close enough to his own lawyer to hear beckwith whisper shit still on the subject of delay i trust we are ready to proceed on the matter of medical submissions asked the judge going back to the two opposing lawyers this time they both rose together each holding a bundle of papers separated by various tags these are redrawn medical reports prepared overnight by drs chapman and lewell upon which my fellow attorney mr wolfson would also like to address the court announced bartle jordan was conscious of a movement from beckwith close beside him but there was no whispered conversation pullinger allowed some silence to build up in the court before saying mr beckwith my expert witness dr abrahams at some professional and personal inconvenience has remained here in raleigh to assist your court your honour opened beckwith as he stood i very sincerely hope that he will not be detained beyond today i equally hope that we will be able expertly and professionally to examine these new submissions by recalling dr abrahams to the stand to give this court the benefit of his expertise i would also respectfully ask pending whatsoever is to emerge from the statements this court has yet to hear from the attorneys representing alfred appleton and leanne jefferies that their respective expert medical witnesses can be called to the stand to be examined on oath upon their resubmitted findings there was immediate and obvious movement between the two now identified venerealogists culminating with chapman groping forward to attract bartles attention the attorney half turned towards the gesture but shrugged it off instead he rose to say your honour i hope already to have indicated an apology to your court for a totally inadvertent misunderstanding which i am quite satisfied i can explain to your honour without any further need to protract what is after all a subsidiary matter to the main purpose of this court your honour erupted beckwith before pullinger could respond and by so doing coming close to being overtheatrical i am going to refrain from making the most obvious comments upon what has just been said to your court mr bartle and mr wolfson have their expert witnesses behind them in this court what earthly reason is there for those expert witnesses not being called to be questioned about their original findings which could have substantial import upon my application before you today and which i in no way consider subsidiary a question i would be interested in having answered for me commented pullinger can you help me mr bartle it was not appletons attorney who responded but that of leanne jefferies to fresh movement behind both opposing lawyers the bewhiskered wolfson said your honour i wish to assure this court that my expert witness dr jane lewell is at your courts disposal as is mine tightly conceded bartle the skeletal pullinger let the court subside into footshuffling throatclearing near silence his vultureeyed concentration unbroken upon the right of his court eventually he said mr bartle your honour responded appletons attorney forced to his feet again i do not consider that you satisfactorily responded to my invitation i no longer offer that invitation but it will remain on record and most certainly in my mind and i would like you mr bartle and you mr wolfson both to bear that very much in mind as this matter proceeds to whatever its end do you mr bartle fully understand what i am saying i do your honour said bartle and in the light of your honours comments i withdraw my request to make a statement to the court mr wolfson i do your honour and i also withdraw the suggestion of my making a preliminary statement distribute to the relevant parties the newly provided material the judge ordered his clerk there will be a recess of fifteen minutes to provide an opportunity to study that material dr abrahams opened beckwith will you tell this court what is indicated in the medical reports upon alfred appleton and ms leanne jefferies that have only this day less than an hour ago been submitted the venerealogist shifted on the witness stand both alfred appleton and ms leanne jefferies have been successfully treated for chlamydia trachomatis what is a chlamydia microimmunofluorescence test that which is carried out to establish the presence of chlamydia antibodies following the infection of cervicitis in woman and urethritis in men cervicitis in women and urethritis in men are conditions caused by a chlamydia infection are they not yes do the medical reports of drs chapman and lewell show that alfred appleton suffered urethritis and ms lleanne jefferies suffered cervicitis yes what is antichlamydia igg the antibody found in the blood of sexually active adults in response to the infection and which may be detected after successful treatment do the reports of drs chapman and lewell show that alfred appleton and ms leanne jefferies had antichlamydia igg in their blood at the time of their examination by drs chapman and lewell yes could there be the slightest doubt about that not according to what i have been shown today could it have been produced by another complaint or infection the microimmunifluoscence test is remarkably sensitive and specific it is medically recognized to be accurate in ninetynine percent of woman and between eighty to ninety percent of men your honour protested bartle rising the fact that my client suffered chlamydia is not contested nor is it on behalf of my client said wolfson in support but it was not admitted to this court until an hour ago insisted beckwith who had not sat during the interjection i would ask you to find your honour that this court be allowed the fullest opportunity to explore this matter including how and why it was withheld from this court until this later hour it was not withheld refused bartle it was most certainly not supplied which is a requirement of such prehearing exchanges came back beckwith you will proceed mr beckwith hopefully without any further interruptions in the hope of this court discovering the truth of the matter ruled pullinger the court has already learned of your outstanding qualifications in your particular profession field dr abrahams picked up beckwith as i understand it there is no formularized presentation for reports such as these we are discussing is that right that is so did you subject the appropriate samples you took from my client to a microimmunofluorescence test of course which was negative as i said in evidence yesterday had that microimmunofluorescene test proved positive and produced antichlamydia igg antibodies would you have omitted that finding from the report you submitted to this court there was shuffling from the lawyers tables on the right of the court but before either bartle or wolfson could rise pullinger impatiently made a waving down motion with his hand the venerealogist still did not answer and beckwith said dr abrahams as we have already established there is no formularized style of presentation that wasnt my question doctor please answer it no of course i would have included it in my report why abrahams irritation at the question came out in a snort which he tried to turn into a cough looking directly from the witness stand at dr chapman because the whole purpose of such reports is to establish whether or not there is or has been an infection thank you said beckwith abruptly sitting and said it again to the judges invitation to continue his submission when the court reconvened after the luncheon adjournment that pullinger ordered at the conclusion of abrahams evidence with the agreement that the venerealogist should be released to return to new york your honour interrupted bartle jerking to his feet i would once more respectfully invite your honour to accept with the apologies i have already expressed and would reiterate my explanation for this most unfortunate misunderstanding this oversight and not further delay the progress of this case by calling dr chapman an application that i also most earnestly request with dr lewell said wolfson bobbing up as bartle sat as if both lawyers were performing vaudeville if not theatre why most earnestly mr wolfson demanded pullinger leannes lawyer looked blankly to the raised bench initially appearing not to understand the question the confusion increased when he did understand i meant maybe a mistake on my part your honour i meant my client and i are anxious not to impede the progress of the court now that this medical difficulty has been resolved i do not for a moment find that what you refer to as this medical difficulty has been resolved to my satisfaction refused pullinger having been found exposed to be so lamentably wanting are you mr wolfson or you mr bartle seeking to bulldoze this court to bury those failings both bartle and wolfson were standing now and their replies under no circumstance whatsoever your honour came practically in unison beside him beckwith created another battalion of exclamation marks on his yellow legal pad taking jordans mind back to their adjournment lunch in the court cafeteria at which alyce her doctor and reid had not appeared to jordans insistence there a euphoric beckwith had gauged the chances of getting his dismissal at seventyfive percent so surprised had jordan been by the estimate that his initial unconsidered thought had been that if he were discharged he could within days be back in england the nightmare relegated to the place of bad dreams until a question hurried him back to reality what he asked himself about alfred jerome appleton and the personal promise hed made to himself what alyce had in france called tit for tat the fact that if he were discharged he wouldnt be penalized for hundreds of thousands millions even didnt come into any calculation the bill would still be huge here in america and in england and he didnt intend spending as little as a single bent penny of his own money in payment or settlement for anything appleton would though jordan was more implacably determined than ever to recover everything and more far more for the upheaval the man had caused so he wouldnt be returning to london whatever the outcome of todays hearing only when alyce abruptly turned towards him did jordan realize that throughout his reflection he had been looking at her she frowned questioningly jordan looked hurriedly away i hope i can be convinced of that pullinger was saying nodding again to beckwith to resume dr mark chapman came reluctantly to the stand and took the oath looking fixedly at appleton and his lawyer not averting his gaze until pullinger stated for the record that the doctor had been called to give evidence upon the application of a defendant lawyer dr chapman began beckwith at pullingers indication will you give again for the benefit of the record and in full not by acronym your medical qualifications chapmans hesitation lasted so long that jordan briefly thought the man was going to refuse but finally chapman responded with clipped stilted formality the faintest trace of an irish accent in his voice in addition to those qualifications you also contribute to medical journals upon subjects within your chosen expertise do you not yes regularly no from the way beckwith was standing jordan could see the faint smile on his lawyers face and guessed beckwith had reached the same conclusion that he had that the venerealogist intended to remain monosyllabic how many articles have you been responsible for in say the last five years chapman thought before replying six to the admiration of your peers dr abrahams for example from bartles table there was movement that ceased at pullingers quick look i do not know you have not received letters of appreciation congratulation from other specialists in your field not from dr abrahams but from others occasionally as i made clear i asked you to give your qualifications in full for the benefit of the court record in assembling them for myself i discovered the possibility of you taking up a position as lecturing microbiologist at bostons leading teaching hospital which would accord you the title of professor would it not the appointment has not yet been made were it to be made in your favour dr chapman would you include the diagnostic importance of antibodies and antigens in your lectures the mans second hesitation was as long as the first eventually chapman said of course i would of course you would echoed beckwith because as we have heard in very informative detail from dr abrahams the discovery or otherwise of antibodies andor antigens is a very necessary part of the investigation into infections and disease either bacterial or viral are they not yes why then doctor didnt you include your discovery of antichlamydia igg in your examination of alfred appleton the purpose of which was to establish whether alfred appleton had suffered or was suffering a chlamydia infection i was responding to the instructions with which i had been served said chapman with the quickness that hinted at prior preparation now it was beckwith who let the silence build into a mocking echo you were responding to the instructions with which you had been served yes chapmans concentration was again on bartle which were persisted beckwith chapman had both hands gripping the side of the witness stand as if he physically needed its support and his face was markedly flushed compared to his complexion when hed first entered it formally his voice fluctuating he recited to examine alfred appleton and carry out various recognized tests to establish whether alfred appleton was suffering a venereal infection specifically chlamydia at the time of my examination he was not that is what i said in my report your original report qualified beckwith my original report agreed the venerealogist at the time of that original report during your investigative examination you found antichlamydia igg in alfred appletons blood did you not yes which proved that he had suffered such an infection and been treated for it yes but you chose not to include that finding i was following the remit that i had been given at the time of my examination alfred appleton did not have a venereal infection the man continued staring fixedly at the table at which appleton and his lawyer sat your honour broke in bartle groping to his feet can i help by confirming what dr chapman is telling the court the remit to which dr chapman is referring was mine knowing of its relevance in the case before us you did not ask dr chapman to provide evidence of your client having an infection in the past only if he suffered it at the time of examination demanded the judge making no effort to keep the incredulity from his voice that is so your honour confirmed bartle the fault the oversight is mine not that of dr chapman and i humbly apologize i think mr bartle that this is something about which i have to reflect further turning to the other side of the court pullinger said i think you have established your point mr beckwith with respect your honour i have a few more questions a frown flickered across the judges face lets move along mr beckwith dr chapman resumed the lawyer studying as i have your professional qualifications i noticed also that you attended harvard as did alfred appleton you were contemporaries in fact yes there was a fresh tightening to chapmans face did you know mr appleton at harvard we were acquainted how were you acquainted we shared a mutual interest in sailing queried beckwith which im sure you already knew flared the other man giving way at last to anger i did indeed dr chapman but the court didnt until now have you continued to sail with mr appleton yes so how would you describe yourself as an acquaintance or as a friend there was yet another pause before the man said as a friend i suppose the voice was quieter controlled again did you attend your friends marriage to alyce bellamy yes how would you describe alyce appleton nee bellamy as an acquaintance or as a friend your honour protested bartle i agree said pullinger i think you have extended this examination sufficiently mr beckwith is it your intention to call dr lewell it most definitely is your honour i shall permit it on the grounds of fairness but not with the same latitude as i have with this witness is that clear very clear said beckwith then i dont expect the need to remind you dr jane lewells qualifications were not as extensive as those of either george abrahams or mark chapman but did include those of microbiology and gynaecology she was a tall thin woman her face dominated by heavy thickrimmed spectacles there appeared little attempt at makeup nor to colour the greyness in her hair which she wore very short cropped to the nape of her neck jordans immediate impression when she began responding to his lawyers questions in a flat although confident voice was that she was setting out to be as monosyllabic as the specialist doctor who had preceded her it was quickly confirmed in a series of staccato yes or no answers despite beckwith adjusting his questions to achieve fuller responses pullingers mounting impatience came to its head after she agreed that leanne jefferies had suffered a chlamydia infection with peter wolfsons interrupting admission that her first inadequate report had been a strictly accurate diagnosis according to his limited remit so there we have it insisted pullinger both expert witnesses adhered to the very strictest letter of their legally permissible instructions instructions that remain very much in the forefront of my mind that had their evidence been presented in its original form could have seriously misled myself and a subsequent jury but for the intervention of mr beckwith it is now established for the benefit of subsequent proceedings that both alfred appleton and leanne jefferies suffered a venereal infection is this matter now concluded to your satisfaction mr beckwith it most certainty is to mine with respect your honour i have questions to this witness that will occupy no more than five further minutes which i will time to the precise second said the judge the domicile of ms leanne jefferies is east th street apartment b manhattan is it not yes are you ms leanne jefferies gynaecologist no had she been a patient of yours prior to her coming to you for the examination we are discussing today no according to what has been indicated here today it was peter wolfson her attorney who made the appointment with its very specific remit for leanne jefferies to be examined by you yes until this occasion has peter wolfson had clients examined by you no did you not think it strange that a woman domiciled in manhattan should be asked to travel all the way to boston for an examination for which there are reverting to theatrics beckwith consulted papers on the table in front of him there are to my rough calculation twenty consultants with qualifications matching yours within thirty minutes even allowing for the worst traffic for the first time the woman lapsed into the previously familiar hesitations finally she said yes did you ask her your time is rapidly running out mr beckwith warned the judge dr lewell hurried beckwith no i did not ask her how friendly professionally or otherwise are you with dr chapman you will answer that question and that will be the end of your examination ordered pullinger we are friends professionally and socially said the woman twentythree the chambers of judge hubert pullinger were as frigidly austere as the man himself wallpapered practically from floor to ceiling with legal books each precisely in its regulated indexed place scribbled notes in the centre of an otherwise unmarked blotter pens in a regimented holder beside a telephone console the chesterfield with matching chairs was in red oxhide and unoccupied because pullinger kept the four lawyers standing before him his attention totally concentrated upon david bartle and peter wolfson the only physical indication of pullingers fury was the involuntary tap of an index finger as if he were keeping occasional time with the sticky tick of the mahoganycased grandfather clock creating the sole sound in the room apart from the asthmatic rasp of reids breathing the judge still wore his robes and when he finally spoke eyes now lowered over his prepared notes the tightly controlled voice was so quiet that at first until they adjusted both bartle and reid strained forward to hear properly throughout the course of this outrageous day i have almost lost count of the offences that you mr bartle and you mr wolfson have caused and inflicted upon my court the most obvious is contempt the worst to which i believe i have ever been subjected in twentyfive years upon this bench there is no mitigation or explanation that i will accept from either of you i have been minded to abandon the full case before it officially opens which is why i have interrupted the current application before its completion to report you both to your respective state regulatory and licensing authorities with the recommendation that you both be subject to official enquiry into your total lack of professionalism that is still a course open to me and one i might choose to pursue in deciding to postpone that decision i am mindful of the inconvenience and costs that would be caused your clients as well as those of mr beckwith and mr reid i find no reason why any of them should suffer because of your conduct when the court resumes however i intend advising both doctors who appeared as your expert witnesses that i shall complain to their licensing authorities dissatisfied as i am with the explanations both have offered it is i who decide the interpretation and application of the law not either of you with the sleight of hand of snakeoil salesmen pullinger paused clearing his throat after such an uninterrupted diatribe as both of you would appear to need guidance in law i will remind you that the course i have chosen today to address you as i am now doing is highly unusual and might even be construed as undue and premature bias although i give you my absolute assurance that this is not nor ever will be the case it does however open the way for both or either of you to object to my continuing to hear any more of this current application or the divorce itself and apply for a new judge that would of course require me to justify this meeting which i am fully prepared to do i will continue this recess to enable you both to consider your course of action and discuss it with whomever you choose and to advise drs chapman and lewell of what i have told you but warn you that if you decide to continue i will not tolerate any more of the behaviour to which i and my court have been subjected this meeting is concluded your honour tried wolfson immediately to be faced by pullingers halting hand i have already told you mr wolfson that i will not accept any mitigation or explanation attempts rejected pullinger leave my chambers and comply with every request i have made of you yours are now the decisions to be made once more neither alyce her lawyer nor her accompanying doctor were in the court cafeteria but it was midafternoon not a recognized break time and beckwith without pause had swept jordan up on his way from the chambers confrontation ahead of everyone else who endured it with difficulty jordan held himself back until theyd collected their unwanted coffee and chosen a table beyond the hearing of any surrounding table and then he demanded is it all over am i out of it that wasnt why we were summoned to chambers calmed beckwith i havent even made my dismissal submission yet you know i havent then what was it for jordan sat without movement or question throughout his lawyers recounting of the inchambers meeting at its end jordan declared were there surely were nowhere dashed the lawyer if they go for a new judge weve lost everything we thought wed achieved no new judge could be told how wed exposed the shit they tried to dump on us you cant be serious pullingers hogtied them whichever way they try to run which i guess he had to do being the judge he is better than any other judge would have worked out how to do it in the circumstances what would you do in their position suicide is the first thing that comes to mind im being serious for fucks sake i was to an extent seriously i think id go for a rehearing what sort of delay would that involve fuck knows months i guess appleton and leanne would have to start over again from scratch i dont know of any case any set of circumstances like this on record so it would attract more attention than it already has queried jordan posing the most prominent of his several concerns inevitably a lot of his carefully stabled trojan horses would be useless too jordan accepted hed virtually have to start over to put himself as far ahead as he had this first time can pullinger stop like this right in the middle of your application couldnt he carry on and decide on my dismissal i just told you i dont know of any other legal situation like this thats ever arisen in north carolina or anywhere else in north america with the criminal conversation statute still in existence we might have a way out if today collapses im going to have a lot of time to go through the records to see if there is a precedent we can use what about the cost of the sort of delay youre talking about ill certainly apply for costs of everything so far i dont see how pullinger could refuse or appletons side resist beckwith broke off at the sight of the court usher entering the cafeteria and rose in anticipation saying decision time as he did so they were the last to return to court although reid was settling alyce in her seat ahead of them she sat docilely and jordans impression as he followed to the adjoining table was that alyce appeared practically catatonic it was very different on the other side of the court everyone was flushed the two doctors shifting constantly in their seats appleton was gesturing with bartle but leanne was pulled away from her lawyer as if she wanted physical separation beckwith didnt sit but continued on to reids table for a huddled discussion until the shouted announcement of pullingers reentry the judge didnt hurry this time pointedly rearranging his robes around him having done so he said counsel will approach the bench the four lawyers arranged themselves in front of the judge in the order in which they sat pullinger said well my client wishes the hearing and the case in full to continue before your honour said bartle but my expert witness dr chapman wishes to address the court my client also wishes to continue before your honour echoed wolfson dr lewell also seeks to address you your honour pullinger nodded in dismissal and as he retook his seat beckwith hissed were going on christ knows why but we are looking towards his lawyer as he was jordan saw reid hunched towards alyce who showed no response no awareness even of what she was being told dr chapman and dr lewell will stand ordered pullinger when both did the judge continued for the record i will repeat what i know upon my instructions has already been communicated to you by your respective lawyers for whose clients you appeared before me as well as providing written medical opinion it is that i intend reporting to your governing licensing body my displeasure at the manner and lack of professionalism of both your evidence and your written opinions i am in turn advised that you both wish to make representations before me i am refusing to hear those representations this is not the court to hear or adjudicate upon your professional conduct for me to hear whatever it is you wish to say could prejudice any future enquiries in which you might be involved you will both be provided with a full transcript of all the proceedings in which you have featured thus far as well as a copy of what i write to your licensing authority that isnt fair protested chapman this will not be argued and neither of you will make outbursts in my court which i order you to leave immediately usher escort the two doctors from the premises switching his attention to the other side of the court pullinger said lets get on shall we mr beckwith jordan was aware of a flicker of interest from alyce as his lawyer stood reminder notes in his hand he was aware too of beckwiths pause the actor preparing himself for his opening speech beckwith said as your honour has already had cause to remind us this is a court of law it is not despite the evidence that might be brought before it a court of morals it is the law its interpretation and its administration upon which i seek to address this court alyce had definitely emerged from her private world jordan decided he was encouraged too by what he inferred to be several nods of approval from the judge i submit for your honours ruling that the north carolina statute section is an inextricably connected hybrid of two parts continued beckwith using his reminder notes more as a gesturing prop than a memory prompt from the first comes the accusation if proven to your honours satisfaction of alienation of affection which surely requires the intercession between spouses of a third destructive party with the result that the marriage irretrievably breaks down the second support to section is the offence of criminal conversation which i further invite your honour to interpret as the intentional alienating seduction by a destructive third party i seek to prove to your honours satisfaction and agreement that my client harvey jordan is not liable to the accusation of criminal conversation because at the moment and time of the admitted affair with mrs alyce appleton there no longer existed in mrs appleton any affection whatsoever to be alienated therefore there can be no case for criminal conversation in the submitted papers before you alfred jerome appleton admits adultery with at least two different women at no time during their marriage in which considerable difficulties arose did mrs appleton betray her marriage vows indeed there will be evidence produced before you that mrs appleton did everything in her power to save her marriage from irretrievable collapse even attempting a reconciliation and resuming conjugal relations with her husband it was during this attempted reconciliation that mrs appleton contracted chlamydia that has become the subject of so much discussion already and upon which i will not dwell further at this point although there are points i intend to raise in my closing arguments any lingering affection the remotest possibility of a lasting reconciliation vanished when mrs appleton discovered she had contracted a venereal infection from her husband who could have been the only source or cause of that infection she initiated divorce proceedings the intention of which was communicated to her husband before her departure for a lengthy vacation in the south of france at the time of that departure mrs appleton considered herself married to her husband in name only a name she sought to divest herself of as quickly as possible in france she was a lonely woman a betrayed and humiliated woman only recently cleansed of a sexual disease uncaringly passed on to her by her promiscuous husband alyce was listening intently now to every word jordan saw actually with a pen in her hand although she did not appear to be taking notes both opposing lawyers were as well as pullinger appleton and leanne jefferies were gazing directly ahead as if oblivious of each other and in france this lonely betrayed and humiliated woman met my client harvey jordan a gambler broke in pullinger the inference was of accusation beckwith managed to pick up practically without pause that is indeed how mr jordan makes his living which some might regard as an unusual career certainly out of the ordinary to those of us who follow a more mundane profession but i would suggest that at this very moment those working on the trading floors of wall street mr appleton himself as a commodity trader could be described as gamblers the very men who made america the world leader it is today the astors and the vanderbilts and the jp morgans were chancetaking entrepreneurs which is an interchangeable word for a gambler quite so nodded pullinger harvey jordan was an entirely innocent party in a long ago divorce the papers of which are before you resumed beckwith he was on vacation in the south of france a region he knows well and in which he vacations most years he always stays when he is in cannes at the carlton hotel where by total and absolute coincidence alyce appleton was also staying their meeting was not prearranged it was a chance encounter like so much is in life harvey jordan took alyce appleton on the shortest of excursions along the coast they had an affair the briefest of episodes which ended with her return to her country his return to his country they did not exchange addresses or telephone numbers neither considered it as anything more than what it was a holiday liaison harvey jordan was not engaged in criminal conversations intent upon alienating the affection of alyce appleton from a husband in name only for whom her only attitude of mind was contempt for what he had inflicted upon her to be judged guilty liable for an offence your honour there surely needs to be evidence produced that a law has been contravened here i respectfully submit that there is nothing in law that supports the accusation against my client for several minutes after beckwith sat which seemed to catch the opposing tables by surprise there was the necessary silence for everyone to digest what beckwith had said pullinger broke it he said that was an address too eloquent to have been kept from a jury which must i suppose forever remain their loss what you have told me is of course based upon the prehearing statements of mr jordan and mrs appleton do you not intend calling them to support what you just said jordans impression was that for the first time beckwith was disconcerted although he concealed it well quickly rising again the lawyer said my address was upon the admitted and uncontested facts your honour they require of course to be subjected to the examination of the other side for someone who had always until now existed as mr invisible never to be seen and even more importantly never to be recognized harvey jordans feeling at being the sole object of everyones unrelenting attention lurched into the surreal he was confident that he had his hand upon the bible and was correctly reciting the oath but his mind suddenly blanked of everything he had so carefully memorized to wordrehearsed perfection the bewildering outofbody experience remained throughout the early officially required formalities and only began and then very slowly to ease when straining for concentration jordan forced himself to respond to beckwiths gentle yes or no confirmation of his already provided statement beckwiths abrupt departure from that statement did you consciously predatorily set out to seduce alyce appleton finally brought jordan back to the reality of his surroundings every answer had to be thought through although without any obvious hesitation jordan warned himself he couldnt risk once being caught out in a lie no i did not how then did you look upon alyce appleton jordan gave an uncertain gesture to give himself time as a fellow guest at the hotel someone with whom i got into casual passing conversation yet you lunched together the first day of your meeting jordan gave another delaying shoulder movement shed prevented me losing the book i was reading it was a snack rather than lunch it was entirely inconsequential what gave it consequence nothing happened specifically to give it any consequence we talked about books and writers i knew from my knowledge of the area that alexander dumas novel the man in the iron mask was based on fact and that the victim was at one time imprisoned on an island just off the coast of cannes i invited her on a surprise trip to see it beckwith was building up to how he and alyce went to bed that first time jordan accepted it hadnt been ugly as it would sound here now in a cold court it would make alyce appear a whore which she wasnt abruptly jordan remembered beckwiths ballpark estimate of the potential damages if pullinger found against him and beckwiths angry insistence that alyces words made her out to be the pursuer not the pursued you chartered a yacht sailed to the ile st marguerite and saw the prison in which the man in the iron mask was incarcerated yes hed limit his answers as much and as best he could jordan decided then what did you do we had lunch on the yacht beckwith was looking very directly at him jordan saw with what he gauged the beginning of a warning frown it was a catamaran and yes thats where we lunched what happened after that we swam to do which you had to change did you change together in the same cabin or separately separately you didnt suggest that you should undress together no did it not enter your mind that you might suggest it mr jordan no did you not find mrs appleton attractive yes sexually attractive jordan hesitated looking at the woman who looked directly and expressionlessly back at him yes yet it did not occur to you in the circumstances in which you found yourself to suggest you undress together make a sexual approach to her no why not it did not seem i dont know i didnt did you fear that she would rebuff you i didnt think about whether she would rebuff me or not and in the early evening you sailed back to cannes arriving around dinner time did you suggest dinner yes did she accept jordan felt hot hotter than he had when hed first stepped his mind blank on to the witness stand no what were her precise words as best as i remember she said she was not hungry after the lunch what else do you remember her saying mr jordan that she was tired and demanded beckwith the frown deepening that she wanted to go to bed and jordan did not immediately reply alyce was still looking at him without any expression whatsoever mr jordan demanded beckwith but not by herself jordan blurted mrs appleton told you she wanted to go to bed but not by herself insisted the lawyer yes twentyfour you stalked her didnt you demanded david bartle loudly you sought out alyce appleton in the south of france and pursued her until you got her into your bed totally unaware of any of the detailed evidence that appletons enquiry team might have assembled to incriminate him jordan recognized that under crossexamination he had to test every word and innuendo to avoid stumbling into traps and never lose his temper no danger from this first exaggerated opening no i did not you knew alyce appleton was a married woman too easy to be caught jordan thought she wore a wedding ring and a particularly obvious engagement ring given to her by her husband i did not know from whom she obtained the engagement ring qualified jordan believing he saw a safe avoidance i believe widows divorcees even still sometimes continue to wear their rings she told you she was married yes he needed to repeat that he and alyce had parted without any intention to meet again one of the several points with which beckwith had concluded his examination minutes earlier but not until after youd seduced her not until after wed slept together said jordan qualifying again at your persistent urging i have already told this court the circumstances in which the affair began very slightly although not easing any of his selfimposed safeguards jordan began to relax he didnt think bartle was a particularly good interrogator but very positively refused to lapse into any false security youre telling the court that alyce appleton was prostituting herself up and down the french riviera jordan felt the burn of anger but quickly subdued it i am telling you nothing of the sort and you and the court know it he should have stopped after the initial denial shit before this examination is over i shall know a great deal about everything threatened the lawyer did you find alyce appleton attractive jordan hesitated trying to anticipate the subsequent question yes did you fall in love with her jordan managed to avoid the hesitation no did you think she might fall in love with you too obvious thought jordan no what would you have done if she had indicated that she was falling in love with you it wasnt that sort of situation answer the question pullinger ordered sharply i would have made it clear that the feeling was not reciprocated but gone on sleeping with her no insisted jordan what would you have done persisted bartle terminated the situation are you sure quite sure you are no longer married i am divorced how long were you married four years i have provided the court with all the legal documents and evidence were there children from the marriage no are you the father of any children out of wedlock it was a rerun of his first meeting with daniel beckwith jordan remembered wrong to regard that as a useful rehearsal alyce hadnt known he had been married he remembered no it is customary for you to vacation every year in the south of france yes always at the carlton at cannes i move along the coast until you find a woman to pursue fuck you thought jordan not responding i asked you a question mr jordan pressed bartle i inferred it as a totally fallacious and misleading statement which being both untrue and ridiculous did not require an answer jordan thought he detected the slightest of facial expressions a wince maybe from beckwith indulge me with a comment mr jordan he shouldnt have opened himself to the mockery jordan acknowledged and the question could be the feared mantrap if theyd discovered previous holiday affairs i do not tour the cote dazur seeking women to seduce how many years have you vacationed in the south of france jordan genuinely had to pause to calculate the period its not a figure ive ever bothered to record i would estimate about ten twelve possibly how many holiday romances have you had during the course of those possible twelve years the trap was gaping open in front of him feared jordan at once came a contradiction why was it so much of a trap he could even cover himself if they had discovered some of the other woman before alyce three i think he hadnt spent a single holiday alone were any of them married i dont know did any of them wear wedding rings or engagement rings i dont remember does it matter to you if the women you pursue are married surely the lawyer would have pounced by now if hed found a previous conquest and so what if he had jordan asked himself again every liaison in which i have been involved has been consensual i do not to use the word you persist wrongly upon using pursue women you didnt know if it would or would not endanger alyce appletons marriage when you first went to bed with her although you knew she was married jordan seized the ineptly presented opportunity neither alyce appleton nor i regarded our time together in france as anything other than what it was an adventure that would end with no attachments on either side we parted as the court has already heard at the end of my earlier evidence without any intention of ever meeting again i did not alienate alyce appletons affection from her husband she no longer had the slightest affection for him she told you that she told me that papers upon which she had been working signing the day we met were divorce papers why did she extend her holiday in france for a further week persisted bartle jordan shrugged and immediately regretted doing so we didnt discuss it at any length i was not returning to england for another week she had no pressing reason to come back here to america wasnt it that she was falling in love with you absolutely not as ive told but that you told her you didnt love her i repeat absolutely not denied jordan you gave her a ring did you not a what frowned jordan incredulous conscious of beckwiths sudden jerk of attention during your stay in st tropez didnt you buy her a ring and put it on the finger upon which alyce appleton by then no longer wore her wedding or engagement rings demanded bartle and celebrate as people do upon engagements by drinking champagne what exclaimed jordan blocked on the same word in his astonishment bartle beckoned the usher handing the man a sheaf of photographs and itemizing their recipients to pullinger the lawyer said these were taken in st tropez your honour the date clearly shown upon the prints coincides with that during which alyce appleton shared a room with harvey jordan at the residence de la pinade momentarily jordan stared bewildered at the two photographs he had been handed one showed him and alyce walking arm in arm by what he recognized to be the place des lices and the other at a table at the mouscardins restaurant at the edge of the port he was clearly holding her left hand putting a ring on her wedding finger there were half filled champagne glasses on their table the bottle in its cooler alongside and then he erupted into laughter alyce at whose courtroom table another set of prints had been delivered sniggered leaning sideways to her lawyer reid didnt laugh perhaps your client would share the joke with the court mr beckwith said pullinger who wasnt smiling either theres an open air market on the place des lices in st tropez on two days of the week tuesdays and saturdays explained jordan patiently it caters for tourists as well as local residents selling all sorts of things cheap clothing and a lot of local produce cheeses and meats and there are bricabrac stalls from one of them at a tuesday market i bought a plastic ring in imitation marble it was a joke between us playacting the way people do playacting the way people do when they feel they are falling in love said bartle no refused jordan it wasnt like that like what mr jordan a serious declaration of love a declaration of anything of the sort you are trying to make it into why didnt you mention it in your written statement hold your temper jordan told himself because it was so inconsequential so meaningless i had totally forgotten the incident didnt even remember it when i first saw the photographs you claim it was a joke it was a joke a silly harmless joke people laugh at jokes said bartle you and alyce appleton look very serious at your restaurant table with your celebratory champagne this is a ridiculous attempt to create a situation where no situation existed insisted jordan did alyce appleton continue to wear your meaningless plastic joke ring after that day in st tropez thered be more photographs jordan guessed she might have done i dont remember her doing so as i have tried to make clear it was totally inconsequential something over in a moment and forgotten alyce appleton doesnt appear to have forgotten it said bartle summoning the usher to distribute another selection of photographs the second batch was thicker than the first and jordan was surprised that his initial reaction at flicking through them was not apprehension at the questioning they were going to prompt but the briefest moment of nostalgia do you recognize remember these photographs of course i do replied jordan unthinkingly of course you do again mocked bartle as he looked up to the bench i would particularly invite your honour to look at the ring upon alyce appletons finger as i go through the numbered sequence here dated as they all are is mrs appleton boarding a yacht to another sailing excursion this time to the lies de porquerolles and print five shows mrs appleton and mr jordan at cagnes print six has them at the hermitage hotel in monte carlo and this declared bartle with the enthusiasm of a conjuror groping into his top hat for the rabbit is the photograph of alyce appleton passing through nice airport for her return to america bartle paused to create his moment each of the photographs before you your honour very clearly show alyce appleton wearing the joke inconsequential plastic ring so seriously slipped upon her finger by the defendant the gesture celebrated with champagne and he hadnt once been aware of it being on alyces finger after that one fun lunch at the mouscardins restaurant thought jordan alyce walked unaided but with her lawyer attentively close at hand to the witness stand her doctor tensed forward from his chair behind took the oath in a controlled voice and settled herself demurely in her seat knees discreetly covered by her midcalf skirt hands crossed in her lap despite the lack of makeup there was a tinge of natural colour to her cheeks in a steady controlled voice she went through the identifying formalities before looking expectantly to daniel beckwith on her trip to france she agreed she had had an affair the first in which she had engaged after her marriage to alfred appleton with harvey jordan she could not recall a time in her life when she had felt so lost so abandoned having initiated the divorce proceedings after discovering she had a sexual disease and undergone successful treatment she had tried to distance herself as far away as she could from a husband she despised and for whom she no longer had any feeling other than contempt when shed got to france shed realized it was not the good idea she had imagined it would be she was lonely her confidence gone thered been days specifically two she admitted under beckwiths questioning when she hadnt bothered to bathe or even get out of her hotel bed harvey jordan had been kind at no time had his attitude towards her been that of a predatory seducer shed been intrigued by his invitation to what emerged to be the prison in which the man in the iron mask had been held never for a moment considering the possibility of his making a sexual advance which he didnt feeling as she did because of her personal circumstances the circumstances of being betrayed and abandoned she had been deeply moved at seeing the cell in which someone had been shut off from the world as she at that moment felt herself to have been what happened after you disembarked from the catamaran back in cannes to return to the hotel at which you were both staying asked beckwith looking directly at the man her voice even and clear alyce said harvey asked if i wanted to have dinner i told him no that i was tired after being at sea all day and that i wanted to go to bed but not alone had harvey jordan made any sort of sexual approach any sexual advances prior to your telling him that no none whatsoever so the approach came from you without any encouragement or pressure from him yes although when i said it i didnt think of it imagine it as a sexual approach id been too long alone like the poor man whod spent his life in jail for an offence that has never been positively known i just didnt want to be alone that night but that night you and harvey jordan made love yes were you a willing partner to the lovemaking yes did harvey jordan force himself upon you absolutely not i had only ever known one man sexually before harvey who was the most gentle considerate man i could ever have imagined sex with my husband had been close to rape sex with harvey was what id always imagined love to be but never known the reactions stirred through the court from the appleton table there was anger from the man himself but a smile of satisfaction from bartle beckwith irritably tapped his finger against his leg quickly beckwith said did you imagine yourself believe yourself falling in love with harvey jordan of course not neither of us from that night until i left to return here to this divorce had any illusions or fantasies about what was happening we were having an affair for my part a wonderful affair but it ended with my flight taking off from nice you did not intend plan ever to see him again never what was your reaction at learning that harvey jordan had been cited as a co respondent in this divorce and that a damages claim for criminal conversations had been filed against him great distress i do not deny the affair in france but according to my understanding of the damages accusation harvey jordan is not in any way responsible for me divorcing my husband by the time i met harvey jordan there was not the slightest affection remaining to alienate me from my husband there hadnt been for a very long time as he sat beckwith leaned close to jordan and said better than id hoped apart from the actual moment of admitting that she had made the first sexual move alyce had avoided looking at jordan he thought she might have returned to him when her examination switched from beckwith to bartle ready to give a smile of both thanks and encouragement but she didnt she did shift on the witness stand sitting more positively upright as if preparing herself for the attack that was to come but it was with an attitude of defiance forced defiance maybe not the lassitude under which she had appeared crushed throughout most of the hearing you went to france still considering another reconciliation with your husband didnt you thats why you took the final irrevocable documentation with you instead of signing it here in america i had no intention whatsoever of entering another attempted reconciliation with a husband who had given me venereal disease the final documents were not signed here in america because they werent ready when i went to france they were sent to me for signature while i was there in france you fell in love with harvey jordan bartle paused searching for the quote from his notes the most gentle considerate man i could ever have imagined no her face was more flushed now with what jordan inferred to be anger you were so much in love with him that you couldnt wait to get into bed with him could you so eager in fact that you actually invited him to sleep with you after enduring the life to which i was subjected by my whoring husband i welcomed gentility and kindness is that why you were happy to settle with a plastic token of love i would started alyce but stopped instead she said it wasnt a love token as harvey has already told you it was a joke a silly joke that meant nothing a silly joke that meant nothing but which you continued to wear throughout your time together in france even on the plane coming back here for your divorce action that you didnt finally initiate until you met harvey jordan ive answered your question said alyce not quite argued bartle you began answering but changed your mind about what you were going to say what was that mrs appleton that you originally intended to say i said what i intended to say insisted the woman did you set yourself a time limit to take a lover in france my purpose in going to france was to get as far away as i could from a man of whom my contempt and disgust was absolute not to take a lover shes holding up well beckwith leaned sideways to whisper to jordan hes trying to run her down like a truck but shes not letting him beside his lawyer jordan was burning with fury hands tightly gripped together beneath the court table you do not like love sex do you mrs appleton persisted bartle from the very moment of your marriage you were reluctant to share your husbands bed it was not until i met harvey jordan in france that i learned the joy of sex what i did not like was rape which is how i came to regard my sexual encounters with my husband very early on in my marriage you loved your husband though didnt you i imagined i did at the very beginning it did not take me long to realize that was all it was imagination which is why this action against harvey is so ridiculous how can a man alienate affection when no affection exists youve rehearsed your story well the two of you havent you practically the same phrases the same denials there has been no rehearsal no preparation between harvey and myself to defend this preposterous accusation there didnt need to be all we both needed to do was to tell the truth which we both have the flush was going from her face alyce even appeared to have resettled more relaxed in her seat wheres the ring you wore throughout your time with harvey jordan in france ive no idea youve no idea of the whereabouts of the love token that was so precious to you i have no idea where the joke ring is no isnt it somewhere at home in one of those boxes in which women keep things trinkets that they treasure more than diamonds or gold things of the greatest sentimental value i do not have such a box you do remember him buying it and giving it to you in st tropez dont you i had forgotten until i was reminded by your photographs but now you do remember yes what did he say when he took your hand and slipped it upon the finger from which you had so recently discarded your husbands wedding ring i dont remember did he say it was a token of his love i dont remember did he ask you to marry him when you were divorced and free to do so i think i would have remembered if he had i dont remember surely he didnt say something like this is a plastic ring i want to put on your wedding finger as a joke i really dont remember repeated alyce it is you attaching such great importance to the ring we didnt except that you wore it all the time you were together look at your own photographs invited alyce youll see in most of them that i wore the sun hat and sandals i bought there it was very hot that was all i thought them to be a hat and a pair of sandals there was an isolated snigger from dr harding from behind the rail i can see that you did mrs appleton agreed battle resuming his seat but as youve just told the court you bought the hat and sandals yourself harvey jordan bought the ring for you and you didnt wear that most of the time you wore it all the time beckwith waited until alyce got back to her table to sit beside her lawyer before rising and as he did so the judge said i trust this will not be a lengthy concluding submission i see no reason for it occupying very much more of your honours time because i believe the evidence you have heard speaks for itself responded beckwith this was no instant love match the stuff of fiction and movies this was a brief adult affair between two people one a single unattached man on vacation the other a lonely woman about to divorce a husband for whom affection if it had ever existed had long ago died mr bartle has attempted with very obvious desperation to make much of the giving of a ring as proof of his clients claim against harvey jordan both harvey jordan and alyce appleton have described the ring episode as a silly joke which was all it was i submit to you your honour that mr bartles efforts to make it appear otherwise is an even sillier joke and an indication of his desperation although far less sinister than the efforts to which the other side appeared prepared to go with the medical evidence of chlamydia about which i will say nothing further knowing as i do that your honour has reserved judgement upon it what i do invite you to find upon the evidence is that under section of the north carolina statute is that harvey william jordan is not guilty of alienation of affections nor of criminal conversations and dismiss him from the proceedings judge hubert pullinger had listened to the submission slumped back in his chair not appearing to make any notes he remained that way for several moments before coming forward over his notation ledger his throat rumbling as it had earlier to clear it before making a pronouncement you have mr beckwith forcibly made a submission of some substance some passion even which i would be ill treating with a snap ruling without the benefit of proper reflection a snap decision which might even provide you with ground for an appeal i choose to remind you of the legal application open to me on charges of alienation of affection and criminal conversation between which there is an important division the date of separation of the parties is important to prove alienation of affections and i have yet to hear sworn evidence to prove the depositions that have already been provided to the court essential to that is the malicious conduct of your client harvey jordan in contributing or causing such loss the parties to the marriage must still be together in order to prove this claim i have yet to hear further about that although there is every indication that by the time mrs appleton met and engaged in admitted adultery with harvey jordan the contesting parties were not together the action of criminal conversation however is more complex it is a lawsuit sounding in tort an injustice to the person based upon sexual intercourse between the defendant your client and the plaintiffs spouse mrs appleton further to define the law a criminal conversation is a strict liability tort because the only thing the plaintiff alfred appleton has to establish is an act of sexual intercourse the existence of a valid marriage between the plaintiff and the adulterous spouse and the bringing of a lawsuit within the applicable statute of limitations it is not a defence that the defendant did not know his sexual partner was married which indeed mr beckwith you did not advance nor is it a defence that the adulterous partner consented to the sex which again you have not advanced nor is it open to you to plead that a separation already existed that the marriage was unhappy or that the defendants sex with the spouse did not otherwise affect the plaintiffs marriage most important among other caveats which i will not at this stage explore further is that the plaintiff had also been unfaithful there was the familiar pause for further throat clearing beckwith expressionless was sitting tensed forward leaving the judgement to be recorded by the court stenographer bartle was doing the same but there was already a satisfied smile settling on his face on that of alfred appleton too none of which diminishes the submission that you have made before me today it is my function to interpret and administer the law as it has been proscribed even before the full and proper beginning of this action matters arose which greatly disturb me and upon which i have yet to adjudicate i do not believe that i would be properly administering the law which is my duty if i found for your submission and dismissed your client from this matter as i have in the matter of the medical evidence i intend to reserve my judgement pending the full hearing fuck it jordan heard his lawyer say it was what jordan thought too twentyfive after granting david bartles instantly sought and unopposed application on behalf of appleton for the divorce hearing to be in closed session pullinger adjourned until the following week citing his need to use the intervening days to tidy the loose ends of this wholly unfortunate beginning and once more jordan and the two lawyers gathered in reids raleigh office to review the judges rejection we should have known about that goddamned ring complained reid at once openly accusing if id remembered it i would have told you said jordan no longer deferring to either lawyer although glad now that he and beckwith hadnt split after their earlier disputes it was exactly as alyce and i told the court a stupid joke thing that was totally unimportant and i cant and wont believe pullinger refused the dismissal because of it that would be ridiculous he looked at beckwith i thought you made a convincing submission thank you the lawyer inclined his head in acknowledgement and said it was annoying being caught out about the ring but i dont think that was why pullinger found against us either i think he was thoroughly pissed off by what the other side tried to pull and didnt want to protract everything further with another possible plea on leannes behalf this way hes tied it up in one bundle you still estimating any finding against me as high as you did in the beginning asked jordan beckwith shook his head were way down the scale now weve got to be i agree said reid alyce stood up well until it was all over said jordan when shed been invited to the review conference she had pleaded exhaustion and dr harding at once confirmed after examining her that medically it would be too much for her to go through any analysis actually administering some medication in a court anteroom before yet again smuggling her from the building now youre going to be centre stage beckwith reminded reid you think shes going to be strong enough to stand up to it all today wasnt even a taste of what shes going to face from bartle when we get to the full case im glad of the adjournment admitted reid im seeing harding first thing tomorrow after whats already happened i dont want to throw any more medical stuff at pullinger but i might ask for some relaxation in her attending if harding tells me its necessary you intending to have him on hand all the time queried beckwith another reason for seeing him tomorrow expanded reid im hoping his function at the bellamy clinic is more administrative than actually practising if it is he might be able to spend more time than someone with a patient list he looks young to be the administrator of an entire hospital suggested jordan local boy made good said reid very good indeed what do i have to do now jordan asked his lawyer do i have to be in court the whole time there was a lot more use to which he could put the new york bank accounts ill think about that as things take their course said beckwith cautiously were pretty much at the back of the bus in the immediate future but certainly you should be in court in those early days im sure were still ahead as far as our part of the case has gone but i dont want to upset a spiky old bastard like pullinger by making a move hed consider disrespectful and after his reaction to how you make a living i wouldnt like to argue pressure of business i dont think much of bartle or wolfson prompted jordan or reid for that matter he mentally added we knocked both of them way off course said beckwith bartle did the best he could with what he had which was why the ring was a nuisance without it he really would have been floundering he looked at reid dont underestimate him next week hes got a lot of court ground to recover wolfson too alyce is going to be put through a lot of hoops and she already needs a doctor on standby thats what im going to talk through with harding tomorrow shouldnt there be a specialist on hand as we had over the chlamydia business i told you thats what im seeing harding to decide insisted reid and i think these aftercourt discussions are useful id welcome the input continuing i bet you would thought the unimpressed jordan he said youre going to need more than discussions like this if your enquiry people dont move their asses more than theyve done so far the planning conference with them is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon theyre making promising noises ill bring dan up to speed before we start next week and ill bring myself up to speed on trojan horseback thought jordan but not here in raleigh he decided recognizing the opportunity again to get back to new york which he already knew his lawyer intended to do on the first available flight the following day dinner was jordans first reflective opportunity on the outcome of the day and he accepted without admitting it to his lawyer that hed been too optimistic of pullingers dismissal but as objective as he always was jordan at once recognized that there was a potentially protective benefit from him being officially detained in america instead of remaining there of his own volition which hed already decided to do if theyd won the day this way there could be no suspicion of him in any way being responsible or involved in the intended retribution against alfred appleton remote though any such suspicion might be so carefully and so far undetected had jordan evolved his unfolding attack but he would be restricted in expanding that attack if he had constantly to attend the raleigh court this fact created an uncertainty a hindrance in the mind of a man who didnt like initiating anything about which there was the slightest doubt or difficulty jordan was glad he wasnt able to get a seat on the same flight as beckwith able to travel alone back to new york so accustomed to working and being always alone responsible only for and to himself that objective again jordan acknowledged that the constant presence of beckwith and reid of so many other people had caused something like claustrophobia in him in raleigh it might not have been so bad he supposed if things had been different with alyce if hed been able to see her be with her sometime during the adjournment fragile though she was she had been magnificent on the witness stand doing everything that she could to prove he wasnt guilty or responsible for her marriage collapse under ridiculous dark ages laws enacted by puritans who believed in witches and burned them at the stake he wanted needed to thank her thank her for enduring the humiliation of actually admitting that it was she who had come on to him before hed hit upon her which hed intended to do the night theyd got back from the prison island visit anyway was beckwith right that what alyce had gone through the previous day was a soft prelude to what she was going to be subjected to by bartle the following week he didnt want to be excused the court when alyce was on the stand hed be there every day supporting her if he could letting her know if he could that he was there for her as he would be counting counting every humiliation every shitty trick or device that bartle and appleton imposed upon her and by every notch in that count hed increase the humiliation and shit hed already started to dump on alfred jerome appleton not just an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth hed figuratively dismember the man organ by organ limb by limb until all that was left for people to laugh at would be a humpbacked flushfaced head on a spike hed advised the carlyle the previous night of his return to manhattan and his retained suite was predictably immaculate his intrusion detectors in the suit closet and dressingroom drawers undisturbed he held back from unstabling his trojan horses at once deciding that there was so much he had to cover that he needed to create a reminder list to avoid him overlooking anything it took him an hour to compose and he was surprised at its length when he finished he assumed that bartle and wolfson would have returned as he and beckwith had maybe appleton and leanne too but there would have been little opportunity for the lawyers to have updated their computer case files working his way patiently through his reminders jordan decided that with the exception of ddk investigations reids enquiry agency within whose computers he had so far not embedded a seeall spyhole hed probably be premature accessing any of his already burgled sites until the following day jordan was on the point of quitting the hotel for west nd street and whatever mail might be waiting there for him in appletons name when his telephone rang i wondered if youd be back here said alyce youre in manhattan i couldnt stand being in raleigh any longer and there were television and cameramen all around the estate how are you its just the court once im out of it not in the same room with him im ok what are you doing just here in the apartment you just here in the suite theres still time for a late lunch west nd street could wait that would be nice do you know enricos on th and rd i can find it she was there looking through her heavyrimmed glasses at the menu while she waited when jordan entered the black sweater showed off her blondeness and shed covered the courtroom pallor with more makeup than she normally wore and jordan thought the lipstick was too bright almost as bright as leanne jefferies has been in court she was drinking mineral water she seemed to sense his presence before he reached the discreet side booth shadowed even more than the already deeply shadowed restaurant and looked up smiling hi jordan lowered himself opposite her and said hi back she hadnt completely managed to hide the dark rings beneath her eyes i know i look a mess she said as if reading his thoughts you dont look a mess and you know it i feel a mess youve no reason to feel a mess either she smiled again shaking her head i dont believe you but thanks anyway the hotel in raleigh told me youd gone away until sunday so i guessed youd come back here jordan said im glad you got me i want to thank you for everything you said in court it was the truth thats what youre supposed to do isnt it tell the truth why didnt you what about having once been married jordan shook his head all part of the venture capitalist nonsense too busy for a normal life how did it go wrong for you rebecca found another guy she liked better she had but not until hed tried to drown himself at the bottom of a bottle alyce humped her shoulders dismissively jordan ordered a gin martini from an enquiring waiter it still cant have been easy for you standing there in front of your husband saying what you did im sorry about the ring turned out to be a pretty bad joke didnt it it was nice at the time everything was nice at the time jordan hesitated curious at the remark i thought so too i really didnt notice that you went on wearing it i know you didnt why did you i wanted to i wouldnt have done it though if id known everything we did everywhere we went was being watched as it was alfreds a bastard a onehundredandtenpercent bastard but we fucked him with the chlamydia lie him and leanne jordan suddenly remembered that reid hadnt made his promised application to the judge for the medical records if any still existed of the dead sharon borowski he supposed that it wasnt so important now i hope we can catch him out in all the others what others demanded jordan alertly i wish i could guess therell be a lot more believe me jordan did and wondered if hed get any leads from the following days phishing trips through the computers weve agreed to have daily aftercourt conferences dan bob and me theres a lot of us on your side im glad you arealyce said smiling at him across the table from her study of the menu before hed arrived alyce immediately asked for spaghetti with clams when their waiter returned jordan who hadnt bothered with the menu said hed have the same as well as a bottle of chianti eager to get rid of the man what happened to the ring he asked i took it off on the plane left it there when i got off wed agreed it was over remember jordan hesitated didnt you want it to be alyce shrugged awkwardly it was best that it was except that it wasnt over was it isnt insisted jordan correcting her tense alyce shook her head positively lets not walk this route any further youre still a defendant possibly going to lose a lot of money after showing up their medical reports as we did dan doesnt think its going to be anything like as bad as it might have been he was shortening the mans name he realized i dont see the connection but that isnt what i want to talk to you about i i mean the family will pay back whatevers awarded against you as well as your costs whats happened to you is my fault nothing to do with you the offer silenced jordan for several moments his reactions colliding between anger and gratitude and settling somewhere in between i dont want that thank you but no it could be a lot of money i know i can afford it how much he wished he could tell her that it would be her husband who paid and in a lot more ways than just money youre offended she accused i told you no and mean it they were both glad of the arrival of their food the wine was better than jordan had expected but alyce limited herself to half a glass seizing the abstinence as a weak excuse to break the embarrassment that had come between them jordan said arent you supposed to drink with whatever medication the doctors given you alyce didnt reply at once it was just a tranquillizer yesterday and its not regular medication youre going to be under a lot of stress a lot of pressure next week i know have you talked to the doctor about it he says there are things but i dont want to slow myself down certainly not when im giving evidence i dont want to give the bastard the slightest advantage surely started jordan his mind on the previous days aftercourt discussion ive forgotten his name walter she provided walter harding is there a guarantee that walter will be able to be in court every day persisted jordan not trusting reid to be as thorough as he should be bob says hes going to try to get me excused some of the time jordan decided against referring to the conversation with the two lawyers instead he said what if pullinger refuses maybe then ill have to take something dan seems to want me there most of the time alyce gave a half smile thatll be something having you there when are you going back down to raleigh sunday i guess its not something i particularly want to think about we could spend some time together here at the weekend maybe alyce said doubtfully why dont i call we could drive up into the catskills i dont want to pick up where we left off in france harvey not she stopped i just dont ok ill call insisted jordan jordan went several times through virtually every word of their conversation eagerly analyzing every inference and meaning sure of his final conclusion the most important of which was that alyce hadnt wanted their affair to end in france which hed been too stupid then not to realize but now he did realize it and decided it wasnt too late for him to recover shed clearly reconciled herself to it being over her only consideration now the impending turmoil of the coming weeks but thats all it would be just weeks days and weeks when hed be with her doing everything he could to help and support and protect her and when it was all over what about when it was all over he demanded halting the fantasy all it could ever be a fantasy how could it be anything else doing what he did existing every day of his life as he did darling theres something ive got to tell you im not a professional gambler any more than i was an investment financier im a crook i steal peoples identities rob them never stripping them clean just as much as i think they can afford to lose apart from your exhusband who by the way is paying for everything its going to cost me ive already got close to of his money but we can have a wonderful life together if you can overlook where the money comes from impossible jordan told himself he lied to everyone else but never to himself which was what he was doing trying to do now it was time he woke up from the daydream remembered who he was and what he did and accept france for what it had been a nostalgically recalled but passing thankyouandgoodbye affair except that he didnt want it to pass not now for the first time since rebecca unthinkingly unintentionally he had developed a feeling an emotion hed never imagined himself capable of again still impossible but not totally dismissable not quite yet there were still the next few weeks a period during which he had no alternative but to stay where he was with alyce as much and as closely as possible looking after her the outstanding loan invitation was waiting for him at west nd street along with acceptances with the money already deposited in his account for each of his four earlier applications there was still time for jordan to complete it and personally deliver it before moving along wall street to draw upon those already agreed swopping the amounts between the various safedeposit boxes to keep the value in each below the legal reporting levels back at the hotel he picked his way meticulously through the trading accounts and internal email stations of appleton and drake the first task always to pick up the slightest indication of suspicion or discovery before making further transfers to the banks he had so recently visited again he travelled further than the already plundered currency trades moving that late afternoon through the companys metal division drawing predominantly from already agreed copper and aluminium futures jordan was at his laptop showered and with roomserviced coffee beside him before eight the following day trawling through his illegal computer emplacements roughly in his order of establishing them he saw that beckwith had written himself an aide memoir to bring to the attention of the jury before whom the full divorce would now be heard what he labelled a determinedly attempted deception over the initially incomplete chlamydia findings on the systems of both boston venerealogists in email exchanges and in an already partially written defence to the massachusetts medical licensing authority jordan found written confirmation that the inadequate reports had been prepared under pressure from appleton as well as david bartle there was also a series of emails between appleton and bartle in which the lawyer complained of having to defend mark chapman free of charge before any disciplinary body and of the difficulty he might have getting chapman back into court for the full divorce hearing one note contained the phrase your stupid interference that could get the whole lot of us in serious shit which puts a lot of strain upon our friendship jordan discovered and saw them as a potential gold mine some incomplete but hostile emails between bartle and wolfson from which the most obvious conjecture was of a falling out between appleton and leanne jefferies in one message wolfson wrote of the chlamydia dispute seriously endangering the agreement our two clients have reached and led me to question my own professional position as perhaps you should question yours that had caused bartle to write back that i think any further consideration of this particular aspect should be very strictly restricted to onetoone unrecorded discussions between the two of us it was midmorning before jordan returned to the communications between his own lawyer and reid which were intriguing but again frustratingly incomplete reid wrote of his enquiry agents investigation being much better late than never and of it being couriered to beckwith whod replied obviously after reading whatever had been uncovered that reid might encounter difficulty introducing it into the forthcoming hearing on grounds of applicable admissibility unless you can manage it during crossexamination encouraged by the notes between the two lawyers jordan broke off from accessing his already established sites to get into his newly established trojan horses in the computer system of reids investigators he was frustrated once more by what had passed between the two of them there were apologies for delays and appreciation of reids patience but it was obvious that the findings had been provided on hard paper copy not transmitted over an internet link knowing that the master copy had to be somewhere on a hard disk jordan spent almost two hours as he had earlier trying to locate the other obviously couriered documents saved on other hard disks but failed to find it without the necessary inhouse dedicated file name jordan failed too to find a possible link when he went back a third time into reids system but did locate further interchanges within the previous hour with his own lawyer about alyce the planned morning meeting with walter harding had been delayed reported reid the hospital administrator diagnosed alyces problem to be psychological stress compounded by having contracted the venereal infection from the man she was now divorcing although the condition had been completely cured her gynaecologist had found considerable fallopian tube scarring which made it unlikely that she would ever be able to carry a child full term harding had undertaken to attend the court for the majority of the hearing certainly during the times that alyce was on the witness stand both when she gave evidence or faced crossexamination alyces gynaecologist was prepared to appear to give evidence about the fallopian scarring and harding to support any application for her to be excused court attendance he could also recommend a psychiatrist if the court demanded corroborative evidence about stress although he knew alyce to be reluctant to call such an expert witness because she doesnt want to sound mentally unbalanced which she isnt as she was reluctant to be prescribed tranquillizers throughout the duration of the case beckwith had responded recommending that reid do the best he could to get women on the jury during its selection process and to do everything you can to bring out the fact that because of what appleton did to her alyce cant ever have kids jordan worked through lunch not finishing his final computer invasion until gone five a useful phishing trip he decided particularly discovering the disarray among the opposition but there was far too much at the moment that was incomplete and needed expanding hed done well ingratiating himself with both beckwith and reid it was essential he kept it up made the sort of practical suggestions that his hacking had already produced to ensure he was always included in the aftercourt conferences there should be enough from what hed come up with today there was no reply when he telephoned alyces apartment and he held back from leaving a message that would identify his voice if anyone other than alyce accessed the machine there was still no answer when he called again an hour later nor at eight the following morning on that call he said its me call me back and waited in his suite until noon it was just after when his phone rang his smiled expectation seeping away when beckwith said you all set for tomorrows flight all set confirmed jordan hows your weekend been not as good as id hoped it would be twentysix the first day of the full divorce hearing was largely technical dominated by the painstaking jury selection which to the judges quick and obvious irritation became protracted by reids determination to follow beckwiths advice to pack the eventual adjudicating panel with as many female members as possible the manoeuvre succeeded in a jury of seven women and five men achieved largely by reids persistence in objecting to anyone who admitted prior and therefore possible biased awareness of either the social or historical standing of the bellamy or appleton dynasties for his part pullinger opened his court cleared of that jury and any of its impending participants to rule to the briefly admitted media that the hearing was to be conducted strictly in camera as allowed by every free speech caveat available to him under the first amendment of the constitution of the united states of america including as well as written words any current or past television or newspaper images it was during their exclusion that jordan had the first although limited opportunity to talk to alyce whod already been in the court and scarcely acknowledged him when hed arrived that morning for pullingers publicitybanning statement both sides were separated in different anterooms dr harding who had accompanied alyce for the opening day was also excluded but instead of joining them in the anteroom he hurried off to telephone his hospital beckwith and reid huddled together at the larger of the two available tables discussing various court documents set out upon it alyce went to a window her back to the room you ok jordan asked coming up behind her she half turned smiling wanly thats not the most intelligent question youve ever asked is it i called over the weekend like i told you i would said jordan he thought the lipstick was still too heavy i know i was there why didnt you pick up the phone we talked everything out in enricos im not sure that we did i wanted to talk about the money that was all it went on beyond that i believe i misunderstood a lot of things in france i dont think i do now stop please stop whats happening now going to happen now is all i can handle its going to end youre going to win be rid of him and well be back where we were we werent ever anywhere i told you i misunderstood lets talk about it again when this is all over theres nothing to talk about i got you entrapped and i hate myself for getting you caught up in it and i want you to change your mind and take the money however much it might be stop talking about the damned money im not interested in that im talking about us you two ok over there called beckwith just chatting jordan called back not realizing that hed raised his voice im not said alyce lowering hers as well all i want to think about get through is this case i cant think wont think about anything else jordan saw she was shaking hands clenched tightly by her sides hey lets calm down thats what well do get through this then well talk some more but not now nothing more now promise me just promise to be here doing what youve been doing the shaking had worsened and jordan reached out towards her alyce hesitated and then came into his arms although keeping her own at her sides he said i promise you got a minute harvey beckwith called again from across the room when jordan reached the lawyers leaving alyce at the window reid said what was that all about shes wound up tighter than a spring said jordan no reason why i cant talk to her now that the judge has ruled against my dismissal locking me into the case is there i guess not allowed beckwith but lets leave the physical support to the doctor shall we the huggy stuff wouldnt look good outside this room how did your meetings go after the adjournment jordan asked reid directly anxious for his inclusion to be automatically accepted reid hesitated and it was beckwith who answered bobs people think they might have something about what you picked up on appletons withdrawal from that olympic selection remember and why he seemed to drop out of bostons social life added jordan building on the reminder what was it they havent fully pinned it down not completely but a woman a girl seems to have been part of it alyce had talked of something involving a girl jordan at once recalled what he couldnt remember was when and then he did when theyd first met in new york with neither of them sure whether or not it legally endangered them cautiously he said thats not going to impress pullinger from what ive seen so far that sort of observation is not why youre being included in these conversations to provide dismissed reid those words of reids echoed in jordans ear like the clearest of warning bells too softly for her to hear from where she stood at the window he said ask alyce i already have she says she doesnt know what it could mean ask her again insisted jordan the ponytailed beckwith let out an exaggerated sigh we going to have to beat this out of you harvey it had to remain vague jordan decided alyce told me something that sounds familiar about appleton and a girl before she and appleton got together jordan was conscious of his lawyer looking pointedly at him as reid walked across to the window at which alyce stood beckwith said you got something more to tell me just the two of us no i dont want to be caught out again like i was with that fucking ring i explained that you agreed it wasnt important i accepted how it might have happened i wont accept getting caught with my pants down a second time you and alyce got an agenda i dont know about no denied jordan again he was walking backwards into a culdesac he decided where did alyce talk about this in france or here here when before the dismissal application a meeting you also forgot to tell me about after id told you bob had told you as well to stay away from each other its in the past over said jordan inadequately now it could help you want to do me a favour harvey i want you to stop thinking behaving like a gambler and more like a defendant in a court case that could still cost you a whole bunch of money youve contributed a lot and i recognize that appreciate that as bob does dont risk losing everything weve so far won by trying too hard he had to capitulate jordan accepted reluctantly and was relieved too that reid was walking back across the anteroom towards them jordan said to his lawyer ill tell you every time i piss too and wished he hadnt the moment the words were out make sure you do it in the pan and not all over your feet scored beckwith easily increasing jordans regret she doesnt know much more announced reid getting to them how much more demanded jordan alyce thinks the girl belonged to the same yacht club as appleton in boston and that she lived in lexington its a suburb of boston with a lot of history said reid continuing on i can get that enquiry underway before the court resumes more than alyce had volunteered to him thought jordan but then he hadnt pressed her very hard on it should be a good enough lead he remarked to beckwith he didnt add that hed started to discover the story of other peoples lives from much less jordan who was walking behind was conscious of alyce looking anxiously around for her doctor as rejoined by reid they filed back into court jordan couldnt see harding either and before they passed through the gated rail he came as close as he conveniently could and said hell still be on the phone dont worry she gave no indication of having heard him the appleton group followed into the court directly afterwards and virtually as they sat pullinger began addressing the recalled jury as was in his power the judge said the court was to be closed to reporters and photographs either old or new forbidden from publication until they had reached their verdict for that reason they were prohibited from discussing with anyone outside the court anything they heard in evidence including members of their families or friends if they were approached by strangers seeking information they were to obtain as best they could a telephone number for instance the identity of that stranger and report it at once to a court official their sworn and therefore legally required function having heard his concluding directions was to decide which of the petitioning parties was primarily responsible for the breakdown of the marriage their second function according to a law which north carolina remained one of the few states within the union still to observe was to decide the financial culpability of the two corespondents separately cited by each of the petitioning parties here again insisted pullinger the jury was to be guided by his very specific concluding guidance before retiring to reach their verdicts if there was anything whatsoever that they did not understand or by which they were confused they were immediately to contact a court official for those doubts and uncertainties to be resolved turning to appletons attorney the judge said at last mr bartle jordan was reminded within minutes of bartle opening of his own lawyers remark that bartle had a lot of court ground to recover jordans biggest surprise was that there was no attempt to apportion or admit blame to either alyce or appleton marriage was a solemn but often difficult undertaking intoned bartle its failure always regrettable and too often acrimonious they would hear of such acrimony they would hear of adultery to which the judge had already referred from the care of its selection bartle acknowledged each member of the jury to be men or women of the world and as such on behalf of his client he accepted that theirs after his honours guidance would be a properly considered and well founded verdict clever opening insisted beckwith unasked bending sideways to jordan not talking down to them but to them as equals not to be frightened of a court or what theyve got to do in it coming sideways to meet the lawyer jordan was briefly aware of walter harding resuming his seat just behind the separating rail and of alyces brief snatched look of relief returning to what was happening in front of him jordon decided alfred appleton appeared even more overpoweringly large when he took the stand trying but failing to refuse his earlier thought of the incongruity of such a gross man being in bed making love to someone as fragile as alyce there was a studied politeness though in the way appleton responded even voiced to his attorneys lead talking not to bartle but always between the jury and the judge he was proud declared appleton to be a descendent of one of americas oldest and most respected families and had been even prouder when by his marriage to alyce there had been created the link to another similarly respected countryfounding family he had never nor ever would take lightly the privileges and responsibilities of his birth he worked worked hard for his living hoping in a small way to give back something of the benefits that hed inherited from his forefathers building and development of the great country that was the united states of america hed hoped his marriage to alyce bellamy would be a contribution towards that ambition so hard had he followed the american ethos of working to build up his wall street practise that stupidly and now regretfully hed neglected alyce in the early years of their marriage but hed hoped to have realized that neglect in time trying to balance the demands of business with the responsibilities of his marriage his fervent hope had been that they could start a family to seal the joining together of their dynasties with children but they did not materialize knowing that his wife preferred a country to a city life hed suggested she live in a family house on long island from which hed commuted every day of the week to manhattan commodity dealers worked to a twentyfourhour clock meaning that he needed to be in the city around six in the morning and felt rarely able to leave before seven at night and after a few months he was warned by his doctor that he was risking a nervous breakdown he changed his routine splitting his week evenly between their two homes his wife became unresponsive to him and he in turn became convinced that she was having an affair stupidly rejected by a wife he loved lonely in manhattan he became involved in two quickly terminated affairs one of which to his great and abiding regret had resulted in leanne jefferies appearing with him in court as a defendant in a damages claim brought against her by his wife he believed his conviction that his wife was having an affair was confirmed when he discovered he was suffering a venereal disease despite which after treatment he made a determined effort to save his marriage by attempting a reconciliation with his wife after she demanded a divorce shortly afterwards his wife announced that she was suffering a venereal infection and blamed him for giving it to her which he categorically denied then and still did now believing it was she who had given it to him for him in turn unwittingly to give it to leanne jefferies despite the difficulties they had experienced the venereal infection being the greatest he still loved his wife and was willing once more to try yet another reconciliation he had made that clear to her but she had said she wanted to go away to france to consider it but from france where he later learned she had formed an association with an englishman harvey jordan she had instructed her attorney to initiate the threatened divorce that had brought them to court that day beckwith began scribbling a series of notes to alyces attorney as appletons evidenceinchief drew to its close with reid hunched in what appeared to be virtually permanent conversation with a headshaking redfaced alyce how would you describe your being here in court today confronted with the end of a marriage in which you held so much hope and expectation asked bartle finally a tragedy i shall regret for the rest of my life replied appleton reid appeared in no hurry to get to his feet to begin his crossexamination and even when he stood he fumbled without apparent success through his disordered papers and then he needed to use an asthma inhaler before he could speak finally he said i apologize your honour and to you mr appleton do you need a short recess asked the judge jordan concentrating upon appleton caught the briefest exchange of satisfied looks between the man and his lawyer no your honour but thank you for your consideration said the attorney no indication of difficulty in his voice but i would seek your understanding in an application even before beginning my examination to recall this witness at a future time jordan was aware of appletons face tightening bartles too do you wish to approach the bench invited pullinger no your honour the jury has heard of the plaintiffs admission of two adulterous relationships but been introduced to only one that with ms leanne jefferies a defendant in the secondary action of criminal conversation your honour interrupted bartle coming to his feet perhaps it was remiss of me not to have brought to the jurys attention the death of the second woman to whom my colleague is referring and if you find it to be so i apologize but he turned to include the jury the person concerned ms sharon borowski was the victim of a fatal automobile accident as such she cannot feature in any way in this hearing this surprise intercession therefore has no purpose or part in these proceedings reid took his inhaler from his pocket considered its use but then replaced it your honour in the required exchange of material before the commencement of this case he moved his hand through the papers on the table before him coming up with a single sheet numbered thirtyfive in your bundle your honour i advised the other side that i required the medical records of ms borowski to which i replied that none were available the unfortunate woman being dead came in the opposing lawyer again indeed mr bartle did agreed reid its numbered thirtysix in your bundle your honour two other people died in the accident involving ms borowski a mother and her son the fatality is the subject of a civil action against ms borowskis estate by the husband of the other woman who died from enquiries i have made after mr bartles dismissal of my request i believe there was a toxicology analysis carried out upon ms borowski that would have included blood samples i have applied to the coroner for a copy of that analysis relevant as certain medical matters would appear to be in this case and to which the plaintiff mr appleton has already given some evidence turning very slightly towards the jury reid went on and i would stress some evidence to the matter of transmitted infection it is for that reason in the hopeful expectation of a reply from the coroner during the course of this hearing that i am making my recall application i find no problem with this said pullinger mr bartle i know of no precedent for such a course to be admissible argued bartle the dead cannot provide evidence from the grave it would not be ms borowski providing evidence from the grave disputed pullinger it would be a coroner or medical examiner both of whom could be called to give evidence before this court on oath of their findings he paused a course a provision of evidence that mr reid opened to you by his original request i am at your honours discretion and disposal capitulated bartle with no alternative which is that i shall allow mr reids application as i now invite mr reids initial examination beside him jordan saw that beckwith had created a virtual army of exclamation marks upon his legal pad aware of jordans attention his lawyer scribbled absolutely brilliant and immediately blacked out the words to make them unreadable jordan saw that alyce was sitting with her head sunk so low upon her chest that she could have been asleep mr appleton began reid still with no catch in his voice you are giving evidence to this court under oath appleton looked for guidance to his lawyer who did not respond the man said yes which requires you to tell the truth there was still no protest from bartle appleton again said yes do you intend telling the truth mr appleton bartle at last rose in protest your honour isnt this risking your court being brought into disrepute a question i am still considering from the hearing that preceded this one replied pullinger at once i will allow it but would recommend restraint mr reid are you telling the truth mr appleton repeated reid yes you admit two affairs one with sharon borowski the other with the defendant leanne jefferies demanded reid yes which was the first that involving ms borowski or ms jefferies ms borowski replied appleton appleton was trying to protect himself with clipped oneword answers whenever possible jordan recognized when did the affair with ms borowski begin im not sure of a precise date said appleton you can surely remember the month i think it was march march last year yes which part of march the beginning or the end i said im not sure more towards the end than the beginning reid again made the pretence of consulting his disordered papers ms jefferies is a commodity trader like yourself appleton was shifting uncomfortably on the stand gripping and ungripping its bordering rail as if needing physical support yes what was ms borowskis occupation i dont believe she had an occupation you dont believe she had an occupation you had an affair with her surely you knew whether she had a job or not it was a very brief affair how brief a matter of weeks how many weeks four five how did you meet at a party in manhattan i asked you how your honour interjected bartle once more what possible relevance has this to do with the current case mr reid invited pullinger if i am allowed to continue with the expectation of receiving the toxicology and blood analysis findings upon the deceased ms borowski i hope to show that it is of crucial importance to the outcome of this matter particularly the transmission of disease insisted reid then it will continue decided pullinger i asked you how you met ms borowski repeated reid i told you at a party that was where you met her how i was introduced to her by a mutual friend towards the end of march last year yes replied appleton too quickly was that when your affair began that night appleton regripped the edge of the witness stand it might have been might have been was it or wasnt it mr appleton i think it was you think it was echoed reid you did know ms borowski before you were formally introduced to her at the end of march last year didnt you i didnt know her insisted appleton but youd seen her before been to parties where she was i may have done may have done echoed reid again going unerringly into his tumbled papers to bring out a neatly prepared individually separated batch of papers beckoning the usher to give him the majority to distribute but personally delivering their packages to beckwith bartle and wolfson i would ask that these be placed before the jury and yourself your honour these are copies of newspaper cuttings objected bartle these cant be admissible whats the purpose of this introduction mr reid demanded the judge stopping the usher before he reached the jury box they feature photographs of ms borowski in the diaries and social columns of certain new york newspapers some with caption references to her which might give some indication of the occupation of which mr appleton appears unsure said reid i object to their introduction insisted bartle this court was given no indication or warning of their being presented weve already touched upon your dismissal of mr reids enquiries concerning this lady reminded pullinger i will not recess the court but read them here at the bench attorneys will read them too but not yet the clients they represent or the jury there were shuffles throughout the court mostly from the jury alyce remained head bent behind her dr harding was leaning solicitously forward the three lawyers were still reading when pullinger finished he said mr beckwith i have no objection to their introduction replied jordans attorney mr wolfson i have no objection said the man i will allow them mr bartle but warn you mr reid to be extremely careful in whatever it is you have to say ruled the judge the usher will deliver the copies to the jury and to the plantiff from the photographs ms borowski was obviously an extremely attractive girl mr appleton yes agreed appleton the copies fluttered slightly from the tremor in the mans hand in the copy number one in the new york daily news ms borowskis age is given as twentythree was that how old she was i did not know her age or her occupation reminded reid if she was twentythree that would make her younger than you by almost twenty years your honour protested bartle quite so agreed the judge careful mr reid my apologies your honour said reid with no obvious apology in his voice the daily news suggests an occupation for ms borowski does it not on the marked line it describes her as a party girl doesnt it yes and there is something similar in the new york observer isnt there on the marked line of the cutting numbered two she is described as a regular party person isnt she yes what do you take party girl and regular party person to mean mr appleton i dont know i dont think it means anything that is you in the background of the cutting from the new york observer isnt it mr appleton yes the date of that cutting is february eighth last year isnt it yes so you were already aware of ms borowski before you formally met in march yes and that affair with party girl sharon borowski began the first time you met her in late march presumably at yet another party yes would you agree with me that an affair is a consensual relationship a sexual attraction between two people i suppose so you suppose so mocked reid you had sex with ms borowski on the first night of your meeting thats right isnt it ive already told you that i did said appleton his temper flaring for the first time did you envisage a longterm relationship i do not intend letting this continue much longer mr reid warned the judge i started appleton but stopped then he said i dont know but you do know remember that you continued to sleep with ms borowski and have sex with her over the course of four or five weeks yes did you pay to sleep with sharon borowsk the regular party girl bartle rose to protest yet again but before he could appleton said loudly no i did not pay her she was not a hooker as bartle sat pullinger said have we laboured this point sufficiently mr reid i have just one further question on this particular matter your honour tell the court sworn under oath as you are to tell the truth mr appleton did you give sharon borowski any gifts jewellery for instance a bangle perhaps i think stumbled appleton i gave her a bracelet thats all let me move on to another part of your evidenceinchief said reid you were working hard to establish your new business despite apparently having time to party your wife was living in the country which she preferred but you were trying for a baby were you not yes but without success yes were you saddened disappointed that your wife did not conceive yes your wife suggested adoption did she not yes but you argued against that why i wanted our child to be biologically ours to carry the bloodline of our two families it was important your wife also underwent medical examinations and tests to discover if there were some medical or physical reason why she was incapable of bearing children did she not appleton had precariously lodged the newspaper cuttings on the corner of the witness stand and in reaching out yet again to grip its edge he knocked them off some fell inside others outside of the box im sorry he said stooping to recover those inside as the usher collected those beyond having retrieved what he could appleton stood uncertainly with them in his hand until the usher reached out to take them mr appleton urged reid yes agreed appleton rigidly maintaining his minimal script but you refused to undergo any medical examination didnt you yes why demanded reid matchingly short there is no biological or physical impediment in my becoming a father insisted appleton reid strained the maximum silence from the remark before saying without undergoing any medical examination you know there is no biological or physical impediment to you becoming a father bartle was sitting with his head bowed although not as deeply as alyce and appleton stood flushed on the witness stand washed away by a tide he couldnt fight against eventually he said that is what i believe believe because of some internal conviction pounced reid something of which this court is unaware or because you have already been the father of a child your honour exploded bartle coming finally to his feet before pullinger could respond reid said i am finished for the moment your honour what in the name of fuck was that demanded jordan as they settled in reids office there were glasses and a bottle of jack daniels on the desk once more alyce had insisted she couldnt withstand a review ill tell you what that was offered beckwith you remember me telling you that courts were theatres in which people performed youve just witnessed a performance deserving more oscars than there are academy award categories you were brilliant bob absolutely fucking brilliant and i never believed the man capable of opposing a speeding ticket thought jordan still needing time to properly assimilate it all we never discussed any of this i never knew you had so much to throw at him i dont remember our agreeing to talk about to discuss everything said the resistant reid pointedly looking between the two of them beckwith sniggered and said you play a lot of poker harvey as a professional gambler some allowed jordan further confused then you know about bluff jordan looked from one lawyer to the other will someone either of you tell me what the hell youre talking about all bob had were the newspaper cuttings explained beckwith we dont expect there to be any surviving toxicology evidence from sharon borowski which was why bob delayed until the last minute asking the coroner for it because we didnt want to be told there isnt any it gives bob the chance to recall appleton with whatever might arise during the hearing appleton and bartle will be shitting rocks that we know more have something which was what i meant by bobs academy award performance what about appleton already having fathered a child persisted jordan who knows whether he has or he hasnt shrugged reid hes admitted to not undergoing a fertility test what more did i need but you knew about a bracelet persisted jordan no i didnt denied reid i just tossed it into the pond to see if i could make ripples and i did you mean there wasnt any evidence for any of the inferences and innuendoes you spread around in there today demanded jordan every question was justified from the evidence available before the court insisted reid we cant be caught out like the other side was caught out with chlamydia and the opposition dont know where were coming from next jordan wasnt sure where he was coming from next either hed been too confident of being dismissed from the case and had even more grossly misconceived how fully hed thought he was being included by the two lawyers he wasnt the driving force any longer he accepted and then he further accepted that perhaps he never had been twentyseven b ody language said jordan his approach and hopeful recovery mentally rehearsed from the illtempered email exchanges hed read between bartle and wolfson and he did have to restore himself in the lawyers judgement jordan decided recover a lot and not allow his overconfidence to imply the overconfidence verging on conceit that he could do beckwith and reids job better than they could beckwith frowned and looked up from his jack daniels with which theyd both continued at the hotel after the initial celebration in reids office you want to help me with that you asked me earlier if i played poker there are two essentials to win at the game you need to be able to memorize every discard to narrow down what your opponent might be holding and read his body language and bluff which bob did so well today added the lawyer ive been watching leanne jefferies said jordan doggedly all day today shes actually sat as if shes trying to distance herself from appleton are you surprised exclaimed beckwith if the jury finds against her shes going to go down for big bucks shes got every reason to hate the guy certainly to despise him which i think is a new hate urged jordan her lawyers from the same firm as appletons and she went along with using a boston venerealogist both of which has got to be under pressure from appleton my impression is that she didnt realize the shit hed dropped her into until she ended up in court she doesnt know yet which way pullingers going to go with what they tried with the venerealogists and today she heard my guess is for the first time that before her appleton was screwing a hooker whose infection she caught beckwith whose crossexamination of appleton was to begin the following day appeared to consider the argument could be youre right he smiled maybe an idea to widen the rift a little before we get her on to the stand better to widen it a lot trust me harvey sighed beckwith he was trying too hard again jordan accepted quickly he said theres something i dont understand theres a lot i still dont understand remarked beckwith gesturing for refills jordan hoped the lawyer wasnt getting drunk on the basis of that days success why did appleton volunteer his affairs with both women actually providing alyce with the grounds for divorce and for the claim against leanne im there ahead of you insisted beckwith vaguely mocking its on my reminder list for tomorrow but thanks why didnt bob go for it today beckwith sighed again because its not the strategy were following which he didnt know about acknowledged jordan wondering if it had been decided when hed been at the anteroom window with alyce which is reexamination disclosed beckwith bob achieved it today on a limited point if something comes out tomorrow he can stretch or try to stretch the remit as i can if appleton slips between his replies to me and the replies hes already given to bob and we can do it all over again with leanne when we get her on the stand what about alyce demanded jordan at once wont she be exposed to a double act from bartle and wolfson if they work out our game plan agreed beckwith as you will were you going to warn me if i hadnt asked of course jordan didnt believe the other man is bob going to warn alyce it would make good sense to do so i dont like how shaky she is neither did he thought jordan bob should try to get her excused from the court too soon insisted beckwith pullinger will have seen a lot of women break up in pieces far worse than alyce has done so far divorce is never a walk in the park he had all his illegal sites still to access jordan remembered and he hadnt yet helped himself to that days tranche of appleton and drakes money that thought prompted another he said are things going more slowly than you anticipated largely because of what the other side tried to pull said beckwith with pullingers adjournment built in an entire week has been added so are we still looking at a month from now the lawyer shrugged how the hell do i know when i gave you that estimate i didnt imagine us encountering anything of what we have so far you got a problem yes thought jordan on his current rate of the appleton embezzlement he could possibly amass a further half a million by the end of a month but that was to offset any damages that might be awarded against him but he didnt imagine he could continue for a month without some financial controller or individual trader realizing appleton and drake was being milked like a milch cow which wasnt the most pressing problem even after it was suspected or proven by a snap audit it would still take at least another month maybe even two for an official criminal enquiry to begin by which time he would have distanced himself untraceably from all the illegally established appleton bank holdings leaving only their existence as evidence of appletons theft and money diversion from his own company but jordan intended far more and an inhouse investigation could very easily and badly impede his next move to avoid his plans being disrupted he had to siphon off although to different destinations larger sums than his usual daily collection but by increasing those amounts he correspondingly increased the danger of earlier discovery another week of simple bank transfers jordan decided after that he had to begin much more aggressively undermining appletons very foundations belatedly responding to beckwiths question jordan said no real problem i undertook to stay until everything was over if we lost the dismissal and i will i just dont want everything to limp on openended which it seems to be doing pullinger wont let anything that he controls limp on openended declared beckwith if he suspects for a moment hes being manipulated as he clearly thinks he was with the venereal disease busisness therell be hell to pay how wondered jordan could he create a situation that would appear to the judge to be precisely that motivated by appleton he didnt at that precise moment have the remotest idea but he was confident hed be able to think of one confident jordan at once qualified not over confident you employed a lot of people to watch your wife in france didnt you demanded beckwith i engaged an enquiry service said appleton but not specifically for france insisted beckwith youd engaged them long before that hadnt you yes conceded the commodity dealer the man had reverted to his singleword answers jordan recognized although appleton appeared more at ease in the witness box than he had the previous day alyce did too despite dr harding not being in court leanne looked strained her face drawn why asked beckwith matching the brevity i told the court yesterday said appleton determined against saying too much not to my recollection refuted the lawyer why did you put your wife under surveillance before she went to france appletons face flushed very slightly i wanted to discover the man with whom she was having an affair the man from whom she contracted the venereal disease that i caught his voice had risen too beckwith was proving as good as reid the previous day thought jordan within minutes hed irritated appleton out of his attempted stonewalling answers which he guessed appleton now realized and by so doing unsettled the man the lawyer stoked the unease by letting appletons reply settle in the minds of the jury before saying what was the outcome of that surveillance here in the united states nothing appleton was forced to admit i didnt quite hear that said beckwith settling into his performance they didnt discover the man they didnt discover the identity of any man with whom your wife was having an affair expanded beckwith how long was your wife under surveillance here in america im not sure appleton tried to avoid of course youre sure insisted beckwith you employed them paid them money for the period during which they tried but failed to find anyone with whom your wife was sleeping how long was your wife watched here in america before she went on vacation to france a month your enquiry agents will be called to give evidence warned beckwith do you want to think again how long a period it was maybe six weeks it ran on over into the time they spent in france it may have been six weeks here are they experienced enquiry agents yes yet over a period of six weeks they failed to discover the lover with whom you were sure your wife was sleeping am sure beckwith let appletons blurted angry answer hang in the air for several moments before asking your investigators failed to find any evidence of a lover here what other evidence other source do you have to make that assertion the infection i caught thats your proof yes how much did six weeks unsuccessful surveillance here in america cost you mr appleton it wasnt broken down in the bills i have so far paid all right then tell the court the amount you have so far paid two hundred and twenty thousand dollars there was a stir among the jury and beckwith waited for it to subside a huge sum of money the majority of which i assume to have been incurred on air fares and expenses in sending your investigators to france yes where they discovered the affair between my client and your wife yes appleton smiled were you relieved appleton moved to speak but stopped i dont understand a reputable investigation agency had failed after six weeks of twentyfourhour surveillance to find that your wife had a lover in this country in france they found my client your suspicions were vindicated werent they it proved she was promiscuous did it of course it did why dont be it did what else could it prove appleton was almost shouting when he finished today was unfolding just like yesterday thought jordan and without the slightest input from him he saw alyce was leaning forward in her seat head slightly to one side her entire concentration upon her husband leanne jefferies attention was also focussed intently at the overpowering commodity trader instead of responding to appletons demand beckwith said to pullinger with your permission your honour i would like to introduce into the court the birth certificate of harvey william jordan the copy of the passport of harvey william jordan and a venerealogists report upon harvey william jordan prepared by an american specialist dr george abrahams to pullingers nodded agreement the court usher collected the itemized material for distribution as reid had done the previous day beckwith personally handed the individual packages along the attorney tables the first document before you numbered one attests the birth of harvey william jordan in paddington london england on june tenth does it not yes agreed appleton will you turn to the final page of the copy of the united kingdom passport numbered two on its attached sticker and read aloud to the court the surname on the first line of the man photographed in it jordan and the given names on the next line i am being lenient here mr beckwith cautioned the judge making his first interruption which i appreciate while asking your honour to accept the importance of this pedantry to my client said beckwith keep it within bounds ordered the blackrobed man the given names mr appleton prompted beckwith harvey william dully responded appleton go now if you will to the front of the document in which are recorded the visas and entry dates into countries outside the european union guided the lawyer what is the last entry stamp that you can find for an entry into the united states of harvey william jordan a copy of whose passport you now hold january thirteenth endorsed for what period of time ninety days from which it is beyond question that harvey william jordan could not have remained in the united states of america beyond april thirteen i suppose so will you now go to the diagnostic page of the medical report prepared by dr george abrahams numbered three that you hold does that conclusion read that harvey william jordan does not nor ever has in the opinion of dr george abrahams suffered from the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia yes sighed appleton you spent the majority of having your wife followed more than three thousand miles to the south of france to find her with the lover your detective team had failed to identify after six full weeks of surveillance here in this country didnt you it proved she was promiscuous it proved she engaged in one brief and immediately terminated affair after contracting a venereal infection from you who admits to at least two extramarital relationships doesnt it i did not infect my wife neither could harvey william jordan could he from the irrefutable evidence you hold there in your hand she did not contract it from me in his shouted anger appleton leaned forward over the rail he had the previous day needed for support who did she catch it from her other lovers insisted appleton wildly other lovers your detectives failed to discover shes very clever knew i was having her watched how did she know because i told her jordan was aware of david bartle shifting noisily at his table to attract appletons attention the only way possible to warn the man of his loss of control jordan saw too that for the first time since she had been in court that alyce was smiling when how did you tell her i dont remember you dont remember when you told a wife with whom you wanted a reconciliation that you were having her watched spelled out beckwith spacing every word to stress his incredulity we were arguing over what seized beckwith appleton shifted too late realizing the trap snapping closed behind him when she accused me of infecting her which you did didnt you no denied appleton loudly again she infected me go on appleton shrugged that was it no it wasnt it was it mr appleton you were arguing about who had infected whom and you told her you were having her watched tell the jury of that occasion she said id given her a complaint and wanted a divorce and i said id got it from her and that i was going to find out who her lover was and that i was going to have her watched and she said she was having me watched jordan saw alyce suddenly come close to reid as beckwith said was going to have her watched not that you already had her under surveillance i dont remember the precise words what was the date of that confrontation i dont remember that either beckwith paused as reid passed him a note smiling up from it can i help you with the date it was april fifth last year wasnt it it might have been you really can do better than this giving testimony on oath cant you mr appleton persisted beckwith sorting through papers and material in front of him he came up a diary in hand april fifth was a saturday you would have been home in long island on a saturday a weekend trying for your much sought reconciliation with your wife wouldnt you it could have been april i dont know the actual date you cant remember the date when you still wanted a reconciliation with your wife no how many days are there in the month of march appleton looked anxiously to his lawyer who shook his head appleton said thirtyone and april thirty yesterday you admitted to the court that during march the precise date you couldnt remember it starting you were in a sexual relationship with sharon borowski appleton nodded the court requires an audible reply said beckwith yes for six weeks yes so at the same time as desperately trying for a reconciliation with your wife you were committing adultery with the party girl sharon borowski id ended the relationship with sharon borowski when we agreed to a reconciliation yesterday you told his honour and the jury that your affair with sharon borowski extended over six weeks that was a mistake i meant we slept together maybe six times all during march beckwith didnt hurry shuffling again through his papers all the time keeping the note that had been passed to him by reid very obviously in his hand beckwith finally stopped at something among the documents sharon borowski was the first of the two women with whom you admit adultery the second is ms leanne jefferies who is a defendant in the criminal conversation claims brought by your wife yes i really do need your help in establishing a time frame as i am sure the court does said beckwith once more consulting the note that had been passed from the adjoining table even giving you the benefit of your corrected recollection that your sexual relationship with sharon borowski began and ended in march weve still got your confrontation with your wife on april fifth at which you each accused the other of transmitting a sexual disease to the other when exactly did you fit in your affair with ms jefferies its wrong shouted appleton something is very definitely wrong commented the lawyer what very exactly again is wrong mr appleton all the dates all the dates are wrong it all didnt happen in as short a period as you are suggesting suggestions to which you have agreed under oath mr appleton i was confused am confused not thinking properly isnt the confusion caused by you lying about the sequence of events and trapping yourself into a time frame that is too tight for you satisfactorily to fit in two separate affairs at the same time as supposedly trying a reconciliation with your wife demanded beckwith no and isnt the only way to make it work to tell the truth that there was no sequence but that you were conducting your affair with sharon borowski and leanne jefferies not separately but simultaneously and at the same time as you claim you were attempting a reconciliation which your wife rejected because she contracted chlamydia from you no and isnt it also the truth that trying to suggest that my client harvey jordan gave your wife chlamydia is blatant nonsense because at the time that you she and leanne jefferies suffered the infection harvey jordan who is not a sufferer of the disease had not even met your wife it proves she is promiscuous and isnt it also blatant nonsense that harvey jordan caused the breakdown of your marriage which by the time he met your wife had already irretrievably broken down no you were honest when you admitted affairs with sharon borrows and leanne jefferies werent you appleton didnt reply genuinely confused on this occasion the court requires an answer insisted beckwith yes appleton finally said why i dont understand what youre asking me why did you tell the truth about those two affairs before you had been accused of them because its the truth i believed i had to beckwith glanced at the paper that had been handed to him and which he still held isnt it that having contracted chlamydia your wife told you at that confrontation on april fifth that she already had you under surveillance that you knew you had been caught conducting your simultaneous affairs and decided to admit to them in the hope that those two admissions would be sufficient and you wouldnt be accused of any others no so before being challenged you told the truth yes the truth with which you are having so much difficulty now your honour said bartle rising at the first available protest it is for the jury and myself to decide the truth or otherwise mr beckwith rebuked pullinger quite so your honour i withdraw the comment with apologies said beckwith i believe i have taken my examination as far as i am able at this stage but i would refer to the submission that mr reid made yesterday to my understanding there has still not been a response from the coroner who conducted the enquiry into ms borowskis death i would therefore officially request your agreement to me resuming my examination of mr appleton in the light of whatever that response may be in principle i agree subject to the arguments upon admissibility that might be made by either mr bartle or mr wolfson upon the contents of the coroners reply i would also ask your honours agreement to my approaching the bench upon the subject that occupied this court before the swearing in of the jury no refused the judge i will instead see all four attorneys in my chambers the court stenographer together with her machine was positioned directly alongside the judge still in his robes and again pullinger kept them standing extending the schoolboystoheadmaster analogy by not speaking for several moments when he eventually did he said my court this court is being reduced to a vaudeville parody against which i have already warned i will neither tolerate nor allow this to continue unchallenged what i will permit is this one final and i mean final application from mr beckwith i will also consider any belated applications from the rest of you here before me which and make no mistake of my seriousness and determination will be the end of the nonsense to which i suspect myself and my court to have been subjected all four of you know my disquiet at what emerged during the closed hearing already in my mind is the possibility of me reporting each of the four of you to your respective bar authorities which is why a verbatim record of this meeting and this warning is being made do any of the four of you have the slightest misunderstanding or doubt about what i am saying led by beckwith each lawyer recited no your honour mr beckwith invited the cadaverous man i believe it is incumbent upon me to recall dr abrahams to provide in open court his expert testimony in the defence of my client it was therefore equally incumbent upon me to advise the court to give mr bartle and mr wolfson the opportunity to recall their expert witnesses who gave evidence before you in closed court your honour this is preposterous after what happened earlier your honour protested bartle at once and without being invited to speak what happened earlier was equally preposterous responded pullinger are you objecting to the application i am most determinedly said bartle mr wolfson no your honour i am not objecting anxious as i am for my clients case to be opened before you mr reid not to the recall of dr abrahams your honour but i also seek to call on behalf of my client both dr walter harding the administrator of the bellamy clinic and her gynaecologist neither of whom are on my original witnesses list which leaves you the odd man out mr bartle the judge pointed out after the misunderstanding during mr beckwiths failed dismissal application your honour made observations concerning drs chapman and lewell which surely makes their recall impossible argued bartle not to recall drs chapman and lewell would surely provide you with grounds for appeal against whatever verdict and judgement is returned by the jury would it not disputed the judge and legally it is not open to you to offer nor for me to accept an assurance at this stage that you will not seek to appeal said pullinger this is manipulation of your court accused bartle looking sideways to beckwith about which i opened this meeting with what i hoped to be sufficient and serious warning said pullinger it is my opinion that without matching expert witnesses for both alfred appleton and leanne jefferies they would be appearing before me at a disadvantage which i will neither countenance nor permit i am suspending the court for the rest of the day although i intend remaining on the premises you mr bartle and you mr wolfson are to approach your respective medical specialists and invite them willingly to return tomorrow if they refuse because of the earlier episode i will subpoena them which i give you permission to warn them of when you speak to them i am obliged your honour said beckwith formally no refused pullinger none of you are obliged all of you continue under warning the last any of you will receive do not try my patience or expect any further allowances of the law none is any longer available to any of you harvey jordan felt disconcerted without having a positive focus for the feeling he was not sure even if disconcerted properly described how he felt it was a combination of things he supposed none greater than the other but each forming part of a whole like a snowball getting bigger and bigger as it rolled down a winter hill after wanting alyce to be part of the afterhearing discussions he was disappointed that today when she had finally attended it hadnt been at all as hed imagined it would be although there had been some benefits chief among them had been the admission from beckwith that only the april fifth date had been written upon the note that reid handed to him but that theatre again hed used the paper itself as a prop to convince appleton it held more incriminating questions jordan was curious as well as pleased at alyces apparent recovery asking more questions and offering more opinions than he had himself in contrast beckwith and reid had seemed to hold back as well volunteering very little too little of what had been discussed and ruled in the judges chambers the more he thought about it the more jordan came to the conclusion that their reticence had resulted from alyces presence for the first time there had been positives though the concensus had been that beckwith had performed as well as reid the previous day and that appleton had emerged a bumbling and obvious liar another surprise a question that they hadnt resolved before the analysis conference ended was wolfsons easy agreement to dr lewell being recalled which prompted one of the few contributions jordan did make trying in the limited way available to him to pass on what hed learned from his internet burglaries by reminding his lawyer of leanne jefferies body language implying a rejection of her former lover alyce had accepted without any visible regret the calling of her doctor and gynaecologist and insisted that she could remember telling appleton during their april fifth confrontation that she already had him under surveillance which in fact hadnt begun until after shed engaged reid as her divorce lawyer when the aftercourt conference ended jordan hesitated on the point of suggesting that he and alyce spend the unexpectedly free afternoon together only pulling back at the awareness that he had more arrangements to make for his planned moved against alfred appleton back in his locked hotel suite jordan patiently surfed the net for hedge funds based throughout the caribbean uncaring that what he intended breached us financial regulations and selected two in grand cayman one in the turks and caicos islands and the other in aruba to each he wrote from his position inside appletons personal computer in appletons name and giving appletons genuine passport details social security identification and asked for opening deposits required to establish a portfolio he did not expect immediate responses imagining a delay possibly as long as a week but within an hour he received an acknowledgement from one of the grand cayman funds stipulating as a minimum and another from aruba setting the figure at he notified each to expect contact from alfred jerome appleton within the coming month beckwith was waiting for him when jordan got to the bar delayed by the hedge fund enquiries and still with some of his sites unchecked the lawyer announced that hed taken the chance of jordan agreeing to their going to a restaurant that reid had recommended about ten miles out of town a change from here would be good accepted jordan abrahams has confirmed his arrival tomorrow said beckwith so have the other two i didnt expect that did you its getting difficult to anticipate anything said beckwith all these delays must be boring the hell out of you i manage to fill in the time said jordan when they got back from the restaurant which theyd enjoyed and decided to use again jordan declined beckwiths offered nightcap anxious to complete his nightly computer check hed been at his screen less than an hour when he came upon the query from a chicago broker and accepted that the hunt to find the appleton and drake intruder had begun twentyeight there was the briefest stomach lurch at his detection if there hadnt it would have meant he had become complacent which jordan had always regarded as the greatest sin possible in his profession but that was all it was brief as quickly acknowledged and just as quickly compartmentalized because there was not the slightest risk of the investigation that would now laboriously unfold ever connecting him to what had already happened or with what was going to continue happening until mr invisible once more he chose to disappear at the splitsecond click of a computer key a gambler which jordan most very definitely was not would have bet upon it taking two months from this moment for appleton and drake to go thoroughly through their back office trades for them to begin to recognize how completely they had been invaded and by how much they had been looted jordan set himself a month to complete what he had started even if by the sort of miracle in which jordan did not believe the investigation within a month traced the intrusion to darwin he was still not in any personal danger the trojan horse in the darwin cutout system was in appletons name and contained all appletons identifying details none of jordans jordan was nevertheless disappointed and irritated at being discovered hed been particularly careful not to siphon money from any wash trades buyandsell futures purchases upon which an immediate profit was likely sometimes within the space of twentyfour hours but those instead intended to be held for a longer period for the price to go up jordans mistake which he at once and fully acknowledged was not sufficiently following the market movement in all the commodities through which hed moved collecting figuratively with his basket in hand hed concentrated upon metals the primary trading activity of appletons company the fivehundred dollars hed skimmed from the order placed by a chicagobased broker named david cohen was for pork belly predictable from the chicago exchange being dominated by meat trades the movement of which unlike metals he hadnt consulted daily and in which there had obviously been a sudden upward price jump to trigger the sell like all objective men jordan accepted it as a lesson to be learned and a mistake not to be repeated from now on he had daily even twice daily to monitor the price shifts of every commodity deal he raided a month then jordan rationalized more than sufficient time in which to achieve everything more maybe that he wanted no reason yet for him to break the american financial regulations by opening in appletons name the intended hedge fund portfolios his only current pressure was to move the visible money from the new york bank accounts into the safedeposit facilities to make available space for fresh infusions from the appleton and drake client list during the four weeks jordan estimated he could accumulate between and to offset any court award and lawyer costs possibly more if his monitoring of the impending investigation disclosed that it was moving more slowly than hed estimated no jordan warned himself at once to go beyond his time limit would be to risk the gamble he had already decided against jordan awoke by six wrongly believing the chicago challenge to be the only leftover surprise of the day there had been insufficient movement over the preceding three days to prompt profit selling in either copper or steel and he decided to restrict himself entirely in both going through previously untouched accounts and distributing a total of between the five new york accounts the transfers completed jordan came across a letter from the chicago broker which was not addressed to appleton but to a junior partner in the firm john popple who had carried out the futures purchase smiling at the confirmation of its tone it was not phrased as a complaint but as an enquiry inferring that the fivehundreddollar disparity was a bookkeeping or accounting mistake which was the manner in which popple replied promising a records check of the back office buy and sell comparisons with the undertaking to get back to cohen within days hed underestimated the time it would take for a proper investigation to get underway jordan decided upon reflection it was far more likely to be three rather than two months but hed stick to his schedule unless that is something came up that he hadnt anticipated how long would it be before appleton learned of the chicago enquiry jordan wondered gazing fixedly at the hunched dourfaced commodity trader as the court assembled certainly not this week maybe not until a full blown criminal enquiry by which time the divorce case could be over and he conceivably back in england evolving another overly delayed new operation or would he be wrong question he corrected himself did he want to go back to london directly after distancing himself both from the divorce and the retribution against alfred appleton all of it had been and would continue to be work unaccustomed work far harder and more demanding than that upon which he was normally engaged and in between which he usually allowed himself a recovering break if not a proper vacation didnt he deserve a period of rest just he and jordan stopped the drift very positively refusing it turning to the other side of the court for the first time that day alyce was in black again her paleness accentuated and she had turned back to the separating bar towards which dr harding in turn was stretched forward in nodded conversation along with a greying bespectacled woman in the same row although not directly alongside sat the three venerealogists because of how she was twisted to look behind her alyce became aware of jordans look and turned to smile briefly at him beckwith and reid were also stretched between their separated tables in huddled discussion and as they rose for the familiar opening ritual of the judges entry beckwith muttered could be another good day reid remained on his feet as the rest of the court settled and to pullingers enquiring look said i wish to inform your honour at this earliest opportunity and prior to the expert medical evidence for which this court was adjourned yesterday that i have received this morning by courier the requested medical examination report on sharon borowski after her fatal automobile accident i have had that report duplicated for distribution with your honours permission before the calling of todays medical experts whose interpretation i believe will be necessary you are not seeking yet another adjournment are you mr reid demanded the judge threateningly subject to any representation from other counsel and of course to your honours guidance i am prepared to ask doctors abrahams chapman and lewell to respond from the witness stand if it would further assist the court there are also present today dr walter harding and mrs appletons gynaecologist dr brenda stirling whose addition to my witnesses list i have already advised instead of addressing the other lawyers individually pullinger looked between the three of them and curtly said well bartle was first on his feet to agree followed by the other two and while the medical examiners report was being circulated beckwith said quietly shit whats the problem jordan whispered back if whatevers in the report on sharon borowski goes against appleton theres room for a mistrial appeal intervention at least on the grounds of insufficient consultation why didnt you object its better as far as you are concerned to go ahead youre the guy i represent remember said beckwith rising as george abrahams was called to the stand because it was the first time the jury were to hear the evidence referring to the chlamydia the beginning of beckwiths examination was a virtual repetition of the previous closed court hearing establishing that jordan was clear of any such infection beckwith got as far as can we now turn before pullingers interruption not yet stopped pullinger to abrahams he said i require you to answer in the briefest manner possible some questions i wish to put to you which have to be introduced into the public record you have already given evidence before me in the absence of a jury upon chlamydia have you not yes confirmed the venerealogist during the course of that evidence you were asked to comment upon the findings of two other expert witnesses drs chapman and lewell yes what were those comments as he had in the closed session the man shifted uncomfortably looking at both other specialists that they were inadequate with what result they were reconsidered and resubmitted what did those resubmissions prove that alfred appleton and leanne jefferies had in the past suffered from chlamydia which the initial reports did not indicate no thank you said pullinger nodding for beckwith to continue i am going to impose upon your expertize with the continuation of my questioning apologized beckwith in advance you have before you the medical findings upon the late sharon borowski with whom alfred appleton has admitted a sexual liaison i seek your correction if it is appropriate in suggesting that the listed injuries in that report a skull fracture compression of the left rib cage burst aorta and spleen is consistent with injuries sustained in a headon collision between two vehicles one of which according to the report before you was driven by the late sharon borowski consistent also with the deceased not wearing any seat restraint agreed the doctor beckwith nodded his thanks to the qualification can we now turn to the other findings particularly the serological discoveries can you explain those to the jury dr abrahams the blood alcohol level is two and a half times beyond the legal driving limit there is also a substantial amphetamine reading so sharon borowski was driving under the influence both of drink and drugs broke in beckwith unquestionably are there any other analyses there is reference to unidentified antibodies which were not judged medically relevant to the particular autopsy what are antibodies dr abrahams a body a substance formed within the blood either synthetically or by the immune system of the body to fight a toxin a disease or an infection yes but which is not specified what is the recognized treatment for chlamydia treatment by one of a number of antibiotics which would result in antibodies in the blood yes could sharon borowski have been suffering from chlamydia i have already testified that the antibodies are not specified by analysis it could have been one of a number of diseases or infections refuted abrahams one of which could have been chlamydia persisted beckwith or not the venerealogist continued to refuse i think you have pursued the point sufficiently mr beckwith said the judge none of the other three lawyers chose to crossexamine abrahams forewarned by the judges previous intercession beckwith did not directly question dr chapman about his first attempted medical submission during the closed session leaving it to pullinger to extract the admission from the specialist that his first medical assessment had needed substantial correction and clarification despite beckwiths pressure when he resumed after the judge pressure matched by reid when he took up the questioning chapman doggedly refused to go beyond his closed court insistence that his initial failure to disclose chlamydia antibodies in appletons blood had solely been because of his strict adherence to the instructions hed received from david bartle chapman even more insistently refused to speculate on the presence of unidentified antibodies in the blood of sharon borowski jordan expected the same monosyllabic repetition from dr jane lewell when she was called to the stand his mind more upon what he was going to do outside the court in the coming month until pullinger yet again broke into beckwiths examination to put the closed court dispute before the jury and into the public record of the case your first submission before me had to be substantially corrected did it not pullinger asked the identical question hed put to chapman yes replied the woman because i had been pressured to omit the presence of antichlamydia igg in the blood of ms leanne jefferies which professionally i should not have done and now deeply regret and for which i now publicly apologize the court resumed after thirty minutes although without the jury at pullingers insistence peter wolfson remained standing beside dr lewell although in the well of the court not directly in front of the bench for the exchange to go unheard to the lawyer the judge said have you fully advised your client of the constitutional protection against selfincrimination i have assured wolfson dryvoiced have you understood everything you have been told by mr wolfson about selfincrimination the judged asked the woman yes replied dr lewell have you fully advised your client of the penalties available to me if perjury is committed pullinger asked the lawyer i have you honour replied wolfson although i would remind your honour that the evidence my client gave under oath during the closed hearing was entirely truthful concerning the chlamydia infection contracted by ms leanne jefferies pullinger looked unwaveringly at the lawyer for several moments before turning to the venerealogist did you fully understand what you were told by mr wolfson about lying under oath in a court i fully understood said the woman then you will return to the witness box and although you are already sworn you will be sworn for a second time to remind you that everything you tell me must be the absolute and complete truth as the jury filed back in jordan leaned sideways towards his lawyer but beckwith raised a forbidding hand as well as shaking his head as he withdrew jordan saw bartle similarly refuse appletons approach the commodity trader wrote hurriedly on his own legal pad pushing it towards his lawyer who gave no reaction to what was written on it dr lewell began the judge i want you to explain the remark you made before i adjourned the court i apologized for not including in the original venereal report upon leanne jefferies the presence of antichlamydia igg in her blood what would the presence of antichlamydia igg have established that she had been treated for a chlamydia infection that she had in fact suffered such a disease yes did you treat her for a chlamydia infection no i did not do you know who did i believe it was her gynaecologist were you aware of the reason for examining leanne jefferies yes i was in the report upon leanne jefferies that you originally submitted but which you did not swear to in court you omitted to record that in leanne jefferies blood you found antichlamydia igg the woman frowned uncertainly thats what i have already told you if you had submitted and sworn that original report what would it have conveyed to the court that she was not suffering chlamydia which medically she no longer was she had been cured if that original report had been accepted could it not have conveyed or been inferred by a jury that leanne jefferies had never suffered from chlamydia dr lewell hesitated yes so the intention was to deceive the court that neither leanne jefferies nor her admitted lover alfred appleton had ever suffered such a disease and that therefore alfred appletons wife must have contracted it from a lover at the time i prepared the report i did not know it was for presentation in a court i only learned that when i received a witness summons why didnt you prepare a fuller more accurate report when you did receive the witness summons the woman looked to her right where appleton was at last in whispered conversation with his lawyer and wolfson was learning back towards the separating rail to talk to chapman i suggested it but was told it wasnt necessary that all that was necessary was to establish that leanne jefferies no longer had it told by whom there was another hesitation as she again looked to the plaintiffs side of the court dr chapman thats not true shouted the other venerealogist standing at the rail sit down ordered pullinger youll get your chance when i recall you to the woman he said at the closed hearing your lawyer mr wolfson admitted giving you the remit to restrict your report now you are telling me it was dr chapman it was dr chapman first then it was reinforced by mr wolfson didnt that strike you as odd it was the first time i had been asked to prepare this sort of report for a court i did not know the procedure i sought guidance from dr chapman whom i knew had experience he told me what to do is what youre telling me true you ordered that i retake the oath said dr lewell which isnt the direct answer to my question it is the truth she insisted i also want to make it clear that if i had been called to testify upon the original report i would have corrected it verbally you were called before me at the closed hearing why didnt you tell me then what you have told me today i was bewildered by what happened at the closed hearing the challenge about the report your telling me you were going to report me to my licensing authority the reports had been corrected and the fact established that leanne jefferies had been infected i just wanted to get away but today you werent in so much hurry to get away i wanted to apologize and i have pullinger did not adjourn for the second time but from the bench lectured mark chapman himself on the american constitutional protection against selfincrimination and of the criminal offence of perjury before having the venerealogist sworn again it was the judge who conducted the examination putting to the man practically the same questions that he had posed to dr lewell chapmans replies were remarkably similar the man insisted that he too had not believed he would be called as a witness but that the purpose of his examination of appleton and the way in which he had prepared the discredited report was solely to attest that at the time of the examination appleton did not have chlamydia not that he had never been a sufferer would you have corrected it in court demanded pullinger it had already been challenged and corrected answer the question you have been asked demanded the judge of course i would have corrected it what advice did you give dr lewell when she asked about preparing a venerealogy report to be submitted to a divorce court that she had to be very specific in her answers to the questions set out by the lawyer representing leanne jefferies did you tell her to omit any reference to there being any antichlamydia igg in leanne jefferies blood indicating that although no longer a sufferer she had in fact once had the infection no denied the man what did you tell her when she asked you that she should stick very specifically to the remit from leanne jefferies lawyer and i want you to be very specific in your answer to this question insisted the judge did you ever tell dr jane lewell to omit her finding of the antibodies in leanne jefferies blood no i did not replied chapman how do you account for dr lewell telling me that you did the only explanation that i can offer is that she misunderstood the advice i gave her and inferred i had told her to omit it when in fact i had not will you stand dr lewell said pullinger did you misunderstand what dr chapman told you or did he specifically tell you not to include your finding the woman remained silent for several moments before saying still haltingly i could have misunderstood beside him jordan could see that beckwith had paraded another battalion of exclamation marks on his legal pad jordan looked startled at the man when beckwith declined pullingers invitation to take up the examination reid did though coming up hurriedly at the judges first gesture would you describe yourself as one of alfred appeltons oldest friends asked reid there was no indication of any tightness in his breathing i believe myself to be one of them responded the medical specialist cautiously from college days yes my recollection from the closed hearing which preceded this case was that your friendship began at harvard through a mutual interest in sailing yes jordan was aware of beckwith poised to add more exclamation marks alyce was tensed forward her entire concentration upon the man in the stand unlike leanne jefferies who was actually looking away from the man as if her mind was upon something else would you describe alfred appleton as a man of integrity after the briefest of pauses chapman said yes an honest man your honour interrupted bartle is there anything of relevance in this exchange i am as curious as you to find out said pullinger mr reid i sincerely hope so replied the lawyer far more relevant than an uncorrected inadequate medical report beckwith stood five exclamation marks to attention i look forward to reaching it in the shortest possible time said the judge although not aggressively i asked you if alfred appleton one of your oldest and best friends was an honest man i believe him to be as you are an honest man of integrity giving evidence under oath having been warned of the dangers of perjury chapmans pause was longer this time before he finally said as i believe myself to be were you an honest man of integrity bound by a medical oath as you are by a legal oath in court today when you carried out your medical examination of alfred appleton for presentation before this court yes insisted chapman unable to prevent the hint of uncertainty in his voice had you ever medically examined alfred appleton before the report intended for presentation before this court chapman looked towards bartle who remained expressionless and unmoving dr chapman prompted reid not to my recollection before you specialized in microbiology and more specifically in the study and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases did you practice as a general medical physician chapmans uncertainty was even more obvious when he said i served a period of hospital internship i never practised generally that period of internship was at the massachusetts general hospital situated on fruit street boston was it not yes during that period of internship you were a fully qualified hospital physician able to reach diagnoses and if necessary to authorize admissions and prescribe treatment chapman did not reply jordan saw that appleton was sitting statued at his table both hands extended upon it as if to prevent himself falling forward dr chapman again prompted reid there was still no reply pullinger said dr chapman you will answer the question finally chapman said yes i was in november were you attached to the accident and emergency department of the massachusetts general hospital on fruit street boston i was working at the hospital in in november of that year in the accident and emergency department i worked in a variety of departments including accident and emergency yes do you recall an admission that you authorized into the emergency department of massachusettes general hospital on november third and the diagnosis you reached upon that emergency admission your honour protested bartle i again ask the relevance to this case of something that occurred so long ago how can dr chapman be asked to remember such a specific event the point you are seeking to establish mr reid enquired the judge points enlarged reid those of honesty credibility and possible collusion to pervert the course of justice you will answer the question dr chapman insisted pullinger no i do not remember said the man reid let the pause build finally inhaling deeply for the breath he needed you do not remember admitting alfred jerome appleton your old college friend with whom you so often sailed and whose integrity you so much admire to massachusetts general hospital on november third after a traffic accident in which a car plunged into a lake a car from which anthea elizabeth bell a girl of twentythree could not free herself from her seat belt and therefore drowned resulting in the death not only of herself but of an unborn child no i do not remember repeated chapman the reply only just audible in the sudden noise twentynine the jack daniels bottle was on the table again although this celebration was more muted than its first appearance the judge had upheld david bartles protest at the inadmissibility of the fatal accident refused any further reference to it and rejected reids application to call ddk investigator jack doyle to give supporting evidence at the same time as instructing the jury to disregard any inference when considering their final verdict they wont be able to disregard it beckwith told the other lawyer its in their minds and you put it there where it will stay when they get around to reaching a decision i could have done so much more complained reid we even had proof of the payoff appletons family gave antheas parents to avoid charges being pressed the mom and dad broke up because of the accident and mom changed her mind about it being hushed up she actually wanted to be called to give evidence that appleton made her daughter pregnant and that hed started out only offering how did the kid die asked jordan he was drunk after some yachting event said reid missed a turning and drove instead into a lake managed to get himself out and swim ashore the driver of a following car called emergency and got appleton to hospital appleton didnt say anything about the kid in the car until the following day by then it was obviously too late but a medical examiner said if shed been gotten out she and the baby would have survived chapman swore appleton was too concussed to have remembered anything that he couldnt even remember the accident so no prosecution was brought and there was chapman again with all the necessary qualifications willing to help out with venereal disease and pressure another specialist to go along with it completed beckwith how the hell did appleton think he was going to get away with it arrogance of the rich and spoiled i guess said reid it worked once with the same guy and lets be honest appleton was within a whisker of getting away with it again now the lawyer raised his whisky glass in silent acknowledgement to jordans contribution alyce didnt do so well today said jordan after chapmans release from the witness stand reid had cleverly ignored the attentive dr harding but called alyces gynaecologist brenda stirling to testify to what jordan had already read in the intercepted email correspondence that alyce now only had a ten percent possibility and thats being extremely optimistic of conceiving a full term birth because of the fallopian tube scarring caused by the chlamydia infection alyce had wept openly throughout the testimony and reid hadnt bothered to invite her to that evenings conference ive got to call her to give evidence tomorrow said reid unapologetically and leanne directly after for the jury to compare the two of them literally side by side and alyce can cry as much as she wants thats cynical protested jordan thats practical dismissed reid dont worry about alyce worry about yourself and the hook youre still on its because im still worried about myself that im worried about alyce and wondering how shell stand up to a full examination and crossexamination bartles got to destroy her to give appleton any sort of a chance hasnt he i dont see how he can damage her said beckwith i actually dont see how appleton and bartle could have believed they had any chance of pursuing the case theyre attempting arrogance of the rich and spoiled echoed jordan beckwith shook his head theres got to be more than that so far appleton doesnt have a damned defence on the subject of defence lets not forget pullingers lecture about rebuttal of criminal conversation as far as you two are concerned warned reid the law the way pullinger interpreted it comes down pretty heavily against any logical defence you cant be serious argued beckwith logically you looked to be home free at the dismissal hearing but pullinger didnt find for you reminded reid we discussed it reminded beckwith in turn pullingers an ornery old bastard look how far everything has turned in our favour since then harvey cant possibly be found guilty no one ever said the law was fair any more than life can we take pause here urged jordan the jury cant find against me not on what theyve heard i dont think they should nor am i saying that they will insisted reid but pullinger is an ornery old bastard and hes still got to sum up and guide the jury i wouldnt like to place bets not yet he finds against us ill appeal insisted beckwith how many more months and how much more money could that cost demanded jordan genuinely shocked confronting reids caution jordan acknowledged that although hed begun raiding appletons firm to build up the necessary insurance against having a financial penalty imposed against him he had increasingly begun to regard the money as the fitting punishment against appleton for the inconvenience and upheaval appleton had caused him precisely in fact the sort of compensation people sought from insurance anything up to a year to get a hearing before the north carolina supreme court answered beckwith to reids vaguely nodded agreement costs would be openended if we won which we would minimal the majority would go against appleton and if we failed double whatever id have to pay now plus whatever is awarded against me in the first place challenged jordan i said wed win repeated beckwith and you wouldnt have to hang around here while you waited you could go back to england and only need to return here when we got a hearing date he wouldnt come back was jordans first thought and then just as quickly realized that he wouldnt have a choice there was still the danger of limited publicity and of his identification at the conclusion of this case that publicity and identification would be far greater if he failed to return for an appeal with the inevitable photographs and the even more inevitable recognition this would blow open the identity thefts hed carried out in america in the past and almost certainly at the new york banks in which he had opened the accounts in appletons name and with whom he would be publicly linked in an appeals procedure and during beckwiths estimated year the attack hed mounted against appleton and his firm would be very actively under investigation what can we do beckwith actually laughed at the facile question go on expecting to win of course thats why were all here theres nothing more we can do unless youve got a better idea jordan didnt have although he spent much of a disturbed night trying to think of one to think of anything he finally decided ignoring the pun that alyces lawyer was playing devils advocate to their overconfidence which hed admitted to himself the moment reid had spoken it would be wrong to regard it as anything more than a cautious touch on the brake jordan still wished reid hadnt created the doubt and that beckwith hadnt been so flippant dismissing it despite trying to dismiss it himself the doubt remained lodged in jordans mind as he scrolled through his illicit web hideaways there was nothing more on the chicago query nor any additional questions on any of his other raids prices remained virtually static on copper and jordan limited himself entirely to that one metal for the days pilfering on their way to court jordan said i didnt like bobs doom and gloom last night forget it beckwith continued to dismiss bobs a pessimist thats why he always dresses in black like a funeral director funeral director to dodge city cowboy thought jordan he was surprised that dr harding who knew it was alyces day on the witness stand wasnt in court when they entered she was already at her table nodding to whatever reid was saying to her she looked up through her thickrimmed and now shaded glasses as jordan and beckwith took their places but didnt give any response to jordans nodded smile she was again in funereal black matching the pessimistic reid without any noticeable makeup and as she stood to take the oath her left hand on the rail of the witness stand jordan was further surprised to see that for the first time since that initial day in france she was wearing her wedding and engagement rings where would you rather be today than here in a divorce court opened reid creating an immediate stir throughout the court practically anywhere replied alyce at once most of all in my own home with a family of my own including children of course including children a family isnt a family without children how can it be children which until you contracted a sexual disease you were according to your gynaecologist who testified yesterday medically capable of bearing yes how do you feel now at having less than a ten percent chance of bearing a child full term alyce didnt reply at once bringing to her face a handkerchief jordan hadnt been aware of her taking from her purse it might not properly explain how i feel what i mean but i feel empty inadequate not a proper woman and now never able to be a proper woman hes pushing it right to the edge of the cliff beckwith whispered to jordan who saw that so far there were no exclamation marks of approval on his lawyers legal pad im no longer a proper woman how important to you was having children it was everything to me beyond just being a woman my marriage as the court has already heard was the bringing together of two of the oldest families in america i have no brothers no sisters there is no direct bloodline it will die with my death i believe that is important a loss not to other people i wouldnt think but to me it is of course said reid your marriage wasnt happy before your infection was it no how what did you feel about that alyce again hesitated inadequate like before which again i guess other people other women might not understand didnt you think of divorce then of course i thought about it how could i not have done but i never actually considered it as an option i hoped the separation might help help what seized reid my husband in what way help my husband to love me jordan saw beckwith was at his legal pad at last although he was assembling question marks not approving exclamations if you didnt believe he loved you why did you marry him in the first place i believed he did when we got married it wasnt until afterwards that i thought differently why i very quickly came to believe that what i thought had been love was really pride on his part pride at me a bellamy being his wife it was as if i was a trophy he kept cuttings in a special book when we appeared in social columns or magazines he agreed to a television programme being made about us didnt you like that i hated it i knew who i was who my family were i didnt believe we had to prove it it seemed she paused seeking the word arrogant i suppose did you talk to him about it i tried to told him i didnt want any more television programmes because after the first there were other approaches but he told me i was being stupid that it would bring clients to the business prestige by association he called it he told me i was being unreasonable did he want to accept some of the other tv approaches yes i refused to take part so they never happened was he upset very he said it didnt reflect well on our marriage but you didnt talk of divorce not over something as stupid as a television show divorce is a failure isnt it a lot of people stay together unhappily for the sake of the family i thought that if i had a child it would be all right that he might change but that if he didnt it wouldnt matter id have a child hopefully more than one child and that would be enough for me would it have been i never found out now i never will did you ever suspect he was being unfaithful not in the beginning although after the first few months he invariably came home late he said it was how it had to be in his business i thought there might be other women when i went up to long island and he stayed in manhattan he was rarely in the apartment when i called did you ever challenge him no and you didnt have any proof he was disinterested in me when he did come home sexually you mean yes your husband engaged a private enquiry agent to watch you did it ever occur to you to do the same to watch him no when we finally did appointing ddk it was at your suggestion i didnt have to before then hed admitted it hadnt he im not sure i understand that remark or that the jury will complained reid when i told him he had given me chlamydia there was the big argument hed been drinking when i said hed obviously been sleeping with someone else he said not one two and laughed he later tried to deny it when he sobered up and realized the mistake hed made jordan saw reids frown do you think thats why he admitted it in his statement i dont know when i told him i wanted a divorce he said i wouldnt win that hed destroy me how was he going to destroy you begin divorce proceedings against me first and make my life a misery the lover you never had the lover his investigators failed to find yes did your husband ever physically attack you he actually hit me twice once was at that time during the argument he slapped me across the face told me to pull myself together were you bruised marked in any way not really you didnt need hospital treatment oh no when was the other occasion soon after when i told him i was going to france and that he would be hearing from you my lawyer about the divorce that i was finally getting away from long island and the marriage and from him he punched me said alyce stopped said what pressed reid the words he used told me to fuck off right then never to think of coming back he actually said crawling back like the sad bitch i was were you hurt when and how he punched you i wasnt expecting it i fell over hit my leg and side against a table so you were hurt i was bruised did you need hospital attention dr harding looked after me i left long island right then for the last time beckwith had started taking proper notes but stopped when reid said you told your husband that i was going to initiate divorce proceedings before you left for france yes i took the papers i needed to sign with me weeks before you met harvey jordan the defendant in your husbands claim under the criminal conversation provisions in the alienation of affections statute in force in this state at least six weeks before which is why the accusation against mr jordan is so ridiculous what was the likelihood of your crawling back after discovering you had contracted venereal disease from him alyce snorted a laugh as ridiculous as him citing mr jordan only one person is responsible for the breakdown of my marriage to alfred appleton and that is alfred appleton youre not telling the truth are you mrs appleton demanded david bartle i am telling the truth which i swore to do when i took the oath he never hit you did he he slapped me when he was drunk and i told him i was beginning divorce proceedings and threw me over as i have just told the court neither of which needed any medical treatment dr harding looked after me after i was punched there was bruising as i told you some grazing yet dr harding who has attended you remarkably closely so far because of what is claimed to be the stress of these proceedings is not in court on the day of your major evidence i did not want to take them but he prescribed some pills when he knew he would not be able to be here today your honour broke in reid rising before bartle could continue dr walter harding is not in court today because of something that unexpectedly arose at the hospital at which as you know he is the administrator i could make contact to see if the situation at the hospsital has been resolved for him to come here if your honour wishes i think it is essential in view of your questioning dont you mr bartle i would have thought it essential for him to be here in the first place complained bartle tightly quite so said the judge we find ourselves with another lapse in the presentation of the case but it can easily be remedied you are excused the court in the hope of bringing dr harding to us before we end today mr reid jordan saw beckwith had arranged question marks on his pad some were at an angle instead of being upright your husband didnt admit to two affairs did he resumed bartle you told him youd had him under surveillance because you suspected he was being unfaithful and that you were going to cite sharon borowski and leanne jefferies that is not the correct sequence rejected alyce it was as i have described it i had not organized surveillance and had no idea who the whores were with whom he was sleeping i just knew he was sleeping around because that was how i had become infected that was what i told him it was you who first mentioned the divorce statute of criminal conversation here in north carolina not him insisted the lawyer until i engaged mr reid and learned the totally unfounded case brought against harvey jordan by my husband i had no idea of any such law or divorce provision how could i have done yet you initiated proceedings against ms jefferies i was advised by mr reid that it was a course open to me and that it was one that i should take you had suffered a disease which you claim your husband gave you you had told him you were divorcing him yet you took the papers with you to france instead of signing them here you were still unsure about the divorce werent you no denied alyce the papers werent complete particularly the criminal conversation claim against leanne jefferies they were posted to me in france i took what was already prepared i was going to be by myself i had time to read everything very thoroughly but you werent by yourself were you i wish i had remained so not for my own sake but for mr jordans i very much regret his entrapment by my husband the exclamation marks on beckwiths pad were all upright now your husband is a wealthy man the president of one of wall streets leading commodity brokerages with a multimillon dollar turnover my husband never discussed business affairs with me only in the beginning when he borrowed a million dollars from me a million dollars that you have no proof of drawing from any of your accounts it was how he wanted it done in cash not only is there no traceable record of it having been withdrawn from your accounts there is no recorded entry of such a sum in the company books how do you explain that easily i told you he asked for it in cash to avoid it showing in the books if it were recorded it would have been taxable maybe it was to spend on the women i then didnt know about you had a manhattan apartment costing well over a million dollars the long island house is valued at four million you had staff a amonth allowance luxury cars all provided for you by your husband he said the cars were part repayment of the loan which meant i was buying them for myself what about the rest i would have exchanged it all for a loving husband home before ten every night and children your husband paid for all those homes and luxuries didnt he to which i made a onemilliondollar contribution did you love your husband when you married i thought i did i thought he loved me now i know i was wrong on both counts families dynasties were more important to you than love werent they thats what your marriage was the creation of an american royal family and you knew it didnt you thats what youve already told the court today you didnt expect love of course i expected love love and respect and a family one of the most important factors in a royal marriage is the provision of an heir dont forget which was why your husband wouldnt consider adoption because it wouldnt have provided a proper bloodline if that is the explanation you are offering for his refusal to adopt it is total and arrant nonsense rejected alyce as reid returned to the court as your denial that you had a sexually infected lover is total nonsense challenged bartle at last despite her robustness so far alyce broke into tears at which reid hurried to his feet and said you honour my client should surely be allowed the protection of the court which i am allowing her and which you must observe mr wolfson warned pullinger as leanne jefferies attorney got to his feet the shouted violent confrontation with your husband that you have described to the court followed your discovery that you had chlamydia began wolfson yes agreed alyce dryeyed now as far as i understand your evidence your marriage to alfred appleton was already profoundly unhappy your living in long island and his living most of the time in manhattan was virtually a separation wasnt it yes but the chlamydia was the final irreparable breaking point yes you did attempt a reconciliation though yes did it work no if you hadnt been infected would you have filed for divorce yes i think i would just think pressed wolfson not just think i would have filed for divorce my marriage our marriage was a sham there was a line of upright exclamation marks on beckwiths pad jordan saw when you had that final irreparable breakingup fight with your husband did you know of leanne jefferies i knew he had a mistress i didnt know her name when did you learn her name when the proceedings began when my lawyer received the papers from my husbands lawyer until that time did you have any intention of claiming financial damages from leanne jefferies for criminal conversation for being the cause of the collapse of your marriage jordan turned at the shift in the jury box and saw walter harding sliding into his accustomed seat beyond the separating rail no alyce replied to the questioned ive already given evidence that i did so because of the law in this state of the availability of the provision did leanne jefferies cause the end of your marriage wasnt your marriage already over before you ever learned her name during the womans hesitation beckwith leaned sideways and said to jordan good try his only try but it isnt a defence finally alyce said yes it was i suppose bruising identified harding from the witness stand in a bland even bedside voice to the upper right thigh and lower ribs some contusions but no actual skin break by the time i examined mrs appleton i suspected there might be internal rib bruising too how did you understand mrs appleton received those injuries she told me she had been violently punched by her husband earlier in the day at their long island home that her ribs had been particularly painful on the flight back here to raleigh did you not consider having mrs appleton xrayed at your hospital to establish whether her ribs were actually broken or fractured from the external bruising i did not believe either to have happened if either had occurred there is no medical procedure no plastering or binding support that could have eased the healing or reduced the pain beyond the palliative medication i prescribed were the physical injuries on mrs appletons body consistent with her being violently punched to the ground the specific injuries we are discussing were consistent with a fall but on her upper left shoulder extending maybe three or four inches down her upper chest as far as her breast there was further bruising marked in such a way to indicate knuckle separation this was consistent with her having been punched there was another separate bruise on her right shoulder which could have been caused by a thumb being heavily pressed in her at this point violently punched pressed reid it would have to have been a heavy blow to have resulted in the bruising i am describing and to have knocked her to the floor and the pressure that caused the other mark on her right shoulder substantial harding agreed under intense questioning from bartle that he had been in raleigh not long island where alyce claimed to have sustained her injuries and repeatedly agreed that he had no way to substantiate that they could have been inflicted in the way she had described to him so she could have received the bruises and contusions by the simple act of tripping falling from her own clumsiness not by being attacked demanded the lawyer the bruising and contusions to her upper right thigh and side yes agreed harding but most definitely not the bruising to her upper left shoulder and breast that was clearly imprinted with the method of its cause a heavy punch and its not possible to punch yourself to leave that severity of imprint she was hit hit hard by somebody else the practice was for jordan to wait in the corridor outside the court to be collected by his lawyer and reid to go on to their afterhearing conference and assessment but that night beckwith emerged alone to announce there wasnt going to be one why not demanded jordan wolfson wants a meeting with bob what about bargainings my guess said beckwith thats the usual reason for opposing lawyers to get together during a hearing to whose benefit its got to be alyces its wolfson whos come to bob you think the case is collapsing somethings shaking at least did you notice alyce was wearing her wedding and engagement rings and kept them visible all the time expanded beckwith oldest trick in the world in a divorce hearing a constant reminder to the jury of what theyre there for and the punishment the wronged wife has suffered and dont tell me its cynical i know it is but if id been representing alyce thats exactly what i would have told her to do dont forget the theatre accepted jordan why the different sometimes angled symbols today yesterday bob was brilliant i wasnt completely sure of the questioning tactics today although unless theres any reexamination i think bob got away with it got away with what didnt it strike you as curious how well alyce stood up to everything only showing the slightest weakness a few tears at the very end harding had given her something she said so from the stand she didnt seem much under the influence of anything to me said beckwith she did her best in front of the jury for you you think from the way its going it could all be over quicker than you imagined very little has come out the way i imagined apart from our part and thats come out better than i imagined which was what jordan thought until he turned on his computer thirty there were two more challenges both from manhattan brokers this time both highlighting shortfalls one on a copper disposal the other on an aluminium trade that should have resulted in a profit the combined deficit for which jordan was responsible both one of his early hits was as with the chicago query the approaches from both brokers imagined a miscalculation and the appleton dealers replies promised immediate enquiries it was the internal email correspondence upon which jordan concentrated in sequence they began between the two metal dealers but within the space of three messages grew to include john popple the dealer to whom the chicago complaint had been made popples pickup to his two colleagues was that the initial back office investigation had failed to discover the disparity in his sale to which the copper broker george sutcliffe replied suggesting the three of them immediately report the situation to their financial control division the third man colin nutbeam warned against an overreaction before making their own essential enquiries well look fools if theres a simple explanation like a misplaced digit or a dropped decimal point with no cause for panic popple countered that he was going to bring it before his section leader ive been trying to track it down for days and cant its time i made it official both the other traders asked popple not to mention their problems until theyd had the chance to make their own checks popple wished them luck still no cause for him to panic jordan judged there was no way short of a professional electronic sweep of discovering his illegal presence within the appleton and drake computers and when that eventually happened weeks away from now the embezzlers name uncovered would be that of alfred appleton not harvey jordan but before that there would have to be a full scale and individual trader audit to establish the embezzlement in the first place and after that a criminal investigation mounted to trace its source to appleton it was still moving faster than jordan had expected but then although he knew his way through the labyrinth of computer hacking he hadnt actually worked such a complicated scam as this before so he didnt precisely know what to expect except of course to win which he would because he always did jordan phished appleton and drakes trades with the delicacy of an angler dancing a fly on a trout stream taking his time undecided between gold or silver eventually choosing to split between the two he raided three gold holdings and two silver switching a total of in bank transfers the tranche brought him close to his selfimposed banked limit making essential withdrawals from all the accounts into the unrecorded safe deposits in which including the his profit currently stood at he hadnt confirmed the possibility of their meeting that night but decided there was a need suggesting by telephone to beckwith that they go again to the outoftown restaurant to get away from the incarceration of the hotel both stopped momentarily startled at the sight already at a table although not yet eating of appleton and bartle both briefly seemed equally surprised it was the bejeaned beckwith who recovered first he gave a stilted half wave to which bartle awkwardly responded told the bell captain they needed their reserved table to be at the opposite side of the room and as they walked towards it said to jordan its a free country and there aint any law against it they ordered martinis in preference to the heavier jack daniels and a recovered jordan said you know what baffles me how someone as he had to pause for the word as delicate as alyce could have shared the same bed with someone like him ive never actually seen one but with that funny hump of his he reminds me of that bison on your belt buckle youve got the inside track to make that sort of comparison which i guess makes you biased said the lawyer and smiled but he sure as hell doesnt give tom cruise any competition does he it make you uncomfortable being in the same room not at all said jordan meaning it at that moment he reflected he knew more of the inside workings of appletons business than appleton himself miserable looking son of a bitch as well said beckwith but then at the current state of play hes got every reason to be id still like to hear what theyre talking about what leannes going to say would be a good guess suggested jordan coming to the first reason for his invitation he went on you heard from bob about what he and wolfson talked about beckwith shook his head didnt expect to were huggermugger about everything involving you and alyce because of the obvious mutual interest anything concerning him and wolfson and leanne i guess is outside the loop what bargain has wolfson got to offer bob beckwith shrugged again beats me the only purpose of bargaining meetings is mutual cooperation and i cant imagine what there is to cooperate about between alyce and leanne wouldnt it also be jordan has to pause again for the word illegal unprofessional maybe for them to talk like this its coming pretty close to the fence allowed the lawyer but its not forbidden and if you cant stop the express train coming at your client at miles an hour which wolfson cant it doesnt hurt to negotiate about what i just told you said beckwith with a flare of impatience i dont know and cant think of a reason he looked across at the other table theyre really not very happy to see us jordan followed his lawyers concentration across to the other table from which both bartle and appleton were looking at them and talking at the same time bartle took a cell phone from his pocket dialled and abruptly slammed the lid shut appleton half rose but sat when bartle held out a restraining hand jordan said looks like an argument as well as a telephone call that didnt connect id say so agreed beckwith jordan turned away at the arrival of the wine waiter as the host he tasted and agreed to the napa valley burgundy although he would have preferred a french wine coming to the second point he wanted to establish he said lets talk about something you might be able to speculate on the way its going i dont think itll get anywhere near your estimate no way agreed beckwith at once weve got leanne tomorrow maybe some recalls although im not going to apply for any at the moment i dont think bob has got anyone else now that his enquiry people have been cut off by pullinger i dont think he needs anyone else so whats your new estimate middle of next week tops everything was definitely moving faster coming up to the speed of light than hed expected acknowledged jordan i know it will only be a ballpark figure thats all im asking for keeping everything else out of the equation how much am i into for costs beckwith waited for their meal to be served cut into his inevitable steak but held it on the fork before him as if examining it we got a problem here harvey absolutely not apart from moving necessary funds across from england assured jordan which is why im asking the question i may need to go back to withdraw some more make plane reservations stuff like that ballpark heavily qualified beckwith ballpark confirmed jordan two hundred and fifty thousand estimated beckwith and dont even think of anything extra for an appeal from his conversations in london with lesley corbin jordan had imagined it would be much higher maybe i wont need to go back to england just hit appleton far harder after making room in the openmouthed accounts he thought with a better view of bartles table from where he was sitting beckwith said and baby makes three jordan turned again to see peter wolfson approaching bartles table at something that bartle said the other lawyer looked across towards them before he sat beckwith gave another hand gesture which wolfson did not acknowledge beckwith said like the wise man said shit happens they go to all the trouble of finding a little outoftown hideaway for their council of war and we walk in no wonder they look so pissed off you think wolfsons come straight from seeing bob hardly need the help of sherlock holmes do we said beckwith i can hardly wait for tomorrow but they had to longer than theyd expected after rigidly sticking to his early morning routine which produced nothing beyond what hed already read on appleton and drakes computers jorden went down for breakfast to be told that by the time beckwith called him reid had already left to collect alyce from the bellamy estate earlier than usual queried jordan two hours earlier than usual agreed beckwith they obviously had things to talk about and they were still talking already at their table when jordan and his lawyer arrived at court there was only the briefest moment before the judges entry for any conversation between alyces lawyer and beckwith before peter wolfson called leanne jefferies to the stand jordan managed eye contact with alyce as the other woman was being sworn alyce looked back at him blankly on his pad jordan wrote what beckwith scribbled back leannes ours led by wolfson with appleton and bartle both intently forward over their separate table leanne confirmed her age to be thirty and described herself as a senior partner in the wall street commodity firm of sears rutlidge not once looking at him leanne testified she had known alfred appleton by reputation over a period of five years as the senior partner of appleton and drake a rival firm of commodity dealers thirteen months earlier she and appleton had begun a brief relationship which she estimated to have lasted no longer than two months at that time she had understood appleton to be coming to the end of an unopposed divorce her relationship with appleton had ended when she contracted a sexually transmitted disease which appleton told her he had in turn caught from his wife during a failed reconciliation before their relationship began she would not have engaged in such a relationship if she had known that divorce proceedings had not at that time even been initiated she had not regarded their affair as a serious commitment on either side and now deeply regretted it how many commodity firms are there in wall street demanded reid as he rose to crossexamine as always when he was on his feet in court there was no trace of asthma in his voice im not sure there was a discernible uncertainty from how she had responded to this questioning ten twenty thirty suggested reid i really am not sure leanne insisted would you say it was a comparatively limited community most dealers knowing other dealers not particularly but you knew alfred appleton for what almost four years before your affair began yes when she wasnt talking leanne had her lips drawn in tightly between her teeth wasnt he someone particularly well known in wall street because of his family antecedents not particularly she repeated did you know of the family history i may have heard something of it did you or didnt you demanded reid brusquely id heard something about it conceded leanne defensively what about the historically well known bellamy family i didnt know anything about a bellamy family protested the woman you didnt know that your lover alfred appleton was married to alyce bellamy uniting two of the best known families in americas founding history no said leanne before every answer she looked hopefully towards wolfson although still steadfastly refusing to look at appleton so close at the adjoining table when did you discover the identity of alfred appletons wife i dont remember not until we became close i dont think how did you become close when did it happen who approached whom leanne took several moments to reply it was at a seminar in new jersey went over two days when did it begin the first night or the second night there was another pause the second night before you went to bed with alfred appleton the second night you knew he was a married man didnt you he told me he was divorced appleton thrust sideways to talk to his lawyer at leannes answer was divorced or getting divorced pressed reid was divorced insisted leanne just waiting for the decree to become absolute thats exactly what he said that he was waiting for the decree to become absolute yes blurted leanne before seeing wolfson shaking his head i mean i think yes by then you knew who appleton was the history didnt you something had been said i had an idea the woman stumbled on you saw yourself as the second mrs appleton didnt you marrying into one of americas oldest families pounced reid no leanne denied flustered that wasnt how it was what it was i told you it wasnt a commitment she looked at alyce beside her interrogator like hers wasnt a commitment didnt mean anything just something that happened she twisted looking for the first time to appleton and managed you you bastard before collapsing back into her chair sobbing to jordan beckwith finally said if i can only get the chance first bartle and then wolfson objected to beckwith taking up the crossexamination wolfson even pleading that leanne was incapable of continuing despite her obvious recovery on the witness stand but pullinger dismissed both arguments that further questioning was unnecessary you did believe alfred appletons marriage was over didnt you began beckwith softly encouraging yes because that was what hed told you yes so he lied to you your honour bartle tried to protest but pullinger gestured him down yes said leanne she no longer appeared uncertain as he lied about catching chlamydia from his wife i suppose so from what ive heard here in court why didnt you go to a doctor a venerealogist in new york he said he knew people in boston who could help that he had influence there alfred appleton persuaded you to go to boston because he had influence there said beckwith what did you understand he meant by that i dont really know that they were good doctors i suppose why werent you treated by the same venerealogist who treated him dr chapman he said it would be best if we were treated separately did you ask him why no not really i was very upset at having been infected he said i wasnt to worry that hed fix everything your honour objected bartle again i really must protest at this my client is here in court able to refute anything that this witness says if you choose to call him stopped pullinger as you are to crossexamine in an attempt to obtain contrary evidence if you choose mr bartle he told you he would fix everything picked up beckwith is alfred appleton a dominant man ms jefferies very much so who dislikes opinions contrary to his own finished beckwith who refuses opinions contrary to his own said the woman she was sitting forward in her chair now looking directly at appleton when was the first time you heard of a person named sharon borowski there was a falter from leanne jefferies when i was served with the court papers ordering me to appear here you hadnt expected them been warned to expect them of course not replied leanne indignantly because you believed the divorce was already resolved over exactly what did you do called alfred asked him what was happening what did he say that there had been a mixup a mistake that hed fix it that hed fix it repeated beckwith for the second time how did he say he was going to fix it he made me go to his lawyers in boston who said stop sharply ordered pullinger from the bench do you intend pursuing this mr beckwith in view of the suit that has been brought against my client i believe it is incumbent upon me to pursue it your honour said beckwith mr bartle asked the judge i would respectfully submit that this is far beyond any grounds of admissibility said appletons lawyer mr wolfson repeated pullinger with equal respect your honour i would make the same submission said leannes lawyer and would further seek to approach your honour either at the bench or in chambers if your honour feels there is benefit to your court or to yourself from such discussion pullinger slumped reflectively into his highbacked chair leaving three of the four attorneys on their feet leanne looked around her confused alyce stared directly ahead unmoving appletons bisons head was forward over his table there were the sounds of shifting from the jury box pullinger came slowly forward further than he normally sat immediately bringing to jordans mind the imagery of a watchful predatory vulture to permit the continuation of this examination while permissible within the bounds of law would seriously invite the possibility of my having to dismiss this jury and declare a mistrial upon the grounds of undue and prejudicial bias to deny its continuation provides mr beckwith with the opportunity to seek an appeal on behalf of his client as indeed it does mr bartle and mr wolfson on behalf of theirs so be it this has been the most contentious and most unsatisfactory hearing i believe i have ever been called upon to adjudicate i further believe however that at this stage it is still possible for me to direct the jury subject to consultation with the respective attorneys about further potential witnesses to a fitting and legally satisfactory conclusion which it is my intention to do it is also my intention to release the jury from their responsibilities for the rest of this day be available in chambers for individual or combined discussion with counsel about witnesses to whom i have already referred and subject to those representations address the jury at the opening of the court tomorrow weve won declared beckwith there cant be any doubt agreed reid theyd gone together to see pullinger in chambers to announce neither had any remaining witnesses nor objection to the hearing being closed and waited back at their tables to be recalled by the judge if the separately attending bartle and wolfson had raised a question needing a fuller discussion which seemingly they hadnt reid telephoned his office from the courtroom corridor before helping alyce into his car and the ordered champagne french not american was waiting when the four of them arrived alyce hesitated at the toast and said you heard what leanne said about his always needing to dominate which id already told you he does alfred will appeal the judge actually invited him to not even a control freak like your soontobe exhusband could risk having paraded in open court to be reported every day whats come out here insisted reid and it would come out if you retained me to appear on your behalf at an appeal id object to any closed hearing and make that clear to whatever attorney he engaged and it wouldnt be david bartle i dont think he would take the case even if he were offered it which i dont think he would be able anyway because i think pullinger is going to report both him and wolfson to their bar council for professional misconduct which in my opinion wolfsons move last night definitely was im still waiting to hear what that was protested jordan he offered a deal an outofcourt damages settlement of to alyce from leanne if we agreed not to call her shed told wolfson whod told bartle that shed be a hostile witness because of the crap appleton dumped on her but i said no added alyce i didnt dont want her money i want alfred just once to be shown hes not god which she would although not immediately thought jordan where was leanne going to get appleton i guess said reid wolfson insisted the money was there if we agreed she wouldnt have done said alyce the bastard would have cheated her like he cheats everybody are we going to get around to drinking to victory complained beckwith they finally drank alyce hesitantly she said thank you thank all of you i cant believe its virtually all over and it is isnt it virtually all over we can behave like normal people again all over but for the formalities promised reid bringing out the jack daniels from his desk drawer in preference to the champagne alyce shook her head against her glass being refilled as jordan did moving with her away from reids desk what are you doing this afternoon asked alyce i havent thought about it lied jordan hed already calculated that at only just past one he had more than sufficient time to get to manhattan to empty the overflowing bank accounts to make room for more transfers and be back in raleigh long before tomorrows court opening why not spend it back at the house invited alyce id like that very much accepted jordan the bank accounts could wait overflowing or not thirtyone jordan and beckwith had alternated between cars to move between the hotel and the court building and that day they had used jordans hired ford beckwith accepted with a frown although nothing more at being told hed need a taxi for his hotel return and within fifteen minutes jordan and alyce were driving in the opposite direction to the bellamy estate jordan followed alyces route directions from the civic centre court avoiding any possible media interference isolating none but jordan quickly recognized the surroundings and as they passed it nodded towards the previous nights restaurant thats where we saw them after wolfson made his pitch to bob bob told me said alyce they must have thought you were having them watched knowing where they were when you walked in they certainly reacted as if they had been caught doing something wrong laughed jordan it wasnt difficult for him to laugh to be very happy alone with alyce driving through the low undulating north carolina countryside i cant believe they thought id go for the offer legal or otherwise bob doesnt think they ever expected you to fight the case in the first place that youd be too frightened of losing and simply stay away i still might wish i had stayed after tomorrow im not as confident as either bob or dan alyce admitted they dont know alfred like i do he doesnt lose ever doesnt know how hell appeal if theres the slightest room for him to do so there had been no building no sign of any habitation at all for the previous fifteen minutes and alyce raised her arm gesturing to his right just around this bend theres a turning to the right that suddenly comes up take it jordan did and almost at once found himself on the edge of a plain that stretched out in all directions as far as he could see he said thats incredible the worlds flat and were right at the edge alyce shifted in her seat quietly as if she were embarrassed she said its all bellamy land as far as the horizon and as much more than as much again beyond thats i dont know it must be groped jordan a lot of land helped alyce and theres more way over to the south right up to the coast weve leased a lot of it long hundred year leases but we still own it you own it qualified jordan ultimately i guess agreed alyce its all tied up in trusts and foundations and charities and god knows what it was all here for the taking when the first ships landed all those years ago and a man named hector bellamy took it at least unlike most of the other early settlers he didnt annihilate the native americans who already lived here maybe he should have done according to the history they rose up against his settlement and killed him but not until he had sons almost inaudibly she said which i cant now have jordan wasnt sure if shed intended him to hear and pretended that he hadnt they drove on for what jordan knew from the cars speedometer trip to be a further ten miles passing through an unexpected neonlit township which jordan thought of as an unwelcome intrusion before alyce gestured another right turning on to a private blacktop within yards there was a cctvmonitored gatehouse with a further cameramounted identification speaker grill into which alyce leaned across him to announce their arrival a huge electronicallycontrolled barrier that filled the entire gate space began to open from both sides of the gatehouse spread a high fence in front of which at intervals were printed warnings of its electrification about twenty yards behind the fence began a thatch of even higher trees seemingly planted without any design but which in fact formed a straggled forest beyond which it was impossible to see from the outside no house was immediately visible but there were several flocks of faraway sheep as well as a herd of nervously attentive deer when the buildings came into view jordan realized that there was not one house but several a complex dominated by the central columned and verandaencircled white clapboard original with separate twoand threestorey constructions grouped around it completed by a single storey lshaped stabling to one side around it all was looped a stand of very tall and longestablished shading trees jordan was surprised when he stopped to see that they had only been driving a little over an hour as the towering front door opened to their approach jordan said itll be a uniformed butler house manager corrected alyce although it was a man in a black suit and tie waiting for them at the entrance well eat something when ive got out of these court clothes to the man she said well use the garden room stephen take mr jordan through will you alyces instinctive authority he remembered from that night at the carlyle but only occasionally in france had returned jordan recognized following the man as alyce mounted the wide stairway winding around half of the circular entrance hall from its panelled walls were displayed a portrait gallery of whom jordan guessed to be alyces ancestors the garden room fulfilled its title it was a vast glasswalled and roofed conservatory stretching out into sculpted and fountainflower displays on three sides with longleafed plants and vases of more flowers inside jordan declined the offered drink looking out beyond the neatly bordered and colourcoordinated beds in which two gardeners were working when alyce entered she was wearing a vnecked sweater light blue jeans that jordan was sure hed seen in france and was barefoot he nodded in the direction in which he had been frowning and said what looks like a long red flag way beyond all the buildings its a wind sock right an airstrip she agreed flying is the quickest and most convenient way to commute up and down from new york theres a helicopter as well as a lear both owned and run by the bellamy foundation i didnt guess it was anything like this as extensive as this an empire alyce shrugged stephen offer you a drink i thought id wait jordan saw that while hed stood with his back to the room a table glass topped to fit its surroundings had been laid with cutlery goblets and tumblers lunch is scrambled eggs and smoked salmon sounds good alyce totally comfortable in her own accustomed environment the creator of her own environment went to a side cooler jordan hadnt seen and said how about a drink now jordan saw at once that it was the white burgundy hed ordered for them in france now id like one his conflicting unaccustomed feelings were colliding at that precise moment he knew himself to be confused seeking a balancing plateau he said i thought your mother would be here she likes the beach house at this time of the year she paints actually paints quite well faraway in another part of the mansion there was the distant sound of a telephone and almost at once a louder summons from a multilined console on a side table as jordan gestured that he was leaving the room he heard alyce say hello hi sorry yes hes here now im fine no problem ok he was at the door when he heard hey come back and when he reentered the room she said thanks for the politeness but you didnt have to do that it was walter hes coming over when hes finished walter walt harding he can guide you back later jordan hadnt thought about later hadnt thought about anything not wanting to anticipate anything more than a minute ahead now he felt disappointed he said i could have found my own way he admitted to himself the hope that he wouldnt have needed to at least it took away the uncertainty alyce didnt reply rising instead at the reentry of the butler he was pushing a flameheated serving trolley from which as they sat he ladled eggs and fish on to plates and topped up both their glasses alyce said i guess by this time next week youll be back in london i havent thought about it lets get tomorrow over first wondering why i invited you out here this afternoon no lied jordan its about tomorrow like i told you im not as confident as either bob or dan even if theres no damages awarded against you youve still got a lot of costs and stop demanded jordan loudly weve done this too many times and ive told you no too many times its still no always will be so lets forget it once and for all ok no its not ok she argued youre going to be out a lot of money whatever happens thats not fair jordan swept out his arm encompassing the house and beyond so you brought me here to show me you could afford it more than i could thats not fair either tell me it isnt true then i wanted to talk to you by ourselves the court break was convenient i wasnt trying to impress you this is just how it is i am impressed finally conceded jordan but not enough to take your money its no longer a conversation between us hed never imagined himself uninterested in anyone elses money jordan further conceded but there had been a lot of other things attitude changes over the last few weeks that he wouldnt have imagined possible either never againalyce promised she sniggered promise you wont get mad if i say something else though ill try you know who you reminded me of yelling at me like that you tell me its alfred and ill yell louder he said joining in the game it was alfred how he used to speak talk to people talk to everybody she hesitated at stephens return with a black uniformed woman to clear the table apart from their wine and water glasses allowing time for them to get out of hearing she said people never worked for us either in manhattan or long island beyond a few weeks because of it she physically shuddered at the recollection in the land of the laidback why on earth does everyone automatically refer to him as alfred never al alyces laugh this time was more spontaneous call alfred al youve got to be joking he was always alfred and even then only to a very few people how the hell did you ever get involved with such a jordan paused a man monster would have done she said you wouldnt believe how many times and in how many different ways ive asked myself that same question but hes very good at hiding himself when he needs to when its necessary and it was very necessary with me and the family and all that wed created it was only when it didnt work as hed intended it to work that it all started to go wrong that the punishments started youre losing me complained jordan maybe we shouldnt even be talking about it now that its virtually over theres no point you know what i now realize alfred really felt about me about me and all the historic bullshit and where we the bellamys are now said alyce too engrossed in her own reflections to heed jordans caution it was resentment it was right what bob suggested in court although he never brought it out like it truly was it wasnt me that alfred loved i dont think its possible for him to love anyone probably not even himself although i think i said that he did what alfred really did love which bob challenged him with was the idea of being the king in an american royal family a king who could have as many mistresses as he wanted like kings once did like some still do maybe marrying me gave him the combined lineage but to make it really work he needed the court and the country to rule which didnt exist but the bellamy foundation existed the foundation on which i was a working chief executive until he persuaded me to resign as i told the court except that it wasnt because he considered it illfitting for me to be a working woman he manoeuvred that to vacate the throne for himself but he miscalculated as alfred so often miscalculated the bellamy foundation is a charitable organization with all the responsibilities that were explained in court but theres nothing charitable about the board that runs it theyre hardassed professionals who were the first to see alfred for what he is long before i did getting on to it wasnt the shooin he thought it was going to be he couldnt get the necessary board member vote certainly not when mother whos got the controlling vote structure wouldnt back him thats how the punishments started punishments queried jordan i believe thats what the loans were alfred appletons personally imposed financial penalties and the neglect and the whoring although i dont think infecting me as he did was an intended humiliation because to do that he had to contract it first and not even he would do that alyce abruptly laughed although nervously jesus ive really run off at the mouth havent i turned you into my therapist jordan laughed with her anxious to lighten the mood i had a free afternoon i know she started but then stopped know what im not going to talk about money i promise but i know from bob what a hell of an input you made i want to thank you and apologize for you getting caught up in it and i promise never again to mention any of that either you think i could have a moment or two to talk asked jordan sure he knew what he wanted to say but not at all sure how to say it depends what it is qualified alyce cautiously none of whats happened jordan started awkwardly stopping at the sound from the far door of the garden room hi greeted walter harding emerging through the foliage hisaid alyce shit thought jordan when they came to be delivered jordans initial reaction to the verdicts was that of an anticlimax despite even his total exoneration because that was how he regarded the conclusion of the previous afternoon at the bellamy house anxious at its end to quickly leave a place which until hardings intrusion hed hoped desperately not to leave that night hopefully not for many nights so occupied still was he by that disappointment that at the opening of the court proceedings jordan actually had to force his concentration upon pullingers summation and guidance to the jury which strictly obeyed pullingers insistence on the priority of its required judgements this meant appletons criminal conversation claim against him was the first to be dealt with and totally dismissed immediately following the verdict pullinger ordered that appleton should pay three quarters of jordans total costs for initiating such a flagrantly insupportable action in part for which he held bartle responsible for providing the inept legal advice the jury found against leanne jefferies but again following pullingers instructions limited the award against her to in alyces favour they also found in alyces favour on her cross petition against appleton after discharging the jury pullinger declared he had considered a bench order alleging perjury against appleton but held back from doing so in the event of the man appealing upon the grounds hed offered the previous day he definitely intended an enquiry into alleged perjury against mark chapman and to carry out his already indicated decision to report both venerealogists to their respective massachusettes licensing authorities for professional misconduct on the same grounds he was going to report david bartle and peter wolfson to both the north carolina and new york state bar associations in addition to which pullinger told the two attorneys whom hed ordered to stand before him i shall refuse ever again to have either of you appear before me on any legal matter which i shall make clear to both bar associations i have nominated i further order upon the possibility of both or either of your clients being held in contempt of my court against making comments or assisting in any way the media either electronic or print beyond what this court provides about any of the defendants or claimants in these proceedings i want your assurance which will be recorded by the court stenographer that you fully and completely understand the order i have just issued one by one the two attorneys appleton and finally leanne jefferies acknowledged that they understood this hearing the most disgraceful ever presented before me is now closed pullinger concluded reids office was judged both inadequate and inappropriate for the celebration and at a loss for an alternative they went back to the all too familiar hotel where a hurriedly arranged private room was hired and food and drink ordered while alyce telephoned her mother to relay the news and jordan returned to his suite to make an earlierthanusual computer check that there had been no movement upon the existing shortfall enquiries nor any new challenges as an afterthought as he was actually leaving his suite jordan quickly dialled lesley corbin in london who said shed never had any doubt of the outcome and whom jordan didnt believe jordan was back in his anticlimax depression when he got to the celebration by which time walter harding had arrived and alyce had passed on the court verdict also there were the ddk enquiry team who had never been called upon as well as some support staff from reids office harding approached jordan the moment he entered the room and said didnt i tell you this was exactly as it would turn out you certainly did agreed jordan as well as a lot of other icanpredict bullshit by which hed become so irritated the previous afternoon that hed switched off any attention to the mans constant outpourings hows it feel demanded harding im not sure its settled in jordan wished alyce would break away form reid so that he could excuse himself from the hospital administrator it was obviously nonsense from the beginning insisted the man i guess youre now going back to reality and england where everything and everybody is normal hed never ever lived in reality thought jordan always the opposite the unreality of living being somebody else with somebody elses name and persona he said im not sure thats an apt description either he saw alyce had moved away from her lawyer and immediately excused himself to join her alyce said at once i didnt realize pullinger was delaying the media release until tomorrow neither did i by which time i shall be back at the house beyond any camera lens is that what youre going to do theres no better place to hide for how long for as long as i choose although the judge put a pretty effective lid on it becoming a longrunning saga didnt he so what after you come out of retreat pressed jordan she smiled at the expression regain my life ive already arranged to get my place back on the board of the bellamy foundation as well as thats as far as for the moment said alyce there was something you were going to say just before walter arrived at the house yesterday maybe later said jordan not now call me thirtytwo jordan tried the moment he got into his carlyle suite the following morning before even bothering to unpack after a delayed new york arrival from raleigh at the bellamy north carolina estate stephen after having established who jordan was told him alyce wasnt there and that he didnt know when she would be returning she hadnt given a date or a location although he didnt think it was manhattan jordan told the butler where he was even stipulating his suite number and to pass on a message for alyce to call if she made contact and did the same when despite the butlers doubt that alyce was in new york he got the answering service at her west th street apartment during the returning flight jordan had scoured as many newspapers as were available at raleigh airport both the new york times and wall street journals coverage was relegated to deep into the inside pages boosted beyond the strictly limited factual release from pullingers court by photographs of both appleton and alyce and the inevitable historical background of both families jordan was named only once without either a photograph or an indication even of his english nationality there was nothing in any international edition of any english newspaper collected for him by the hotels customer service department hed alerted lesley corbin during his earlier call from raleigh and when he telephoned again she confirmed there was no reference either to the case or to him personally in any of that mornings london editions neither had there been on any national british television or radio bulletin or any internet news source shed accessed why should there have been she asked him rhetorically you were found not guilty of any involvement in the case jordan waited until after hed unpacked before mounting his daily monitor of the appleton and drake computers there was a further challenge again from a manhattan broker to a shortfall on another of the earliest copper trades hed raided and evident growing alarm in the continuing email conversations between the two earlier questioned metal traders at their inability to discover the cause of their individual problems through any of the personal enquiries they had so far conducted one colin nutbeam complained of not being able to look any further or differently than he already had and his colleague george sutcliffe agreed that if they didnt identify the cause of the disparities in the next twentyfour hours there was no alternative but to officially report it to their respective financial supervisors from the now extensive communications between the originally challenged john popple and his financial controller there were gaps indicating either personal interviews or internal telephone conversations culminating the previous day in the latest email from the fiscal manager not to popple but to alfred appleton asking for the earliest possible meeting upon his return from raleigh to discuss an apparently inexplicable financial discrepancy in an onwardly traded pork belly future in an attempt to trace the error before the requested meeting the controller intended conducting an audit of every buy and sell contract in which popple had been involved in the preceding six months until the matter was resolved it was suggested that a specific accounting be made of every buy and sell trade in which popple had engaged jordan unsuccessfully tried alyces number again before leaving the hotel delaying any more raids upon appleton and drake holdings until he had made room in the five bank accounts even though the banks were comparatively close to each other it took him almost four hours to move between them keeping to the same strict routine he first withdrew all but between to from each account carrying the cash to the separate securities divisions where in the locked seclusion of their individual private rooms he emptied the already well filled safedeposit boxes into the two briefcases he carried with him both for continued security against the unlikely irony of a street mugging and to necessarily relieve the physical strain of carrying the two now very heavy cases jordan hailed a taxi when he emerged from the last bank to take him back to the carlyle hotel there he reentered the computers of appleton and drake and spent almost a further hour plundering previously untouched accounts moving a total of into the five banks in which he had been earlier that afternoon there was no new correspondence in any of the appleton and drake sites he accessed including the personal station of alfred appleton jordan again got alyces answering service when he tried the manhattan apartment and stephen insisted there had been no contact from her since jordans previous call promising to pass on his message and location the moment there was the low table in the suites sitting room was substantial running virtually the entire length of the two couches it divided but it was still too small to accommodate the money when jordan tried to tip out the contents of both briefcases even though he had mostly stipulated notes every time he had made a cash withdrawal jordan worked carefully and with practised professionalism assembling the money in individual onethousanddollar bundles before moving the piles from the table to the floor to make room for what was in the second case at that moment the haul amounted to which meant that after pullingers reduced costs decision in his judgement that jordan had more than sufficient to settle his account with daniel beckwith even if the final bill exceeded the attorneys ballpark figure of jordan managed to fit in the suite safe concealed inside the bedroom closet neatly stacked as the money now was it was easy to assemble in envelopes of each to transport it all in just one briefcase to the cashiers office where he rented three more safedeposit boxes in addition to the two already in his genuine name jordan resisted his impatience to telephone the manhattan apartment too early the next morning waiting until just before ten before calling alyce again not bothering to leave another message when he again got the answering machine why had she suggested he call if she hadnt intended to be at either of the numbers shed given him it wasnt until his settlement meeting with daniel beckwith after a further two days without any contact from alyce that jordan learned alyce had changed her mind about hiding in north carolina and flown instead to antigua according to bob she didnt want to be kept a prisoner there by the media theyve set up camp outside despite pullingers warnings said beckwith you know where in antigua no frowned the lawyer why i didnt properly say goodbye improvized jordan when are you going back in a day or two said jordan he really did need to go back to england he told himself there could be a lot of correspondence at the hans crescent flat quite apart from what might be waiting for him in marylebone i guess its still possible that appleton might appeal despite pullingers warning said beckwith he could i suppose apply for a retrial because of the comments or argue separately against the costs apportionment whatever i dont see how or why you should be enjoined apart from the matter of costs but if anything comes up that you need to know about ill liaise through lesley ok fine agreed jordan what are those costs exactly what i gave you as a ballpark figure said beckwith but by the judges order your liability comes down to cash ok questioned jordan he could settle what remained outstanding of the carlyle bill the same way and still have a lot left over he calculated enough even for a short detour to antigua cash is always ok smiled the lawyer when jordan called the north carolina house yet again stephen insisted he did not know where alyce was staying in antigua know even that she was on the island and repeated that there had still been no contact jordan decided against telephoning reid in raleigh for the number at the same time as realizing he was verging upon making himself appear ridiculous pursuing the woman as he was doing when hed explored appleton and drake before leaving for his appointment with daniel beckwith there had been no new email exchanges but it was very different when he entered again that afternoon there were two fresh broker enquiries on discrepancies on metal trades as well as the decision to alert their financial managers by the two traders whod failed to solve their individual shortfall problem and a blizzard of correspondence to and from alfred appleton including four of increasing animosity between appleton and his partner peter drake demanding to know why an inhouse investigation had not been initiated earlier it was difficult for jordan to assemble a fully comprehensive understanding of everything that was unfolding in the wall street office because of the obvious breaks in the sequences by telephone or personal meetings but towards the end of the day jordan knew appleton had ordered a total internal audit of their previous six months business upon every trader in addition to imposing supervision upon every future trade until the cause of the apparent errors was traced there were also emailed instructions with the assurance of personally signed letters to follow against allowing anything of the problems leaking outside the office to undermine the reputation or confidence of the firm any such disclosure would be investigated with the tenacity with which the financial irregularities were being pursued any uncovered whistleblower would face civil litigation for commercial infringement of the confidentiality clauses of their contact as well as instant dismissal it was time to close down jordan concluded it was still short of the time hed originally allowed himself and far shorter still of the inevitable outcome that would engulf alfred appleton jordans decision had nothing whatsoever to do with any belated regret and certainly not pity for how badly the outcome of the case had gone for the commodity trader appleton had set out to damage and inconvenience him as much as appleton would eventually be damaged and inconvenienced in return nor was it jordans fear of discovery because after todays final closure the risk of his being caught would no longer exist it was rather that jordan had lost interest virtually to the point of boredom in any future retribution jordan believed he had his priorities in their carefully arranged order and alfred appleton no longer featured on the list except for this one last explosive time from a selection of appletons personally held but unmoved trades jordan switched a total of into the account hed taken out in appletons name in the chase manhattan and in which still remained although the safedeposit box was now cleared directly after that he ordered by email that be transferred into the caribbean hedge fund that had advised him their minimally acceptable opening investment was well aware too that the chase were required automatically to report the transfer and that such reporting would just as automatically trigger the sort of official enquiry and attendant publicity that appleton was so anxious to avoid jordan then patiently severed all connection and trace of his trojan horse stables throughout every computer and ancillary linkline in the appleton and drake system after electronically ending the lease on the west nd street apartment and settling all outstanding bills electronically again he telephoned the concierge at the marylebone flat and lesley corbin just off chancery lane advising them of his return the following day leaving until last his final call to north carolina leaving with stephen the message that he was going back to england and would call alyce from there sometime in the future he managed to book a conveniently timed midmorning flight to london the following day and that night after dinner took a taxi to the rd street marina and seaplane port into which appleton had flown during his daily commute from long island enjoying the irony when judging the moment he dropped the muchused and incriminating laptop into the east river as he settled his outstanding and substantial bill in cash the receptionist said we hope youll be coming back soon to stay with us again so do i said jordan meaning it thirtythree it was a tuesday a month after jordans return to london when his retribution against alfred appleton became public knowledge with headlines in the new york times and wall street journal both of whose websites jordan monitored daily doubting that the announcement of a police investigation into the affairs of alfred appleton would be carried in english newspapers it was though in the independent and the daily telegraph when the fbi were called in after the additional discovery of the apparent hedge fund application and even then the coverage was based more upon the recent divorce that had broken the tenyear bond between two of americas oldest historical families the telegraph even carried a wedding day photograph of alyce and appleton there was a second photograph of appleton being escorted from appleton and drakes wall street building by federal agents above a company statement denying any knowledge or involvement in alleged embezzlement of client funds and attempted illegal monetary transfers into offshore funds the english coverage was short lived and jordan relied upon the continuing coverage in the american newspapers extending his monitoring to the new york daily news as the initial story grew with the uncovering of the five new york bank accounts in easy walking distance of the commodity dealers building and the west nd street apartment leased in appletons name jordans concentration remained upon any reference or comment concerning alyce which he found towards the end of the first week an unnamed spokesperson from what was described as the bellamy north carolina compound was quoted as saying that alyce was out of the country at an undisclosed location on an extended vacation from which she was not expected to return for several weeks she would have no comment to make upon that return jordan had made four unsuccessful attempts to contact alyce from england in between working to restore the far too long neglected routine in his life although stopping short of actively selecting a new persona to adopt there remained of course the already researched operation as paul maculloch in whose name the hans crescent apartment was leased and whose every personal detail he knew also existing in the maculloch name were the royston and jones bank accounts and the unbreakable rule against carrying over from one job to another an already established facility jordan accepted that he was stretching the protective rule to its breaking point but thats what restraining rules were protective and for this reason they had to be strictly observed that decision made long before the eventual tuesday revelation about appleton jordan moved both to guard his existing savings as well as severing all links to the little used maculloch identity even though in doing so he breached another forbidden barrier within two days of his return from america he loaded half the money in the royston and jones deposit boxes into a crammed suitcase far more than he had ever moved before and went directly from leadenhall street to the jersey ferry port to put it beyond any discovery or court power in the bank secrecy haven of st helier two weeks later far more quickly than any previous asset transfer jordan risked the repeated trip and crossed the english channel again with the remainder of the london money jordan closed the leadenhall street facilities and the hans crescent flat rental the same day and spent the majority of his evenings in casinos in which over the course of the four weeks he lost close to of his total stake which although he refused to admit to any gamblers superstition not regarding himself as one he regarded as a bad omen although he still collected the necessary winning receipt certificates on the that remained dinner with lesley corbin on his first week back was a highlight largely because he had so much background to recount of the raleigh hearings during which she pointedly reminded him thered been a loose unfulfilled arrangement for her to attend as a legal observer adding that shed already heard from beckwith how much hed contributed but hed declined her invitation to a nightcap when he delivered her home to her pimlico flat he paid lesleys bill in cash by return the following week and she telephoned to thank him and jordan responded as he knew he was expected with another dinner invitation afterwards he took her to a mayfair casino and overrode her protests to stake her with five hundred pounds she doubled it and he lost he declined the nightcap invitation that night too she promised to call if there was any contact from beckwith about an appeal by appleton and jordan said there was a message service with which he kept in contact if he wasnt at the marylebone flat lying that there was a possibility of his soon going on a gambling sweep through europe he did actually go to paris for the arc de triomphe race meeting briefly sorry that he didnt invite her but regretting more losing it was the publicity of the appleton investigation that brought jordan out of denial to confront the fact that hed done virtually nothing whatsoever constructive to reestablish anything like a proper working regime but that to the contrary he was positively avoiding doing so jordan used the excuse of that publicity to telephone daniel beckwith who responded at once with the demand would you fucking believe it never in a million years said jordan wondering the colour of the other mans cowboy shirt that day you heard anything about an appeal with the shit hes now covered in forget it you think he really did it asked jordan to justify the conversation the story is theyre running book on wall street you should get back over here win yourself some easy money with what he knew he could probably do just that if what beckwith said was true reflected jordan you heard how alyce is reacting spoken to bob maybe dont expect to dismissed beckwith id imagine shes turning cartwheels and setting off fire crackers in celebration ill keep in touch if theres anything jordan mulled over the idea for almost an hour before calling reid in raleigh as beckwith had done the north carolina lawyer took the call at once although more controlled theres a guy with a whole bunch of trouble the lawyer agreed the late night talk shows are competing for the best jokes ive tried calling alyce to see if shes ok said jordan honestly i read in one of the papers that shes abroad and wont be back for some time a smokescreen dismissed reid shes mostly down here on the estate just outside the city best place to be if she wants to hide which she does and she can fly in and out when she wants from the airstrip theyve got there you speak to her a lot not a lot no reason to now its all over if you do will you do me a favour tell her ive tried to call to see if shes ok that id like to hear from her there was a pause from the other end of the line ill pass it on if we speak again jordans phone rang two days later ive tried to call said jordan bob told me and before i came back he thought her voice was flat as if she were depressed stephen told me that too how are you pissed off with all the media hanging around again since alfreds arrest i guess hes in deep trouble i guess she agreed disinterestedly im thinking of coming across what for just a trip jordan pressed on i thought maybe we could meet up i told you im under siege again down here bob said you could get in and out by air when you wanted to we could get together in new york if they havent found your apartment there alyce didnt respond alyce i am going up for a foundation meeting next week itll be the first time since my reestablishment on the board it was next week i was thinking of coming over improvised jordan when will you be there tuesday onwards ill be at the carlyle again ill call you from there wednesday said alyce make it wednesday wednesday agreed jordan remembering his jetlag jordan caught a weekend flight the sunday edition of the new york times reported in a front page story that the fbi had encountered some unusual features in the appleton investigation jordan didnt once leave his carlyle suite on the sunday eating from room service and only walked as far as central park the following day it was in the park that he read that days new york times and wall street journal both of which reported without much more detail that the justice department were possibly convening a grand jury to investigate the appleton affair he reached only alyces answering service on his two tuesday calls asking her on both occasions where she wanted to eat to enable him to make the reservation but it wasnt until the wednesday morning that she finally answered personally suggesting lunch not dinner and at the hotel whats wrong jordan finally asked she was as flat voiced as she had been when shed called him in london the previous week and since then hed thought about little else but her obvious lassitude you really do sometimes have the strangest aptitude for asking the most stupid questions as you sometimes have the strangest aptitude for responding with the most confusing answers you want to call it off no said jordan urgently the last thing i want to do is call anything off i want to see you talk to you at lunch alyce insisted ill make the reservation we can have a drink first ill be waiting in the lobby again which he was a table booked in the bar as well as the restaurant the half bottle of champagne already in its cooler alyce came into the hotel with the same commanding confidence as before attracting the same attention as before although jordan judged it to be because of how she was dressed a long coated white trouser suit with a floppybrimmed matching white hat and so perfectly made up the too bright red lipstick replaced by paler pink the colour to her face more natural than applied she accepted the champagne and extended the flute for the glasstouching toast and said i almost didnt come again but now i have im glad and its good to see you and im even more confused than ever said jordan which i guess i am too and dont want to be not any longer then im glad i made the trip here because i dont want any more confusion or misunderstandings said jordan from this moment on i want both of us to understand everything know everything about the other although im not sure its going to come out as straight as i want it to you sure about that my darling jordan smiled at the word the relief surging through him i think so i think i know so and i think i should speak first before started alyce no refused jordan you spoke ahead of me when we said goodbye in france and i stupidly agreed because i didnt understand didnt know and im not going to let it happen again nothings going to be easy because of what and who you are and because of what i am although what i am really am isnt going to be any barrier because im all set for another career change thats going to get that out of the way i love you which is something i never thought id ever tell anyone again i want us to be together married together although god knows how thats going to happen but ill make it happen i guess youll want to continue living here working here which is fine and i dont want you to imagine i want to live off you and your money and your position ive got a lot of money enough money and we can give all yours to yet another charity and stop insisted alyce please stop i dont want you to go on misunderstanding saying things i dont want to hear you say although i do want to hear you say them youre not making sense halted jordan in turn then let me pleaded alyce let me talk try to explain as best i can without stopping me without stopping me and hating me because i never want you to hate me not now and not ever i know who you are harvey know what you are which means i know what youve done to alfred how i guessed you paid all the bills and didnt want my money she stopped gulping too deeply at her drink and having to cough when it caught her breath i tricked you my darling she started again tricked you and now i am so very very sorry i never intended it to happen none of it i never imagined alfred would invoke that stupid fucking criminal conversation claim never thought id ever see you again which made everything worse because i wanted to so much after france youre not jordan started again but sharply she interrupted him no ive got to finish because i dont think i can say it all a second time of course i knew alfred was having me watched here because i was having him watched long before he put his private detectives on to me i knew all about sharon borowski and leanne jefferies and had two other women if i needed to cite them but here in america he was getting too close he had to be diverted get the corespondent he needed for the divorce which is why i went to france and found you you were only ever supposed to be a necessary name to get him to pull his people off i didnt even know of something called criminal conversation or guess in a million years that you would fight it never thought id ever see you again although by the time i flew back i wanted to so very much jordan took advantage of another gulped drink how do you know what i do that extra week when i extended the vacation that was to get my own enquiry people to france those id personally employed to watch alfred not the dkk agency that bob engaged she sniggered a humourless laugh you know why i did it i did it because i really didnt want you to get in the situation you ended up in but you confused us so much back in england changing from harvey jordan to peter thomas wightman it didnt take long to work out why though then we thought youd caught us out all those evasion tricks when you went back to your own apartment she raised her hand towards him dont worry darling what you did when you got back to england wasnt breaking any american law not that id have blown the whistle on you if it did and im certainly not going to tell anyone about what youve done to alfred you keep calling me darling why do you think i wore that stupid plastic ring all the time after you gave it to me even wore it back here on the plane i loved you by then like i love you now which is why im going to end it now and marry walter whos kind and gentle and who i came to france to protect from alfreds people and who i think i love enough just enough to marry no refused jordan we could make something work i dont know what or how but therell be some way alyce shook her head it might have worked maybe if alfred hadnt sued for criminal conversation and if you hadnt beat him in court as you did somehow somewhen it would come out if we got together and when it did alfred would have every grounds for appealing the courts decision alfred would employ every private detective he could although he wouldnt need many to show your photograph to the banks in which you opened the accounts in his name and the realtor from whom you leased the apartment on west nd street that all the newspapers have identified would it and then youd go to prison which i couldnt bear and all the bellamy foundations and trusts would be disgraced because id be linked possibly even charged with complicity with you and i couldnt expose the family to that as much as i love you its over my darling its got to be over we got too clever both of us and ended up beating ourselves jordan reclined the back of the first class seat and adjusted the eye shades against being disturbed by the cabin staff even though hed already told the supervisor he didnt want anything to eat or drink just to be left alone which he was he acknowledged alone again with only himself to consider or think of which hed once considered the perfect way to be but didnt any more alyce was right of course hed known that all the time hed argued with her close to pleading with her that they could work out a way to stay together be happy together to her headshaking adamant refusal that theyd end up hating each other unable to hide from appleton which meant he supposed that in a way appleton had won after all too convoluted jordan corrected himself too much selfpity he had to accept what had happened not yet but eventually and move on as hed eventually moved on after that other long ago collapse into selfpity except that he didnt want to the sudden awareness surprised jordan confused him even and he forced himself to confront exactly what it was he didnt want any more to go on as he was doing what he did he answered himself further surprised at another potential selfimposed upheaval in his life what life he asked himself continuing the personal analysis what where was the life in becoming someone with a different name every two or three months turning some poor bastards existence on its head as his had been turned by what had just happened to him compartmentalizing everything between himself and alyce jordan recognized hed been lucky escaping as he had remaining undiscovered for what he was by appletons surveillance team harvey jordan the man who never gambled acknowledged that his luck couldnt last what could would he do then not a decision to be rushed although hed once done well enough running his own legitimate computer programming business and there was more than sufficient money squirreled away in jersey to start again there was no need or reason to rush the decision he thought again maybe something to think about refine in detail on another vacation but then again maybe not the vacation that is not the detailed consideration on his future the weather in the south of france was uncertain in october he slept dreamlessly and undisturbed during the flight and disembarked in london actually excited at the thought of doing something new the immigration officer was a blonde girl who reminded him vaguely of alyce she looked between him and his passsport photograph and said harvey jordan yes he replied to his own satisfaction very definitely harvey jordan
