palmer and my thirtyyear pals bill wilson and dr bob smith were always there when the ship needed righting prologue i know you cant believe this is happening ms coates but i assure you it is i have been paid and paid very well to kill you belle coates looked up at the intruder through a glaze of tears please just tell me what you want she said just tell me what you want and you can have it anything anything at all the man sighed youre not paying attention ms coates he said with the accentuated patience of a thirdgrade teacher i am not here to bargain i told you that im here because this is what i get paid to do but why why me belle made yet another futile attempt to stand her wrists and ankles were lashed to her kitchen chair by the sort of velcro restraints she and other hospital nurses used so often on difficult patients those restraints look amazingly simple the intruder said but i tell you they are a marvel of engineering and ergonomics no pain no marks none at all thats why i have a dozen or so sets of them in the drawer at home the man six feet tall and wiry had been hiding inside belles apartment probably behind the couch in the living room when she arrived home at nearly midnight her nursing shift to pm in the cardiac surgery icu at the central charlotte medical centerhad been a tough one and she had relished every stair of the trudge that brought her closer to her apartment a cup of tea and a steamy shower she was just choosing a tea when he appeared in the doorway of her kitchen an apparition in sky blue surgical hair and feet covers latex gloves black jeans and a black longsleeved tee she was so fixated on his appearance that it was several seconds before she noticed the huge gleaming knife dangling at his side her hesitation was more than enough in two quick strides he was beside her seizing a handful of her hair snapping her head back and pressing the blade against her throat with just enough restraint to keep from drawing blood he forced her down onto one of the oak chairs she had recently refinished and in moments the restraints were on her it had happened that fast a dozen or so sets in the drawer the statement was as terrifying as the knife was he a serial rapist a psychotic killer desperately searching for even the smallest inroad to understanding the intruder belle tried to remain calm and remember if she had read about such a man in the papers or heard about him on the news what do you want she said my fianc√© will be home any minute he fixed her with pale translucent blue eyes that were devoid of even the slightest spark of humanity i dont think so we both know about your failed engagement celebrate belle and dougs love im very sorry about that belle froze at the words quoted from her wedding invitation who are you she managed again what do you want from me now were getting someplace the man produced a vial from his pocket and set it on the table i want you to swallow these sleeping pills i found in your medicine cabinet the last time i was here i have augmented what was there with some that i brought with me tonight so there will be more than enough to achieve our goal but before you take these pills i want you to copy and sign a brief note i have composed explaining your despondency and your desire not to live anymore and finally i want you to undress step into your tub and go to sleep see simple and absolutely painless belle felt her breathing stop this couldnt be happening she wouldnt do it he wouldnt be able to pry her jaws apart with a crowbar she began to hyperventilate and shake grabbing and releasing the arms of her chair i wont do it you will i wont she began screaming i wont i wont help someone help m her words were cut off by exquisite pressure around her throat a hard rubber ball was forced expertly between her teeth and into her mouth the killer remained absolutely calm during the insertion that was stupid ms coates do anything stupid again and you will be responsible for causing both yourself and your sister a great deal of pain belle stared up at him wideeyed the mention of her sister was a dagger hyperventilating through her nose she still could not seem to get in enough air thats right the man said i know all about jillian just like i know all about you now refuse to do exactly as i say try anything stupid again and i promise both you and jillian will die prolonged and painful deaths understand i said do you understand belle nodded vigorously im still not certain you do now listen ms coates and for your sisters sake believe me i have no contract to kill jillianonly you with very rare exceptions those i am not paid to kill i dont kill he took out his cell phone made a gentle tap on the screens touch display and held it up for belle to see i assume you recognize your sisters condo in virginiaarlington to be exact bristol court to be even more exact nod if you agree that is the case good i know how close you two are you see i read your journal or diary including entries from the trip to nassau that jillian took you on after you learned about dougs how shall i say dalliance with your friend margo surgeons they are just so full of themselves arent they i see you are having a little trouble breathing okay heres the deal ill remove that ball if i get your assurance you will stay quiet and still belle grunted her agreement and again nodded the man pulled the ball out keeping his fingers clear of her teeth and dropped it into his pocket now he said what you are about to watch is a live video feedlive as in its happening at bristol court right this very instant belle stared in disbelief at the fullcolor projection the footage was unquestionably taken from her sisters tastefully and lovingly decorated condominium she was certain that the woman sleeping alone in the queensize bed was jillian also a nurse and one of the main reasons belle herself had chosen the profession following the automobileaccident deaths of their parents jillian had stepped in to raise her fourteenyearold sister often making major sacrifices in her personal life belle considered her to be the kindest brightest most centered person she had ever known the camera had been placed above the valance in the bedroom at the sight of jillian rolling languidly from her left side to her back belle began to hyperventilate again easy the man warned slow down thats it thats it please please dont hurt her the apparition holding the phone leaned forward belle cringed as his empty eyes came level with her own his pale white skin was tinted blue a ghoulish illusion cast by her ecologically friendly halogen lights you must calm down your breathing and listen ms coates to save your sisters life and yourself from a great deal of pain it is essential that you believe i will do as i say i believe i believe turn it off turn that camera off and leave her alone im going to make you a promise ms coates he whispered his lips brushing her ear i promise that if you fail to follow my instructions jillian will die and die quite horribly do as i say and she lives want proof look here he held the phone at eye level enough belle pleaded dont hurt her ive placed small canisters of a potent nerve gas above the door frame inside the closet action almost instant from this phone i can control how much of the gas is released simply by tapping my finger incredible yes i am a virtuoso operating this setup i put another camera in jillians bathroom because i want you to see what happens when just a smidge of this gas is inhaled no please please stop this i believe you the intruder paid no attention it was as if he had planned this demonstration all along belles brain was spinning how could she believe him how could she not what choice did she have would he really spare jillian as he promised why would he why wouldnt he the unanswerable questions roiled on and on if i wanted to he said as if reading her thoughts i could kill your sisteri could kill anyoneanytime anyplace and in any way i wish but the point is i dont have to i dont even want to she seems like a nice woman and as i said there is nothing in her death for me he made two gentle taps on the phones display and jillians quaint bathroom came into focus illuminated by a nightlight beside the sink and a small diamondshaped window above the tub there are four levels of gas i can administer the first three will cause increasing pain and the symptoms you are about to see the fourth will kill slowly this is level one within seconds jillian wearing flannel pajamas belle had bought for her burst into the frame fell onto her knees and began retching violently into the toilet between bouts she lay clenched in a fetal position on the tiled floor shivering uncontrollably can you believe thats only level one the man asked i think i should patent this delivery system stop it stop doing this to her belle cried keep it down or ill cut your larynx out and set it on the table im sensing you need a bit more motivation ms coates allow me to oblige by upping jillians misery to level two ill keep it on level two until you start copying this note audio is really a must to get the full effect he tapped his phones display again and now belle could hear jillians grunting labored breathing interrupted by fits of gutwrenching vomiting and sobs of pain please stop i believe you i believe you he loosened her left hand and pushed the note she was to copy in front of her start writing your farewell letter ms coates when you do ill stop killing your sister he said belles face contorted in agony at the sound of jillians unrelenting anguish please do you need more volume write the damn note the monster barked pounding the table with each word youre dead regardless but you can still save your sisters lifethat is if you have the courage to do the right thing the man shut off the gas as soon as belle began to write in just a minute jillians moaning stopped belle managed to pen the first four words before she began to sob finish he said or ill fire it up again why me i havent done anything wrong i dont even know you why do you want me to die not my call somebody in this great big world of ours has decided you have to go and that somebody is paying me to make it happen i can do it to you alone or to both of you this is insane she said as much to herself as to the man who was about to murder her this is absolutely insane i guess you enjoy listening to your sister scream allow me to show you level three the tormented retching belle heard could scarcely be described as human on the tiny video display jillians body convulsed more violently than before as soon as belle lifted up the pen again the man pressed a button on his phone and her sisters screaming stopped belle found the strength to finish copying the note im a man of my word ms coates im also very good with handwriting and i have a large sample of yours from your journal mess with this and ill dismember you joint by joint with that ball stuck back in your mouth youll still be alive to watch when i finally jack up the gas in jillians pad to level four i did as you asked let her go sign it the man studied the note with great care okay now the pills he shook the pills onto the table motioning for her to take one please belle begged still trying to make inroads into the utter helplessness she was feeling whos paying you why do they want to kill me im running out of time and patience the man pressed a button on his phone like a puppet master pulling on invisible strings jillians body again twitched with violent spasms no you promised belle cried you have the power to make this easier on jillian think of all your sister has done for you you owe it to her dont you make me stop i want you to stop me ms coates she could not listen to her sisters cries anymore her only thought was of the mans chilling proclamation youre dead regardless as though in a trance her hand reached out shakily jillians moaning abated as soon as belle swallowed the first pill please dont no more keep swallowing and thats the last time you have to hear that nasty sound ms coates belle tightened her jaw and nodded that she understood promise her voice sounded like a childs i said do you promise ms coates i might be a killer but im a professional you have my word but im going to resume torturing your beloved sister unless all these pills are down the hatch it was too much to take belle raced to swallow the pills what else can i do her mind kept asking what else can i do what else can i do the action in a way was liberating her heart rate slowed and her tears stopped in minutes she no longer felt agitated or even frightened the mans eyes once haunting now made her feel nothing at all good girl you are simply going to close your eyes and go to sleep her tongue already felt heavy you promised belle managed you have my word after a while he filled the tub then undid her restraints clothes he said feeling the wooziness from the drug take further hold belle stepped out of her scrubs and dropped her bra and panties onto the floor then she stepped into the tub i love you jillian she murmured i love you chapter nick nick throw it here come on let it go nick garrity cocked his right arm and lofted a perfect spiral to the gangly youth waiting across the yard the boy who would have been happy to keep playing until midnight gathered in the pass effortlessly and immediately threw it back okay thats it reggie i gotta take chance for a run and then get ready for work one more pass just one more after dinner ill go over to your place and take chance out promise through the gloom of what was going to be a stormy evening nick could feel the boys energy and see his enthusiasm a drugaddicted mother a longgone father time in juvenile detention for a crime no one seemed willing to talk about seven years in a sequence of foster homes and the kid was still upbeat and great to be around how in the hell do you do it nick wondered for most of the week nicks mood had been as somber as the prestorm sky and as usual there was no reasonat least not on the surfaceto explain it a night in the helping hands rv would improve his flagging morale it usually did he made a final throw handled as easily as most of the others and then motioned for reggie to come in come on big guy ive got to leave soon so wherere you goin tonight nick dc i think so junie keeps track of that can i come its a school night and you promised to deal with second chance remember dont let him off the leash or hell see a squirrel and chase it to the moon greyhounds are bred to chase little furry animals use the long leash if youre going to throw him his frisbee how about i go with you tomorrow well see i never get to do anything exciting yes you do staying out of trouble is exciting reggie punched nick playfully in the side nick put his arm around the youths shoulders and walked with him to the back door the modest onefamily with three bedrooms and a finished basement was located in the carroll park section of baltimore nick had lived there with june wright and her husband sam for a few months before renting the first floor of a refurbished twofamily down the street close to the park not long after the move reggie smith now fourteen had taken over the basement bedroom a sequence of kids were constantly coming and going through the wright household including the sixyearold levishefsky twins celeste and bethany who had been there for almost a year now if one looked up saint in any encyclopedia pictures of junie a sixtyyearold nurse and sam a dpw worker might well be there since junie would be working the rv tonight with nick her husband would be doing the cooking the couple had children of their own and grandchildren as well but at every stage of their lives together they had added foster children to the mix the helping hands rv was parked on the street by the wrights house it was an aging thirtyfourfoot mobile home converted into a general medical clinic nick loped past it on the way to his apartment at sixfootone with broad shoulders and a solid chest he still moved like the running back he had been in college before an illegal block had taken out most of his anterior cruciate ligament now the repaired knee was serviceable but hardly ready to absorb a major hit nicks father once a football player himself was a retired gp the option of moving to the family home in oregon was always available to nick but had never been one he had considered seriously in general his parents were decent understanding people though not about their only son there was no reason to expect they would be in that same encyclopedia at least in their library his picture might have been inserted next to the word disappointment this is our son trauma surgeon dr nick garrity they had introduced him on more than one occasion during the years when he was their golden child and this is his sister nearing his apartment nick heard the low rumble of thunder in the distance sounding like a truck engine slowly coming to life he tensed at the sound he always would nicks duplex would never be featured in architectural digest but that was fine by him oak floors a variety of posters from the local art store plus curtains and a few plants gave the place an airy comfortable feel he was bent over beside the mail slot scooping up circulars and bills from the floor when he was hit from behind hard enough to drive his forehead into the door he turned knowing what to expect second chance sat head cocked panting around the red frisbee in his mouth im running behind nick said rubbing at his forehead half expecting blood reggies going to take you out the dog pointed his snout toward the door and shifted his behind no go pal gotta shower they had been a team for almost two years dating back to the first and only time nick had ever been to a dog track lost in thoughts about sarah he had been on an aimless drive that ended at a casino in west virginia after an hour losing at the slots he wandered over to the adjacent tristate track he was in the midst of a particularly difficult time when selfdestructive thoughts had once again been seeping into his mind damn ptsd second chance a long shot in the fifth race and a natural bet for nick had been well in the lead when he suddenly slowed dramatically twenty yards from the finish he was trampled by seven dogs as they passed over and around him and was left nearly motionless in the dust an hour later nick and the greyhound had claimed one another at the adoption tent where the dogs sleazy trainer tried to convince the army trauma surgeon that chances uneven lurching gait was due to nothing more than a minor concussion back home the concussion responded dramatically when nick assisted by reggie sam and two army buddies cleaned densely packed dirt from each of the greyhounds ear canals of all the therapies nick had tried in his battle against posttraumatic stress disorder second chances presence in his life was the most consistently effective there were days when nick was able to fit in some calisthenics and weights before going out on the road but tonight after playing catch with reggie there was just no time he showered and was dressing in his usual work uniform jeans and a faded work shirt when he glanced over at a printout he had taped to the wall beside his bed listing the ten levels of sudsthe subjective units of disturbance scale he used to estimate his mood at any given time this evening seemed like a five moderately upset uncomfortable unpleasant feelings are still manageable with some effort progress thats all he and dr deems had decreed he should shoot forjust a little progress each day days like today even after all these years it was difficult to tell whether or not he was succeeding he spent a minute patting and scratching chance and then pulled on a windbreaker and headed out the door the thunder was louder now chapter as usual junie wright looked like royalty perched on the massive passenger seat her ipod earphones in place let me guess nick said as he eased the rv down the street and toward the interstate south to dc the temptations nope sam cooke way off not more rap yup its my main man jayz pure sex through and through ummmhmm she punctuated the statement with a seductive shoulder shake and flashed him the smile that had raised so much money for various charities that it could have eliminated a chunk of the national debt an ample africanamerican woman with wide bright eyes and what seemed a perpetual smile junie was raised in the projects of baltimore after battling a thousand dragons on her way to a high school diploma making it through nursing school was a relative breeze she had been working for the helping hands medical foundation for some time when nick returned to medicine and began volunteering first one night a week then after a half a year two when the foundation went under due to mismanagement of their funds junie did what she often did in so many crisesshe took control first she formed a taxexempt corporation with nick as ceo and herself as chairman of the board then she mediated the sale of the rv to the corporation for one dollar she proclaimed nick the fulltime salaried medical director and used his rugged good looks and history as a decorated combat surgeon to raise money and recruit volunteers but by far her biggest challenge over the yearsespecially since the disappearance of nicks best friend umberto vasquezhad been keeping the medical director afloat were gonna get wet tonight she said setting her ipod aside nick nodded keeping his focus on the road junie was good at many things but making small talk was not one of them the seemingly innocuous statement was her way of asking if he was okay and ready for their customary long night one of the many symptoms that had gotten in his way since the horror of forward operating base savannah had been insomniafitful perspiring legcramping nasty insomnia coupled with more than one persons share of lurid nightmares i can handle it he replied im tough he turned the massive wipers on against the drops that were serving as reconnaissance for the storm that was predicted to hit full force by about eight junie deciding that matters with him werent dire enough to push repositioned her earpieces and settled back into her seat from the other side of the highway lights flashed past hypnotically summoning up as they frequently did the vision of another set of headlights that was some job you did in there dr fury sir nick grins at the name taken from one of vasquezs favorite comic book heroessgt nick fury of shield now after five months most of the hospital staff and many of the other soldiers have picked up on it dr nick fury youre the one who plugged that sucking chest wound in that kid umberto nick says well youre the one who taught us how to do it so congratulations to us both listen my friend i have something ive been meaning to give you for some time but before i do i want your promise not to refuse it but promise okay okay i promise nick reaches into the pocket of his scrubs and hands over his combat medical badge presented for medical service during active combat it is a handsome awardoval an inch and a half across with a caduceus beneath a greek cross at the center overlaid on a field stretcher i take this into the or with me for luck nick says i want you to have it not only for what you do around here but for the way you do it i cant uhuh you promised umberto sighs im honored sir ill take real good care of it promise in exchange have a seegar the stocky marine staff sergeant nearly half a head shorter than nick but probably the same weight produces two long cheroots and the friends move to the front of the massive field hospital to light up nick is gritty with fatigue from what is now an eighteenhour day vasquez never seems to tire fob savannah one hundred kilometers southeast of khost isnt usually the busiest field hospital in afghanistan but today it probably has been a convoy heading to the base along main supply road tiger had been ambushed two deaths twenty casualties four or bays in continuous action all day bellies limbs heads and the sucking chest wound in an eighteenyearold named anderson nice work by umberto who never failed to take one of nicks combat emergency lectures nice work by the whole team including nicks fianc√©e of six months sarah berman also a surgeon she was career army when they met nick fairly new to a private practice in philadelphia on september had been hit hard emotionally by the tragedy and had opted out of the reserves and into active duty the two of them were as made for each other as they were fated to connect nick and vasquez lean against a humvee parked in the dirt lot to the left of the main door and savor their cigars you going to reup when your tour is over vasquez asks his dominican accent barely detectable maybe i really love the work and the guys so does sarah youve really hit the jackpot with that one doc tell me about it the guys are crazy about her and even more important they respect her shes still at it in there almost done no need to save her a cigar though nick a selfproclaimed adrenaline junkie has had three or four cigars in his life this one given his exhaustion exhilaration and the night air is the very best he warns himself against getting too fond of them sarah hates the way they make his kisses taste it is nearly am a firm breeze sweeps across the desert but provides little cooling far away near the camp perimeter a pair of headlights appearstwin stars jouncing toward them through the blackness who do you suppose that is vasquez asks inhaling deeply and exhaling through his nose he flips on his radio and calls the guardhouse this is vasquez at the hospital whos bouncing across the desert at us thatd be zmarai from the clinic down the road sergeant hes coming to check on his people from the firestorm this morning also wants to mooch some supplies off you guys vasquez out vasquez says turning to nick zmarainow theres a scary dude beady eyes bad teeth ill bet he thinks the same of you nick counters he does a good job running that place and the little store at least we have positive news for him this time the two civilian casualties are both gonna make it the lights from zmarais truck move closer the afghani is a local leader who has his fingers in most of the areas pies and often passes through security on his way to pick up supplies for the tiny clinic he runs they know him well the battered ancient chevy pulls into the floodlit perimeter and stops fifteen feet from the massive wooden door to the hospital hey zmarai nick calls out as he approaches whats in the truck i sure hope its pizza through the side window the man looks offkilter his face is tilted skyward his eyes are closed all at once he opens his mouth and begins a chilling screeching chant allah akbar allah akbar umberto down nick yells now sprinting toward the drivers side oh my god get down get down he leaps onto the running board and grabs the sideview mirror with one arm pounding on the window with his other hand just as the engine roars to life and the truck surges forward spewing sand nick sees vasquez appear at the tightly closed passenger window at the moment the truck shatters the main door with a fearsome jolt it hurtles ahead toward the heart of the enormous tentthe operating and recovery rooms suddenly sarah appears locked between the headlights nick barely has time to register that she is there to see the terror in her eyes before the grille of the truck hits her at the base of her ribs tearing her nearly in half nick sees blood gush from her mouth as she flies backward toward the ors vasquez is slammed against a support pole and driven off the running board the truck bursts into the brightly lit space scattering victims and hammering into patients zmarai hits the brakes hurling nick to the ground like a rag doll paralyzed by sarahs gruesome death nick stares unseeingly at the floor he knows the truck is going to explode and that hes about to die the image filling his mind is sarah suddenly there is a blur of movement from his right side heavy arms wrap around his shoulders and drive him backward into the base of a massive refrigeration unit filled with blood and blood products umberto glass shattering the refrigerator topples onto nick and his friend covering them both nick is semiconscious facedown under the glassandsteel appliance units of blood are torn open and their contents pour onto his head and torso then amidst the chaos and screaming zmarais ancient truck explodes the roar is deafening blastfurnace heat floods nicks face and arms then there is nothing it is more than twentyfour hours before nick begins to regain consciousness his skin is badly scorched his ears are ringing and his hearing is muffled but he can still hear the surgeon telling him that rather than leave the tent umberto had rushed back to nicks side and saved his life he is told that umberto is still in a coma and there is only one other survivor an orderly who is still touch and go there are twentyeight fatalities some of the bodies including sarah bermans have not been pieced together yet jeez marie nick junie cried i just looked over at you and you werent there its like the rv is on automatic pilot i was here nick lied flexing his shoulders and back against the chilly perspiration that was soaking into his clothes the rain had become a downpour and the rv was blasting through it into the darkening night you want to go home i said i was okay nick snapped junie knew better than to react whatever had been going on was leaving him and no one had gotten hurt the episodes had been coming fewer and farther between hed be okay on the highway this here bus is like a battleship against a bunch of rowboats she said i know im sorry he slowed the rv to forty youre going to be okay nick the nurse said in what was half statement and half query youre going to be fine nicks reply was a grim smile chapter come on gang its a simple question an atom that loses one or more electrons becomes a what franz koller bristled at the students lack of respect for their education and thought of killing themevery one of them an aerosol blast of sarin the nerve gas used in the tokyo subway attacks would do just fine the glorious image brought a smiletwentytwo perfect teenage bodies simultaneously tumbling from their chairs writhing in seizure soiling themselves as respiratory failure set in his grin broke the tension between him and the tenthgrade chemistry class at woodrow wilson high in coltin california the kids saw him brighten and a few actually smiled back again he pictured them squirming on the floor their tiny backs arched in agony mouths agape like fish on a dock madly sucking for breaths that just wouldnt come the visual made him laugh out loud the students joined in and laughed with him oh pleeeeasseee koller begged kneeling in mock desperation on the scuffed linoleum floor please take pity on your poor old substitute teacher and answer the question i know we subs arent supposed to actually teach but i really know chemistry and im determined to impart some of my knowledge to you though he was born and raised in austria his speech was free of any accentunless of course he wanted one to be there on bended knee praying before his class for some bright star to respond koller clasped his hands together and bowed his head he paused for added dramatic effect before looking up and raising one eyebrow as if to add pretty please with sugar on top it was a phrase he sometimes used when begging his victims to hold on just a little longer the class giggled though somewhat cautiously little by little he was winning them over koller was incredibly skilled at thatwinning people overespecially those he was in the process of studying for what he called a nonkillmurder that appeared not to be murder at all he laughed with the class as he rose but his laughter was not at what they were finding funny he was continuing the fantasy about their mass destructionspecifically the vision of their parents cocooned in white chemical suits coming to identify their bodies one of you must know the answer an atom that loses one or more electrons becomes the only sound was the ticking of the wallmounted clock no wonder americas world dominance was on the decline koller mused for years in between contracts he had protected his identity as a killer by creating new identities as a substitute teacher he enjoyed the deception and the teenage girls but until recently he also enjoyed making complex concepts clear he had wellsupported teaching credentials in california and florida where he also had residences at last a tiny hand third desk from the back tentatively came up the killers eyes flashed with delight all heads turned toward the back to see who it was ah ms rebecca woodorf the girl looked puzzled at his remembering her name after all what substitute teacher without the aid of a seating chart who had heard their names only once during attendance could pull off such a feat please stand up rebecca stand up it appears you are our only salvation now prove to me and to your fellow classmates that americas tenth graders can stay with the russians chinese and japanese when it comes to inorganic chemistry koller rubbed his hands in anticipation it was a game he enjoyed playing during the sometimes interminable periods between contractsto win over the class so that he was all they would be talking about after school he actually had never finished college dropping out after he was recruited by a psychology professor to meet with the people who would eventually teach him how to kill for money they were the ones who would supply him with unassailable teaching credentials he was a quick study in every area and while there was much to learn he had a head start because when it came to manipulating others and controlling their behavior he already had a phd with high honors rebecca rose her black sweater was tight against her slender frame accentuating her burgeoning womanhood in a most appealing way koller noticed too that her lips were tight across her teeth she was shy though not too shy to show pride in her body interesting mr greene rebecca said in a small voice yes go ahead give it to us may i go to the bathroom the classroom exploded in laugher rebecca glanced about mortified koller kept his expression stern and his arms folded tightly across his chest the laughter subsided only if you can tell me what an atom that loses one or more electrons becomes koller said matteroffactly there was an audible gasp and rebeccas lips tensed even more the students stared from their classmate to their substitute teacher and back trying to get a read on each of them behind his deep brown contacts koller gave them nothing to fix on in the next teaching gig the lenses would be green or navy covering his true eye color a startlingly pale blue his storebought mustache would be on or off depending on his mood koller took pride in disguising not only his thoughts intentions and facial features but his physique as well which for this job thanks to skillfully applied padding and latex looked doughy and poorly maintainedanything but capable of snapping a human neck with the quick grip and twist of one hand are you serious rebecca managed the bathroom key in exchange for an atom that loses one or more electrons koller paused just the right amount of time before breaking nah he said with a broadening grin and a dismissive wave of his hand im just messin with you of course you can go that did it the students applauded and howled even louder this time and rebecca who moments before had looked as if she were going to be sick laughed along with them clearly still uncertain and off balance she walked warily to the front of the class past the substitute they knew as mr robert greene cautiously she took the key attached to a model of a chlorine atom off his desk and moved to the door once there she paused before exiting the room and turned back mr greene yes rebecca a cation she said simply koller though not the least surprised gave her a playful bow and applauded encouraging her classmates to do the same she beamed then turned to go the backs of her thighs taunting koller as she closed the door behind her playing head games with fifteenyearolds ogling a childs ass this day was becoming truly torturous in the past teaching high school chemistry had been reasonably diverting in addition to providing him with an effective cover it was not a good idea to be a single man leading a secret life without having some sort of socially acceptable profession in addition he had never done that well with too much downtime between contracts but now the queens of vapidity youtube the internet and television had taken their toll and in most of the socalled students there was little mind remaining to mess with this was the end of the teaching he vowed from now on when he needed a diversion he would just drive out to the woods and kill something it had been two weeks since the last contract how long would he be made to wait he recalled with fondness the nurse from charlotte whom he had studied and then manipulated to ingest a lethal overdose of sleeping pills complete with a handwritten suicide note nicely done you call franz koller delivers the csi goofs would have given up searching for clues in the nurses death before the first commercial koller heard the growing restlessness behind him and knew he was ignoring the class screw them they were lucky he didnt go out to the local poison gas store for some sarin sleepers and a suicide note the woman was a magnificent nonkillmore intense than screwing a hundred rebecca woodorfs would have been belle coates first in her class at nursing school fluent in three languages was so exquisitely sexy lying there naked helpless and utterly outmaneuvered slipping away in the lukewarm water of her bathtub just watching her breathing slow and her head slip beneath the surface had given him a fearsome erection he never even had to touch her sex was all about control and how much more control could there be than the classroom door opened and closed rebecca woodorf returned from the bathroom less shy and more confident you have some tp stuck on your shoe koller said casually as she passed the girl reddened quickly glanced behind to see then stared in confusion at her teacher just kidding koller said gotcha this time the laughter from her classmates was directed at her koller did nothing to stifle it the girls shoulders sank under the humiliation as she scuffled back to her desk fun fun fun til her daddy takes the tbird away koller sang to himself he sent a portly boy named sommers to pass out a quiz left for them by their teacher they were all quiet now busily scribbling in their booklets answering questions a sixthgrader should have known ten minutes more ten min his cell phone began ringing the tone was acdcs famous guitar riff from back in black the students recognized the song immediately and looked up at koller with surprise and reverence mr robert greene was hipthe coolest chemistry teacher around their delight did not come close to kollers who is it greene one of the class toughs called out one of your biker babes i wouldnt be caught dead on a motorcycle harcourt koller said flashing back to the contract on a surgeon from chicago who rode his gleaming harley into oblivion the bolts supporting the front and rear calipers carefully modified by the master of the nonkill disconnected simultaneously at the top of a long percent grade on the interstate under the best of circumstances investigators would probably never have spotted the modification in the case of lewis leonard md a tractortrailer saw to it that there was no modification left to detect nicely done so whats the call all about harcourt asked far too loudly its nothing koller said bursting to tell the truth to the arrogant little shits but knowing he wouldnt just an alert that an art dealer i like to buy things from has posted an item for bid on ebay i get notified whenever he lists something new what are you buying a blowup ever hear of sarin stankowsky what nothing what is it then what are you buying koller glanced up at the clock four minutes before last bell want to see he asked anything but chemistry the class begged him in unison he clicked a link in his email and opened up an ebay product description and photo then he passed his cell phone around allowing each student a chance to see the wooden desk lamp shaped like an old sailing ship that was now open for bids starting at thats a piece of crap one student exclaimed walmart wouldnt carry it there were guffaws from some of the others but koller didnt react what do you think rebecca he asked rebeccas eyes were fixed on her test booklet i dont know she mumbled take a look koller said youre the smartest one in this classthe only one whose opinion i would trust the only one worth saving when the flood comes i think its simply beautiful how about you rebecca glanced up at the phone as if half expecting something gross its a very nice lamp she managed what it is koller was thinking is a job for mr greenebuckets of money for work he would happily do for free last bell sounded and koller was out the door without even looking back at his class as soon as he was back at his apartment he would decode the message encrypted within the picture of the lamp then once he had all the facts he would decide if was enough for the job or whether a million fivewould be more appropriate later that day john sykes the principal of woodrow wilson high called to say that the feedback from his chemistry classes was excellent especially f block the last period could greene possibly come in and substitute again tomorrow chapter the interior of the helping hands mobile medical unit was straight out of a norman rockwell painting every inch of available space inside the fleetwood rv was being used for somethingnotices storage medical equipment office machinescreating a quaint homespun feel which was enhanced by the white honeycomb window shades beige textured carpet and incandescent accent lighting the steamy windows and the grizzled hardened faces of the three men at the center foldout table each in a different posture each clutching a mug of coffee completed the masterpiece it was a wednesday and at this stopthe muddy lot of jasper yeos dependable used autosthat meant nick would be teaching his weekly class on obtaining va benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder outside the heavy rain was continuing unabated pelting the roof of the clinic and scrubbing the air clean after what had been an unseasonably warm day the rv was crowded so the seven men and one woman seeking treatment were using the covered bus stop at the corner as their waiting room the inconvenience bothered them little most of them were near the bottom of lifes totem pole and quite used to being put on hold inside the rv the stakes in the tiny classroom were high benefit money each of the three men needed to survive had been denied by a va review board in fact nicks credential to run the course he had started was a protracted ultimately victorious battle for his own benefits it was a struggle that had begun with a rejection by the antichrist of va claim evaluators phillip maccandliss and ended with a highlevel review board reversing the decision not long after that possibly because of his heavyhanded opposition to nicks petition maccandliss was passed over for promotion war sorry to keep questioning you doc eddie thompson said its just that this is my third go at trying to get my benefit pay im running out of steam and ive already run out of cash nick set his hand on the shoulder of the bullnecked exinfantryman whom he knew had witnessed inconceivable brutalitymany of the victims his friends i know eddie he said not even attempting to cull the huskiness from his voice i know given the flashback during the ride into dc it wasnt a great night for him to be doing the class in spite of himself nick felt his concentration begin to slip he glanced up past eddie at the corkboard wall festooned with job notices lists of aa and na meetings nightly shelter possibilities and other hints for survival on the streets at the center of the announcements was the fouryearold poster requesting any information on the disappearance of umberto vasquez the sepia photograph was slightly faded but not enough to wash away the visage of the intensely funny bright compassionate marine who was the only other one to have survived the nightmare of fob savannah vasquez suffering from ptsd at least as debilitating as nicks had nevertheless helped him to grieve for sarah and had often held him for as long as it took for nick to stop shaking even as umbertos own demons and omnipresent cheap wine were tearing away at his guts reward for validated information regarding the disappearance of staff sgt umberto vasquez last seen fort stanton park call capt nick garrity damn they make it hard eddie moaned for a reason three out of ten claims get va approval three out of ten thats millions if not billions of benefit dollars that dont have to get paid out theyll pay it if they have to but theyll sure make you work for it aint right corporal matthew mcbean added in his dense mississippi drawl but thats the way it is when i was diagnosed with ptsd i made the mistake of asking the va regional office and their lead benefits blocker phillip maccandliss to expand my claim to include that diagnosis maccandliss knew the rules and interpreted my request to mean that i had a claim previously denied the proper wording for what i wanted to do would have been to amend my claim that misstep cost me four months of tedious paperwork and that was just my first of a number of mistakes maccandliss counts on us caving in at some point and just giving up he and many of the rest of them equate depression and ptsd with weakness he underestimated meat least in that regard he did shit id give up all my bennies for one decent nights sleep mcbean said nick nodded empathetically have any of you called the emdr institute yet he asked if not lets make that your next homework assignment ask for dr deems and tell her i recommended you call you really think itll help nick hesitated did he think it would help the jury was still out on that one even so the thought of ridding himself of his torment was enough motivation to continue experimenting with the relatively new psychotherapy tool the idea of emdreye movement desensitization reprocessingwas simple enough and the technique had been used successfully for a number of conditions including performance anxiety phobias sexual dysfunction and eating disorders working with a therapist in dc once each week nick was now on phase four of an eightphase emdr program by combining repetitive eye movements with varying mental snapshots of both positive and traumatic images the treatment purported to eliminate most if not all ptsd symptoms nick was hardly a poster child for the technique though behind them the floortoceiling curtain opened a foot and junie poked her head out got a minute to check this kid nick if not for the class both junie and nick would have been seeing patients from the beginning of the evening in almost any situation the nurse could match her skills and judgment against any md or do but it was helping hands policyand that of the board of healthto have every patient checked by a doc or else by a physicians assistant or a nurse practitioner and tonight there were neither of those on duty although frequently there were nick passed out a sheet of instructions for the next class and asked his three students to check it over while he was gone what do you have nick asked as he approached the curtain junie did not pull her head back i have a kid that i think has mono did you draw bloods a mono test cbc and liver chems plus an amylase and lipase throat classic if there is such a thing i cultured it and gave him a supply of penicillin a rinse and some motrin enlarged spleen i dont think so but you know im not the best at that unless its the size of a football you done good lets see him junie did not move when she spoke again it was in a near whisper i looked out a couple of minutes ago she said and you were staring up at umbertos poster you okay hanging in there the class is a nice distractionespecially these guysbut that nightmare i had on the way here is still resonating good thing i dont have to hold a full cup of hot coffee have you tried your eye exercises nick kissed her on the forehead and motioned to the examining room im doing fine now lets go kick some mononucleosis butt not surprisingly junie was spoton in her assessment of the seventeenyearold whose residence was listed as the hotelnightbynight cots for homeless men with no major trouble swallowing and no striking enlargement of his spleen the youth was sent out with a mono sheet of dos and donts as with most of their patients the caregivers could only hope that he kept his followup appointment nick was back giving final instructions to his class when the mono patient passed by them and left followed moments later by junie carrying her umbrella im going to grab the next victim she said im thinking of stopping by dunkin donuts across the street to see if they can donate a box o joe to our waiting room out there theyve done it before like they have a chance against you a gust of chilly wet air blew in as she opened and closed the passenger side door just a few minutes later the door opened again and a short stocky balding man entered he was wearing a tan trench coat and shaking off an umbrella he was followed immediately by phillip maccandliss good evening garrity maccandliss said fixing nick with dark narrow ferret eyes may i introduce mr janus fielding he increased his volume so that anyone in the rear of the rv could hear hes with the dc department of health chapter the sight of maccandliss turned nicks stomach it wasnt the first unannounced visit he had made to the rvtwo other times over the past few years he had just stopped by to see what this operation is all about but this was the first time he had arrived accompanied were very busy maccandliss nick said why didnt you phone ahead for an appointment now that wouldnt be a very good way to go about holding a surprise inspection would it the va claims evaluator infamous among the gis for his hardnosed refusal to grant disability benefits remained in the stairwell behind janus fielding maccandliss was swarthy and thinly built and looked slightly ridiculous in a tweed walking cap but nick knew better than to take the man lightly he was devious and unpredictable except in his unswerving drive to put himself first in any situation nick sized up the moment and considered whether it was worth stalling until junies return still shaky he wondered if he could control his temper which was known to be hairtrigger when he was dealing with the confounding symptoms of his ptsd he glanced out at the bus stop waiting area but she was probably still in dunkin damn you maccandliss he barely kept from hollering out why tonight okay mr fielding nick said instead sighing audibly why dont we start at the beginning credentials fielding flipped open a dedicated leather case revealing a health department badge and a photo id facilities inspector department of health exactly what is it you want mr janus fielding nick asked recalling from a mythology course at stanford that janus was the roman god of among other things doors and gates and wondering how the mans parents could have come up with so prophetic a name i have a list of complaints that have been filed against this medical facility of which you are the owner im assuming mr maccandliss there is responsible for the complaints the forms are all in order fielding said pointedly ignoring the statement behind him maccandliss was the very essence of smug you know were very busy nick said gesturing to the three men in the dining area and out the window toward the bus stop through the unremitting rain he could see junie approaching the shelter carrying a large plastic bag and two tencup cartons of coffee no surprise even if the staff at dunkin was resistant which they had never been in the past they were outmatched to begin with fielding said id like to do a walkthrough and conduct an inspection of the way you are handling issues of cleanliness as well as your equipment and pharmaceuticals i am especially interested in assurance that the needles and syringes are properly locked theres really only room for one of you nick said id appreciate it if mr maccandliss stayed where he is or better still waited outside with the others over the next few minutes fielding made his way down his checklist without finding anything major amiss he did suggest that the isopropyl alcohol swabs be kept locked with the syringes and needles and that the file drawers holding the patient records be doubly protected against both theft and fire right from the beginning nick could tell he was reaching bless you junie he thought reflecting on the thoroughness with which she insisted they prepare the rv fielding was certifying that the sharps disposal units and the trash receptacles were to code when the front door swung open a thin unshaven white man in a sodden peacoat entered and squeezed past maccandliss who took a decent soaking and looked as if being closer than a city block away from the fellow was too close the man whom nick recognized from other visits headed unsteadily toward the aft examining room he was followed closely by junie who made enough eye contact with nick to say several things at once the most important of which was that she was worried about this latest patient nick felt the same way the man who nick recalled was named campbell looked sick his eyes were dark hollows and he had an odd tick at the corner of his mouth nick watched as junie followed campbell to the examining room then she turned at the last second and glanced back dont wait long she silently urged nick ushered fielding back to where maccandliss was waiting okay guys looks like ive got some doctoring to do feel free to wait or not mr fielding i can save you some trouble by telling you that we read the hipaa manual as a bedtime story and that our board of directors makes surprise inspections of the rv all the time tell whoever filed complaints against us that theyre wasting their time and yours ill be back when im sure this man is okay without waiting for a response nick headed to the examining room campbell who smelled like the streets was still standing shifting from one foot to the other had there been much more room he certainly would have been pacing his eyes pupils wide were darting from one side of the space to the other mike junie said sit down and let me get your coat off i need to check your blood pressure nick this is mike campbell weve met when was it mike a year ago i dont know campbell mumbled it was an overdose of some kind nick felt almost sure of it mike we want to help you give us a chance to help you were on your side have a seat up here hesitantly campbell pushed onto the edge of the examining table junie was just beginning to help him off with his coat when nick saw the wet stain six inches below his armpit glove he said simply to the nurse without asking for an explanation junie slipped on a pair of latex gloves campbell reluctantly allowed her to remove his coat the left side of his white redskins tshirt was soaked with an expanding oval of blood at the center of the stain was a twoinch slit pulse one ten pressure ninety over sixty from the beginning of his medical training nick constantly had to suppress the urge to jump in and get to work when a patient was bleeding as it was unless there were obvious indications he still could not bring himself to allow an injured person to continue bleeding while he took maximum timeconsuming precautions against aids such as donning a gown an extra pair of gloves and plastic fullface shield mike dont be frightened im going to glove and then i need to examine you and quickly where am i campbell rasped nick and junie exchanged concerned glances you came to the helping hands medical van junie said im junie and this is dr nick garrity were here to help you is this the hospital this is the mobile medical van campbell looked wildly about no hospital were on your side nick said as junie gingerly pulled off the mans shirt anything we do will be to keep you alive nick could tell immediately that there was no way this wound could be properly evaluated outside of an er and possibly an or the chest cavity could easily hold a lethal amount of blood if the blade had gone through the chest wall a lobe or an entire lung could have collapsed he was relieved to see that campbells trachea was midlinean excellent sign that for the moment at least the lung was still inflated his nail beds were fairly pink another good sign systolic pressure is still ninety junie said as if reading nicks mind hes having a few extra beats hang in there mike nick said well explain everything in just a minute no hospital campbell said again his speech marginally thicker than it was before nick carefully listened with his stethoscope there were breath sounds out to the chest wall in all fields he forced himself to take a step back the knife wound could be nothing or mortal he knew that guessing at this point was a shortcut to disaster but his clinical sense told him the wound was shallow if so the mans low blood pressure confusion dilated pupils and irregular heartbeat were out of proportion to the severity of his injury something else was going on junie could you get his record he asked continuing his exam there was no question that campbell needed transportation to the hospital and quickly the trick would be getting him to agree nick checked his blood pressure again eightyfive maybe there was more internal bleeding than he thought without asking he slipped an oxygen cannula into campbells nostrils and turned the flow up to six liters the man made no attempt to resist nick was preparing to start an iv when junie opened campbells chart and pointed to a section known heroin and benzo addict history of multiple overdoses especially meth on probation terrified of going back to prison that explains why mike is so reluctant to let us take him to the er junie said is that right mike nick could feel the tension in the mans body mike i need to put an iv in your arm to give you fluid and medicine your blood pressure is really low campbells expression was that of a caged animal in seconds nick had inserted a twoinch iv catheter into a vein at campbells wrist extra wrap junie asked nick nodded as usual she was ahead of the game draw up one of narcan and point three of flumazenil then hang a liter of saline and run it wide open he said junie unlocked the small crash cart and began drawing up the meds at that instant campbell slid off the examining table and began turning frantically from one side to the other nick shelved his plan to anesthetize and probe the knife wound and instead tried to help the addict back onto the table the exam could wait until the antidotes for the narcotics and valium overdose were in however before anything more could be done campbell bolted chapter mike campbell wideeyed and beyond reason bellowed and thrashed at invisible enemies as he charged from the examining room toward the front of the rv eddie thompson a hundred pounds heavier than the addict rose to block his path and was thrown aside like a child stumbling against the table and down to the floor sending coffee spraying from the mugs of the other two students janus fielding moving with surprising quickness reactively filled the spot vacated by thompson leaving phillip maccandliss exposed to the brunt of campbells onslaught the claims evaluator caught in the passengerside stairwell was slammed backward against the door with enough force to snap the latch and fling it open helpless he disappeared into the pelting rain landing on his back in the mire of jasper yeos dependable used autos sales lot campbell naked from the waist up stepped off the bottom stair and onto maccandlisss belly falling heavily next to him in the mud then he scrambled to his feet and lurched off toward the busy fiveway intersection by the time nick had taken the antidotes for overdoses of narcotics and valium from junie campbell was out of the van thank god she had taken the precaution of a bulky wrap around the iv nick thought thank that same god they had found a vein at the mans wristone of the best spots to protect a line if he could catch campbell there was a good chance that junies maneuver might end up saving the mans life eddie thompson was awkwardly trying to return to his feet when nick sprinted past two more strides and he was at the stairwell beyond the doorway maccandliss had managed to get unsteadily to one knee focused on campbell nick leaped off the bottom step like a hurdler the scene ahead of nick unfolded in slow motion campbell still moving forward in a bizarre uneven gait was stumbling from side to side like a prizefighter about to go down for the count but he did not go down instead he stepped off the curb and into traffic nick closing the gap between them rapidly saw the bus that was barreling through the rain toward campbell from the right his instantaneous estimation told him that his patient was better than even money to be dead in a matter of seconds but his minds eye had locked on to something else as wellsarah coming from the or moving unaware across the path of a careening pickup truck whose driver had no intention of stopping the image of her being slammed in the midsection by the pickup froze him at the curb for what seemed an eternity suddenly he broke free of the paralyzing image with no real plan fully expecting to be killed he charged into the street campbell was just about in the location between the headlights where sarah had been when she was hit but there was still a gap between the man and the massive bumper of the bus as he dashed across the road nick glanced to his right enough to see that the driver had spotted them and begun to react she instinctively pulled the wheel to her left just as nick launched himself at campbell catching the halfnaked addict by the waist the two men pitched faceforward onto the rainsoaked tarmac and slid ahead half a dozen feet past the speeding bus and into the next lane of traffic brakes and tires screeching the bus rose up on the drivers side wheels as it skidded sideways for several terrible seconds it hovered motionless the front and rear wheels on the right side well off the road its full length now at a right angle from the direction in which it had been headed nicks chin snapped against the pavement and instantly split open dazed he still managed to hold on to the two syringes the suv that had been following behind the bus spun out with its passenger side wheels also lifting off the road it smacked against the rear end of the bus the impact kept both vehicles upright and sent them skidding away from the two prone figures nick rolled campbell over the addict was unconscious now breathing slowly and sonorously drops of blood from nicks chin landed on the mans chest and were instantly washed away by the pelting rain on all sides cars had managed to stop forming a cordon around the two men campbells respirations were getting shallower and more widely spaced it was possible the problem was internal bleeding and not a drug overdose but as things were in this spot one condition was treatable one was not nick doubted the man was getting effective ventilation which meant the fourminute clock of brain death had started something had to be done first though he had to get some air into campbells lungs the addicts pulse was faint and no more than twenty beats a minute tilting campbells head back nick closed off the mans nose and administered several mouthtomouth breaths the bus driver and a passenger had hit the street and were charging across to them many others were closing in as well a number of them with open umbrellas nick took the syringe of narcan and fixed it into the iv the slight flow of blood from the end of the plastic cannula told him the line hadnt clotted off or worse been pulled out of the vein hey what are you doing an onlooker called out suppressing any number of snide responses nick emptied the narcan and then the flumazenil into campbell im a doctor from the medical van over there nick said i need someone to grab his ankles and help me bring him back to our clinic keep your hands on his pant legs and away from that wound it was eddie thompson breathless from his sprint across the street who took the addict by the armpits and snatched him up as easily as the crazed man had knocked him down just a few minutes before just take care of that iv nick said pressing his sleeve against his chin sorry about your bus maam that was a hell of a piece of driving ill tell your boss chapter the scene as comatose mike campbell was carried to the aft examining room of the helping hands mobile medical unit would most certainly not have made the final cut in any norman rockwell selection process everything in the rv was weteither with rainwater mud coffee or blood seated at their spots by the table the two remaining students from nicks small class looked considerably more sanguine than phillip maccandliss who was slouched in the drivers chair wrapped in a blanket that junie had probably provided for him his jaunty cap was gone and his thinning razorcut hair was matted with mire janus fielding stood to his right leaning against the window his expression appearing as if he might have dropped from the sky and landed in the emerald city of oz comfortable with junies ability to handle this or almost any other medical situation nick paused as he was about to head to the rear of the van sorry about that he said to maccandliss you okay no im not okay do i look okay nope now that you mention it you dont look okay at all sorry i asked mr fielding is taking mental notes on all this garrity hell be filing a report on the bush league operation you two are running here he knows as do i that every one of these unfortunate men and women would be better off in an emergency ward or a cityrun clinic i dont think that even in the weakest er in the city you would find a doctor chasing his patients out into the street you could have gotten any number of people killed and for what to save that that cave dweller well we can talk about this another time ive got to get back there and see what i can do for our patient what you can do garrity is what you should have done when that wretched fellow first walked into this sad excuse for a clinicyou should have called nineoneone nick took several steps toward the rear of the rv then paused and looked back over his shoulder you know thats an excellent idea maccandliss im glad my nurse did it as soon as we realized how bad off the man was at that instant the heavy night was pierced by the sirens of an approaching rescue squad and police cruisers well doc junie said these steristrips will hold until we can get you to a surgeonmaybe even a plastic surgeon that is some impressive gash you gave yourself nonsense this mug needs a plastic surgeon like a warthog needs a beautician let me dismiss my class and check on the people who stayed around in the bus stop then we can talk about whether or not i need to be sewn up its still oozing look do what you want theres just too much testosterone floating around here for me as usual the paramedic and emt had done a stellar job under difficult circumstances in what seemed no time at all they had gotten campbell onto oxygen cleaned up his old iv and redressed it while simultaneously starting a second one evaluated and dressed the wound in his side and begun treatment to raise his blood pressure and oxygen saturation were not going to have to intubate him at this point the paramedic said i think you saved his life by getting the narcan and flumazenil into him when you did aw shucks nick said and i agree with you that the wound doesnt look too bad stand over here and say all that again nick responded gesturing toward the front of the rv where maccandliss and fielding were preparing for the arrival of a cab nice and loud by the time the police finished at the accident scene and entered the van the cab had arrived and the two men were gone the cops grateful that no one had been seriously hurt and citing that they had more than enough statements to type up already agreed to have nick and junie stop by the precinct house on their way to the hospital the eventful stop at jasper yeos auto lot was almost over the van would be significantly late for the last two scheduled stops of the evening but their patients would probably be waiting with no particular place to go nicks three students thompson mcbean and riddick sprayed and wiped down the interior of the fleetwood while nick and junie worked their way through the patients who had chosen to remain in the bus stop waiting room outside the rain had finally begun to taper off and inside the tension generated by maccandliss fielding and campbell had begun to dissipate lost in the pleasure of taking care of patients nick felt the unique almost indescribable rhythm of the van settle back in finally with the last of the cases tended to and junie readying the exam room for the trip across town he came up to the front and sat down with his class if we had tuition id offer to refund it he said pouring himself a mug of coffee if we had tuition id double it mcbean said it was worth the price of admission just to watch that jerk try and shake you down dont ever underestimate maccandliss people who do end up with fang marks on their butts no need to tell me i know the man from way back nick felt his interest immediately perk up he knew that maccandliss had not been the one who rejected mcbeans request for increased benefits what do you mean matthew i had a buddy named ferrismanny ferris you might have run into him i dont think so im a little surprised because he hadhasptsd like the rest of us maccandliss rejected his petition for an increase in his benefits ol manny was depressed in the best of times the ruling sent him onto the street and into the bottle he went from a little room to a flophouse and finally to a cardboard village i used to visit him there from time to time then one day after a couple of months had passed i stopped by the guys told me manny was a new man he had cut way back on his drinking and left the village kept talking about how the marines had called him back and were planning to activate him for some sort of topsecret covert mission then he vanished topsecret covert mission the words hit like a missile umberto had been sitting right there at that table when he said them to nick he was a man reborn his countenance beaming ive been called back by the marines for a topsecret covert mission thats what he said maybe those exact words not long after that like manny ferris he disappeared matthew nick said has manny resurfaced since then to tell you the truth i dont know for sure except that once maybe a couple of years ago one of the guys said that manny was back on the street im embarrassed that i never tried to find him but for me life had changed first i managed to get a job then i met a terrific woman and we got a place together then i got into that eye therapy for my ptsd i just sort of let manny slide listen dont be so hard on yourself life is all about living i suppose so tell me how long has it been since you actually saw him manny a while let me think four years nick was thinking its been four years i know when mcbean said it was right after i got the job at the body shop four years give or take a couple of months it was four years ago chapter the police ruled it a suicide but could it have been murder hello all you charlotte night owls youre tuned in to wmew fm home of the rick clemmons show starring me rick clemmons the rotund dj draped in an orangeandwhite hawaiian shirt wearing loosefitting cargo shorts and a straw cowboy hat pressed a yellow button on the eightchannel mixing board cuing his shows signature heavymetal guitar theme song for those of you just joining us our instudio guest this morning is jillian coates from virginia thats right arlington jillian do you go by jill or jillian jillian with a j jillian with a j is a photographer and the sister of belle coates the charlotte resident and nurse at the central charlotte medical center who died three weeks ago in an apparent suicide from a drug overdose nurse rick im a nurse just like my sister i just do photography as a hobby once in a while i sell a piece or have a show but yes well the police called the death of belle coates an openandshut case our guest this morning a nurse currently working at shelby stone memorial hospital in washington dc shelby stone memorial hospital isnt so sure separating fact from fiction is what the rick clemmons show is all about and this juicy tale has more twists to it than a twizzler bogus suicide botched investigation delusional sister psychic connection you be the judge but you know that rick clemmons always gets to the truth so remember our phone lines are open call anytime boys and girls lets get to the bottom of this thing jillian balled her fists and reminded herself that media exposure was what she was after you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas her mother always said the weeks since belles death had been a living hell with one terrible call from the charlotte police jillians life had come to an abrupt stop and then made a sharp rightangle turn nothing would ever be the same not an hour passed that she didnt think about her younger sister and imagine what the final minutes of her existence must have been like it made no sense that belle though hurt by her decision to break things off with the philandering jerk she was close to marrying would be despondent enough to take her own life she was all about adventure discovery and a love of people even in the infrequent troublesome times of her life she had never even hinted at suicide jillian was the volatile eccentric onethe lone eagle with the spontaneity the artists eye and the unpredictable temper belle was a warm breezea zephyr making everyones life she touched feel better you lie down with dogs you wake up with fleas who in the hell could have done this to her when jillian agreed to come to charlotte for the radio show rick clemmonss producer made it clear that the host though genuinely caring made his living by being outspoken and feeding the insatiable schadenfreude appetite of his audience but at this instant having to endure the man she wished that he could know exactly what it felt like to lose somebody whom he loved as much as she did belle she wanted him to feel his stomach knot up at seeing his loved ones photographto endure a sadness so profound it threatened to stop his breathing sadly out of more than a hundred requests she had made to local regional and national media outlets rick clemmons was the only broadcaster who agreed to air her story like it or not she had to play by his rules as desperate as she was she probably still shouldnt have come but she had to do something there was no way she could just turn and walk away this was her sister her best friend somebody someplace had to know something what else could she do but keep looking even if it meant having to deal with a bottomfeeder like rick clemmons clemmons pressed mute on his mixing board then turned to her and asked you ready to keep going little lady i am jillian said adjusting her headphones we gotta share a mic remember the akg is on the fritz means you gotta lean in real close now his gaze traveled downward and jillian could feel him unbutton her blouse with his eyes she was used to men staring at her and flirting but something about clemmons made her itch to distract herself she again fiddled with her headphones and politely nodded despite his show airing at the obscene hours of am to am jillian had held out hope that clemmons would actually have someone in his audience who could help her those hopes took a direct hit when she pulled her rental car into the stations dirt parking lot abutting a barren litterstrewn stretch of highway between charlotte and paw creek the producer had said nothing to prepare her for the ramshackle trailer from which wmew broadcast when she first knocked on the rustspeckled trailer door she half expected a crazed toothless old man shirtless in his overalls to leap out and grab her she knew going in that wmew was smallmarket radio but hell this was bordering on microscopic she wondered how a photographic study of the place would fit in with her current project on americas back roads it wasnt surprising that clemmons had to resort to tabloid radio to maintain competitive ratings especially competing in such an ungodly time slot but she was frustrated to the point of desperation and it was either play this game or dont play at all okay jillian clemmons said into the one working microphone now if im getting this right some of the evidence you have that your sister was murdered is in her diary jillian paused to compose herself not exactly after the police had completed their evaluation i came to charlotte to collect her things what things clemmons asked everything photographs clothes files her computer i boxed everything up and hired a moving company to move all of her things to my place i wanted to go through it all one last time before i before i started throwing things away the police didnt need any of it according to them there was nothing for them to investigate except maybe murder clemmons threw in there was a diarymore like a journal actuallybut there wasnt much in it that i didnt already know as you can tell my younger sister and i were very close our our parents were killed in an auto accident twelve years ago when she was fourteen and i was twentyfour we lived together until she started nursing schoolthe same school i had gone to in washington during vacations and summers she stayed with me in the condo i bought with my half of the sale of our parents place exactly what did you find in this diary that led you to believe the suicide note she left was somehow bogus or forced by another person first of all i want to say that i am a psych nurse in one of the best departments in dc ive been in that specialty for a long time its my job to know when someone is suicidal and believe me rick belle was not suicidal not in the least the diary it wasnt a deeply personal fromtheheart diary more like a journal of events in belles life it wasnt locked up or hidden away i found it on her nightstand while i was boxing up her things so im guessing the diaryim sorry journaldidnt say im going to kill myself if it did you wouldnt be on this show exactly there was nothing in any of her entries to suggest that she was even in a fragile state in fact i was planning on driving down in a week all she said the last time i the last time i spoke with her was that she couldnt wait to see me but there was that brokenoff engagement that she was depressed about right her fianc√© dr doug dearing an orthopedist at the carolina bone and joint hospital reportedly was having an affair with her best friend jillian took some comfort in knowing that clemmons had at least a cursory knowledge of the facts she could handle him ogling her but only if he gave belle the respect she deserved it was also great to hear dearings name and actions broadcast sure she was depressed about it jillian answered who wouldnt be she had seen a therapist and gotten the sleeping pills thatthat she took but she was philosophical about the end of the engagement and actually grateful she found out about what he was beforejillian paused and cleared the fullness from her throatthey got married there were passages in her journal where belle wrote about feeling stronger more like her old self again she even referenced her upcoming diving trip to cozumel with her girlfriends and how much she was looking forward to it thats not the writing of somebody who would take her own life jillian had read the journal several times it brought them closer the way emails or talking on the phone had done but it was also like experiencing belles death over and over againtraveling alongside her through years of hopes joys and disappointments all the while knowing it would come to a tragic end so have the cops ever investigated this dearing fellow clemmons asked they did but he had an alibi he was with his girlfriend and out of state the night belle died then theres this wild psychic connection business what was that all about i would prefer to avoid the implications of the word psychic and just leave it at connection go on at what might have been the exact moment belle died certainly within the same half hour three hundred and thirtyfive miles to the north i became as violently ill as i have ever been it felt for a while as i was getting sicker and sicker on the floor in my bathroom as if i were going to die the horrible attack went on for half an hour or so and then simply went away just like that yes okay well the night owl listeners to the rick clemmons show might believe in such psychic connections but were here to sort out the facts and only the facts and the facts in this case at least as you have presented them so far do not lend support to your contention that she was forced to write a suicide note and then forced to swallow a lethal dose of sleeping pills i disagree thats why im here youll excuse me for saying so jillian but so far im not convinced tell me more about the journal what about it made you think belle was murdered it wasnt the journal so much as it was belles suicide note jillian said in both the note when she told me she was sorry for what she had to do and all throughout the journal belle referred to me only as j so in the journal that was just an abbreviation she used for me she would never refer to me by an initial in something as emotional as that note shed write out my name or at least jill i dont know how or why but im sure she was forced to write the note and using just the letter j was her way of telling me so thin stuff jillian clemmons said glancing down at the lifeless caller board i guess the police didnt make much of it actually they didnt make much of anything well did you notice anything strange about the things you found in her apartment anything at all jillian hesitated she already felt foolish enough presenting the psychic connection and hearing clemmons talk about the journal made most of her points sound thin but there was something else i have nothing to lose by mentioning this she decided finally in a box in the back of her closet belle had a stack of comic booksfifty or so different issues of the same kind and they didnt make anything of those either comic books i feel i knowknewmy sister very well i had no idea she was interested in any sort of comics and i told the detectives how odd that was but they just shrugged the notion off in the box right on top of the comics were several printouts from the internet belle had been researching them i have no idea why and as i said the police just didnt care clemmons glanced once more at the naked caller panel well he asked well what what were the comic books oh i had never heard of them before but they were all marvel comics called nick fury agent of shield and on the cover of several of them she had written doctor or dr period right before his name or phd right after his name maybe that means something to your listeners well it doesnt to me except that your little sister may have been more eccentric than you knew maybe she had a secret life listeners whats your opinion as if on cue a blinking light appeared on the studios small callin panel theres one jillian said forgetting for the moment that their mic was on thanks for the help clemmons said sardonically hey we got ourselves a caller hello to troy from weddington youre on the rick clemmons show whatcha got yeah this heres troy from weddington the caller said in a dense backwoods patois inwardly jillian groaned whats up troy youre on air with rick clemmons you got thoughts on the belle coates case nah the caller said iuz just driving west on seventyfour thought yer guest sounded hot figured id call clemmons looked over at jillian as though he were making an assessment offering an apology and issuing a warning all at the same time hey numbnuts he said this isnt the dating game were doing real investigative reporting here and yes troy from weddington for your information jillian coates is hottall and slender and absolutely gorgeous but she aint interested in you troy and guess what neither am i clemmons disconnected the call and cued the sound effect of an exploding bomb look folks you got opinions share em you got information especially about a marvel comic hero named nick fury or dr nick fury give it up to us you got a big woody like that idiot who just called well thats what your bedrooms for clemmons laughed jillian was glad she wasnt holding a weapon agreeing to appear on this show had clearly been a mistake the time could have been better spent going through belles things again searching for any kind of clue as to what might have happened that horrible night as i was saying she managed if you knew my sister youd know she wouldnt take her own life have you hired a pi you know somebody familiar with the ins and outs of police work who can review the case file with fresh eyes im a nurse the detective i called wanted a retainer that would have just about wiped me out in the weeks since my sisters death ive taken a leave of absence and made finding her killer my lifes purpose im hoping somebody out there knows something and has the courage to come forward and help clemmons clicked over to a second caller go youre on the rick clemmons show yeah lady why dont you come over to my apartment and ill help you do some real detective work clemmons disconnected the call and signaled for a commercial sorry even though i think its true maybe the tall and gorgeous thing was a little unnecessary ralph he called out to the producer a beanpole with a head resembling an ostrich egg what in the hell kind of calls are you letting through we aint got a very big selection rick the man replied from the tiny control booth besides you know as well as i do that kind of call is why people keep tuning in youre on in three two one and now what happened to respect people clemmons barked at his audience there was a time when you callers at least had some sense of decency come on night owls how about some thoughts about the journal and jillians theory you know tonights topic how about some comments on that how about those comic books she found doesnt it seem weird for belle coates to be collecting nick fury comics jillian looked again at the studio walls adorned with pictures of rick clemmons gladhanding with celebrities she recognized maybe she had read him all wrong this wasnt a dream gig for him he had mentioned getting fired from a much bigger station in atlanta but hadnt said what he did wrong rusted trailer or not it was starting to sound as if his concern might be genuine sorry about these callers tonight jillian he said on air okay everyone the truth is what matters most on the rick clemmons show starring me rick clemmons broadcasting on wmew fm where the weather is still the same as it was ten minutes ago when i last told ya fiftyfive degrees and dark outside clemmons signaled to jillian that it was her time to talk i think whoever killed belle knew her jillian said there was no sign of a breakin or a struggle a young nurse with an obsession for comic books dies under at least suspicious circumstances her apartment is locked up solid from the inside theories people theories a lone light on the phone bank began to blink along with a message from ralph on the small led display announcing the callers name hey there joe from monroe clemmons said nice rhyme youre on the rick clemmons show you got any fouroneone for us the caller laughed for this crackerjack no nada youre nuts clemmons for having this whackjob on joe get ready to be blown up that your real name my real name is officer you dont need my name of the charlotte pd and yeah i got info i was one of those who investigated this case and ill tell you this much this lady is way off base what are you trying to say that we dont know how to do our job no thats not what im saying at all i just want somebody to listen to the facts im presenting jillian answered her voice again husky with frustration my sister would never ever have the fact is that comic books or not your sister killed herself look we got it bad enough out there with dopers and killings and carjackings without you making things worse by questioning our ability we investigated belle coatess death we investigated it good those internet printouts with the comics were years old years she made the choice she took the pills she died case closed dont blame us for it lady blame her i i there was a click and a dial tone chapter as she emerged from the dimmed lighting of the trailer the morning sun took jillian by surprise her focus during the broadcast had been so unwavering she had completely lost track of time pausing in the weedy gravel parking lot she blinked until her vision had adjusted to the glare then she checked her watch and sighed the only four hours i could get you on any broadcast and i let you down she tried with some success to convince herself that joe from monroe was nothing more than a twisted prank caller cop or not though his words still cut and had hurt her deeply she made the choice she took the pills she died case closed dont blame us for it lady blame her in the studio she had suppressed the urge to shout names at the callers that would have embarrassed howard stern but she couldnt risk upsetting clemmons and possibly having him cut the broadcast short when the morning crew arrived jillian was in a somber mood still reeling from the horrific experience despite what had just transpired in the trailer from clemmonss wandering eye to his legion of moronic callers she still managed to pitch the newly arrived morning show producer for more airtime he politely declined it wasnt until jillian reached her rental and unlocked the door that she heard footsteps behind her turning she saw rick clemmons straw hat in hand hurrying toward her you did great in there he offered thought maybe you and i could head on down to waffletown for some eggs or somethin talk about the show and all then he winked as if he needed to make the subtext of his offer perfectly clear jillian shook her head in disgust clemmons you really amaze me you know that she replied i mean dont you have any appreciation for what i just went through in there and youre not making it any easier out here by hitting on me my sister is dead and you were my best hope for catching her killer show still might help clemmons said seeming not the least bit affected by her harsh words okay im sorry for snapping at you your show wasnt exactly what i had in mind when i wrote and asked for a spot on it but at least you gave me a chance i owe you for that but a thankyounothing more clemmonss cheeks reddened slightly and he was about to say something when the trailer door flew open and the pale ovoid face of his producer poked out got a phone call bout the show rick guy says his cell ran outta juice afore he could get through he wants to talk to our guest here wont tell me what its about jillian groaned she knew the call would most likely be crude or abusive but she trudged back up the trailer stairs anyway for belle hello this is jillian she said slightly breathless from fatigue and the short climb ah hey there jillian names roach kyle roach from out oakbridge way yes kyle do you have information for me jillian tensed at what she was certain was going to be a crude retort tough callers tnight real bottomfeeders if ya ask me he sounded like all the others and jillian was about to thank him and hang up when he added but i aint one of them i assure you i have a wife and two kids at home i listen to rick clemmons because i work the night shift at the daimler plant and those idiot callers he gets keep me laughing and awake im listening jillian said i would have called in to the show and all but my cell phone here died on me yes yes the producer told me that now what is it i think we might want to get together and talk jillian had had enough goodbye mr roach she said wait i said i was serious and i meant it jillian was poised to cut him off but something made her stop go ahead she said but one crude word and youre gone okay heres why i think we should meet i know who dr nick fury is what i served with him in afghanistan chapter when jillian arrived at the calderwood diner kyle roach was right where he had promised he would be he spotted her the moment she stepped inside the folksy roadside grill and rose from his booth farthest from the door he was wearing a baseball cap tattered along the rim and a pair of faded olive green overalls that did little to mask his expansive girth he was nothing like the crackpot clemmons night owl she had been expecting and his manner and aura immediately put jillian at ease despite her exhaustion jillian had spent much of the past day and evening awake in her hotel room pondering the link between belle and dr nick fury finally after leaving a wakeupcall request for five she dozed off twisting her brain into knots over what sort of monster could have done such a thing to such an incredible woman and how they could have done it after a brief shower she stopped by belles apartment before heading for the diner roach extended a hand to her as she neared his calloused palm was that of a workman his melancholy bluegreen eyes those of a soldier jillian coates kyle asked in a logy drawl thats me kyle roach a pleasure to meet you he guided her back to the booth and motioned the waitress for two coffees first off let me say how truly sorry i am about the passing of your sister i cant imagine what youre going through i lost quite a few buddies in the war and one real good friend but the years have taken the edge off some thats about the best i can hope for same with you i suspect jillian thanked him for his understanding and especially for his honesty after a string of reflexive i know what youre going through sentiments from friends and coworkers his remark was refreshing in hindsight her decision to pay one last visit to belles apartment had not been a wise one seeing the dark windows from the street had been heart wrenching enough her last walk through the empty rooms now filmy with dust left her sobbing on the hardwood floor the closure she had hoped for was absent and she had trudged back to the street consumed by an insatiable hunger for answers thank you for taking the time to meet me kyle jillian said heck its nothing at all i come here most every morning anyway after i get out of the plant i couldnt meet you yesterday because i was working a double sorry i troubled you to take an extra day here in charlotte it wasnt any trouble at all really as you can tell from the show im desperate for information can i get you breakfast thats very kind of you no limits you should watch me eat before you say somethin like that roach ordered three fried eggs sausage bacon two biscuits gravy and grits jillian fresh fruit and yogurt she felt herself shaking with the notion that she might be close to learning something anything that connected to belle even if the connection was a tenuous one fortyseven different issues of the same comic book set in belles closet no copies of even one other title doctor written in several ways on a number of the covers clearly belle wasnt in it as a collector the comics store around the corner from jillians place in dc had priced the complete issuance at just over a hundred dollars maybe we ought to talk before that breakfast arrives jillian said unless you can guarantee me you can stay awake after you eat it heck i was thinkin of makin the grits a double order kyle you know why im here im here because im very interested in learning more about this dr nick fury well what do you know so far roach asked nothing really jillian confessed i spent a few hours in the hotel business center googling every combination of nick fury dr nick fury n fury i could imagine all i turned up were references to the comic book character well thats to be expected like i said i know only one dr nick fury and i doubt hes going to come up in any web search roach explained see nick fury hes a comic book character all right but dr nick fury heck that boy is as real as these here menus you convinced me it was important we meet in person to share what you know why is he some sort of criminal or something do you think he murdered my sister roach laughed in a deep engaging way maam dr nick fury is a saint not a killer at one and the same time he uz one of the most caring doctors and one of the toughest soldiers ive ever known the waitress brought over their food jillian studied roach as he took a sip of his black coffee and a lengthy gulp of water before digging in for a man of war he seemed very much at peaceexcept for his eyes she remembered the serenity in her own life before belle died getting over their parents death had been such a long climb for both sisters belle had been a constant source of strength throughout the ordeal and together they kept each other grounded i want to know everything i can about him jillian said roach paused and looked beyond her she could see the years in afghanistan cross his countenance like a cloud i didnt join the army until i was twentyeight he began my skill wasnt with a gun much as it was with a wrench but i was sent out on patrol more than once did hvac work before so naturally i eventually became an army mechanic they shipped me all over the world fixing stuff did you enjoy it yeah good work steady pay saw the world i was in my midthirties when i got the call to go to afghanistanyou know right after nineeleven when we were turning up the heat on the country not that it actually needed any more heat he attempted a laugh but this time quickly gave up no matter what there was simply nothing amusing about the place thats where you met dr nick fury in afghanistan yeah roach said only his name wasnt dr nick fury it was dr nick garrity fury was just a nickname one of the grunts gave him because of his first name and it sort of stuck he was like a water bug over thereall over the place teaching marines some basic combat medicine techniques that saved lives in the arena volunteering at the local clinic working more shifts at the hospital than assigned the energizer bunny didnt have a patch on his eye like the comic book fury but man he sure was tough like him can you pass me the ketchup please jillian slid the bottle across roach reached for it with his left hand it was then jillian noticed a long jagged scar running from the tip of his index finger down past the base of his thumb and disappearing into his sleeve what happened there jillian asked well now that there is my permanent reminder of dr nick fury he said speaking between bites crushed my hand in a tool press fury was on duty spent hours repairing it a lot of hours people told me he saved my hand i was flown to the hospital at landstuhl in germany for a revision of his work they told me there was no revision needed and sent me back didnt even change the antibiotics he put me on it still aches a little when i do a double shift or stormy weather comes in but i sort of welcome the reminder of how lucky i was to have that man on duty when i got hurt now you see why i wanted to meet you facetoface i do so where is he and why do you think my sister would be interested in him roach shook his head no idea i dont stay in touch with the old crew much you see something bad real bad happened on fob savannah where we were stationed jillian saw the pain in roachs eyes intensify he set his fork down instinctively she reached across and set her hand on his can you talk about it one of the locals turned out to be a terrorista suicide bomber the guys cover was running a health clinic for the people just outside the wire fury was always helping him out with supplies volunteering his offhours to treat afghan patients and such some thankyou he got what happened did the terrorist kill fury well in a way maybe im sorry i dont understand this bastard drives his truck onto the base checkpoint has no problem letting him in hes a regular but once inside he plows his rig right through the front doors of the hospital blows himself and the truck to kingdom come garrity was there right on the running board of the truck from what we heard trying to break the window and get at the guy he survived by some miracle i heard that one of the guys he worked with saved him somehow the hospital was leveled most of the others didnt make it including his fianc√©e oh my god jillian wasnt certain she could continue the conversation she sipped some water and stared at the wall behind roach suddenly spent images of belle at her vibrant best flashed through her thoughts she wondered what nick garritys fianc√©e looked like you okay roach asked no oh i understand i think you do any idea where garrity is now like i said dont keep in touch with the old crew but i wanted to give you this thought it might help you to track him down its been in my bureau drawer since he sent it to me roach fished into his pocket withdrew a folded newspaper clipping and passed it across it was an article from the washington post about the helping hands mobile medical unit and its director dr nick garrity there was a byline but no date nick mailed this article to me a few years back roach said he was trying to raise money to keep this rv on the streets its like a roving clinic helping downandout folks get decent medical care thats nick ive heard about this programeven thought about volunteering at one point i sent him what i could a hundred if i recall right i would have sent more if times werent so hard im sure he appreciated any amount you could manage is the rv still in operation do you think garrity is still in washington its possible like i said havent been in touch with him since i wonder what the connection between garrity and belle could be she left dc right after she graduated i can see her volunteering on something like helping hands but she wasnt licensed yet when she left for jillian stopped midsentence when her cell phone began ringing excuse me she said retrieving her flip phone from her purse her brow furrowed when she didnt recognize the number hello the reception was weak and between the bad connection and the din of the diner it was hard for her to hear this is scott emberg who emberg scott emberg he said louder im the president of our oak grove condominium association oh jeez scott yeah is everything all right not exactly there um was a fire last night a big fire oh god she exclaimed is everybody okay was anybody hurt everybody is fine thank goodness two units suffered minor damages but im afraid yours was where the blaze started much of it was destroyed destroyed yes especially the first floor the fire inspectors are going over it now im really sorry jillian i would have called you sooner but the cell phone number we have wasnt the right one i had to wait until i could get it from the management company i didnt see the second floor but theres nothing left on the lower level nothing at all chapter jillians heart sank as she stared in disbelief at the devastation that for six years had been her condominiumthe first place other than her parents that she had ever owned the front door to her unit had been hacked away and the entryway marked off with yellow plastic ribbon she leaned against the scorched brick to keep herself from collapsing if it werent so tragic condo association president scott embergs assessment of the damage would have been laughable the walls werent blackened as he had described most of them on the first floor at least were simply gone only the support struts remained though those were transformed into something akin to the logs burned nearly to charcoal and ash in a fireplace mountains of dark soot littered with unrecognizable forms created an alien landscape across the living room jillians throat tightened as she gazed at the large pile of debris in the centerbelles things packed in carefully labeled cardboard cartons and now just so much soot im sorry baby her words were a muffled whimper im so sorry jillians nostrils filled with the acrid stench of burnt plastic and vinyl her lungs felt raw bile percolated into her throat for five minutes she knelt on the ash and sobbed finally she rose and took several cautious steps inside the stack of nick fury comic books had been incinerated it had been stupid not to leave them someplace safer jillian glanced about and laughed ruefully at the irony of that thought there was nowhere saferat least not in her world the comics had seemed unusual for belle to have but not that significant what else had been lost that might have shed light on belles killer she wondered she felt no compulsion to sift through the charred remnants to prove what she knew in her heartthere was nothing left at the doorway to the combination sunroom and studythe only significant addition she had made to the placejillian spotted the vshaped burn pattern just above the gnarled metal baseboard heater according to emberg the fire inspector had pegged that spot as the source of the blaze a subsequent call by her to the arlington fire department supported that conclusion according to the chief it had taken investigators only a few hours to rule the conflagration accidental the clothes inside a plastic bag left up against the electric baseboard heater had ignited setting a nearby stack of similar bags ablaze as well as a wastebasket and its contents the telling signs the chief explained were the uniform vshaped burn pattern and lack of any trace evidence of an accelerant despite there having been a lot of green plastic storage bags around from the move jillian was almost certain she had not left any of them near the baseboard and had turned off the heat before leaving for the airport or had she she hadnt been thinking clearly since belles death and in the rush to make the flight to charlotte who knew what details she might have overlooked the weather had been unseasonably cool lately and the study beautiful as it had been seemed to accentuate extremes in temperature if only it had been warmer perhaps this would not have happened wondering if the damage to the upstairs had been as total as that around her jillian checked the ceiling the panels had melted away exposing blackened wiring and support beams miraculously however the exposed floorboards though scorched and streaked black with soot seemed intact in most spots perhaps the upstairs wasnt as badly damaged as emberg had indicated jillian was musing about the safety of what remained of the stairs when she heard footsteps descending from the second floor hello she called out hi there a cheerful male voice replied from above i thought i heard someone come in the stairwell leading to the top floor curved to the right making it impossible for jillian to get a clear look at the man until he was almost to the bottom step he wore sootsmeared tan coveralls with yellow and silver reflective tape wrapped around the arms and ankles a bright yellow hard hat and heavy wellworn construction boots he removed his helmet as he neared revealing a mane of thick silver hair i didnt realize anybody was going to be here she said neither did i the man responded sorry about that i hope i didnt startle you too much he navigated his way over a debris pile and pulled off his work gloves to extend his hand to her names regis paul regis im a fire investigator with atrium insurance she took his hand which felt smooth and cared for his grip was firm jillian coates she said i live lived here regis quickly glanced about im sorry ms coates i really am this is a terrible thing to have happen jillian liked regis for saying that worse than you could ever imagine she replied but scott emberg the president of the condo association made it sound like the damage here had already been inspected oh gosh i apologize regis said his hazel eyes earnest im a very trusting person so thats probably the reason im always forgetting to show this i should have it hanging in plain sight but i never liked things around my neck he reached into the breast pocket of his coveralls pulling out an id badge hanging from a metal beaded lanyard he presented it to jillian who glanced at it the photo didnt nearly do paul regis justice atrium isnt my insurance company she said ive been hired to perform an independent investigation of the premises regis explained you might not be an atrium customer but your condominium association is why did the condo association contract you to investigate ive been told the cause was already established oh yes the burn pattern above the heater in your office it appears that they are right on the money arson investigators usually are were quick but careful atrium has several of us experienced inspectors on the payroll mostly guarding against home or business owners who hire a pro to defraud their friendly neighborhood insurance company every once in a while we find something the local departments inspectors have missed that points to arson in that case even if its someplace modestno offenseweve earned our keep i see jillian said feeling a great emptiness and suddenly not anxious for paul regis to leave i didnt realize insurance companies had their own fire investigators they all do theyll doublecheck anything thats threatening to cost them money thats why so many of the biggest buildings in so many cities have insurance companies names on them regis smiled but jillian abandoned a brief attempt to respond in kind she had no relatives in the city but half a dozen of her friends would be happy to take her in probably more most of them had already extended kindness to her by planning the funeral bringing food and staying over with her it made her sad to think of having to impose on them again it was hard to believe that before the horrible call from the charlotte police she was happy and fulfilled almost every minute of every day regis seemed to have maturity and a genuine air of compassion maybe they could go and sit for a cup of coffee before she decided whom to call you look a little pale he said do you need to sit down no im okay actually theres a bench on the lawn out front if you have time maybe we could sit down there for a bit regis took her by the elbow and guided her out through what had once been the portal to her home twilight had nearly given way to a cool breezy night jillian decided she would find a hotel and deal with everything else in the morning im really sorry about your place regis said again thanks its just stuff i know but it was my stuffmine and my sisters i wasnt told that someone else lived here its just me my sister died three weeks ago oh thats terrible she lived in north carolina i was storing all of her things before i decided what to do with them now theyre gone in my line of work regis said the first lesson you learn and learn quick at that is things are replaceable but people arent im grateful that nobody was hurt or worse its just that jillians eyes began to well she took a minute to compose herself these things were all i had to remember her by our parents passed away a few years ago in a car accident its a strange coincidence regis said but i lost my sister too im so sorry paul im not telling you this to make you feel bad for me or anything regis continued just wanted to let you know that i understand how hard this must be for you my sisters death has haunted me my whole life in fact shes the reason im a fire investigator was she killed in a fire exactly regis said staring off at the condos across the walkway i was away at college when it happened she was only sixteen living at home it was arson jealous boyfriend threw a gasoline bomb into her bedroom window while she slept she didnt have a chance ever since that ive been fighting fires or investigating themfirst for various fire departments and for ten years now as an independent contractor thats a horrible story just horrible at least i can say susannah didnt die in vain ive helped police catch a bunch of arsonists im very good at what i do lot of times i find evidence of arson that town or state investigators miss jillian could see the mans eyes beginning to mist thats good for you paul and im sure what you do makes every day that much easier it does somebody murdered my sister too forced her to write a note and then take an overdose of sleeping pills and im not going to rest until i catch whoever did it i dont want belles death to be in vain either ill pray that you succeed thank you impulsively jillian turned and gave regis a grateful hug he returned the embrace but broke it off when she did his shoulders felt tight and powerful and in spite of all she was going through or possibly because of it jillian felt a slight spark well he said im actually all done with my walkthrough his voice rose as if he were about to say something further jillian did not want him to leave and barely kept herself from saying so i appreciate you taking the time to explain things to me she said instead you know im really glad to have been here when you came their eyes met and for several moments jillian held his gaze thank you she said youve made me feel much better look its getting dark out i wouldnt hang around here much longer if i were you okay ill come back tomorrow and check the upstairs just be careful the floor looks okay but there may be weak spots id help you but i actually have to drive up to philadelphia for an inspection i im really pleased to have met you jillian said you are very empathetic i left my cards at home per usual jillian but id be happy to give you my number if youd like his eyes really are quite remarkable i would like that she said writing her cell phone number on the bottom of the notepaper he had handed her and passing that half back to him expect to hear from me she gave fleeting thought to kissing him then and there but finally managed to pull her gaze away thank you paul thank you for everything dont mention it he said with an understanding smile ten blocks away after pulling his unmarked rented van to the curb the man who called himself paul regis reached into the pocket of his coveralls to caress the smooth steel of the two small gas canisters he had extracted from their hiding place in the closet of jillian coatess upstairs bedroom beside them in his pocket were the topoftheline surveillance cameras and microphones he had also removed from the condo jericho the code name used by the organization who had hired him had violated the most basic tenet of their agreement no intervention what a stupid thing for them to do rule number onerule number everything franz koller works alone good thing the second floor hadnt collapsed onto the first the canisters and spyware would be in an evidence bag and someone would have connected the coates sisters good thing he had been his usual professional self in concealing the vgas and the surveillance cameras and microphones koller pulled off the hollywoodquality silver wig and removed his contacts jealous boyfriend he said laughing out loud the canisters of nerve gas and the surveillance equipment had been in a safe spot above the inside of the closet door frame and in the curtains it would have taken an almost inconceivable piece of bad luck for jillian coates or anyone else to have discovered them before he had the chance to get back and remove them then whoever made decisions for jericho had to go and nearly burn the place down they would have hell to pay for doing something that stupid everything could have been ruined if he had not been so busy and had even remotely suspected jericho might panic and break their agreement he would have gotten out to jillian coatess condo right after belles death to remove the stuff he had placed there good thing paul regis insurance company fire investigator had gotten mobilized to act and act quickly now it was time to deal with the idiots who had nearly blown everything from the beginning koller suspected jericho was connected in some way with the cia but in truth he didnt care so long as the payments made it into his accounts now he cared and jericho whether it was agency or someone else was going to pay koller skipped to sympathy for the devil on the stones cd he had been listening to and breathed in a few more minutes of his success who knew perhaps a roll in the hay with jillian coates was in his future she was certainly goodlooking enoughmore than goodlooking enough of course thanks to jerichos poor judgment if she persisted in disbelieving the nonkill of her sister she might earn a nonkill of her own somewhere down the line reflexively he stroked the canisters again nicely done he said chapter i understand that you fell down the sloeeyed er doctor whom nick suspected was just a few years removed from her spring break party days peered at the gash on his chin through thick magnifying glasses after studying the wound from every conceivable angle she still did not seem ready to make a stitch it was as though his flesh were a block of uncut marble and one false tap would render it pebbles go ahead and sew dr baker nick said finally theres nothing to worry about besides this is going to leave a character scar that will only enhance my reputation as a man of mystery the woman laughed uncomfortably whoever put those steristrips on did a masterful job she said it was our nurse she has that woeful condition where shes very good at everything i thought about just leaving them on i know but she insisted and shes very good at that too the woman looked bewildered seeing as were fellow doctors she said you can just call me amanda and im sorry for seeming a bit nervous here im rotating through the er on my way to a residency next year in psychiatry i dont understand why they insist we do a primary care internship except so they can fill in the coverage and oncall schedules and charge for what we do suturing up a trauma surgeon has never been a career ambition of mine feels a bit like baking a pie for martha stewart excuse me for saying this dr amanda but youre not exactly bubbling with confidence here how long have you been doing er two weeks then youre ready doc just think of me as a pillow and sew away banter lighthearted humor who is this man and what have you done with nick garrity nick knew the answer after four years a crack had appeared in the wall of frustration and uncertainty surrounding umbertos disappearance a gi with a story similar to umbertos had disappeared and subsequently surfaced again he had almost nothing by way of clues as to where marine corporal manny ferris might be but whatever it took if the man was alive he would find him ive been called back by the marines for a topsecret covert mission the statement resonated in his mind as amanda baker painlessly numbed nicks chin four years four years without a word now suddenly there was hope by the time the second stitch was in the future psychiatrist was utterly focused on the job and humming softly her hands trembling slightly as she put in the local anesthesia were bedrock solid now the youthful innocence and uncertainty he had observed in her earlier were gone as well nick sensed that she was going to be a capable doc whatever specialty she chose during his own residency he often questioned the absurd amount of responsibility thrust upon new trainees now that thought segued into images of the soldiers he served with at fob savannah many quite a bit younger than amanda the thought put a damper on his mood done baker chirped fifteen stitches sevenoh nylon with three sixohs thrown in just to secure the suture line looks pretty spiffy if i do say so now for some steristrips to keep the tension off and the real mystery about you will be whether or not you ever cut yourself at all told you not to worry five days sutures out in five days five days it is nick said unable to fully cull savannah from his thoughts listen dr amanda one of our patients from the medical van michael campbell was brought to the er a few hours ago i heard he had been transferred to the fifth floor of the grossbaum building but i dont know which room of course she said nick followed amanda over to her desk where she dialed the floors number this is dr amanda baker in the er you have a patient named michael campbell could you tell me his room number fiveohtwo thanks ask her if any police have been in to see him nick whispered pardon amanda shot him a puzzled look please ask have the police been in to see him yet no okay she covered the receiver and whispered to nick apparently a police officer is on the floor now thanks nick replied i gotta run he headed out of the er then called back over his shoulder you did a great job doc nick followed the signs directing him to the grossbaum building the fifth floor was a stepdown unit for intensive care patients being transitioned onto medical or surgical floors or who would have been admitted to the icu had there been space campbells room was the last on the right there was no police officer in the hallway suggesting the officer was already inside his room nick knocked softly and entered campbell on his back was restrained to the bed by all four limbs a uniformed female police officer stood at his right nick was glad to see the addict hadnt required endotracheal intubation but he did have a laryngeal mask airway in place helping to provide some mechanical breathing support the surgeons at city hospital had done a ct scan and apparently decided the knife wound had not caused internal damage that would require an exploratory operation campbells eyes were open but glazed his expression was an intense mix of fear and confusion who are you the woman a stocky brunette asked her brass name tag read sampson and her expression said there were an infinite number of places she would rather be than where she was dr nick garrity from the helping hands mobile medical unit he answered mike here is one of our patients you the one who reported this guys knife wound nick could see campbell stiffen actually no nick said that must have been someone here in the hospital you know its mandatory to report all stab wounds gosh i thought it was more mandatory to save the patients life i did help to do that sampson glared across at him he had six inches and at least twentyfive pounds on her but he had little confidence that he could have taken her in a fight and no confidence at all that she would not like to try and find out can we remove this contraption she asked gesturing at the airway i need to talk to him i cant answer that question officer except to say that im a surgeon and if i went to the trouble to put a laryngeal airway in someone i wouldnt want it taken out but youre not the one who put it in right let me guess officer you majored in community relations at the academy i think its time for you to leave dr important and i think my role is to remain here with my patient just as it seemed sampson was about to leap across the bed at nick the door burst open and a bulldozer of a man stuffed into a tweed jacket wearing a crinkled blue shirt and redstriped tie stepped inside the veins on his tirethick neck pulsated and his face was flushed with anger im detective lieutenant don reese mpd which one of you idiots is fucking up my case the detective reached into his jacket pocket and flashed his badge who are you he growled at nick im a doctor im not from this hospital i work on i dont care if you work on the good ship lollipop did you have a hand in this mess not really i only reese even more furious cut nick off again and turned back to sampson i want your district i know every goddamn commander and captain in every police service area do you know what youve done sampson paled hey im not talking to dr eric the red over here reese snapped pointing his thumb at nick youre the cop i asked you a question i im with the fourohfour she stammered the fourohfour commander trudy sandoval shes not going to be happy with this not at all do you know what you just did sampson shook her head lieutenant she said regaining an ort of her composure im just trying to make a report and probably an arrest here well itll be the last bust you make for a while if you do why is that because this guy here with the knife hole in his side is an undercover cop working my case and you are about to flush two years of wiretaps and judicial hoopjumping down the toilet shit sampson muttered well what do you want me to do now either go get primped up because you are about to make the six oclock news for blowing a major narcotics investigation or just walk away and let me see if i can fix what you might have already broken the woman did not take long to decide thanks for not making a big deal about this lieutenant she grunted on her way to the door you can thank me for saving your career later reese replied that goes for you too dr doolittle out nick followed sampson down the hall to the elevator she made no attempt to keep the door from closing in his face before he could get on he waited until he heard the car start down then returned to room where reese was waiting in the hallway that was some performance don he said shaking the burly detectives hand really impressive stuff i guess we can finally call us even now hell no youve got a long way to go and a lot of favors to collect before ill call us even what about that fancy gps unit you fixed us up with after those kids heisted our rv and took it for a joyride not even close its not every day a cop smashes his car into a rolling medical clinic during a drunk blackout you saved my badge and maybe my pension by letting me sleep it off in the back room of that bus of yours and not reporting the accident i did what felt right junie vouched for you and you agreed to pay for the damages and to hook up with two of our aa pals three years now i got my threeyear medallion to prove it reese held up his key ring and let nick squeeze the ornate bronze coin he clasped nicks shoulder and led him into the room you just made it that much easier for me to do the same sort of thing for the next guy nick said okay were not even i own you forever isnt that how it is with the chinese no matter i sure do appreciate you getting here so quickly campbells on parole so it was important that officer sampson not bust him i promised him but one of the admitting staff here dropped a dime tomorrow or as soon as hes with it enough to listen he becomes that next guy i was talking about im gonna try and make him the same deal i made you only he may have to go away for a couple of weeks if we can find a way to pay for it got that mike campbell nodded weakly youre a good man doc reese said a hell of a good man im glad you feel that way don because i need another favor name it ferris manny ferris marine corporal medical discharge maybe seven years ago around thirtyfive five nine hair black eyes brown skin maybe some sort of brownwhite mix has spent time in cardboard villages and flophouses last address unknown but ill be starting work on that as soon as i get home reese checked his watch im off tomorrow he said scheduled to go fishing with my cousin been really looking forward to it i need to find him yesterday nick said chapter franz koller waited on the edge of the bed for the girls to arrive his dell laptop glowed ghostly blue in the otherwise dark motel room he had connected his pc to the internet and even logged in to his ebay account but he was not yet ready to contact jericho a phrase he once read in a wall street journal article about unfortunate emailing incidents had stuck with himit was headlined ready fire aim it would be stupid he knew to message his employer while his emotions still ran hot the killer placed the pads of three fingers just below his wrist crease to check his radial pulse again sixty beats per minutestill way too high when he was truly relaxed truly in control of his emotions his resting heart rate would be forty or even less he expected the girls would help him to achieve that state patience he cautioned himself patience he would wait as long as it took for his anger to fully subside before responding to the illconceived reckless torching of jillian coatess condominium only then when he was in what he called his alpha state would he compose his message encode it within the pixels of todays ebay itema tacky handpainted nutcrackerand then post the nutcracker to his ebay auction account steganography the art and science of writing concealed messages documented examples of steganography dated back to ancient greece when waxcovered wooden tablets kept coded messages hidden from the enemy koller had first been exposed to it in a college course but over the succeeding years he had taken aspects of the craft to the point where he could have earned millions in licensing fees had he not preferred to use his custom software to plan execute and be compensated for nonkills the latest version of kollers steganographic technique was akin to taking the most sophisticated coding technology available and dosing it with steroids he still couldnt wrap his mind around jericho burning down jillian coatess condominium without consulting him first he had made it clear when jericho first approached him about a series of new contracts under no circumstances were his clients ever to engage tail touch or even breathe near anybody associated with the job without his authorizationand that authorization was simply not going to be given obviously the sister of one of the marks fell into the associated with category the more he dwelled on it the more agitated he became where were the girls wearing only a white terry cloth robe koller rose from the bed and powered through two hundred pushups on the gritty motel carpet without breaking a sweat he meditated fifteen minutes afterward before checking his pulse once again fifty better but still not good enough he could not remember the last time he had lost his temper to this extent he was upside down and naked performing a motionless headstand one of the countless yoga positions he could execute to any yogis satisfaction when he heard a soft knock on the door dropping to the floor with catlike grace koller crossed the room without bothering to dress a quick check through the peephole confirmed it was the escorts he had hired the tall hooker with ebony skin he knew as sandy he had hired her before and offered to triple her usual fee in exchange for her cooperation this night the short blonde accompanying her was a relative newbie not yet out of her teens she would be perfect he decided good evening ladies koller said motioning them inside and turning on one bedside lamp the cool evening air washed over his body igniting his senses the night smelled of action koller watched the blonde glance down at his penis as she passed he closed the door behind them with a soft click then doublelocked it do you like what you see he asked the blonde the girl nodded and smiled with artificial shyness cant you speak bitch koller snapped darlene can speak just fine sandy said koller crossed the room and kissed the tall dark woman hard on the lips then he drew her hand down to help him become aroused did i ask for your opinion he said suddenly grabbing her by the hair but focusing on the other whore did i no baby sandy said you didnt ask me nothin thats right i didnt koller said sweetly releasing her okay listen up ladies the game is simple i pay you do sort of like simon says you do what simon says and the night is going to be very much fun mess up and fun will be a little more elusive either way i promise you one thing our evenings going to be memorable isnt that right sandy simon aint never hurt me bad darlene honey an we been friends a long time now besides whatever happens hell make it worth your while sandy peeled away her knockoff burberry trench coat revealing only a black bra and panties at kollers request she had on her stiletto high heels as well the killer savored her long toned legs flat stomach and sensual dark skin in front of the closed drapes darlene held her own coat tightly across her slender frame sandy moved to where she was standing darlene sweetie you aint got nothing to worry about ya hear she whispered he scares me the blonde whispered back but not quietly enough koller heard her he grabbed her by the arm hard enough to make her cry out in pain then he threw her onto the bed as if he were tossing a pillow the womans overcoat flopped open revealing per instructions only a garter belt and mesh stockings her breasts would need implants in a few years he thought but at the moment they were schoolgirl perfect now it was time to see just what she was made of koller was becoming more aroused he sat down on the mattress next to darlene and began to stroke the womans fine straw blond pubic hair shaved in a landingstrip style sandy baby he said you go into the closet and grab my black canvas bag and bring it to me dont open it though i got surprises inside koller kept his eyes locked on darlene her fear was easy to see he could feel his pulse slowing sandy returned carrying the black canvas bag and climbed onto the bed behind koller she placed her hands upon his shoulders and began to massage him rubbing her long delicate fingers down and across his bare chest teasing his nipples darlene gazed up at them unable to keep her body from shivering as though shed just been pulled from a river whatchu freakin about girl sandy snapped take off your stockings and lets do our job hold on a second love koller said give me the bag koller took the bag from her as he got up off the bed then brought it to the small desk and opened it while keeping his back to the bed from inside he withdrew four velcro restraints turning he showed the women darlenes eyes widened but sandy just giggled koller strode back over to the bed now with a full erection his eyes were a wolfs locked on darlene the girl was beginning to hyperventilate he checked his wrist for five seconds fifty maybe fortyseven straddle her koller commanded sandy then he reached beneath the bed and pulled up a length of nylon rope he had earlier tied to the frame sandy you didnt say anything about ropes darlene managed take it easy on her baby sandy cooed to koller remember shes sort of new at all this with his hand wrapped firmly around darlenes neck koller bound the teens wrist with the velcro and tied the restraint to the cord in seconds he had repeated the maneuver with her other wrist and both ankles the knots were impossible to undo without help koller nodded sandy away then he stroked the girls breasts until her nipples responded almost in spite of themselves the horror he saw in her eyes was blessedly pure almost palpable fortyfive if you scream youre going to die koller whispered his lips brushing her ear dont you dare move do you understand me sandy help me koller raised a finger to keep sandy from responding i asked if you understood yyes i understand the master of the nonkill pulled a fifth length of rope from beneath the mattress at the head of the bed then knotted it firmly about the teens neck finally he opened the black bag once more and withdrew a bowie knife with a nineandahalfinch blade a pair of large pliers and three brown glass bottles which he held up to the lamp to ensure they were full of whatever liquid they contained finally he rose and moved to his laptop computer his erection was now fully tumescent and his demeanor magnificently calm koller could see darlenes reflection in the threefoot mirror hanging above the desk he watched unblinking as she tested the ropes her sobs and strangled breathing were a symphony to him he checked his radial pulse again an even forty alpha state the young whore had served her purpose he was ready to write he motioned sandy down between his legs and made only the faintest murmur of pleasure when she took him in her mouth koller never averted his eyes from the mirror and the reflection of darlenes terrified tearstreaked face opening a graphic file he had stored on his laptop koller ran a picture of the wooden nutcracker through his encryption program his software named demaratus for the spartan king known for his innovative use of steganography was coded to his exacting specifications by some of the most powerful minds in computer cryptology the application electronically prompted him to type his message he no longer felt the compulsion to reprimand jericho for its unacceptable behavior he was far too relaxed for that instead he wrote you broke the rules of engagement mistakes will not be tolerated the consequence is a new bid post now this is nonnegotiable the words he knew were perfectdispassionate but accommodating his demands would be met any alternative as jericho was well aware was unacceptable jericho would comply or find someone else and when it came to orchestrating murder that appeared to be due to accident natural causes or suicide there was franz koller and there was everyone else koller saved his message and instantly the image of the nutcracker reappeared where seconds ago his words had been to decrypt the message required the matching keya version of demaratus that was customized for each client using his ebay account name chemluv koller posted the nutcracker for bid jericho was instantly alerted that a message from the assassin was awaiting a reply five minutes passed sandy worked vigorously to bring koller to climax while darlene had acquiesced to her mattress prison a message alert bubble popped up on the dell laptop screen guvnerpoppins the code name he assigned to jericho had listed a new item for bid koller clicked on the link and opened up an auction page on ebay the item listed containing jerichos response was a stanley hammer and some nails the irony of the chosen products was not lost on him the genius of his communication protocol was that every auction was authentic somebody would eventually be the highest bidder for the hammer and nails it would then be shipped to the winner from a blind post office box simple koller downloaded the image and ran it through his decryption program the return message read simply understood then koller bidding as chemluv made an offer for the hammer of he smiled after placing it he had just upped the fee for his next nonkill by half a million dollars he doubted jericho would make such a mistake again koller pushed sandys head back freeing himself from her mouth dont you want me to finish baby no koller said i have some business to attend to he moved to the bedside and hefted the huge bowie knife in his hand no darlene rasped the rope constricting her vocal cords please no sandy made a move forward but koller stopped her with a wave of the knife then with his erection even larger than when sandy had been performing fellatio on him he straddled the blonde and with four perfectly placed strokes severed the ropes finally he kissed each whore on the forehead and stepped back from the bed simon says go home he said chapter second chance was asleep on the love seat in the study in his favorite positionon his back with all four spindly legs pointing straight up at the ceiling nick had showered dressed and shaved and was ready for the nights rounds in the rv but mentally he was still scouring the city streets for manny ferris initially the possible breakthrough in his search for umberto had dropped his sud score to a rare two a little bit upset but not noticeable unless you took care to pay attention to your feelings and then realize yes there is something bothering me now frustration had pushed his number up to a five posters had been taken down and maps of washington dc and baltimore covered a good portion of the floors and walls of the study in two days of dedicated searching he had canvassed all of the most unsavory neighborhoods back alleys flophouses and cardboard villages where manny ferris might be found dotting his maps were carefully placed colorcoded pins each representing a city street that needed to be searched again he used a highlighter to trace the miles of pavement he covered questioning every store clerk loitering kid and homeless person along the way nothing ferris was either the most determined hermit in the world or in the four years since making his big announcement to matt mcbean he had traveled on but to where detective don reese had fared no better even though he had given up his fishing trip to search manny ferris is not in dc was his terse conclusion that was when the bounce in nicks mood had leveled off and begun to slip to his dismay the department of veterans affairs was as tight about disclosing last known addresses of their vets as it was about paying out ptsd benefit claims they would not even comment on the status of the marine nick respected the agencys commitment to safeguarding personal information given the pr fiasco and millions paid in damages after several highly publicized thefts of classified laptop computers even so to keep vets from finding each other when friends from combat might be crucial to a soldiers or sailors wellbeing seemed irrationally protective for some reason nick could not shake the feeling that manny ferris was alive in a spiralbound notebook he kept a detailed log of every call he made to chief medical examiner offices in major east coast cities as well as to morgues in dc virginia delaware and maryland there were two instances of recorded death certificates for manuel ferris one for a man in his eighties the other a nineteenyearold killed in iraq he even paid fifty dollars to a web site purported to be a favorite among private investigators the site searched newspaper articles and a multitude of court records including incarcerations and name changes but it was wasted effort nick checked the time he and junie would be on the road in thirty minutes he peered out at the pinkandgoldcast sky wondering if such sunsets would ever feel anything but empty to him the everpresent curse of ptsd was that everything reminded him of something he had losthis bed of a restful nights sleep the sun of his fianc√©e the maps on the wall of his missing friend feeling another episode of melancholy coming on nick closed his eyes and balled his hands into tight fists but relaxed them when he heard his front door open come in its open he called out as junie was halfway down the hall chance perhaps knowing the woman represented no possibility of play remained in his upsidedowntable position junie entered the room her broad smile fading the moment she saw nick goodness love i guess im just stating the obvious but you look like hell thanks for the compliment i checked myself in the mirror and thought at worst i looked like heck the nurse spent a moment studying the maps tacked to the walls thats a lot of walking youve done in two days she said say maybe just maybe thats why my feet are killing me you know junie truth is i didnt even consider not being able to find manny ferris its all a bit disheartening it hurts me to see you so discouraged i admire your dedication to finding out what happened to umberto but maybe its time to let it rest the man saved my life i owe it to him you owe it to yourself to live your life to the fullest too well maybe finding umberto will let me do that im worried youre chasing ghosts nick what if hes not a ghost then we better find him fast we junie nodded and placed a comforting hand on nicks shoulder the night you learned about manny ferris i dont think ive seen you so happy in all the time ive known you i dont want to go on watching you suffer the way you have been if finding our friend umberto is going to take you even one step closer to health and happiness i want to do everything i can to make it happen thank you junie youre doing that i honestly believe manny ferris and umberto are connected ive searched every street corner morgue and veterans organization from here to detroit but im going to keep at it well i know one person we havent used who might help you oh and whos that reggie our reggie my football buddy reggie youcantridethervifyoudontfinishyourhomework reggie the same i promise that if anyone can help you find your manny ferris he can chapter with each stroke of his spoonshaped paddle franz koller felt a million and a half richer what other job could he even think of where he could make so much money for doing something that he loved so much whatever this newest windfall of steady business was all about hed take it no questions asked maybe hed buy another house koller ignored the spray as he powered through threefoot swells kicked up by a steady offshore breeze the spray skirt kept the boat from flooding and practice with the ocean kayak he kept at his estate near panama city florida had made him expert at steering with the footcontrolled rudder system he would have preferred to work in less blustery conditions but the fog now beginning to blanket the ironcolored sea provided additional cover he could not resist the rolling chesapeake swells aside koller was delighted to be on the hunt again executing a nonkill was far more rewarding than executing a lesson plan he was certified to teach in a number of states under a number of names in past years the profession had been tolerable and occasionally even stimulating if it werent for being such an effective cover with flexible working hours he wouldnt spend another minute trying to educate the insipid brats unless dr tightass as koller had come to think of the anesthesiologist whose life he was about to terminate broke with his routine he would be entering the water at the end of parker avenue within the next ten minutes koller had put in his own seventeenfoot carboncolored looksha two miles to the south he had bought the touring kayak in a mammoth sporting goods store outside of newport and later that night had slept with the salesgirl who had sold it to him life was good rowing the extra mile to intersect the doctors track was a precaution the killer had no trouble taking it was best if the man believed he was alone on the water until the very end once the body was recovered and once the time of death was established there would be nothing suspicious for anyone to report to the police of course that presumed there would even be a police investigation of any depth but koller knew there wouldnt be details and working through minutiae were at the core of the nonkill even with the rough conditions koller was barely breathing heavily when he reached the eastern side of the alexander ledge lighthouse the wonder of adrenaline he thought grabbing hold of the rusted ladder which ran halfway up the ninetysevenfoothigh granite tower he checked the time despite the chop he had still made it four minutes faster than the best of his three trial runs details in another twenty minutes anesthesiologist dr thomas landrew would complete his early morning paddle out to the ledge one mile to dead time doc koller said checking his gps and savoring the air which was salty but not as much so as at the ocean end of the largest estuary in the country he had shadowed landrew for several days deciding on the best way to dispatch him following the precepts of the nonkill early each morning even when it was raining koller watched as the man embarked from the parker avenue putin and paddled out to the lighthouse and back the physician was fiftyseven but his body could have been fifteen years younger than that the rigidity surrounding the mans schedule was impressive he rowed then left for work at precisely the same time each day and made a leisurely walkabout of his substantial property each evening when he returned home the nonkill at its best required using a targets weakness against him or her it was landrews obsessiveness about time that would be his undoing chilly waves crashed against the rocks at the base of the lighthouse taking advantage of a brief interlude between swells koller reached into his dry bag resting atop the cockpit tray to confirm its contents the two tools he would need were stashed safely inside nylon drawstring bagsa small hammer and a syringe the latter was kept safe in a protective plastic case and filled with four hundred milligrams of succinylcholine or sux as many anesthesiologists and emergency specialists referred to the magical drug koller removed the needle cap and tapped gently at the base of the syringe encouraging a tiny crystal drop of death to bead out he imagined the onset of the paralysis of landrews muscles especially the thick traps across the shoulder and those chest muscles that were needed along with the diaphragm to breathe a single shot of the massive dose he had chosen was all it would take to stop every muscle cold riding the swells he rubbed his hands together vigorously not so much to warm them but to help contain his exuberance over the sound of wind and waves koller heard the classical music landrew liked to play when he paddled mozartalways mozart hidden from view behind the lighthouse koller gauged the distance he waited until the anesthesiologist tapped his paddle against the granite boulders before slipping out through the fog like a mirage hey there koller called out slightly breathless from his effort landrew did a double take then shut off mozart i didnt know anybody else was out here he said at this hour there seldom is where did you put in koller paddled toward the mans kayak keeping the syringe tucked securely under his leg just a bit south of parker he said this is my first time out to the lighthouse you parker i drop in at parker every day the doctor sounded curious but not suspicious koller decided couldnt have picked a better morning eh the killer replied with a chuckle drenched from ocean spray landrews silver hair escaped in spots from underneath his rei baseball cap his distinguished good looks and bestthatmoneycouldbuy gear were koller thought a perfect compliment to his type a personality if you like fog youre certainly getting the most out of the experience landrew said sounding just a bit rushed i certainly am koller agreed mind if i anchor against your boat for just a moment mines pretty unsteady in these swells and i want to secure my dry bag i suppose so okay times up koller pulled his craft alongside landrews which was downwind and closer to the lighthouse the mark seeming slightly annoyed now leaned over to help steady the other boat oh how koller loved it when his mark helped him to make the kill the lighthouse as he anticipated shielded both men from the steady roll of waves benefiting him with additional stability the classic three dog night song joy to the world popped into his head and brought an audible chuckle whats so funny landrew asked this is koller said with serpentlike quickness he tipped his kayak to starboard giving him the additional inches he needed to reach the base of landrews neck focusing on a spot next to the spine in virtually the same motion he drove the needle deep into the mans trapezius muscle and depressed the plunger dispensing the sux he pushed a few feet away and watched with undisguised delight as the nature of the attack registered in his victims patrician face koller knew that beneath the mans patagonia jacket landrews muscles were already beginning to fasciculatethe individual fibers twitching and wriggling like so much spaghetti whats wrong koller asked with a grin ocean beauty leave you breathless why the physician pleaded fumbling with his paddle but getting nowhere you all ask that same question the master of the nonkill replied why is that then he laughed out loud with the sux working its magic landrew was motionless inside his kayak his eyes were alert though frozen in a horrified stare hey fish got your tongue koller asked and laughed even louder landrews body still upright began gently moving from side to side lolled by the waves passing beneath his craft yes thats the effect of your old friend sux koller said how many times in the or have you used it on others hundreds no no thousands ill bet you can feel your heart racing in a desperate effort to get oxygen to your brain dont bank on your brain winning that one landrews eyes remained fixed koller paddled forward and gripped the gunwale of the mans boat youre a worldrenowned anesthesiologist doctor koller continued but ill bet i know succinylcholine as well as you do rapidly metabolized depolarizing neuromuscular blocker onset of action less than one minute halflife less than one minute breakdown product succinic acid wont be looked forespecially not in a drowning victim and yes even if you cant inhale water will still get into your lungs passively just from being submerged for an hour or so so whos the expert ah but theres more koller reached into his dry bag and took out the hammer i still needed to figure out how you were going to drown while wearing a life preserver he went on want to guess how speechless i understand okay ill tell you just like the police will tell the good widow landrew there was an accident you see a wave flipped your boat or maybe you fainted from an irregular heart rhythm either way you fell out of the kayak and tried your best to get back in but then gosh darnit wouldnt you know the kayak flipped over from a wave and the gunwale came snapping down onto your head the blow knocked you unconscious floating facedown in the water kept there by your life jacket your lifeless body came to rest amidst those rocks over there landrews eyes remained open but koller knew he was already dead he removed the rei baseball cap and tapped the hammer against the mans scalp until blood oozed out from a small gash with his gloved hand koller rubbed blood from the wound against the gunwale of the corpses boat augmenting the smear with strands of hair ripped from landrews scalp he then loosened the spray skirt before flipping the kayak over spilling the lifeless body into the sea nobody does it better koller sang softly makes you feel sad for the rest he watched until the current carried the body and boat against the boulders at the base of the lighthouse then with several powerful strokes he turned his kayak west and disappeared into the morning fog nicely done he said to himself chapter it was lunch hour a steady flow of employees poured out from the veterans administration benefits building off to grab something to eat reggie smith watched them leave from his position behind a hot dog pushcart on the other side of vermont avenue strolling leisurely to the next streetlight the gangly teen crossed the road then waited until another group had exited before entering the building junie and nick had dropped him off a block away and were waiting there in the car the youth was only fourteen and that worried his foster mother greatly but he was physically ahead of the curve and had a survivors wiliness born of his disjointed upbringing and several stretches in juvenile detention barring anything unforeseen he had assured her he would be okay junie and nick had misgivings reggie was five and already in foster care when his remarkable sense of computers began to manifest itself initially he was deemed cute and precocious but that was before age seven when he began charging video games and cds to his foster parents intercepting the shipments to the house and storing the booty beneath the clothes in his bureau drawer by age nine he had been caught hacking into the computer at school and changing grades by eleven when he moved in with junie and sam he had made another trip to juvenile detention for shoplifting and for frivolous but disruptive cyber crime reggie has the potential to change the world or to rule a cell block the judge had told his new foster parents with the wrights steadying hands on the tiller of his life and nicks role as a big brother the boy was headed in the right direction junies rationale in asking him to become involved in the search for manny ferris was that no one would be hurt and someone they both loved would be helped in all her years as a foster parent caring for god only knew how many children she had never used a kid or put one in harms way as she was doing with this boy but nick was increasingly desperate to find manny ferris and reggie smith with an iq measured in the s was no ordinary teenager there was no metal detector from yesterdays visit to the building reggie knew the lunchtime crowd would distract the lone security guard making it easier for him to pass by he was dressed conservatively in tan corduroy pants and a blue collared shirt over which dangled a perfect replica of the buildings visitor badge skipping yesterdays biology class he had ridden into dc with junie and spent several hours observing people and walking up and down the granite steps to the main doors using his cell phone camera he snapped several quality shots of the buildings visitor badge it took him half the night to tweak the forgery using photoshop but before first light he printed his masterwork then had it laminated at a nearby kinkos it was virtually indistinguishable from the badge he had photographed right down to the slight color fade and scratches on the laminate perfectly calm and relishing the chance for mischief reggie climbed the expansive steps and walked through the massive glass doors once inside the marbletiled foyer he marched purposefully head held up eyes solidly forward toward the security desk as he neared he lifted his badge to eye level then waved it in front of his body to attract the guards attention my dad forgot his briefcase in his office reggie said again mindful to maintain eye contact suspicion was his greatest adversary now and to counter it he made certain his voice did not waver in the slightest this was the gamesmanship he missed most about his hacking days hacking into a computer was so much more than just writing code but only people like him understood that it was certainly possible to enter a system long distance from his personal computer but the direct route working from a computer already in the system was so much faster and more convenient to avoid getting caught when taking the direct route often required serious acting skills the guard kept his face virtually buried in the examiner while holding a roast beef sandwich in one hand and a diet coke can in the other he barely glanced up to check reggies id badge before waving him through reggie exited the main stairs at the second floor taking quick inventory of the layout which he had studied on two different web sites it was just what he expected to find he didnt anticipate having to search for long before finding a cubicle that suited his purposes there were only a scattering of employees who hadnt yet left for lunch he had passed only half a dozen workstations before he found one with a yellow postit note taped to the side of the computer monitor he checked inside the cubicle with the postit looking for a jacket or anything that might suggest the usual occupant could be returning soon chances were that david fulton the name on the business card inserted in the plastic holder on the outside cubicle wall was at lunch time to get started sitting down in fultons desk chair reggie gave a quick flick of the computer mouse to power down the screen saver the computer was locked as reggie knew it would be and required the right username and password to unlock it he simultaneously pressed the control alt and delete keys on the keyboard to activate the security prompt he couldnt help but laugh a little when he pulled the postit note off of the side of the monitor david fulton had written pword on the yellow square and then just underneath the characters abcabc information technology departments that enforced topnotch security protocols were notorious for frequently mandated password changes often they made employees change their password every week or two it was smart security reggie would agree but it also made it difficult for workers to remember their passwords instead of dealing with a help desk to retrieve a forgotten password the office drones most of them dealing with nonclassified material often simply wrote their passwords on a postit or slip of paper every time it changed taking advantage of the postit technique was one of the oldest and best hacker tricks for accessing secure systems if the password wasnt kept in plain sight on a postit note chances were good that it could be found under the keyboard or taped either to the side of a nearby filing cabinet or on the bottom of the upper desk drawer finding a valid password on his first attempt was a lucky break but not an unexpected one still reggies pulse rose a notch he had promised when he moved in with junie and sam that he would keep his skills under wraps but using them was always going to be a rush next the username if the security was typical reggie knew he would have three chances to get the right combination of username and password before the system would lock up and he would have to find another cubicle he typed david fulton in the username fielda common naming convention adopted by many information technology departments to uniquely identify each employeeand then he entered the password abcabc bingo it had taken less than five minutes from the moment he started his timer to access every system and file david fultons security profile allowed i love it reggie whispered seconds later the teen had the va intranet open and had clicked over to the bookmarked veterans information search web page as nick had instructed he typed manuel ferris into the search field then hit return five matches instantly appeared on the screen along with basic identifying information reggie downloaded each of the files onto his portable data storage usb key which he had plugged into the back of fultons computer whatever information nick needed reggie felt confident was either now on that key or simply didnt exist reggie slipped the small plastic unit containing the stolen files into his front pants pocket then his racing heart nearly stopped from down the hallway he heard a loud conversation two voices maybe three followed by a burst of laughter he was certain somebody had said the name dave chances were fiftyfifty it wasnt david fulton returning early from lunch but if it was reggies explanation regarding his fathers briefcase would be of no help time to leave he stepped outside the office with no more than a glance to his right and proceeded to walk confidently away from the central staircase and what turned out to be two men in suits slowly slowly somehow he managed to resist the temptation to look back hey reggie heard one of the men shout was that guy just in my cube hey you stop reggie had had enough close calls in his hacking life to know that sometimes the best option was not to try and talk his way out of a jam but to run from it with a sprinters acceleration he raced down the seemingly endless corridor headed for the lighted exit sign the commotion and shouts of the two men in pursuit encouraged several employees to poke their heads through their doorways or above their cubicle walls like prairie dogs reggie risked a quick glance behind him to assess his advantage the men trying to chase him down both of them overweight and running in their suits were not nearly as agile as he was in his loosefitting corduroys and new balance sneakers he was turning back to gauge the remaining distance between him and the exit door when a blond woman in a jacket and gray skirt oblivious to the chase emerged from her cubicle and stepped directly into his path shifting his weight in time to avoid a fullforce collision reggie clipped the woman spinning her sideways and down to one knee she screamed loudly as the papers she was carrying flew up against the ceiling and then rained down on her sorry bout that lady reggie said you okay the blonde nodded clearly confused by the collision and possibly the boys congeniality the delay was costly however reggies chances of making it to the exit without getting caught had all but vanished improvisation was often the hackers best friend and even in the worst of situations he had never been one to panic operating on instinct he spun around to face the two men who were now just a few cubicles away surprise was all he had as he often did when playing tackle football in the yard with nick he dashed directly toward them their eyes widened two doorways were all that separated them now reggie arms pounding was at full speed the men raised their arms like nick would have done either protecting themselves or readying to make a tackle reggie waited until the outstretched tips of one mans fingers were almost to his chest before making his favorite move ducking and sidestepping simultaneously he skidded to his right shifting past david fulton and his coworker instead of open lawn though he was looking at an empty cubicle moving instinctively he leaped onto the desk then grasping the top of the wall divider with both hands he swung his legs around vaulting himself up and over the divider and into the adjacent office neither of the men was inclined or able to duplicate his maneuver help stop him they hollered reggie smiling now had already reached the stairwell door from which he had entered the second floor there might have been enough distance between him and the men to take the stairs but instead he launched himself over the stairwell railing and dropped onto the stone landing below crying out in pain as his ankle rolled beneath him limping he reached the main foyer just as the two men were entering the stairwell hey slow down there kid the security guard barked as reggie hobbled past his desk sorry sir reggie shouted back sorry he hurried as best he could manage out the huge glass doors and down the outside stairs he was in pain and breathing heavily when he reached junie and nick behind him he sensed more than saw the security guard racing down the stairs go theyre coming he managed scrambling onto the backseat are you hurt nick asked as junie accelerated and turned at the next intersection reggie patted the usb key in his pocket not really he said it was going to be hard to thank junie for the rush chapter koller kept pace behind jillian coates close enough to breathe in her apricotscented perfume his shadow stretched long and thin by the midday sun occasionally overlapped hers he liked touching her that way sometimes he walked in perfect synchronized step she of course had no idea that for blocks she was being followed wearing a different disguise far more doughy robert greene than urbane intelligent paul regis koller felt confident that even if she did make eye contact with him he would be unrecognizable to her at worst she would think he was just a typical letch testing how close he could get to her and thinking dirty thoughts how wrong shed be the landrew nonkill had been a masterpiece flawlessly researched planned and executed now kollers bank account reflected his reward for that effort there was no way of knowing how much more work jericho intended on sending his way but koller had been in this business long enough to develop a sense for when a clients well was about to run dry jerichos pockets were extradeep though and he believed the work was far from over he decided it would be a wasted trip to return to the panama city estate his condo in taos or back to california to resume his life as a sedate but colorful substitute chemistry teacher more jobs were bound to come his way and probably soon meanwhile he was content to use the downtime to get to know jillian coates and see for himself how motivated she was to further investigate the cause of the fire that had ravaged her condominium he applied simple mathematical logic to his plan on how best to deal with her the pushier she was in her efforts the less time she had to live even the students at woodrow wilson high could handle that equation jillian left the crowded sidewalk and headed toward anne marie cosco hall a nursing school dorm according to the signpost koller read perhaps shes living there now he mused his mind flashed on the chaos and havoc he could wreak if left to his own devices on a floor full of student nurses the images more horrible than any circle of dantes inferno aroused him koller occupied himself with the washington post which he read on a nearby park bench while waiting for his quarry to reappear she did so twenty minutes later and proceeded to head off at a more accelerated pace he liked her choice of clothesnot flashy or excessively tight but not at all dowdy her breasts beneath a cotton blouse were totally enticinga nice c cup he guessed but it was her behind moving unselfconsciously in her chino slacks that he found most appealing the way her hips swayed with each step was inspiring koller moved even closer to her than he had been before wanting to take in another whiff of her intoxicating perfume he decided then and there that he would have her a willing sex partner or not before he killed her he considered it a bonus for a job well done the notion made him smile jillian took a left onto twentieth street and walked a few blocks north stopping underneath a green awning koller walked past her but turned just in time to see her slip inside madame jessicas psychic readings studio communing with the departed are we koller muttered to himself he wished it had been a private investigator she was visiting and not some medium who would take her money and toy with her emotions perhaps she could use someone to comfort hersomeone like paul regis he was rock hard from following her and from the taste of his last nonkill still fresh in his mind chapter of the five manuel ferris files reggie smith had obtained from his close call at the veterans administration building only one seemed promisinga thirtyfiveyearold with an address on h street nw in washington there was no apartment number the internet and nicks maps placed the address in dcs compact chinatown as his cab pulled up to the curb nick stared at the structure and checked reggies printout again lucky bill pearls the sign above the awning of a windowless black brick building read serving dcs finest gentlemen since below the fringed awning the entrance was moderately discreet with three glassencased glossy photographs of women on each side presumably advertising the headliners in their roster of performers and exotic dancers nikki sabra colette before he paid off the cabbie nick checked the address a final time lucky bills hardly seemed like the residence for a man who had gone off for a topsecret covert military missionunless the mission was here in which case it hardly seemed likely the va would be making the operatives identifying information available in its database the fa√ßade of the building was four stories high it wasnt a stretch to imagine what the upper floors might be used for but apartments were certainly one of the other possibilities he scanned to the right and left but there were no more entrances perhaps there was one on the far side of the building nick tipped the driver percent and went inside he was carrying a small manila envelope containing several photographs of umberto and one of manuel ferris enlarged by reggie from a unit snapshot matt mcbean had come up with the original photo was creased and grainy and the enlargement only enhanced the deficiencies in addition ferris was wearing some sort of a cap further obscuring his appearance from what nick could tell he was a narrowfaced swarthy man with deeply set eyes and was about the same height as mcbeanfivefootnine nick had last set foot inside a gentlemans club with a group of fellow surgical residents bill pearls was considerably more upscale than that place had been just outside the barred ticket window a bald muscleman sat perched on a wooden stool above the collar of his tux shirt the tops of a kaleidoscope of tattoos circumnavigated his treetrunk neck howre you doing he asked the brute who he realized had no eyebrows the man nodded without interest and mumbled a reply nick fished a twenty out of his wallet realizing as he did that he could have been much more subtle the bouncer reached up a beefy paw and instantly the bill was gone im looking for a man named manny ferris nick said i was told he worked here dont you think youre in the wrong club sir the giant replied this is girls only no no what i mean is is there a guy named manny ferris who works or or maybe even lives here what i mean is that i dont know came the humorless reply inwardly nick smiled here he wasa trauma surgeon able to make lifeanddeath decisions in the hospital or in the field fumbling for words with a man who threw people out of a bar for a living the clubs interior was dark and loud but smokefree and not yet very crowded someplace in the building though near the nightclub he could smell that cigars were being smoked so much for city ordinances nick mused all hail king cash several men sat at the bar glued to the busty topless dancer on center stage slithering her athletic body down a polished brass pole the stage lighting was professional and nick noted that it was synchronized to the dance music that was blasting out of an impressive stack of speakers in front of the arcing bar plush highbacked chairs lined the edge of the stage there were a few men seated there as well all dressed in business attire lucky bills was hardly the lowrent district of gentlemens clubs what business could such a place have with a burntout gi nick had crossed to the opposite side of the club when he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder a slender young woman in a slinky black dress was smiling up at him her elfin features were framed by stunning jetblack hair which flowed halfway down her back you look lost handsome she said im looking for somebody nick replied do you know a guy named manny ferris this is the address i was given for him are there apartments upstairs the girl cooed playfully hey thats a lot of questions for a first date how about a little champagne first my names brandy but champagnes my drink nick wondered how much bill pearls charged for a bottle of champagne to say nothing of the services from brandy even without her biggestticket item it was doubtful his nightonthetown atm withdrawal was going to last long so nick said taking a seat at a corner table what about manny ferris or manuel ferris you a cop nope not a cop just a guy whos looking for a guy named manny ferris do you know him i get paid to talk with the customers officer she said i told you im not a cop ive got a hundred im ready to exchange for information about manny ferris its very important to me what if i dont know anything forty just for trying ill take the forty in advance nick reduced his stack of twenties by two his names ferris he said manny or manuel ferris the va gave me this place as his address the club i think the owner may have an apartment on the top floor and the girls use the second floor but i dont know if anyone lives in the rest of the place whats he look like nick produced the photo mcbean had given him and the girl studied it he could be sitting right next to me and i might not recognize him from this picture height weight maybe five nine hes midthirtiesmight have been late twenties when this was taken thats it thats it boy i sure hope youre not a cop if you are youre not very good at it without waiting for a reply she turned giving him one last look at her clockstopping face and figure and headed across the room toward a newcomer who looked strikingly like the cartoon mogul on chance and community chest cards in the game of monopoly nick stood to leave another young attractive woman a redhead approached him before he had made it to the mens room at the rear of the club the va record had to have been wrong he was thinking unsuccessfully trying the photo on the girl it certainly wouldnt be the first time they had bad information the restroom with a swashbuckling cavalier on the door featured orange marble countertops neat rows of toiletries hair combs in blue liquid disinfectant and several small bowls of mints nick could not see under the stalls but it seemed as if there was no one else in the washroom besides him and an attendant in a stained white collared shirt askew bow tie and faded red vest he had a clean towel draped on his arm and passed it over as soon as nick had washed his hands as the attendant turned toward him nick caught his breath the mans face was deformed two thick flaps of skin were separated by several crisscrossing scars it was as if someone had started a multistep plastic surgery procedure and then stopped before it was completed you have a nice day sir the man muttered nick set a five in his jar thanks you he stopped midsentence the attendant drying the sink and countertop in the strip club bathroom was manny ferris nick felt nearly certain of it manny youre manny ferris arent you ferris looked away and mumbled a response manny ive been looking all over for you my name is nick garrity im a doctor and a good friend of matt mcbean i cant believe ive finally found you ferris looked blankly at nick his rheumy eyes were empty and distant do you want a mint he asked his voice was flatdevoid of any emotion his deformed face held no discernable expression manny im a friend of matt mcbean nick said again mcbean from the service ive been looking for you nothing from his stack of pictures nick pulled out the enlarged segment of the photograph of mcbean and ferris taken years ago and handed it to the man look manny this is you right here and this is matt mcbean he told me you vanished four years ago where have you been nothing ferris adjusted the combs and checked that the towels were aligned then without so much as a nod at nick he turned and inspected each of the three elegant stalls night of the living manny nick thought ferris did not protest being shown the photo a second time there may have been a flicker of recognition but then just as quickly it was gone we have some new combs if youd like to do your hair he said nick leaned in close to check the mans pupils for any sign of drug use they were midposition and seemed to react to light then he took hold of ferriss wrist and measured his pulse the former enlisted marine offered no resistance and kept his wrist limp as nick calculated his rate at sixtyeight manny theres a good chance you know my friend umberto vasquez its been four years since i saw him last he was signed on to do a topsecret job for the military just like you were does that name mean anything to you how are you doing today sir ferris replied do you need a towel manny please this man served with me he saved my life in battle then a few years later just like you he disappeared no reaction nicks enthusiasm at having found the man had vanished along with his hope of learning umbertos fate he was wondering if it was worth trying to get ferris into the rv in the near future for an examination and some blood work here manny he said with an edge of frustration and irritability that he knew was out of character heres a twenty take a look at these pictures of umberto vasquez ferris took the bill but he would not take the stack of photographs so nick was forced to flip through them he paused on one picture for a few seconds before switching to the next each time nick was careful to point out umberto ferris kept the same dull expression throughout then while nick was showing him the penultimate photograph something changed ferriss eyes widened his mouth fell agape he started to shake and his face reddened he turned away from nick swinging him around by the shoulders nick held the photograph up to his face the picture was of nick and umberto standing in front of the rv with the lincoln memorial in the background nick could not remember with certainty but he thought that junie had taken the shot do you recognize umberto in this picture do you go away ferris shouted pushing nick backward with force go away from me nick stumbled against the counter and nearly fell his eyes caught a blur of movement and he ducked just as the glass jar filled with combs sailed over his head shattering the mirror behind him manny stop it nick shouted cant stay must run the mans eyes once dead had ignited with a feral frenzy his strength was astounding stiffarming nick as he tried to follow him out of the bathroom ferris barreled into a cocktail waitress carrying a tray full of drinks nick managed three steps in pursuit before being grabbed from behind by the tattooed bouncer pinned facefirst against the clubs velvetlined wall nick watched helplessly as his only link to umberto disappeared through the fire exit door chapter the two biggest shortcuts to disaster in medicine are arrogance and everything else nick knew his focus was compromised the warning about medical mistakes from one of his former surgical professors at brown ran through his head like a m√∂bius strip arrogance wasnt the problem with him it never really had been but even under the best of circumstances his thoughts had a tendency to wander and twentyfour hours after his bizarre encounter with manny ferris this was hardly the best of circumstances the rv was back in dc and the warming weather had brought with it a flood of patients routine routine routine disaster masking as routine the shattering of a medical career was as simple as a oneminute loss of concentrationa swollen lymph node missed a rectal exam not done an abnormal neurologic sign ignored a telltale answer in the medical history passed over or not asked for at all it was that easy and for nick the danger increased in direct proportion to his sud score which tonight continued hovering around five they were on the third and final stop of the evening parked on the street in the anacostia section of dc nick and junie had the help of an experienced volunteer nurse named kate who was working beneath the lightweight canopy that served as their annex and at other times as their triage area and waiting room slowly but surely the crush of patients had vanished and not a moment too soon fatigue and manny ferris were taking over nicks body and mind for a few brief moments after entering lucky bill pearls it had seemed some answers to umbertos disappearance might be at hand instead there were only more questions and more frustrations so have you had the chance to think about ferris nick had asked junie during the ride in from baltimore to their initial stop at jasper yeos used car dealership booze she said simply when in doubt always bet alcohol my moneys on wet brain maybe but for someone who is as much of a zombie as ferris was i didnt see too many of the stigmata that go along with alcoholismyou know spider veins on the cheeks a w c fields nose ascites liver palms weakness impaired gait should i go on then theres those scars and lumps on his face its like he was the big loser in a gang fight what then i dont know probably alcohol i also wonder if someone might have been preparing him for plastic surgery but how do you explain his reaction to the photo of me and umberto it certainly wasnt me he was reacting to you should have seen him junie in about a second he went from night of the living dead to rambo does that seem like wet brain to you maybe drugs i suppose now nick was listening to the chest of an anxious twentyyearold woman who lived in the nearby projects junie cleared her throat and shook her head at him disapprovingly hear anything she askedher way of telling him that he might want to start that part of the exam over again nothing yet he muttered and focused in their patient had evidence of a loose mitral valve and no other good explanation for her recurrent chest discomfort nick asked junie to run a cardiogram on her they would have scheduled an echocardiogram and blood tests if she had insurance but that was wishful thinking nick gave her a sheet on obtaining health coverage and junie promised to follow up with a phone call to see if she had any luck that was the best they could do running a clinic like helping hands involved compromises especially when patient cooperation and followup were constant variables specialist involvement in their cases was more dependable through study and courses nick was decent at reading cardiograms but they had several cardiologists who donated their services to helping hands finally there was the handout dealing with mitral valve prolapse that one of their heart people had prepared either of you want coffee nick asked the nurse and patient its going to be instant but we have decaf and high test and white stuff in the fridge both declined is that woman out there on the drivers seat with you junie asked their patient nope just my boyfriend hes the one sitting at the table nick glanced toward the front of the rv he had noticed the woman several times in passing it was hard not tovery goodlooking with short sandcolored hair and a light spread of freckles across the tops of her cheeks as far as i can tell junie added she never signed in to be seen its been like fortyfive minutes i thought she was here with one of our patients ill ask she doesnt look like shes in any trouble but it is a little weird she hasnt spoken up maybe shes a reporter or one of maccandlisss secret agents nick doing his best to appear nonchalant stopped by the refrigerator for a coke now that he could look directly at the woman in the drivers chair he wondered how he had ever made it past her in the first place she was wearing jeans and a white barn jacket with a brown collarfrom llbean or eddie bauer or someplace like that he guessed she was facing slightly away from him gazing out of the massive windshield then as if sensing his attention she turned and smilednot a broad smile but still enough to light up the whole front of the rv special that was the word that came initially to his mind followed closely by interesting intelligent and unusual as he approached her nick stumbled enough to slosh some coke onto the carpet nice start leave it or mop it up grinning sheepishly he went back to the galley and returned with some paper towels hi he said looking up from one knee and sensing he was speaking an octave higher than usual hi yourself she said seeming totally at ease it felt awkward to be so close to her as incredible as was her smile her eyes an unfathomable bluegreen were even more so he made it to his feet and braced his leg against the console between the front seats to gain some breathing room are you here to be seen by the medical staff he asked medical staff give me a break he chastised himself just tell her youre the doctor nope she said healthy as a horse but you can help me with this she reached into a thin brown paper bag and held up a copy of nick fury and his agents of shield my names jillian coates im a psych nurse at shelby stone memorial got a moment to talk dr garrity it took fortyfive minutes to pack up the canopy and wipe down the interior of the van jillian pitched in and got to know junie as she did nick stayed close to the women and entered the conversation when he could special was right there was a femininity and wisdom to her coupled with a sharp wit that he found totally appealing nick who hadnt really broken through his ptsd enough to become interested in any woman since sarah was surprised to find himself making some comparisons junie exchanged enough glances with him to make it clear she was thinking the same things finally with the nurse kate off to her home in the suburbs and the shades pulled nick and junie sat at the foldout table and listened with empathy and quiet astonishment to the sad story of the death of belle coates and her odd connection to the medical director of the helping hands mobile medical unit through an almost forgotten nickname you say your sister had actually written in md and dr and phd next to nick furys name on the covers of these comics she seemed to be trying out every form of doctor like she heard it rather than read it i wish i had the issues to show you she said but they were destroyed when my apartment burned down a few days ago your sister was murdered and then your apartment burned down do you think the two are connected how can i not nick except the arson people didnt find anything well unless youre incredibly unlucky it seems suspicious to me nick said wishing he could come up with something anything to help the woman wait a minute he said suddenly i have a friend a detective with the dc police he is incredibly well connected i wouldnt be a bit surprised if he knew the arson people in arlington or at least here can i put you in touch with him that would be great i have the number of one of the insurance inspectors who looked at my place maybe i can get a copy of his report over to your friend ill get a hold of don first thing in the morning nick said feeling his knees beginning to go to jello from the womans eyes in the end it seemed obvious that belle coates had come across a reference to the name umberto vasquez had given to his friend a million miles and a hundred thousand years agonot just come across the name but had been impressed enough by what she had heard to go out and buy more than forty different copies of the comic book dr nick fury at one oclock junie encouraged them to keep talking and wandered off to lie down in the aft examining room even before our parents died belle and i were reasonably close jillian said but there was a fairly wide difference in our ages and i really didnt know all that much about her and what she was into by the time of the accident i had already been married for like a year and divorced and was out there in the big wide washington world making up for the time i lost by getting married so young the truth is i was living on the edge a great deal partying always first in line for anything that would provide a rush and chasing my passion for photography to some pretty dangerous places then suddenly you were the parent of a teenage girl it sounds like that would be the case and thats what i expected when i somewhat reluctantly agreed to stay home with belle but thats hardly what happened belle was the most centered spiritual person i had ever met yoga flute painting athletics gardening cooking whatever there was to experience she wanted to try it she didnt care if she ever became the best at anything except maybe nursing but she wanted to know things to feel them in her own way not necessarily to master them and she was without a doubt the best listener i ever knew she sounds pretty incredible she was even at fourteen it was like being around some sort of advanced lifeform in the end before she chose nursing and moved into the dorms in dc she was the one who was teaching me how to livei mean really live not loud or big but softly and passionately with a delight in the details of things and of people jillians eyes filled then overflowed she made no attempt to wipe aside her tears nor was she at all embarrassed by them i never tried to stop the tears when i used to cry over sarah nick said i felt they might be i dont know cleansing then the ptsd took hold and all of a sudden i wasnt crying anymore i just stopped i dont think thats good i guess as devastated and griefstricken as i was i dont think i even felt sad just empty thats right i cant believe you said that just empty its an almost indescribable feeling umberto used to say that as long as i could cry there was hope more than anyone else including my therapist he was upset when i stopped at some point he also told me that he hadnt cried a single time since his discharge from the hospital after the explosion he went from being the best soldier ive ever knowna man who ran back instead of running away and risked his life to keep me from being blown to bitsto being an aimless alcoholic he didnt have any physical wounds like i did so they refused to consider his ptsd reason enough for a purple heart im so sorry thanks i can tell you are and that really means something to me then he disappeared then he disappeared nick echoed shrugging helplessly listen nick she said i want to help you find umberto meeting you and thinking about the strangeness of all those comic books belle wrote on makes me believe there has to be a connection somehow or other her path and umbertos had to have crossed and if getting through to this manny ferris will move you closer to finding umberto then i want to help you with that as well ive got ten years as a psych nurse that says i can help there id love the help nick said wondering if he should have delivered the words more forcefully you told me that manny ferris had an almost violent reaction to one of the photographs of umberto not almost violent he went berserk it was nothing specialjust a photo of me and umberto standing by the rv there was at least one other of umberto and me but ferris took one look at that picture heaved a jar at me and bolted do you think i could see the photos nick retrieved the envelope from one of the drawers in the galley and passed it across now instead of her eyes he became fixated on her handssmooth pale skin nails not too long with a clear coating except for the ends which were quarter moons of white polish he studied the movement of her long delicate fingers as she went from photo to photo umberto has a very kind face she said he would love yours nick thought thats the photo he said the one that set ferris off jillian appraised it with the concentration of one used to examining art i selfpublished a book of my photos of the great buildings and monuments of dc gave it to friends for christmas the shots of the lincoln were my favorites id love to see it you may get your chance she said this time lighting up the galley with her smile i wonder what maybe it wasnt the clinic or you or umberto that upset ferris so maybe it was the settingthe lincoln itself how could we ever prove that well how about we do a little photo shoot of our own interested chapter nick paced along the crowded walkway in front of the lincoln memorial waiting for jillian to arrive the afternoon sky was crisp and bright with only a few passing clouds to block out the three oclock sun if jillians analysis of the photograph was accurate it was around this time four years ago that junie snapped the picture of nick and umberto that sent manny ferris running for the exit door it was after three that morning before jillian had left the rv by then junie was asleep in the back examining room and nick was entangled in a mesh of bewildering feelings surrounding the intense engaging new arrival in his life it was jillian who came up with the idea to take photographs from every conceivable angle around the lincoln memorial then observe mannys reaction to each maybe there was something to her theory that it wasnt who was in the picture that so upset the marine but what to be certain they did not confuse manny any more than he already appeared to be jillian wanted to get the time of their shoot as close as possible to the actual hour the photograph had been taken in case time of day factored into his intense reaction it took some careful study of the photographs light and shadow for jillian to determine the hour nick was astounded by her ability to deduce information from a single picture right down to her figuring out that it was also taken in the springtime based solely on the clothes worn by pedestrians in the background he was certain if she had chosen a career in radiology she would have been a star jillian spotted nick and called out to him as she hurried over the last time nick had experienced anything remotely close to a crush he and sarah had just met and were going out on their first date now it was jillian who had invaded his thoughts they were supposed to meet by the stone bench but nick was too anxious to sit and wait he tried to attribute his nervous energy to a desire to solve the manny ferris mystery but he knew better hey you she said are you ready to be my assistant you look professional and stunningly beautiful nick wanted to add but fought the urge i thought we were meeting at the bench she said i was waiting for you there i guess i got antsy nick said figured id start scouting potential shots well i would have brought my nikon d and wideangle lens but then i remembered im a nurse and about two grand short of being able to afford one so youll have to settle for my canon rebel xt its a little like a beagle next to an irish setter but theyre both pedigrees hey for all i know about photography you could have pulled out a shoe box and told me were doing this with a pinhole camera consider me your loyal assistant ready and willing to serve is that a promise there it was again that flirtatious blink of her eyes and infectious smile that seemed to add ten degrees to an already warm spring afternoon we better get started he said weve got a lot of pictures to take and not a lot of sun left they finished the shoot in just under two hours jillian had stashed a portable printer in her camera bag so they were able to print out twenty or so quality shots representing every conceivable vantage point the pictures from the east exterior captured the monolithic temple columns palatial staircase and expansive causeway a few shots were from the temple interior as well as one of lincoln himself so if its the lincoln shot that sets manny off does that just tell us hes states rights and not an abolitionist nick asked with a wry grin either that or hes scared of statues that would make him staurophobic nick replied now how did i know that youd provide that information jillian asked punching him teasingly on the shoulder i feel like ive been set up it was childish he knew but nick beamed inwardly at having impressed jillian with his knowledge of phobias the subject of a psychology term paper in college what else could he impress her with he wondered but as quickly as that thought arrived it left this woman just wasnt the type they continued sorting through the photographs picking the very best shots to print from the hundreds stored in the camera there was a picture of the washington monument across the reflecting pool taken from the very spot where dr martin luther king jr delivered his i have a dream speech another captured the north wall of the washington monument through the lincoln memorials towering side portico there were a couple shots of the back of the memorial as well including one from the walkway along parkway drive northwest and another rear shot taken from the bike path across the potomac which ran parallel to the george washington memorial parkway looks like were ready to go jillian said zipping up her tripod bag after they printed the final shot are you sure manny will be at the club manny ferris seemed as much a fixture in that bathroom as the fixtures in that bathroom nick said hell be there im sure of it chapter by the time they arrived at lucky bill pearls the april sun had long ago set a cool night wind chilled their skin the two descended the dimly lit carpeted staircase with jillian leading the way nick kept a few paces back wanting to see if the bouncer who had pinned him up against the wall was again working the door as luck would have it it was another bald gorilla although he was equally adorned in ink maybe because the weekend was approaching the club was more crowded this time than last nick watched with amusement as jillian took in the scene her mouth hung just a little agape as she stared in bewilderment at the arcing bar the highbacked chairs lining the edge of the stage the brass poles and the womenspectacularlooking by almost anyones measure you guys do this for fun jillian asked leaning in close and speaking directly into nicks ear so she could be heard over the techno music blaring in the background nick enjoyed the sensation of her lips against his skin and wished the music were even louder and her question a little longer im going to go find manny do you think you can handle it here until i get back sometime soon youve gotta come and see where i work jillian said nick waited until jillian was settled at the bar before making his way over to the mens room when he glanced back a heavyset man in a light blue suit was sitting down next to jillian and starting his rap jillian waved to nick assuring him with her eyes that she had the situation well in hand it wasnt until nick had pushed against the swashbuckling cavalier on the restroom door and called out mannys name that he realized jillian had the prints they had made manny he called out again the orange marble countertop was dry and the toiletries were still in neat rows on top leaning over nick scanned underneath the stall doors but they were all empty on his way over to the box office to check and see if manny was even scheduled to work that night nick spied jillian seated at the black lacquered bar flanked by three leering men each ignoring the girls on the poles as he vied for her attention as if sensing nick was watching her jillian turned and waved across the club not to worry her playful look said stepping into the dim carpeted foyer of the stairwell landing nick peered into the box office window but the room was empty hello nick called out is anybody there then he felt a strong grip on his shoulder nick turned hey buddy a surly voice growled remember me it was the same bald heavyweight who just yesterday had pressed him against the club wall like an ink stamp while manny ferris made his escape how could i forget nick replied more calmly than he was feeling isnt your name dick the bouncers massive hands grabbed nicks shoulders then spun him around and began shoving him up the stairway when i toss someone out of here its permanent didnt i make that clear im sorry i dont speak gorilla must not have understood you nick said struggling futilely to hold his position well maybe youll understand this with a hard push he launched nick into the clubs blackened glass front door nick crashed into the frame shoulder first knocking the heavy hinged door open as if it were part of a dolls house and cracking the glass with his arms and legs flailing he spilled out onto the sidewalk rolling into a somersault as he fell and continuing to roll until he was off the curb and onto one knee then hoping he didnt show the pain he was feeling in half a dozen places he forced himself to his feet the bouncer hands on hips stood glaring at him look nick said my friend is still inside at least let me go down and get her sorry the bouncer answered with a toothy smile but i dont speak asshole jillian checked her watch and frowned nick had left to find manny ferris nearly twenty minutes ago now she was starting to worry to make matters worse the gentlemen crowding her end of the bar were getting restless where is he with no small effort she managed to handle the quartet of admirers strutting about her bar stool like peacocks when they werent inspecting they were preening when they werent preening they were jockeying for position of course she acknowledged this was a mens clubtheir mens club she could deal with matters so long as she didnt run out of small talk and synonyms for no one of the men with sloppydrunk eyes and a sagging face that could have passed for a rorschach inkblot test was becoming a problem so baby mama are we going to dance or not he slurred im sorry but im a customer not an employee she answered him stonefaced he turned with a huff and jillian smiled to herself again she checked her watch nick seemed resourceful but that did not stop her from worrying years in nursing had turned concern into a sort of sixth sense that was impossible for her to shut off even so she knew her feelings for nick were shaped by more than a professional instinct for his wellbeing there was an attraction to him she simply could not deny ill pay you double whatever he offered a man was proposing leaning close enough to give jillian a lungful of old spice jillian was readying to rebuke the advance when a tall man dressed in a black turtleneck and a tailored brooks brothers jacket stepped between them hey what gives old spice snapped the lady said she wanted to hang with me so back off i said no such thing jillian shot back the two men glared at each other and jillian would not have been surprised if they started to growl the tall man who had thinning black hair an aquiline nose and confident dark eyes reached inside his blazer pulled out a toothpick and slipped it into the corner of his mouth his narrow face was pocked by acne scars that were ill concealed by his rough five oclock shadow the diamond studs pinned on each ear had to be two carats at least hey friend the newcomer said why dont you take a hundred pearl bucks and go hang with a lady that wants your company with his jersey accent he could have easily passed for one of tony sopranos henchmen he pulled out a roll of fake bills you think you can buy me off with toy money because youre big into jewelry no i think i can buy you off because i own this place jillian watched with amusement as billy pearl padded the spice mans sweaty hand with a wad of colorful pearl bucks sorry about that pearl said turning to jillian we love it when women stop by at the clubespecially beautiful women thank you jillian said feeling no threat from the man our patrons come here and pay a good deal of money to behave like sharks sometimes innocent guppies become part of their feeding frenzy you have my apology no need but accepted im a very fast swimmer have you been here before miss jillian miss jillian buy you a drink thanks but youd better have a lot of pearl bucks on you to do that i appreciate the feedback ill make sure to tell the boss i know this sounds like a line but whats a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this jillian laughed she liked pearl actually im here with a friend whom i cant seem to find at the moment we came in to talk to one of your employees manny ferris do you know him pearls eyes narrowed and his lips tightened she was being assessed by him but for what and why she did not know know him yeah i know him pearl said finally mannys my cousin what do you want with him hes not in any trouble billy if thats what youre wondering maybe your business with manny isnt any of my concern but seeing as hes family and hes well not all there if you know what i mean i kinda need to make it my concern im a nurse on the psych unit at shelby stone i need his help is all we think manny may have information about a man were trying to find i promise you manny ferris doesnt have information about anything at least not information he can get in touch with what does that mean billy studied her for a time as if deciding if she should be trusted youre a nurse billy said maybe you can help help with what what do you know about brainwashing we studied it in a psych course jillian said the modern version goes back to the fifties it involves breaking down a persons sense of self so they can build a new one manny was a sharp kid even when he came back stressed out from war and was drinking all the time then he disappeared for a while and one day he showed up here he looked as if someone had cut up his face and he seemed to me as if he had been brainwashed how sad what makes you think he was brainwashed it was like the old manny was gone but replaced with nothing he couldnt tell me where he was or what he had been doing only that he needed a place to stay and something to eat drugs pain i dont know who did it or how but somebody wrecked his mind my friend went to find him in the mens room i dont think he found him there pearl laughed manny doesnt have much range if he isnt in the bathroom then hes in the basement storeroom sleeping on the job when you cant rely on your bathroom guy youre really in trouble he sleeps in the basement its not as bad as youd think in my more colorful youth i used to store other stuff besides toilet paper and cups down there the space had to be comfortable and roomy enough to work in but also well concealed if you get my drift can i see him jillian asked pearl considered the request well he said finally if you dont mind following me into the mens room id be happy to give you a tour what about my friend nick im getting a little worried he hasnt come back ill check with the guys out front and find out where he is im sure that if hes not in the washroom with manny then theyre downstairs come on i get a kick out of showing off the room anyway billy pearl knocked on the mens room door waited less time than jillian would have liked then escorted her inside and made a quick assessment of the situation okay so mannys not here that means hes downstairs heres the deal ill give you two hundred pearl bucks if you can find the secret door pearl bucks tell me the truth billy did you plan on naming your money after the writer or was it a coincidence next to the location of the mystery door thats my biggest secret but i will tell you that my eightynineyearold mom still has my diploma from james madison high up on her wall got it but what would i do with two hundred pearl bucks anyway okay make it three hundred jillian groaned then began to walk the elegant blackandwhite bathroom perimeter observing that it was hospital clean and blessedly odorless as for finding a door to some secret chamber she knew at the outset that she had no chance pearl watched with keen interest as she continued to look in all the wrong places he kept his arms folded tight across his chest and his face etched in a knowitall grin i give up jillian conceded quickly ill have to pass on the pearl bucks beaming at his own ingenuity pearl marched over to the row of bathroom sinks and wrapped his hand around one of the opaque plastic soap containers showtime he announced turning the container clockwise a full degrees pearl pulled the stainless steel mount out three inches from the sink backsplash a springheld door next to pearl camouflaged to look like part of the blacktiled wall popped open without making a sound jillian who was standing only a few feet away stepped back in surprise thats amazing she said we used to have some pretty serious business going on down there pearl eased open the hinged doorway with his fingertips then flicked on a light switch on the upper wall of the stairwell jillian followed him down a short flight of wellbuilt wooden stairs that descended into a dimly lit antechamber with a cement floor proceeding cautiously she had to duck low to avoid colliding with the exposed lightbulb dangling by a dustcovered cord through a small alcove she emerged into a much larger storage room boxes of paper goods and other bar supplies were neatly stacked on plastic shelving units that lined the jagged stone walls abutting the only wall without shelving manny ferris lay sleeping on a thin mattress resting atop a rusted metal bed frame jillian was grateful she had been prepared for his disfigurement hey sleepyhead pearl said with surprising gentleness customers are wondering where you at did you forget to set an alarm manny jumped up rubbing his eyes mumbling something jillian could not understand did you hear it pearl asked did you hear him speak arabic what jillian said arabic he can barely put two words of english together but every now and then the poor bastard blurts out sentences in arabic how do you know we have a lot of arab clients one day one of them heard him said he didnt have much of an accent either amazing jillian said thats one of the reasons i think he was brainwashed maybe the arabs did something to him when he was over in iraq fighting who knows mannys eyes were glazed from sleep but jillian suspected they would not become more lucent even after hed been awake for hours nick was right vacant was the best description for manny ferris nick ill go find out about your friend pearl said reading her thoughts you stay here with my cousin dont worry youre safe pearl hurried up the stairs before she could respond hello manny jillian said keeping her voice intentionally calm and nonthreatening ive been looking for you i wanted to talk to you about some pictures that i took manny gazed at her blankly got to get to work he mumbled of course jillian said walking over to him but before you do i have some pictures i want to show you theyre of the lincoln memorial do you know that building she could see the color begin to drain from his face he took several cautious steps backward pinning himself into a corner no yes no dont worry manny nobody is going to hurt you i just want help knowing why you dont like that building can i show you some pictures they wont hurt you i promise no dont want to help mannys voice was hoarse and strained slowly jillian reached out and took his hand he made no attempt to pull away after a minute his tension began to abate come she said sit down here next to me a few more seconds and the frightened marine did as jillian asked and stared at the photos she had printed earlier that day at the lincoln memorial is there anything about what is in these pictures that upsets you think manny its important nothing jillian began to lose hope but when she arrived at the pictures taken from the rear of the memorial mannys tension returned and he began to shake she showed him the final shots of the day taken from the bike path across the potomac manny looked at the first picture and began to sob please no more jillian felt her pulse quicken as she studied the man its this shot isnt it manny this one from across the river this is a view you remember did something happen to you out there please tell me manny she implored what was it what happened to you there manny ferris could not or would not answer then the connection between them was broken by footsteps descending the wooden staircase billy pearl appeared grinning broadly my bouncer felix remembered your friend from the last time he was here and threw him out hes across the street felix says he was a real troublemakera pain in the butt you sure hes a doctor jillian laughed he drives around in a huge rv clinic taking care of poor people bad felix well at least thats one mystery solved did you get what you needed from manny im not sure jillian replied but i think i know where to start looking let me check my hospital and see if there are any doctors who might be able to help manny thanks id appreciate it come back anytime ill have felix bring your friend back in drinks are on me thanks jillian said but i think hed be just as happy with a few hundred pearl bucks chapter phillip maccandliss hated the zoo it wasnt the notion of captive wild animals he hated it was the specific place itselfthe national zoo off connecticut avenue he hated the commotion and the bratty children he hated walking on an unending bed of peanut shells and the overpriced crap food and cheap souvenirs but mostly he hated the smellthe odiferous stench of beasts pissing on straw beds buzzing with flies something about the rank smell reminded him of the majority of the vets who relentlessly harassed his office begging for handouts he assumed that his intense distaste for the place went back to the trips he had taken there with denise and the girls before she had left and poisoned them against him but it really didnt matter he hated the place and that was that why his cia contact had picked the zoo as his meeting point he had no idea an unfortunate coincidence was his best guess but by no means his only one they had ways of knowing thingseverything it was what they did apart from receiving a mysterious ipod delivered to him via interoffice mail the day after taking the assignment this meeting was the most spylike thing hed done the device came with a single preloaded song titled simply play me by listening to that track maccandliss learned how to use the ipod as a twoway radio as well as how to arrange a rendezvous with his contact in the event of trouble the song vanished from the ipod after one listen it was very mission impossible and maccandliss loved being a part of it all even if only a peripheral part now though there was legitimate trouble maccandliss had never had reason to use the emergency number before after dialing he hung up at the sound of a tone and synced the ipod with his computer as he had been instructed the sync operation added a new track to the ipod playlist it wasnt a song but a computer voice detailing the specific location at the zoo and the time when his contact would be waiting he synced the ipod again to erase the track his instructions were to proceed into the zoo from the lot b entrance at precisely eleven oclock buy a box of cracker jack and then take olmsted walk past the reptile discovery center at that point he was to put the ipod headphones on and await additional instructions maccandliss wondered about the early hour he had heard that crowds were the friend of the agency to his surprise there were already hordes of people strolling the paved walkways along with field trips that included what seemed to be every grammar and middle school student within fifty miles of the city coincidence doubtful this was the first time in over five years that maccandliss had set foot inside the place not coincidentally it had also been more than five years since he had seen or even spoken to melissa seventeen and cassie now fifteen la bitch had made certain of that years of badmouthing him and accusing him of abuse had the girls acting as if he was a cobra his only regret now was not having smacked denise more often when they were married at least then the girls would have something to get over with their therapists feeling as uncomfortable as if he were trying on new shoes maccandliss continued to walk the park the heat was forecast to be near record high and he wished he had dressed lighter he saw a boy about six standing in front of the glassenclosed gorilla yard the child clung to the string of his red balloon with one hand while slurping down a slush he held with the other the toxic neon blue drink had stained the bottom half of his face maccandliss had little patience for childreneven when his daughters were small as he neared the boy ducked under the guard railing and banged on the glass hi gorilla the boy called out can you say hello the boys mother a modestly dressed somewhat frumpy woman in her late thirties knelt down beside the youth to encourage her childs exuberance maccandliss cringed its not a parrot he said to the child its an ape and apes dont talk the boy spun around but moved too quickly and accidentally let go of his balloon maccandliss watched as the diminishing red dot shrank into the cloudless sky another reason to hate zoos maccandliss decided balloons that wasnt very nice the boys mother snapped but it was nevertheless madam the truth he said handing her a ten good day the truth his job was all about sifting through a dung heap of lies searching for it how many vets had embellished their psychiatric symptoms just to steal from the taxpayers by way of the government maccandliss wondered as he strolled off in victory what he hated most about his job at the va were the times when he was forced to be the liars enabler it sickened him what he enjoyed most was blocking ptsd benefit pay and watching how fast a seemingly helpless hapless vet found sustainable work of course standing up to the ptsd sissies was an unpopular position within the va though he knew of other bureaucrats who secretly felt the same way he did support for crooks left the best impression with his superiors along with the highest probability for promotion the key was doing things by the book but precisely by the book as long as the denial of benefits appeared to fit within regulatory guidelines the claims administrator who paid out the least was the one who got the most but the call from jericho now years ago had shown him that there were possible shortcuts if a man were willing to take some chances and accepting jerichos proposal had been a nobrainer now for the first time since becoming part of the operation his future was under attack there had been a security breach at the vermont avenue va office he adjusted his ipod headphones hello he said softly anybody there silence he continued along olmsted walk listening for his contact he wasnt entirely sure what to expect he was just passing underneath the heavy overhead wires by which the orangutans traversed the road from one cage to another when a mans deep voice spoke to him look up the voice said maccandliss did as instructed and immediately spied three hideously ugly orangutans traveling hand over hairy hand across the o line from the think tank to the great ape house on the opposite side of the walkway beautiful creatures arent they the voice said i didnt want you to miss that where are you maccandliss asked im here thats all you need to know jericho call me that if you wish just keep walking you dont have to speak so loudly your ipod was put together by people who know what theyre doing dont move your lips too much and youll appear as though youre singing to yourself understand cloakanddagger maccandliss thought these guys love cloakanddagger he couldnt tell if this was the same man who had initially contacted him on his unlisted home phone offering him a chance to help his country and his bank account in exchange for his services maccandliss was promised a significant jump in job grade and salary level a nobrainer two days later he was called into his supervisors office and informed hed been promoted proceed to lemur island the voice said arent those the animals that would follow each other anywhere even off a cliff that would be a lemming mr maccandliss and its a myth that the rodents commit mass suicide clearly youre not much of an animal lover only if theyre grilled medium rare and smothered with onions very well mr maccandliss assume that i can see you stop when you reach lemur island and look at the exhibit while we talk under no circumstances are you to turn around do not try to figure out who or where i am is that understood maccandliss felt a surge of anger he was treated like one of them but only when it suited their purposes well they were anonymous and he was set to take a fall if the security breach wasnt straightened out all he could do was to follow jerichos instructions and supply them with some names perhaps it was time to up the ante on his services when maccandliss was in position at lemur island the voice again spoke to him through his headset you sent word you needed to speak with us at the weekly staff meeting at my office we discussed security measures in the wake of a breach at the vermont avenue building i wasnt aware neither was i then i read the official report and a mana young black man from what we can tellusing a bogus id hacked into the desktop computer of a lowlevel account specialist then almost got caught getting away computer forensics traced the specific files that had been compromised and included that information in their report the intruder was looking for manny ferris one of our guys there was a prolonged silence are you still there im here do you know who the person was no but i did get a copy of the security tape it looks like a boya teenagerbut i dont know who he is as usual with the stoneage equipment they buy from convenience stores and allocate to the va the camera didnt get a clear shot of his face do you have the tape with you of course no nice job or great work we have ways of figuring those things out the voice said now listen carefully i want you to put the tape in your cracker jack box and drop it into the trash receptacle to your left then leave the park the way you came in well be in touch thats it yes thats it look im not comfortable with this anymore unlike most everyone in the va system the computer forensics people actually know what theyre doing i did a lot of research for you there are ways to connect me to ferris i said well be in touch thats not enough anymore maccandliss snapped aware of a sudden flush of nervous perspiration i want information i want to know exactly what im putting my neck on the line for we promised you promotions and youve gotten them well thats not enough anymore my job security might be shot if these forensics people keep digging i may end up in front of a judicial hearing i want to know what im involved in i dont know how deep this thing goes but im guessing deep enough maccandliss could not believe what he was hearing his own voice saying forget the promotions he went on i want cash and i want information or im going to dial forensics number before they dial mine i see and what sized bonus do you think would be appropriate half a million should cover what i would stand to lose from my pension if this situation blows up and i have to run maccandliss replied the uncertainty now gone from his voice thank you for bringing these matters to our attention mr maccandliss i understand your position and i will see that your concerns are addressed please rest assured that you will be well taken care of im deadly serious maccandliss said oh so are we chapter when his phone rangthe bach organ fugue in g minor koller had programmed for that numberhe knew jillian coates was calling paul regis he answered on the fifth ring already in character yes he said as his mind traveled back to that day in her condominium seizing upon the details that made her put so much trust and faith in the insurance investigator hello is this paul yes it is koller said can i help you paul its jillian coates you were at my condo last week jillian of course koller made certain his voice revealed both surprise and delight at her call what can i do for you well i was speaking with a friend of mine well not really a friend we just met actually naturally she was talking about dr nick garrity koller had followed her to the helping hands mobile medical unit but had tired of waiting for her when an hour passed after she disappeared inside the rv he had returned to his hotel and done some research on garritys operation and knew enough about the onetime army doctor and his shoestringbudget medical rv to feel certain that the man was hardly a threat so he said drumming his fingers on the desk does this new friend have anything to do with me no jillian said her laugh sounding somewhat forced i went to see him because because we have some friends in common in passing i happened to mention the fire and my persistent suspicion that having my sister being murdered one day and my apartment burning down just a couple of weeks later seems like more than a coincidence he agreed with me and promised to speak with a friend of his who is a detective on the washington police force do you know this detectives name koller was bouncing the eraser more rapidly and forcefully stupid jericho i dont know his name jillian said but i was wondering if you might send me a copy of your report so my friend nick can take it to him of course where are you staying jillian gave him the address of the nursing school dorm which he had already written down im so grateful to you paul do you expect to be in dc any time soon not that i know of but ill see what i can do im still busy trying to find a lead on belles murderer and ive used up most of my vacation time at work but as soon as things slow down for me ill call okay that would be terrific koller said wondering why she almost certainly was lying about how she knew garrity listen ill get a copy of the report and get it right off to you tomorrow thanks paul youre the best no jillian coates you are chapter this is easy how about giving me something really hard to do reggie shifted his gaze between the two computer monitors crammed sidebyside on his makeshift boardandcinderblock desk as his fingers deftly worked two keyboards simultaneously it was hard for nick to believe that he had known the kid for more than two years during which reggie smiths remarkable intellect and abilities had never been disclosed with jillians guidance manny ferris had managed to break through whatever had damaged his brain enough to single out a view of the rear of the lincoln memorial as being particularly disturbing to him now it was crucial to determine precisely where he had been and at least as important why he had been there nick jillian and junie stood clustered behind the gangly teen who was nothing short of a digital maestro conducting his symphony from the comfort of his wellworn swivel chair with no small flair for showmanship nick was aware of jillians closenessthe pressure of her shoulder against his the fresh scent of her hair he knew what was happening but after so many years he had trouble believing it the photograph that ferris had selected provided more than enough information for reggie he began with google maps and brought in some software of his own there was an air of tense anticipation as he worked in all after recreating the trees lining the potomac it took him no more than three minutes to locate what he said was the only building from which manny ferris could have a view across the river to the rear of the lincoln memorial voil√† the teen announced triumphantly this is it with a flourish he struck one more key and the monitors simultaneously changed their displays to show the same image nick and jillian leaned close to get a better look as reggie used his mouse to zoom in on the building so explain to me how you figured this out nick asked basically i used googles massive database of images which can be overlaid with different views like street detail terrain trees even satellite imagery when i typed the landmark lincoln memorial into the search field i was able to use the hybrid map and satellite view to pinpoint buildings on the same latitude based on distance i wrote a custom software program to calculate the number of stories high a building would have to be in order to get that view that narrowed it down to this building here in arlington virginia thats all there was to it did you follow me of course i did nick said his tongue firmly in his cheek i am after all an md i live only a few miles away from there jillian said i think i know that building with another touch of his computer mouse reggie changed views so that instead of looking down on the building from the satellite perspective they could see it from the street level as if they were looking at it head on oh the web is a beautiful thing reggie sang softly a beautiful thing a beautiful thing amazing nick said now i used to think i was traveling on the cutting edge of information technology now this stuff is like elfin magic to me nah you just didnt grow up with it is all jillian said right for me pong was revolutionary pong reggie asked never mind nick and jillian answered in unison exchanging amused glances nick could not help but continue to look at her she was vibrant and at ease and carried herself with a natural energy and grace as quick as the urge to take her into his arms came images of sarah invaded his thoughts im just not ready he told himself somehow though the words seemed more hollow than usual reggie can you zoom in any closer jillian asked i think i know what that building is for right on reggie said again changing the view i do know it ive ridden my bike past there a bunch of times its a medical spa i think they also do plastic surgery there plastic surgery nick said ill bet manny was a patient there hang on let me get the address then i should be able to look up the business name in seconds reggie had found not only the business name and address but also the companys web page singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center andover avenue arlington virginia nick read it says on the web site the business is owned by the worldfamousthats what it says worldfamousplastic surgeon paresh m singh look at his picture jillian said hes sort of cute i like the granny glasses so whats next junie asked i could get that nose job youve been telling me i need nick suggested and then scope the place out junie and reggie laughed wait that might not be such a bad idea jillian said we do need to get into that building and have a look around scheduling some sort of a tour of the place seems like the right thing to do junie nodded and you would get that tour because because im going to have major work done and want to visit several of the best plastic surgery centers before deciding where to have it and your husband dr deeppockets here of course wants to accompany you junie said husband nick replied ive always said youre a great catch very cute he said thanks for the suggestion there was a brief silence before jillian said she does have a point doc if we want to pull this off we really should go in as a team not just a team as a couple junie corrected a rich couple with a husband who wants his trophy wife to get some buffing up ninety percent of the women who have plastic surgery dont need it so that wont be an issue dont you think reggie she gave a light tap on the leg of reggies chair startling the teenager who actually jumped a bit oh yeah he stammered absolutely you should definitely be a couple for sure but you gotta be the part if youre gonna play the part what are you getting at reggie nick asked shooting the teen a reproachful look i mean you guys better like you know be all coupleykiss and all that to make it real you know oh thats good thinking reggie junie said scooping up the baton the lads right if you two cant convince us youre a couple youre certainly not going to convince the plastic surgeon that your intentions are real nick glared at junie who in turn just smiled and gave him an impish wave of her fingers then he glanced over to jillian who was shifting her weight from foot to foot with nervous energy but she also made no attempt to put the suggestions to bed you guys are ridiculous nick said just ridiculous we dont need any practice to without warning even to himself he took jillian by the waist bent his knees and dipped her backward toward the floor ballroom style then he leaned down and kissed her on the lips for a moment jillians eyes were open wide then slowly they closed as the kiss gained momentum her lips parted just a bit and his opened in response he slid one hand up her back and supported her head her hair felt like silk between his fingers two seconds ten a minutenick would never know how long that kiss lasted he did know that any sense of selfconsciousness vanished in the first instant with some reluctance he eased jillian upright and with his arm still set around her waist he turned to junie there was that believable enough for you he asked it was for me jillian said brushing her hair from her forehead and regaining her breath look reggie said with no regard for the subject he was changing they have a virtual tour of the building on the web site the place seems pretty fancy junie took a close look at the panoramic photomontage of the singh center lobby that reggie had put up on both monitors it was a massive sparkling white marble foyer with a working fountain in the center and several goldframed pieces of art hanging on the walls including a large portrait of singh himself just in case theyre watching nick said well probably need to pull up in some sort of highend auto certainly not the junker i drive there are rentals junie said itll be my treat first we need to make an appointment nick said jillian fished her phone out of her purse and dialed the main number she put the cell on speaker and brought her finger to her lips to remind the others to remain quiet a woman answered on the third ring she had an educated british accent good afternoon thank you for calling the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center this is daintry calnan speaking how may i be of service yes hello my name is collins mrs jefferson collins jillian said im planning to have some plastic surgery and im calling to schedule a tour of your facility and hopefully to arrange to meet dr singh referring physician daintry asked oh a doctor i met at a cocktail party at my friends the bronsteins jillian replied now comfortably in touch with her skill at improvisation i cant for the life of me remember his name when i told him what my husbandi mean what i wanted he told me your spa was the only place to go few would argue with that the receptionist replied we do have availability for a consultation with dr singh in three weeks that would include a tour of our facility oh three weeks is simply too far away for us im afraid that wont do i was hoping to see your surgical center tomorrow actually its the only time that works for my schedule i do a great deal of volunteer work at the childrens hospital you know if not tomorrow then im afraid ill simply have to look elsewhere as your doctor friend at the bronsteins said this is the topoftheline facility for any sort of plastic surgery would you mind my asking what specific procedure you were thinking of having done well several of them jillian said several yes im considering some extensive work id rather not discuss it over the phone mrs collins you are aware that plastic procedures done here usually cost tens of thousands of dollars none of which is likely to be covered by your insurance plus theres a week or so of residence in our very exclusive spa hotel yes im quite aware of the cost i would expect nothing less from a facility with your reputation this is a gift from my husband he invents software you know then builds a company then sells it then builds another one this next sale will be the fifthno no the sixth time hes done it silence um well then in that case hold a moment please classical music piped out from jillians cell phone speaker she put a finger to her lips again to remind everybody to stay quiet fifteen seconds later daintry came back on the line well i have some good news she announced it appears we had a schedule cancellation that wasnt in our computer system yet tomorrow afternoon will work just fine shall we say three we shall say that jillian replied giving her audience a thumbsup she clicked her cell phone shut after finalizing the tour time and getting specific directions from mclean virginia where she lied about living the three standing around her looked at one another in stunned disbelief you were incredible nick said finally absolutely incredible i was blanche in our school production of streetcar reggie please write down jillian and jefferson collins so we dont forget our names you can borrow my wedding band junie said chapter franz kollers mood brightened as soon as the surgeon began to stir the gammahydroxybutyrate one of the newer of the socalled daterape drugs was wearing off it had been easier than he expectedmuch easierto orchestrate her nonkill the main problem he needed to overcome was that except for her surgical practice and teaching obligations dr abigail spielmann lived a virtually monastic existence he had followed her for five days and had entered her east side brownstone three times each time easily disabling the antiquated security system he had rigged up microcameras in her secondfloor study and her thirdfloor bedroom searching for any secret lifeany devianceon which he could build his kill what he found was a dull woman of fifty unmarried and as far as he could tell asexual she returned home every evening at about nine poured a large glass of a highpriced syrah and went to her study to write at ten having finished the wine she repaired to her bedroom read for ten or fifteen minutescurrently an indira gandhi biographyand drifted off to sleep somewhere in the early morning she awoke briefly went to the bathroom and then turned off the bedside light dull unbelievably dull and soon dead on his second visit inspecting her kitchen koller hit pay dirt a corked halffilled bottle of the syrah on the counter and a beesting kit with an epinephrine autoinjector in the refrigerator worldfamous abigail spielmann the foremost authority on surgery involving cardiac tumors had an achilles heel koller wondered if he had made some sort of error in his calculations of the amount of ghb he had dropped into her wine the halflife of the magnificent drug was just half an hour it was a friday evening and she wouldnt be discovered until there was nothing in her body left to detect but by his estimate she should have been lucid an hour ago koller was confident the delay would not derail his plans any the bees in his mason jar were doing just fine spielmann could not sit up although she was trying now koller had lashed his marks ankles and wrists to the posts of her mahogany bed frame using his beloved velcro restraints he had carefully inserted his little red ball into the womans mouth before she could scream he found the confusion and fear exploding in her eyes intoxicating good evening doctor he began my name is koller franz koller its a pleasure to meet such a distinguished physician spielmanns attempt to talk or scream came out a muted choked sob once the security system was disabled handling the lock on her front door was childs playfor a very experienced creative child when he first started his research while seated behind her in the vast hospital cafeteria koller slipped her key ring out from her purse made clay impressions and dropped it back later using the molds he created duplicates of the keys from flattened soda cans and used a tension wrench to insert and turn them he had learned the trick years ago from a locksmith friend who suggested that bringing a clay impression to a locksmith was asking for a report to the police the doctor kept up her struggle against the restraints valiantly but without success koller dressed in his surgical garb placed a gloved hand on her shoulder to calm her clutched in his other hand was the beesting kit he had just taken from her purse he made certain that she saw it you know what this is dr spielmann koller said in his calmest voice the kit itself isnt at all frightening this however would be worthy of a scream if you could koller leaned over the side of the bed and retrieved the mason jar containing eight large honeybees spielmanns body shook violently beads of sweat formed on her brow then dripped into her eyes each bee had a white thread tied neatly around its body the threads dangled down the outside of the mason jar like octopus arms holding one thread koller opened the top of the jar extracting one of the bees then quickly sealed the jar before any others could escape have you ever seen a man fly a bee before dr spielmann a funny little sight isnt it its blessedly simple to do actually you place the bee inside a film canister then freeze it for about ten minutes the cold knocks the little fella unconscious allowing its keepermeto tie the string around its little body without getting stung myself though that would only hurt me you of course are a different story altogether without your epipen this guy would kill you spielmann thrashed against her restraints koller pulled down on the thread guiding the buzzing bee hovering above his head onto the exposed skin of spielmanns right arm i wouldnt struggle much if i were you koller said might piss him off and youd best not scream when i take out that ball bad things might happen as usual koller was careful to avoid her teeth as he plucked the red ball from her mouth the bee perhaps tired from its brief flight walked in a circle on her arm abigails respirations were labored close to hyperventilation what what do you want she breathed i want to talk a moment koller said but if you try to scream the ball goes in followed by the stinger understand yes she whispered hoarsely what do you want from me i have money im well paid to be here koller said but thank you anyway first i want you to know just how truly impressed i am with you and your accomplishments doctor abigail stammered i i dont understand youve pioneered techniques for robotic surgery that i am certain will be a lasting legacy youre going to be well remembered dr spielmann i do hope you know that the bee floated off her arm and danced erratically above her head before coming to a rest on the comforter spielmann traced the insects path with frightened eyes as it slowly crawled up her shoulder inching across her neck then onto her face before taking flight again please stop see we have a lot in common you and i koller continued our life is our work neither of us has any children weve never bothered with marriage no our passion has been our careers and youve done a marvelous job with yours ill pay you to leave abigail sobbed her tears rolled unabated down her cheeks our work i guess is our children our labor of love isnt it doctor but have you ever stopped to truly appreciate each moment of your day i mean when youre cutting out those nasty cardiac tumors with that robot of yours have you ever asked yourself if this could be the last surgery youll perform if you knew it was to be the last would you treat that procedure any different from the others savor each cut and stitch in a way you never had before why are you asking me this her voice was weak and shaky the bee was airborne again this time it landed on koller who didnt even flinch you see i think about these things koller continued i constantly ask myself is this the last time ill ever do this again most parents cant remember the last night they carried their tired little munchkin off to beddybye but sure as sunrise and sunset that night does come its a shame when such a monumental moment passes without proper acknowledgment i wont let that happen to me koller slipped the ball back into her mouth using the thread he guided the bee onto spielmanns arm then pinned the insect onto her flesh with his thumb and index finger despite trying to be gentle he used too much force and crushed the bee before it could sting dang koller said wiping up the small mess with a tissue good thing i have some backups with me koller retrieved a second bee from the mason jar marveling a moment at the artful way the thread traced the bees erratic flight path i mean i have killed surgeons beforea couple of times in fact but i dont know if im ever going to be hired to kill another surgeon again koller continued think about it that would mean you would be the last surgeon i ever kill the assassin paused a moment clearly deep in thought i have to really really embrace this moment you cant record these feelings the smell of your apartment your fear but if you believe it might be the very last time you do something its best to approach it with deserved reverence you might not be the last surgeon but then again you might koller pulled the string tied around the honeybee until the insect came to a rest on the fleshy anterior triangle of spielmanns neck she tried frantically to flick it away by tilting her head and flexing the muscles of her neck but koller held the bee in place he agitated it the wings were a blur of motion its legs marched helplessly as it tried to free itself then probably fearing for its life the honeybee stung to escape it tore away part of its abdomen leaving behind its stinger and deadly venom sac where the medical examiner would certainly find it koller knew the muscles of the sting apparatus continued to pulsate injecting more venom deeper into spielmanns skin a threeinch swollen welt materialized almost instantaneously on spielmanns neck her eyes were the size of silver dollars within seconds more hivelike bumps started popping up all over her face arms and legs it was what koller expected would occur in a systemic allergic reaction her lips and eyelids began to swell too and it was clear to koller that the ball in her mouth wasnt helping her breathing any he waited a few minutes before taking it out by then her airway had swollen closed enough to make screaming impossible next he undid her restraints then he watched as she rolled off the bed and landed hard on the oriental rug she was crawling on her hands and knees in a desperate attempt to get to the stairs leading to her kitchen i wish i was a betting man koller said smiling down at her because i would bet when you get to your refrigerator you wont find your prescription allergy kit there then again maybe you will with her strength failing rapidly abigail spielmann reached the head of the stairs then she fell tumbling over and over before coming to rest twenty feet from her gourmet kitchen incredibly she still managed to get to her hands and knees again inch by inch as her body continued to swell and redden she made it to her refrigerator pulling open the door required a herculean effort her eyes were swollen shut now her breaths came in sporadic wheezing fits koller watched unblinking absorbing her every move there were no glass jars to crash on the floor and disturb the neighbors koller had already removed them and would break a few in a plastic bag to scatter about the kitchen floor before leaving the only items to spill out in her frantic search for the kit were those he put within her reach a head of lettuce a plastic bottle of ketchup and two sticks of butter spielmann collapsed facefirst onto the cold tile floor the cool air from the open refrigerator bathing her now lifeless body koller placed the prescription allergy kit a foot away nicely done any moment can be our last dear doctor he said sadly this is yours chapter mr and mrs jefferson collins arrived at the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center at precisely three earlier in the day daintry calnan had called with the news that dr paresh singh had been called out of town for an emergency consultation she tried to reschedule their appointment but jillian told her that for the time being it would suffice if they were able to tour the facility it will save us time when we do get to come in and schedule my surgery with dr singh the novelty of their plan had worn off and the reality was sinking in despite her theater background jillian had never had any talent for lying or deceit now she used mental images of belle and memories of their last conversation together to keep her focus under some modicum of control nick was at least a seven on the sud scale starting to freak out on the edge of some definitely bad feelings you can maintain control with difficulty he had not shared the fact that he had suffered through another bad night restlessness insomnia nightmares freefloating anxiety even leg crampsthe works brain chemistry run amok as usual there was nothing transpiring in his personal life to correlate with the flareupnothing of course except the sudden arrival in it of jillian coates as exciting as it was to feel himself falling for a woman it was also as frightening as his ptsd episodes themselves how could he ever even consider bringing someone into the bog that was his recurrent mental turmoil perhaps whenifthey caught up with umberto perhaps then the receptionist daintry was posted by the massive glass doors watching their approach she was a statuesque blonde in her early forties although jillian had trouble being certain about that fact due she suspected to the artistry of the womans employer by the time they had exchanged handshakes the receptionist had obviously sized them up and decided they were the stuff of which patients of the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center were made the combination lobby and reception area was even more imposing than the web site had led them to expect the vast spacenearly all marblefeatured an eightfoothigh fountain in the center and huge original artwork on three walls seated behind a marble counter to one side of the lobby wearing a dark suit tailored to show off his linebackers build was a security guard with a square jaw and a plastic id around his neck thats a shelby stone id jillian whispered to nick i guess this place is directly affiliated with the hospital nick and jillian were both wondering about manny and umberto at this point the connection between the two soldiers was tenuousidentical somewhat casual remarks made four years ago by each man regarding their return to the military and their enrollment in a topsecret covert mission in addition manny was much more of a candidate for plastic surgery than a product of it still both nick and jillian had seen mannys powerful reaction to the vista they believed he had seen from high up in this building looking around at the opulence surrounding them it was hard to believe either manny or umberto ever had anything to do with the place but now it was time to home in on that possibility so daintry said passing a price list across to jillian i will check once you have given me your insurance but it is doubtful they will provide coverage for any of our procedures im sure that wont be a problem jillian said yes yes of course daintry passed over a tastefully done brochure and encouraged the collinses to visit any floors that were available by elevator i have a patient coming in for preadmission she said otherwise i would be glad to accompany you can i please see one of the suites where i might be staying for my recuperation jillian asked the actual suites are locked or occupied but ill unlock the sixth floor where some of them are located once youre staying here youll need a room key to access your floor i cant imagine you wont be totally pleased with your suite it will have all the amenities you could ask for plus a spectacular view of the city some very famous hollywood personalities have stayed there and they have had nothing but praise for it i would like to see the operating room or rooms nick said i once had a bad outcome with knee surgery and i prefer to be as careful as possible around hospitals our two operating rooms are not in use at this time but the elevator will take you to the observation balcony one floor above them there was something about the receptionists expression that made nick uneasya look of mistrust perhaps had they already said or done something wrong jillian took his arm as they headed for the elevator her closeness did away with much of the anxiety he was feeling the two operating rooms were located undergroundfloor b the button was at the bottom of a column that went down to b and up through l to a row of five keyholes across the base of the stainlesssteel plate confirmed that some of the floors could be closed off or accessed only after being unlocked the security measures were no surprise privacy was the watchword of the rich b opened onto the observation balcony above the ors themselves viewed through glass or plexiglas from the overhead walkway the rooms were gleaming spaces with stateoftheart operating microscopes and monitoring equipment along with screens most likely used to display projections of the befores and afters of noses jawlines chins wattles eyes lips and the like both nick and jillian were impressed with the scene below them it was impossible not to be if plastic surgery were a religion the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center was the mother church jillian turned and headed back to the elevator nick was about to follow when he saw movement through the small glass window in the door to the operating room just below him a moment later the door opened and in came a tall thin figurea woman it appearedwith a hair cover surgical mask maroon scrubs shoe covers and latex gloves nick pulled back from the edge of the balcony so he was probably out of her line of sight and watched as she went directly to a floortoceiling steel cabinet against one wall retrieved a large sterilized cellophanewrapped instrument tray and quickly made her way back out of the room nick waited a few seconds for her to return and then gave up and followed after jillian his thoughts were spinning the woman might have had something to do with a central equipment supply room but why would she be comingrushing was a more appropriate wordinto an unoccupied or dressed as if she had just left an active or and why would she need a sterilized instrument tray if as daintry had said there were no operations taking place that day more likely she was a nursepossibly a circulating nurse specially trained to oversee all aspects of patient care and nursing performance during an operation there was a haste and purposefulness to her movements that suggested she needed to get the tray back to an ongoing procedure but there were no surgeons in the building and no operating rooms in useat least not on this floor the second floor is the gym jillian said studying the brochure as they walked on excessively plush carpeting past the closed mahogany doorways of the offices of paresh singh the nursing supervisor and the business manager and the lap pool is also on two at the end of this hallway is the family waiting area pretty amazing place pretty amazing nick echoed he scanned the corridor noting the security cameras at each end the medispa for all of its elegance gave him the creeps there was something cold and lifeless about the place he was anxious to share with jillian what he had seen in the or and the conclusions he had drawn but he sensed that they hadnt really been alone for a moment they took the elevator to the sixth floor suites a and b were locked but at the end of the corridor was a sitting area enclosed by huge plateglass windows the vista was an unobstructed panorama over the treetops to washington the view including the back of the lincoln memorial was spectacular but hardly unexpected they had seen something almost identical on reggies computer screen nicks jaw was clenched he felt almost certain that daintry calnan had lied to them when she said there were only two operating rooms and no surgery going on he wanted more than anything to get down to level b and see if there were other operating rooms and if one or more of them were in use more likely judging by the size of the two operatories they saw there was a b floor probably accessed by one of the key slots in the elevator of course he thought there also had to be a stairway down from b maybe he could find it somehow the image of the broadshouldered security guard plus the plethora of monitoring cameras they had passed during their tour argued for restraint any unusual movement in the building would be noticed immediately bad idea can you imagine either of our two friends basking in this place jillian asked nick wanted to warn her to say as little as possible but she seemed to have picked up on his concern and conveyed that fact to him with her eyes only as our guests he replied can you think of anything else we should be looking for darling just our car the security guard in the lobby looked as if he hadnt budged since their arrival daintry appeared to be expecting them quite a place nick said im pleased you like it jillian took the womans hand all we need to do is meet the doctor and plan the surgery she said daintry seemed pleased once at the car in the rear parking lot nick stood beside his door and then asked jillian to join him and gaze back at the medispa whats the deal she asked the deal is that this is a bad place daintry calnan is certainly a bit on the chilly side ill give you that more like an iceberg but theres more shes also a liareither a liar or the most uninformed receptionist imaginable ill tell you about what i saw in the or when were on the way home but suffice it to say that i believe dr paresh singh is not only in the building but performing surgery at this very minute performing where when were away from here we can speculate first take a look at the place gaze at it lovingly okay im doing lovingly how many floors do you remember from the elevator not counting the basement ones seven counting the lobby okay now count up starting from l quickly though im certain the dragon lady is watching and i dont want her to suspect what were doing one two three four five six seven eight nine but exactly i counted on the way in im quirky about numbers there are two floors that no one not even the elevator wants to acknowledge even exist lets talk on the way home mrs collins i dont think i want to trust this place with my body mrs collins replied chapter the psychiatric wing of shelby stone memorial hospital was overcrowded and understaffed which for jillian meant it was business as usual she was halfway through a grueling twelvehour shift the second in as many days still for her work had always been a refuge and getting outside of herself taking on the challenge of caring for the sick the sad and the confused had almost always given her strength since belles death it seemed that she needed work and her patients more than ever this had been an especially challenging afternoon beds on the psych unit and throughout the hospital for that matter were filled the interns and residents on the er were nearing the end of their training year and were shipping patients up to the wards with minimal workups jillians feet had begun swelling beyond what her white canvas work shoes could comfortably contain and now she had been assigned a new admission for whom there would not be a bed available for several hours if that a somnolent jaundiced alcoholic man probably in his sixties he should have been admitted to a medical floor his right eye was discolored and swollen almost shut diagnosis acute and chronic alcohol intoxication possible impending delirium tremens typical the diagnosis of alcoholism of any kind would not have gotten the fellow past the managed care gatekeepers and off the er but impending dts would despite the fact that the condition only occurred after cessation of drinking technically every active drinker had impending dts now instead of offering him privacy jillian had no choice but to treat the poor guy in the hallway it was not that shelby stone was a bad hospital the nursing service had won many awards and national acclaim it was more that the sprawling institution was just unwieldy much of the time and the patient population was so ill she had taken the mans vital signs and was in the midst of changing his iv bag when nick wearing jeans sneakers and a plaid western shirt appeared at her side he reminded her of trapper john md from mash with his bushy reddish brown hair that seemed extra wild today actually she acknowledged she liked that look a lot hey you jillian said this is a fun surprise we brought the rv in early to pick up some supplies and have it serviced at a place that does it for free sign me and my honda up nick nodded down at her patient lying quietly on his hospital gurney jillian had pushed the rolling bed up against the wall so at least they werent blocking foot traffic i always believed that if there were no alcohol there would hardly be any hospitals nick said i havent worked inpatient for a while but im guessing triage to the hallway isnt exactly hipaa compliant its not exactly joint commission sanctioned either but we had our jcaho certification approved last month so i think were all safe to behave badly for another year what brings you to paradise i havent stopped thinking about you since we met thats what that bizarre tour we took of the medispa just wont clear out of my head nick said instead im just not sure what our next move should be its been haunting me too between manny ferriss freakout daintry getting her signals crossed about the whereabouts of the surgeons those mysterious unaccountedfor two floors and the nurse showing up in the deserted operating room i think there is cause for concern besides daintry just seems like someone with secrets nick was paying attention but he was also reflexively checking the battered mans pulse at the wrist and neck then pulling open his lids and examining his eyes with a penlight he had plucked from jillians breast pocket next he gently palpated his belly finally he glanced at the plastic id bracelet on his wrist and bent close to his ear ray its dr nick garrity can you hear me open your eyes if you can hear me he put some uncomfortable pressure on rays breastbone with the knuckle of one index finger ray come on ray open your eyes jillian have you or any of the docs examined him yet i assume they looked at him downstairs maybe not as carefully as they might have i heard its a zoo down there i was getting ready to go over him when you got here something the matteri mean other than the obvious dunno for certain nick said but i think his right pupil is slightly larger than the left subdural jillian asked referring to the lifethreatening collection of blood expanding between the skull and brain that often followed head trauma a lot of folks have gotten ct scans of their heads for less indication than this nick said i think he could certainly use one and i would say sooner rather than later if youre right doc you didnt just drop by to see me you were sent by a higher power nonsense were a team the jefferson collinses if a subdurals there you would have picked it up to the hospitals credit within five minutes of jillians call residents from psych and neurosurgery were on the scene and ten minutes after that ray goodings was on his way down for a ct scan when this place works it works jillian said looking up at him with an expression he wanted to capture and bottle for future use how about you wait in the lounge if you have time i have some reporting to do about how poor ray could have just made it off our service before he was ever really on it thirty minutes later she entered the lounge unable to contain her excitement subdural she said simply pretty big one too according to the psych resident who went down with him rays on the neurosurgery service now what a man you are five minutes in this hospital and you save a patients life and make a heroine out of one of the nurses no wonder they call you dr fury mentioning the words sent a shadow across her face hey nice going nick said clasping her shoulders and hoping he could soften her thoughts of belle you were connected to that guy thats what this caregiving stuff is all about connection jillian glanced about then stood on her tiptoes and kissed him gently theres more where that came from she whispered now where do you want to start well lets step back some and look at what we already know we think poor manny might have some connection to umberto based on what mcbean told me and we believe umberto has some connection to belle based on the nick fury comic books you found in her apartment we also believe that mannys reaction to the photographs is a result of his having been a patient at the medispa and umberto is between manny and belle hes the one linked to each of them so what are you getting at i think we need to take a close look at what happened at the medispa around the time umberto and manny disappeared by that you mean check out the patient records from four years ago see if we can learn anything do you think umberto was also a patient there i dont know but its worth investigating to see if the timing might be a missing link four years excuse me for saying so but thats a stretch jillian rose and walked over to the single narrow window the panoramic view of virginia and the potomac from the seventh floor was breathtaking she followed a sailboat skimming across diamond ripples when belle was a child the two of them loved to go out together on their familys sunfish then suddenly they were orphans and now belle herself was gone jillian felt completely adrift whenifthey found belles killer would it really put an end to the profound emptiness she battled each day the possibility gave her hope and at the moment that hope was all she could really ask for fighting the fullness in her throat jillian returned to the table i agree its worth looking into she said okay i spent a little time on the internet the singh medispa is a joint venture between paresh singh and your employer shelby stone memorial hospital remember that badge on the security guard i do one of the brochures in the medispa lobby said its been that way since before i started working here ten years ago so since youre an employee of shelby stone memorial you should be able to access the electronic medical records for the spa assuming the two facilities share the data we can start by looking at medispa patients from four years ago and work our way back from there we have a computer near the nurses station let me see what i can do jillian exited the lounge and followed the circular corridor to the nurses station where they had recently installed a computer kiosk she parked herself in front of the kiosk which was really just a laptop computer locked inside a black metal case providing employees access to various applications including shift and medication schedules room assignments and of course electronic medical records the psych floor was one of the first to get trained on the new emr system affectionately known among the nurses as the even more redundancy application jillian logged in to her account but accessing records other than those of her own patients was clearly an ethical breach she launched the emr application and clicked on the pulldown menu for facility name as nick had suspected there was an entry for the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center in addition to other facilities connected to shelby stone memorial when she tried to access those records however jillian got a permission denied popup dialog box followed by a loud and somewhat startling error beep logging off quickly and smiling sheepishly as if she had made an inadvertent mistake jillian returned to the nurses lounge i cant get access so much for plan a nick said but wait there actually is a plan b lets go down and check on ray then i can scrounge maybe twenty minutes if the floor is still quiet we can take a trip down to the records room and see if we can get those files the oldfashioned way there still is an oldfashioned way last i heard within the hour the neurosurgery resident told them ray goodings would be in the or having a drainage procedure then the hard work would beginfinding a way to get him off booze and into recovery turns out shipping him to the psych ward in error may have saved him jillian said maybe this experience will scare him into sobriety providing he even remembers it every time an alcoholic stops drinking theres a possibility that this will be it and hell never have to stop again i like the way you think nurse taking the patient elevator down to subbasement level two the pair emerged into a windowless dank and eerily quiet hallway makes manny ferriss bedroom seem like a suite at the four seasons jillian muttered this area used to be the very center of the hospital i have to come down here less and less as the changeover to emrs progresses but i really hate it when i do i think the records roomwhats left of itis the last door on the right they proceeded along the dimly lit corridor with their eyes adjusting to the gloom as they went who on earth works down here nick asked ive only met him a couple times the mole they call him jillian said but his real name is mollender saul mollender i think i heard that when the whole emr unit was created and moved to the top two floors of the corwin building he just stayed a dinosaur at the corridors end was a classroomstyle door with a frostedglass windowpane upon which painted in peeling letters were the words record room jillian opened the door without bothering to knock it was a cavernous space made somewhat claustrophobic by a drop ceiling and row upon row of stacked cardboard storage cartons and tall metal shelving units a number of which were still packed with colorcoded patient records the only other furniture in the room was a slatecolored fiberboard desk positioned directly in front of the entrance saul mollender sat in his chair behind the desk there was a large stack of records piled neatly on top of the otherwise uncluttered surface no photos no pictures on the wall no calendar the topmost patient record folder was flipped open and mollender cadaverously thin with graying hair and wirerimmed glasses appeared to be entering data from it into his computer can i help you he asked not bothering to look up from his work his voice was nasally and his tone unfriendly yes jillian said im sorry to trouble you but mollender cut her off no youre not really sorry youre here arent you if you were really sorry you would have acted on that fact and left me alone for a moment jillian was speechless well yes but what i mean to say is that im trying to access some records but the system wont allow me name of the patient at this mollender groaned and closed the file he was examining as he looked up at jillian he took off his oval spectacles the lenses nearly as large as his owllike eyes your name jillian jillian coates rn seventh floor mollender put his glasses back on and keyed her name into his computer what records the patient again mollender groaned do you see this stack of paper he said he tapped his index finger repeatedly on the file of folders his tone seemed even more annoyed than before yes well these arent going to key themselves into our system despite what the optical character recognition software people seem to think so i dont really have time for your lack of clarity ms coates facility what facilitys records are you trying to access oh right the records are from the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center its jointly owned by mollender cut her off again i know what it is but you cant see them yes i know i cant see them thats why im here no by cant see them i mean not authorized to see them do not have the proper permissionthat kind of cant see them but arent the records in our system well of course they are he said as though she had just asked if air was necessary to breathe theyre in our system assuming theyre not more than ten years old and my dwindling staff and i havent keyed them in manually yet manual data entry if you didnt already know is very error prone which is why distractions are deadly or did you not read the sign he pointed behind them where a handwritten sign taped to the door read precisely that distractions are deadly but despite our archaic methods of record management we have what is known as a firewall ever heard of it computer security nick said whos the boy genius mollender quipped dr nick garrity jillian said no longer bothering to disguise her growing irritation so what can i do to get access to the files well you could go get a job there i hear theyre hiring cute jillian countered now i understand all those employeeofthemonth awards on that empty wall over there she found herself purposely leaning over mollenders desk getting into his personal space the man really was pathetic she had never hit a person before but the mole was inspiring such thoughts what else can we do nick asked its a firewall sir mollender reiterated that means no access unless authorized so unless in your spare time you or ms nurse here are hobbyist computer hackers youre sol sol jillian asked and i thought you medical types were acronym happy that means shit out of luck youve been very helpful mr mollender nick said jillian shot nick a confused look leaning in close nick whispered a single word into jillians ear reggie he said chapter the followup appointment for mr and mrs jefferson collins was on a friday three days after their initial tour they picked up the sclass mercedes at the rental agency at the last possible minute and nick took on the payment at four hundred dollars per day plus tax he could not allow junie to rent the car again but he did admit to jillian that he was going to miss driving it beneath a somber sky he guided the machine to a buttersmooth stop on the brick driveway in front of the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center im terrified nick im not sure i can pull this off nick himself was so distracted and anxious about what was to ensue at the medispa that at first he did not even respond hello are you with me nick im here nick said gently patting her knee i was just going over the plan in my head well do great i promise nick put the car in park but kept the engine idling check the bag again he said i did that just before we left we only have one crack at this jill check it again i mean please check it again dammit im sorry i am really crazed that were doing this i have no idea what will happen to us if we get caught but i suspect whatever it is will involve the suspension of our licenses to practice we can back out now if you want jillian thought about it i would give up everything to find belles killer if were right about the singh center somehow being connected to her death what choice do i really have nick simply nodded he felt the same way about umberto the debt he owed the man could never truly be repaid there were times since the nightmare of the explosion when he found himself wishing that umberto hadnt raced back that morning to save his life but over the years since his involvement with junie and helping hands and emdr those instances had all but vanished and now there was jillian everything that was good in his life everything that lay ahead for him he could link to his friendship with the dominican if something sinister had happened to umberto that could be connected to paresh singh then getting to the bottom of it was worth any risk jillian must have sensed nicks growing concern because she took hold of his hand and looked deep into his eyes well be okay doc besides i loaded up on pepto before we left and then did something i almost never do i took a betablocker to combat all this adrenaline and keep my heart from exploding out of my chest their anxiety was understandable but their plan had a decent chance of working despite junies objections to it for being overly risky the entire scheme hinged on getting jillian alone with the computer in paresh singhs office for better or worse almost everything depended on nick being able to sell a bogus injury severe enough to frighten daintry calnan and have her make her boss come to his aid reggie estimated they would need jillian to be alone in singhs office for five minutes nicks acting job would be a delicate one daintry had to be upset enough to call singh down to the lobby but not so frightened that she dialed nick had no desire to be calling don reese begging for another favor if things came to that all hope of penetrating paresh singhs computer would be lost jillian unzipped her bag and peeked inside she sifted through the contents mostly cosmetics before extracting the small twogig usb key reggie had given her earlier its here she announced whats on this thing again nick tried to recall reggies exact words but when he was unable to do so he opted to read them from his jacket pocket he pulled out the folded piece of paper containing the instructions the teen had printed out its called a rootkit nick said its used to disguise the fact that a computer system has been compromised remember all you have to do is plug that usb key into the usb port you locate somewhere on the computer and double click the program icon on the screen to launch it sounds simple enough put the key in the port and double click the icon best laid plans nick muttered to himself unfortunately he spoke loud enough for jillian to hear and she shot him a distressed panicky look im sorry i shouldnt have said that well be fine nick said though his words failed to reassure himself nick reread reggies detailed instructions one last time for jillians benefit as well as his own he tried to summarize the technical aspects of the plan i guess whats on here will install some sort of backdoor access allowing reggie to create as he wrote here a vpna virtual private network tunnelinto the system through a proxy server i dont know anything about vpns and proxy servers you really trust him with this nick i mean most kids his age spend their free time shooting hoops not hacking computer systems actually he does that too pretty well to tell you the truth but i trust him if he says it will work all we have to do is our part okay then were ready lets sync our watches it was imperative that jillian know exactly when nick planned on initiating his diversion she had to be ready to move the instant paresh left her alone in his office being even a minute off schedule could result in failure or worse you just sell it jillian said if i get my chance ill do my part thats a promise ive had this injury for years and my knee still really does lock from time to time ill sell it no problem are you ready mrs collins ready mr collins nick eased the benz around to the spacious partially filled parking lot at the rear of the building to luck nick said touching her lips with his but not forcefully enough to disrupt her perfectly applied makeup delicious he exited the mercedes and walked around to her door you look beautiful he said as she stepped out of the car jillians ruby lips flashed a movie star smile worthy of any red carpet but nick could feel the tension in her grasp and see it in her eyes the rear of the singh building was nearly identical to the front their figures reflected handsomely in the elevenfoot windows that ran the width of the structure the security desk was to the right just on the other side of the glass but there was no sign of the militialike guarda definite break provided the man stayed away they felt the sudden drop in temperature from the airconditioning as they stepped into the resplendent marble foyer daintry austere behind her marble desk rose to greet them welcome back mr and mrs collins she said taking first jillians hand then nicks her grip like everything else about her seemed rehearsed and controlled thank you for fitting us in the way you have nick replied reminding himself not to lose sight for a moment of the fact that the woman had things to hide as was the case with their previous visit to the spa it surprised and slightly embarrassed him that acting rich and arrogant wasnt totally unpleasant dr singh is upstairs in his office he shouldnt be long no security man today garth no hes here but at the moment hes off making rounds im impressed that you take security so seriously careful nick warned himself you may look the part and even act the part for short spurts but this woman is used to the real deal mess with her and shell sniff you out as a fraud in a heartbeat nick took jillian by the waist and guided her over to a towering work of art that filled half of the rear wall ready to roll he whispered she took a deep breath and exhaled slowly i confess im glad i wont be here to watch youve still got the tough job but there is one encouraging sign yeah whats that my knee is actually starting to ache chapter nick and jillian spent the first ten minutes of their second visit to the medispa fidgeting in the sitting area to the right of the receptionists desk i do apologize for the delay daintry said seeming genuinely concerned ill ring the doctor and see if hell be much longer i know that he is very eager to meet you both im sure hell be here soon as if on cue nick heard the chime of one of the elevators as it arrived at the lobby level the polished brass doors glided open and out stepped paresh singh the surgeon slightly built with a thin mustache and wirerimmed spectacles was singularly unimposing except for his eyes which were piercing and dark and his smallish hands expertly manicured and featuring a number of rings that were probably worth more than nick claimed on last years tax return he was no more than fivefootseven and although his jetblack hair was razor cut and his suit finely tailored nick found it a stretch to believe that the man was world renowned and the master of this glassandsteel palace so singh said after the formalities of introduction his accent clipped british with a modest amount of indian i apologize for the delay and hope that daintry has taken good care of you she has been with me since the beginning and i would be absolutely lost without her shes been wonderful nick said youre lucky to have her dr singh daintry said as you requested ive had the solarium prepared for mrs collinss private meeting nick and jillian immediately exchanged sideways glances they had seen the solarium on their tourplants sculptures and waterfalls but no computer all nick could do was shrug the plus of having the security guard off on rounds had just been trumped by this latest turn why had he thought for even a moment that their plan would come off without a hitch but this hitch was potentially fatal jillian meeting with singh in some luddite heaven devoid of the one thing they needed was certainly not part of their strategy if nicks sud score had been hovering around a six it just shot up close to an eight freaking out the beginning of alienation he calmed himself with thoughts of a buddhist quote from a college philosophy course that had stuck with him throughout the years there are two mistakes one can make on the road to truthnot going all the way and not starting now he decided a third mistake needed to be added not possessing a backup plan jillian perhaps sensing his panic stepped in for the save well she said clearing her throat i hope the solarium is equipped with a computer i wanted to show you pictures of movie stars and models with the sort of features we would like me to have and ill need internet access for that most understandable paresh singh answered we can just convene in my office bless you mrs collins that would be perfect nick said ill be waiting here with daintry take as long as you need he glanced down at his watch and unseen by the others jillian checked hers precisely ten minutes until showtime jillian air kissed nick near the cheek and then spinning around accompanied singh toward the elevator im so looking forward to getting to know you jillian said as they walked away nick mentally ticked off one minute for singh and jillian to settle into his office he had no doubt she would come up with the names for the surgeon to check out online he knew she was nervousprobably as nervous as he wasbut she was handling matters with incredible cool praying that the security guard stayed away just a little longer he made several laps around the massive center fountain on occasion making eye contact with daintry smiling warmly whenever he did anxious husband nick checked his watch again five minutes down he vowed to keep from looking too many times the succeeding minutes were an eternity finally it was time nick made one last stroll around the fountain until it was directly between him and daintry then he shouted out and dropped to the floor groaning in pain are you all right singhs receptionist called out rushing around to him what happened oh dammit its my knee its locked its happened before but not for a while do it but dont overdo it he was thinking as she knelt beside him he kept his left leg bent at a fortyfive degree angle and rolled from side to side what can i do daintry asked genuinely upset theres loose cartilage floating in my knee he said groaning every few words a piece has gotten caught you didnt slip or anything nick nearly smiled imagining her wondering when shed have to call their lawyer no no i didnt slip dammit but this hurts ill call nineoneone no nick responded like i said this happens every few months you can do what needs to be done daintry believe me you can just take my foot and point the toes upward while you gradually turn the whole leg to the right pulling it toward you as you keep pressure toward the floor daintry paled at the notion and clearly could not visualize the instructions which nick was making as complicated as he dared i dont feel comfortable with things like this she said okay he decided its time dr singh can do this it will only take him a minute nick moaned and writhed from side to side for emphasis please hurry and call him this is killing me oh shit im sorry i cursed but this really hurts man i should have had it fixed ill call dr singh atta girl nick remained moaning on the floor behind the fountain as she raced back to her desk he managed a glance at his watch jillian had to be ready hell be right down daintry said before she had even returned to him nick imagined jillian speeding into the sequence that reggie had taught her three minutes to find the usb port plug in the key locate the rootkit application and double click it from there the installation process should only take a minute to his left the elevator chimed and in seconds paresh singh was kneeling at his side i understand your trick knee has locked he said totally calm are you in much pain nick groaned the answer and mumbled something that required repeating the trick now was not to make things too easy it usually pops back pretty easily he managed wouldnt you rather we called nineoneone singh didnt say the word liability but nick could tell he was thinking it please he begged people help me with this all the time just pronate my foot and slowly straighten the leg and the cartilage will pop out of the joint space i guarantee it will work if it doesnt you can call the rescue squad singh sighed clearly still weighing his options and the risks finally he stood and took nicks foot in both his hands no sooner had he begun to move the leg than nick cried out and the knee straightened bless you dr singh nick gasped bless you that was easier than i expected singh said can you stand theres only one way to find out give me your arm please youre a wizard in moments nick was on his feet testing the knee at that instant the elevator chime sounded it was everything nick could do to keep from cheering not the knee again jillian said squeezing his hand twice to say the job was done jeff were going to dr gavryck right now you could have been really hurt but did you and the doctor finish he did an incredible job unlocking this knee thank you doctor jillian said the rest of our session im afraid will have to wait daintry ill call to reschedule that would be fine the woman said still pale call me as soon as you have matters straightened out jillian collins took her husband by the arm and helped him to the door dont count on it daintry she whispered chapter were in to nick reggies words were all he wanted to hear the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center held secrets dirty secrets he felt certain of it now thanks to jillian they might have the means to prove it much as nick wished that buddhas road to the truth was just a stroll down easy street he had long known better there was plenty of risk and disappointment pain and even death along the way but now there was hope once again nick jillian and junie stood behind reggie and his wellworn swivel chair it took the teen hacker all of five minutes to access the computer on which jillian had installed a rootkit she recognized the desktop configuration now displayed on reggies computer monitor as belonging to paresh singh thats amazing she said with the rootkit we can access that computer from right here reggie said same as if we were sitting in his office wont they see us moving the cursor around nick asked stop your worrying dr g its a zombie computer now oh that makes me feel so much better but wont they notice their pc eating the flesh of the living reggie laughed thats a good one once in a blue moon im funny nick said but this might not be it what the heck is a zombie computer well basically its just a computer thats been compromised by a hacker but the owner isnt aware its being used by anybody else the only clue theyd have is an unfamiliar ip address appearing in their access logs provided they even had a reason to look ip address jillian asked its like a phone number for the internet reggie explained it can be traced to a home computer same as your phone number can be traced to your address or wherever youre calling from thats how i got caught the last time if you want to know the truth but i think i know what i did wrong reggie junie said okay okay just to be safe though im using a proxy to access the machine so nobody can trace the ip address back here oh i feel so much better now that youve explained nick said junie how old did you say this terror on two legs was too old and not nearly old enough she answered bringing her fist down lovingly on the teens head jillian leaned in closer so what were looking at now is actually dr singhs computer desktop yup thanks to you were in control of his machine for the time being we can access whatever applications singh can using his security credentials amazing she said again not really computers get way too much creditusually from people who dont know how they work still you have to know what you want them to do do you i think so jillian said i didnt have time to see what application they use for their electronic medical records but seeing how they are a joint venture with my hospital ill bet they use the same software we use at work may i be my guest reggie bowed to jillian and motioned her to his chair she bowed back respectfully and took his place a connection had formed between the two of them nick had noticed it before jillian went straight to the applications menu i feel like im fifteen sneaking out of the house to see my boyfriend nick too felt the thrill of the illicitthe adrenaline coursing through him as they closed in on secrets they were never meant to know do you see the emr program he asked yes this is it its the same application we use at shelby stone eat your heart out mollender having been in one of the first groups trained on the software jillian was easily able to navigate through the various screens and prompts okay from here i can search records by year ill start from four years ago until now yes beginning in april you got it nick said he crouched low beside her breathing in the intoxicating scent of the woman who without his permission seemed to have set up permanent residence in his thoughts jillian worked the application effortlessly okay so it looks like the clinic has a database of about twenty thousand patients is that substantial junie asked not for a major hospital like shelby stone but for a private practice it certainly is according to this billing summary tab the medispas gross income last year alone was over twentyfive million id call that respectable junie said just wait until next years helping hands fundraiser i think dr singh will enjoy getting to know me fear the junie nick said listen guys weve got to keep moving its possible someone could stumble onto the strange ip number right reggie ladies and gentlemen he can be taught you wait smith the next pass i throw goes right through your chest jill can you search by name of course how about we start with manny ferris first jillian typed manuel ferris into the designated search box the query returned no records subsequent searches using variations of his name also yielded no results the same was true when she tried umberto vasquez and even belle coates dead end she sighed damn nick thought mistakes on the road to truth number three not possessing a backup plan and number four not bringing along hiking boots we had no right to think wed hit it on the first try he said lets get a look at all those records um listen reggie said it may be hard to detect our ip address but it isnt impossible fifteen or twenty minutes then we can try another time got it jillian said she switched screens and quickly filled in the required fields to generate patient reports from four years ago the request took only a minute to run and when it did the system returned a list of more than five thousand entries looks like every patient that walked through the doors of the place junie said thats a lot of information forget about fifteen or twenty minutes we could be here for days damn nick thought again the screen displayed one record per row listed by patient name id number and icd code the icd code or international classification of diseases jillian explained was used by physicians and hospital data entry personnel to label patients diagnoses such that procedures could be itemized and billed appropriately five thousand entries for one year at the singh center each record is a mouse click away from more detailed information jillian said physicians notes photographs xray images plus procedures performed products used and amount billed every scalpel every box of gauze pads every iv bottle theyre all here incredible nick said not bothering to mask his discouragement at such a vast amount of data on such a vast number of patients welcome to the wonderful world of electronic medical records jillian said try the first one just so we can get an idea of what things look like without gathering any information on the patient in row one jillian clicked on the image tab and opened a photo of the frontal torso view of a naked woman reggie caught sight of the picture before she could remove it and quickly leaned in for a better look darn but that chicks got some mighty big reggie junie snapped and anyhow jillian added removing the photo and glaring at the youth with good humor she had them reduced thats this procedure code here nick sensed jillians mounting tension as she opened the next record on the list her apprehension was understandable he was thinking thanks to reggies skill and the vulnerability of the electronic records system they were committing an almost inexcusable invasion of privacy that would quite possibly cost jillian and nick their careers should they get caught for the first time he began to question his convictions please give us something anything jillian merely sighed and began to scroll down the list nick did not recognize any of the names or most of the icd codes as they flowed past in his medical practice he never dealt with lifts reshaping body contouring liposuction or breast work so the unfamiliarity of the codes was understandable then after a hundred or so patients one icd code caught his eye as a trauma surgeon he knew that code well crushing injury of multiple sites that one jill he said please click on that one the name of the patient was giuseppe renzulli nick remembered reading something on paresh singhs web site about his worldrenowned reputation for tackling difficult reconstructive procedures specifically shotgun wounds to the face from what nick read in the file and observed in the preop images this particular case would have required a mastery beyond compare according to the physician notes in renzullis record the was elaborated as a shotgun wound to the face most impressive were the stunning threedimensional ct scans each showing a sea of floating bone fragments and shotgun pellets sandwiched between a cracked mandible and a remarkably intact frontal bone oh man thats gross reggie exclaimed that dude dead according to this hes very much alive nick answered he leaned over jillians shoulder and read aloud from one of many physician dictationsthe conclusion of the admission note by paresh singh the patient is a twentyeightyearold caucasian male with massive trauma to the neck and face from a selfinflicted shotgun wound definitive reconstruction and repair of nasal orbital maxillary mandibular and ethmoid fractures feasible requiring multistaged reconstructive maneuvers primary access to fracture sites will be via transcutaneous vertical lynch incision of fractures appear to be type iii jillian turned away as he read it was then nick realized the mans suicide attempt was another painful reminder of belle how could he be so insensitive he placed a hand on her shoulder she in turn reached across her body to take his hand in hers the moment was brief but the emotions within it were intense how could somebody shoot themselves like that and not die junie asked nick flashed on one such case he had treated in afghanistan but before he said anything about it he turned to jillian talking about this okay he asked yeah its okay she said her tone bittersweet thanks for asking a selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head is almost always fatal he explained that is assuming the victim puts the gun in his or her mouth or presses it hard against the temple but when a guna shotgun especiallyis placed under the chin the recoil can actually redirect the muzzle causing massive trauma to the face but avoiding any vital structures in the brain thats gross reggie said nick took the mouse from jillian and continued reviewing the file for this guy no doubt fixing him was a massive undertaking from these reports it looks as though he went through several multistep reconstructive events totaling about thirty operations thats not the only total that was massive jillian said take a gander at the bill this case generated nick looked at where she was pointing and whistled half a million dollars for this work alone no wonder shelby stone formed a partnership with these guys even if the patient defaults on their share of the bill the insurance company owes a hefty sixfigure payday for singh and a percentage of that goes to the mother hospital well that does explain how paresh singh can afford that marble fountain if theyre so well known for this type of work i wonder how many shotgun injuries they reconstruct in a year nick asked i can tell you jillian said ill just look it up by that icd code jillian entered the numbers keeping the scan limited to the twelve months beginning the approximate date umberto disappeared keywords shotgun and face and there you are four seconds after she hit the enter key twenty records were identified amazing nick commented maybe thats what the j geils band meant when they named their album blow your face out whos the j geils band reggie asked if i aint heard of them they must be old with you anything that wasnt recorded last month is old twenty cases in that one hospital doesnt surprise me very much jillian said between fifty and fiftyfive percent of all suicides are caused by guns but there are over fifteen hundred attempted suicides in the us alone each day thats an incredible number junie said sad but true jillian said nick thought through the math so if paresh singh is world renowned for his ability to reconstruct faces after a shotgun blast he said its not inconceivable there could be at least a hundred such cases in the us each yearprobably more worldwide onefifth of them sent to the best of the best makes sense to me lets look at these twenty nick said but wed better move quickly sooner or later someones going to catch on to the breach behind them reggie kept touching his face as though trying to visualize how the gunshot wounds nick described could actually be survivable the first five files they reviewed were grisly but also well documented the skill of paresh singh was undeniable although the residual facial damage in each case was still fairly striking nothing in those files jumped out at them as being out of the ordinary something troubled nick about the sixth case though a patient named edwin scott price from plano texas the majority of suicide attempts with a firearm were males thirty to fifty years old edwin price was fortyfive but although he fit the profile there was a feeling nick could not shake while he was scanning the xray images photos and ct scans attached to prices file something about the record was familiarnot possible given that the electronic chart was one hed never seen before and the patient one hed never heard of the echoing concern nagged at him why nick was about to abandon the ct scans and move on when reggie leaned over and exclaimed in his ear dang that dude is just as messed up as the first poor sucker we saw what do you mean i dont know im good at figuring out patterns and those pieces of bone look almost exactly like that first guy you showed me thats it nick exclaimed thats what jillian asked why ive been feeling like prices record was familiar lets go back to that twentyeightyearold caucasian male we looked at first giuseppe renzulli thats the one jillian pulled up renzullis file can we see both side by side she opened a new window and soon had the two patients threedimensional ct scans displayed next to each other well ill be junies voice trailed off theyre identical jillian said told you reggie boasted nick studied both pictures intently his brow knit im not a statistician he said but im willing to bet the rv that two identical bone fragment dispersals from a shotgun blast to the face is a statistical impossibility are the procedures done on the men the same junie asked doesnt look like it to me nick said renzulli had some pretty significant complications that paresh attributed to his anesthesia and local infection theres something else were missing jillian said i can feel it nick went back through prices and renzullis notes and films the only thing in common between the two records was the ct scan didnt you just say that these procedures cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in hospital billing junie asked nicks focus was locked on trolling through prices file such that he almost missed the question yeah he said absently why well take a look here junie said tapping her finger on the screen hey fingers off the monitor reggie scolded well ill be nick had to blink to make sure he was reading it right jillian as a joint venture with shelby stone doesnt that mean singh operates his medical practice himself but combines his purchases and billing for supplies with stone nick asked i think so that way he gets the benefit of stones purchase power he probably sends stone a percentage of his collections for the procedures he performs well according to this edwin scott price had almost a million dollars of reconstructive work done and what am i missing jillian asked she turned around in the chair to face both the others what youre missing and what junie just pointed out nick said is that none of singhs profits that were shared with shelby stone from edwin scott prices milliondollar new face came from an insurance company that would mean singh didnt want prices insurance company to even know he was doing the work why would that be a devilish smile crossed nicks face i dont know but lets give our little implanted rootkit a rest and then when reggie tells us its safe we start looking to find other identical ct scans and take a real close look at singhs billing practices when it comes to fixing shotgun wounds chapter franz koller sat on one of the recently installed benches at poplar point and watched the moonlight dance across the potomac the plan was for his client to take the bench directly behind his facing toward the woods so they could keep their backs to one another as they talked the cloakanddagger bullshit was cumbersome koller thought but he had done business with the agency before and like the golfing gorilla who hit a fourhundredyard drive and then followed it with a fourhundredyard putt this was the way they operated he knew whom he was dealing with and they knew that he knew but that made no difference to the way they did things the only question that remained unanswered for him and in truth he didnt really care whether he ever knew was the precise identity of jericho the individual or group within the agency who had the resources and clout to authorize the cancelation of at least six people and at the going rate for the master of the nonkill that was some serious clout there was a chill in the air a bit unusual for this time of year and koller was glad he had opted for his heavy jacket not only for warmth but for concealing his favorite directkill weapona ruger bullbarrel with an integrally suppressed silencer the gun provided him with an emergency escape option and given that this meeting breached several protocols he lived by he considered the precaution a wise one koller wasnt bothered by the meeting place so much as he was by the time late at night in a public park any passing patrolman worth the tin on his badge would be wise to question any bench sitter i just want to ask you to be very careful sir muggers like to hang out here late at night koller grinned at the notion for a time he closed his eyes and indulged himself imagining what it might be like to have a mugger actually approach him here the direct kill his mind created was swift and silentone hand up through the flesh of the throat and fully around the larynx after the initial thrust before death his imagination allowed him to pluck the wouldbe assailants eyes out with his thumbs somewhat messy but nicely done he decided nicely done indeed koller suspected that he was about to meet jericho the person or else the head of the organization calling itself by that name he was curious why this client was so insistent on rendezvousing with him in person a facetoface meeting was potentially dangerous for each of themlethal for one of them if it were jerichos intention to kill him but killing him at this pointat any point for that mattermade no sense it had to be that once again as was the case when jericho elected to burn down jillian coatess condo established protocol was about to be broken only this time his client had wisely decided it was easier and safer to ask permission than it was to seek forgiveness the killer sensed movement and sound and slid the ruger onto his lap a full minute passed before he actually heard the voices of a man and woman approaching along the walk to his left koller inhaled through his nose and began the process of slowing his pulse they sounded harmless and intoxicated but professional killers would he followed the couple out of the corner of his eye as they emerged from a dense grove and approached along the walk from a hundred feet away at the same time he scanned to his right nothing if the couple were good enough to fool him it was going to be a hell of a fight he buried his pistol beneath his jacket hey there buddy howre you doing the man said he was an absolute house six five twoeighty or more and if he had anything less than a blood alcohol level he deserved an oscar the girl on his arm was petite and quiet have a good one koller said still on red alert but now for anyone whose presence the couple might have masked you betcha the bear said he hiccuped stumbled once and then proceeded on koller holstered the ruger and checked his watch always arrive late another unnecessary cia gorilla shtick in exchange for the taxfree million or more they were paying him for each kill hed give them five more minutes the jericho contract had already brought him millions with luck this meeting would end up adding to that haul from behind him koller heard footsteps on the grass two people almost certainly men one of them like his previous visitor quite large he did not turn around but again prepared himself for action if they were pros they were either clumsy pros or meant him no harm jericho and a bodyguard he decided the heavier footsteps stopped fifty feet away the smaller man continued forward then sat down on the bench with his back to koller thank you for meeting me like this the arrival said that voice now koller understood why his client had shown up with security its my pleasure whos the muscle back there how did you look you pay me what you do because im the best if you have any other plans aside from a chat youll soon regret that killing me would make quite a story perhaps since youre so astute you already know who i am i watch tv koller said you the head of jericho this isnt a quiz show form your own opinion about that im not wearing a wire i know that already we scanned you ten minutes ago the drunk and the girl theyre good my whole team is good thats why we hired you so lets get down to it then we didnt need to meet in person to arrange a job you already know how thats done there have been some changes what i need now is to know that i can trust you an ironic request of somebody in my line of work dont you think koller began to relax there was no way the future vice presidential nominee with his ticket already well ahead in all the polls would set himself up to be killed it also went far to explain jericho before his recent selection lionel ramsland had been the deputy director of the cia chapter for several minutes lionel ramsland remained silent he had already been chosen to join the ticket with john greenleigh his partys leading presidential candidate well in advance of the august nominating convention popular and respected defenders of democracy few expected they would lose i know that we erred with that condo fire ramsland said finally do you remember what i told you about my marks koller asked refresh me under no circumstance are clients ever to engage tail touch or even breathe near anybody associated with a mark without my authorizationand that authorization is something i would simply never grant okay youve made yourself clear i had materials well concealed in the place that i hadnt had the opportunity to remove if the police had found them it could have gone poorly for meand you our mistake and you paid me for that mistake so well it seems operation jericho has a few new and unforeseen stress points nothing im that worried about especially with you on our side but then again i didnt get to where i am by being passive you know im a professional and i always deliver customer satisfaction guaranteed or your victim back koller said with a chuckle maybe i should have that slogan printed on my business cards maybe you should go on sir the man many considered more powerful and decisive than his much younger more intellectual running mate cleared his throat koller noted for the first time the fatigue in his voice i love this country ramsland said and consider myself a patriot someone who would do anything in his power to protect her anything its important to me that i believe you would do the same country love is your business not mine the people who have hired you in the past told me i could expect that answer from you then you shouldnt have brought the subject up as the moving force behind jericho i could not in good conscience address our latest concerns without meeting you facetoface and at least asking detachment is a valuable asset in my work but so is loyalty to the country no mr ramsland to my clients i see why dont you cut the cloakanddagger bullshit and come sit next to me ramsland did as the killer suggested and for a few pregnant moments the two men locked gazes and sized each other up youre not what i pictured ramsland said i try to stay out of the papers sweet to think you were fantasizing about me though my sources told me that you had ahow did they put itan eccentric sense of humor i dont really enjoy being talked about go on i think you should get to the point ah yes i was told about your bluntness too okay let me begin by saying that we have a responsibility you and i a great and important responsibility if you say so i can tell a lot about a man by his eyes but yours tell me nothing that should bring you some degree of comfort koller offered it means i have no agenda other than the one you pay me to have and if somebody were to pay you more money to have a different agenda the man closing in on the end of his sixties close to being a heartbeat from the presidency was uninspiring but then to koller most people of stature and power were ramsland was a throwback to the days of d√©tente and domino theory backroom politicsa saggyskinned prune with puffy eyes who overfilled the blue power suit peeking out from underneath his london fog trench it amazed koller that the balding silverhaired fool stirred up emotions in anybody other than his mother let alone a majority of the free world koller kept his eyes fixed on the man and had a brief flash as to what he would look like with his lungs full of sarin still underneath ramslands doughy exterior koller sensed toughness and warned himself not to lose sight of that observation guys who played chicken with tanks and missiles tended to have balls i might not be a patriot like yourself but what i am is a professional a consummate professional with my own set of laws at the moment you are protected under those laws whatever you have to say here you can say in confidence ramsland took a deep breath and exhaled slowly okay mr koller i know that by torching jillian coatess place we violated one of your laws and placed you in some jeopardy but she had gone on air with some potentially damaging information and we felt we had to act quickly i know much more about the woman than you do believe me all you did was make her more determined than ever to keep investigating things ive had to start following her to make certain she doesnt make any progress we had intended to follow her but with what youre costing us and the small size of our group we just didnt have the resources what you did was panic okay okay we panicked but i need to tell you that our concerns about ms coates werent entirely unjustified oh a week or so ago there was a security breach at a downtown va facility a kid a black kid in his early teens no less accessed the computer system and started digging around for information about an individual connected to jericho how is coates involved the kids name is reggie smith hes fourteen he has a decentsized rap sheet from his habit of hacking computers he lives with a foster mother and father in baltimore living near them is a family friend a doctor named garrity nicholas garrity i know i know jesus you are good so let me get this straight a fourteenyearold kid got information from the va computers that you couldnt have deleted actually the truth is we couldnt find it that goes back to what i said about manpower we dont always have the resources to bypass proper channels go on so garrity hes in the va system as having severe ptsd thats i know what it is koller cut in is garrity part of jerichos concerns indirectly yes is jillian coates she wasnt but she became a player once she began sniffing around for her sisters killer thats what led her to garrity so you want me to kill them koller offered up their lives with the same emotion he would have used to order a grand slam breakfast at dennys no ramsland said ive got our people watching garrity and his partner june wright and their medical bus wright is reggie smiths foster mother there arent enough of us to follow them all twentyfour seven but we are keeping an eye on them your assignments for jericho have been geographically arranged to keep the media spotlight away from any pattern in your marks we cant risk igniting curiosities by having anything happen to jillian coates or people close to her which garrity has now become if she gets in the way shes dead koller said thats what you get for stirring her up okay then let us handle garrity im betting hes a patriot like myself hell understand what were up against here and back off if not well cross that bridge when we come to it whatever you say so if its not garrity or coates why did you bring me out here the kid has caused one of our people to go squirrelly the guys a small cog in our machine but hes become a weak link i hate mixed metaphors koller thought i cant believe you were a big shot in the cia for all those years let alone that youre going to be vice president it will cost you a million two he said an extra fifty if you want the job done quickly quick as possible your call same rules apply i can get what information i need about the mark off of ebay dont you even want to know who it is in time ill just give you his name so you can get started koller sighed as you wish hes a va claims processor named maccandliss phillip maccandliss chapter nick had never set foot in lieutenant detective don reeses office before that day given the circumstances surrounding their initial meeting discretion was always an unspoken agreement between them but when nick phoned already en route to the second districts station house reese did not bother asking what he needed nicks request to meet was reason enough for the detective to rearrange his schedule the uniformed officer assigned to reception duty seated in a closetsized room behind four inches of plexiglas was in her early twenties after phoning reese she instructed nick and jillian through the intercom to take seats on the molded plastic chairs lining the foyer tucked securely under nicks arm was a large manila envelope thick with confidential records from six different singh center patients over a oneyear period four years ago each of them had been treated for a selfinflicted shotgun blast to the face examined individually there was nothing that stood out about any of the cases except for the violence and utter destruction of their trauma however beyond the differing names and social security numbers these six cases were identical right down to the ct scans cardiograms and progress notes in addition the lists of hundreds of supplies and medications obtained through shelby stone purchasing were also identical the likelihood of even two cases having such similarities was probably akin to the odds of winning the powerball lottery seven or eight times in a row nick and jillian knew they had stumbled upon something illegal but they suspected much more was behind the charts than mere larcenyeven larceny on a fairly grand scale who were these patients and did they have anything to do with manny or umberto those were questions nick hoped don reese could help answer a buzzer sounded to their right and the large steelreinforced door securing the entrance to the inner sanctum of the precinct station slid open reese greeted them with warm enthusiastic handshakes he wore a white buttondown shirt and redstriped tie his imposing stature made even more so by the holstered gun tucked beneath his left arm thanks for taking the time today don nick said after introducing him to jillian i really appreciate it i gave you permission to tell your friend about us when you told me how special she is to you did you he did jillian said but my memorys been horrible lately and i already forgot it i was intending to call you about the fire that destroyed my condo but ive been waiting until i get the report from the fire investigator for the insurance company sorry to hear about your place im here for you anytime i appreciate that like i said in the hospital nick weve got a long way to go before ill call us even that goes for your friends too lets talk in my office reese escorted the pair through the hightech temperaturecontrolled dispatch center pointing out details along the way such as the raised floor necessary to keep the computer systems from overheating the room there was also a bank of television monitors broadcasting a grim version of reality tvthe lives of the prisoners locked in the nearby detention cells the heart and soul of nineoneone reese said gesturing around the communications center over three hundred thousand calls handled last year alone nick could feel the detectives pride in the force as he explained the dispatch process coming here had been the right way to begin with reeses help there was a good chance theyd soon have some idea of just how big a fish they had on the line they exited the dispatch center and were directly in front of the door leading to the detention facilities how many are in lockup here jillian asked like the heart of an enlightened man reese replied with a wry grin the chambers are full nick was impressed by jillians knowledge of police procedures and her familiarity with the jargon it was knowledge she had explained honed over years of dealing with mentally ill patients whose lives were often inextricably linked to the judicial system after they had failed to explain the six identical cases it was jillian who suggested they use a police database to conduct a more comprehensive investigation that was when nick had phoned reese the lieutenant detectives modest office was on a thirdfloor corner and so had windows on two walls the desktop shelves and windowsills were filled with framed photos of his children and grandchildren as well as volumes of forensics and police law the walls were decorated with various memorabilia highlighting a twentyfiveyear career of distinction a cops cop nick and jillian took seats across from reese and nick immediately launched into a detailed explanation of recent events including their history with manny ferris and his possible link to umberto as well as their growing suspicions of the singh clinics billing practices following jillians installation of a rootkit into paresh singhs computer mother of god garrity talk about playing fast and loose with the law you guys make dillinger look like little miss muffett im beginning to feel the returnfavor jar filling up thats fine by me nick said we can call this the last one but i tell you theres some nasty stuff going on here don take a look at these medical records nick pushed the manila folder across the desk but reese was clearly reluctant to review the contents do you have any idea what a sharp da could do to us for just having these in the room jillian will help decorate our cell silk flowers she said i like her reese said join the crowd unable to keep his detectives curiosity in check reese softened unhooked the envelope and leafed through the printouts after a few minutes he locked eyes with nick enlighten me nick i got a gift b minus in college bio so most of this medical jargon is like sanskrit ill buy what you said that weve got a bunch of rubberstamped records that have never been billed to any insurance company for reimbursement but what does that mean it means paresh singh is hiding something such as well thats what we need your help figuring out the patient ids on these files are actually social security numbers from what weve been able to learn if theyre not valid numbers the system wont even allow the patient record to be created but when we tried to look up these six individuals by their social security number we didnt get anywhere reese leaned back until the two front legs of his worn wooden desk chair lifted off the floor then he stared down at his hands processing the singh center would have to bill an insurance company to recoup the cost of labor and supplies right he asked finally thats right jillian replied so technically singh would be out a lot of cash if he did the work but didnt bill well thats whats even more peculiar about it nick said it looks like they were paid for these jobs look heres the column of charges for each case and heres the one for receipts they balance out either somebody paid for these operations or singhs books have been cooked what are you suggesting i thought you said the insurance companies werent billed we took advantage of the rootkit access to take a closer look at their billing and financial records great reese groaned say did you also get a glimpse of those tiny detention rooms across from our dispatch center stick with us don nick pleaded okay but you guys better be ready to treat my ulcer when it erupts we did some quick math on what the average total bill for a shotgun wound to the face would be it was anywhere between five hundred thousand and a million dollars and jillian took over for nick and i had some friends at shelby stone who work in accounts receivable do some more digging for us they were able to tell me how much the hospital earned from their share of the singh medispas net profits from four years ago if we assume these six procedures here are forgeries that generated no revenue for paresh singh then shelby stones share of the take that year should have been substantially less than in subsequent years but im guessing that wasnt the case both jillian and nick nodded the profit shelby stone made from their joint venture with the singh center had to have included revenue from these six bogus procedures at least our accounting people suggest that was the case but if that was true then somebody probably singh paid shelby stone out of his own pocket because no insurance company reimbursed them for the procedures why would they do that we agree it doesnt make sense nick said maybe they were concerned some astute comptroller at shelby stone would notice that singhs supply orders and purchased inventory were significantly out of proportion with what they claimed to have earned in profit singh buys his supplies from shelby stone reese asked yes its part of their joint venture agreement singh gets a good price on supplies because shelby stone memorial buys their inventory in larger quantities in exchange for that perk and of course patient referrals shelby stone takes a cut of the singh center profits but if somebody notices theyre buying more supplies than their profits suggest they need reeses voice trailed off as he thought through the significance it might suggest to somebody that singh was hiding money from shelby stone nick concluded interesting theory but what about proof we have nothing useful at this point and we dont want to bag these guys on some moneylaundering scheme either were looking for umberto and my sisters killer jillian added so you want me to look up these people by the social security number on their medical records to see if i get a hit in our system you are the police were assuming you have access to more resources than we do things that a pedestrian google search might not turn up supposedly these patients shot themselves in the face with a shotgun jillian said youd figure somebody would have reported the incident to the police reese rose from his chair laced his fingers together and stretched his interlocked hands skyward until his knuckles cracked then he groaned and took his seat again i try to remind myself to stretch every couple hours these days my bones have more creaks than an old mattress okay you convinced me i agree there is something going on here ill run these social security numbers through our database but nick what you guys have done up to and including compromising their computer system isnt just crossing the line its drawing a damn new one and stealing medical records seems like a shortcut to both of you losing your licenses then call us even nick offered reese just shook him off nah im famous for my shortcuts i just dont want to see you get in trouble reese keyed in the patient id from the first record on the pile his eyes were focused and intense as he typed damn reeses voice trailed off as his fingers continued tapping away on the keyboard searching what is it i ran this first social several ways no matter what it keeps coming up classifiedrestricted what does that mean jillian asked ever since nineeleven local police departments have been sharing data with federal law enforcement agencies that cooperation has helped to nab not only a bunch of wouldbe terrorists but your runofthemill crooks as well these days if you get a speeding ticket in orlando or a federal gambling charge in vegas ill see it here reese poked his computer monitor for emphasis thats how conjoined all these data have become nick thought for a beat before asking so what did that first patient tell you that you guys are into some deep yogurt my friend ive never been restricted before tough time for a first nick said what about the others reese keyed in the next id his intense expression returned again he shook his head same thing classified im starting to think we need to bring the captain in on this i dont want to put you on the spot don but can you wait im sure you trust the captain not to sit on us but were just not ready to chance it we dont know who is involved or what paresh singh is really up to if we jump the gun we risk exposing ourselves and perhaps losing the only link we have to umberto and to belles killer who do you think could have this sort of clout reese shook his head in disbelief who do you think fbi cia nsa one of those agencies that doesnt even bother with initials youre already in deep my friend and im not sure when all is said and done ill have enough rope to pull you out maybe theyre making new identities i mean it is a plastic surgery center jillian suggested nick appreciated her stepping in and breaking the escalating tension between him and reese possible but ive been able to access personal information about other people in federal witness protection before why not these guys maybe theyre just bigger fish nick said more difficult to hide reese continued searching the other ids gauging by his expression nick figured something about the fifth patient id might be different from the preceding four hey look this guy here seems to be a real person you got an address forget the address i got a name a name we all know reese exclaimed this social security number is registered to a manuel jimenez ferris manny we were right nick well put away your party hats folks i looked up this social when you asked me to search for the guy but it was a dead end i couldnt track him after his last address in richmond virginia we met him he had found his way to his cousins place in dc did you see his id no but that wouldnt have helped much his face was badly scarred we had a picture though and were both sure the man we saw working the mens room at billy pearls gentlemans club was him billy pearls reese mused i know that place know of it i should say so why was your manny ferriss face messed up you think he had plastic surgery with that result not by paresh singh he didnt unless singh never finished the job or that wasnt the real manny ferris i dont know what i think yet lets see what this last record shows reese keyed in the patient id of the sixth record in nicks stack a few seconds passed then reeses eyes widened and a look of amazement washed over his face another restricted file nick asked the cop shook his head nope we got ourselves another hit yeah whats the patients real name according to this database that social security number is registered to umberto vasquez your missing friend nick so why didnt they change his and ferriss social security numbers like all the others nick said his jaw now tense i think you know the answer reese said these guys dont leave loose ends they didnt change the socials because they didnt need to my bet is that neither of them were slated to survive chapter nick knew he was shaking and bathed in sweat his sheets and tshirt were soaked still his eyes refused to open as had happened so many times with so many different nightmares release would not come he was the helpless captive of the terrifying sequences of his dream sarah once again he is kissing sarah he can taste her lips intoxicating and familiar her eyes are the same emerald green that had possessed him the first night they met with her arms around his neck her body moves against his in a desperate pleading rhythm crying out for what they both desire suddenly sarah pushes herself away but now it is jillian who has been kissing him her face glows with an angelic light that grows brighter and brighter still until nick can no longer discern her features but the glow is no longer humanit is a truck barreling toward them through the night jillian moves first shoving nick aside he falls hard to the ground precious seconds are lostseconds that he needs to reach her before the grille of the truck does he scrambles to his feet and charges toward her but it is too late the sound of the impact as the vehicle slams into jillians body echoes like a thunderclap in nicks mind flames erupt all around him and within them he sees the drivers sharp silhouette applauding the carnage nicks legs are on fire the pain of his searing flesh is unlike any he has ever known the man in the truck laughs at his agony through the billowing smoke with the fire swelling around him nick sees the drivers face and gasps it is his own the alarm clock was nicks savior he sat bolt upright staring out his bedroom window at the gray dawn guilt that was how his therapist had explained the recurring nightmares guilt for sarahs death guilt for the skill he had used to save so many other lives guilt that he had helped zmarai earn a trusted status on the base guilt that umberto who had saved his life that morning had surrendered his own life to the bottle and then vanished the recurrent horrors were his punishment for not having done more before this latest variation it had usually been sarah who died in his nightmares and nick the one who drove the truck that killed her now jillian was his victim too it didnt take a freudian scholar to work out the significance of that change he simply wasnt ready to take a woman hostage in a relationshipprobably never would beeven a woman as genuine and special as this one he was carrying too much baggage true jillian was toting baggage of her own no adult could make it this far in life without a goodly load perhaps having her entering his nightmare meant they were closing in on some truth he just needed to find a way to relax and let things happen between them if they were to happen the freudian wouldnt have worked up much of a sweat over that one either on his feet nick shook off the last vestiges of this latest trip to hell stretched and headed to the bathroom reminding himself of junies most constant teaching time is natures way of keeping everything from happening at once the plan for the day was to meet jillian at shelby stone and to try the mole one more time thanks to don reese the stakes were increasing they had paresh singh dead to rights in terms of his counterfeit records although given the illegality of the way nick and jillian had obtained the information dead to wrongs was probably a more appropriate term but they needed morespecifically the connection between singhs surgical satellite and the mother hospital somehow saul mollender had to be convinced to try to search for medical records pertaining to umberto specifically any from four years ago jillian had attempted a search of her own but was electronically denied access without the moles help they were at another dead end nick hooked second chance to a short leash and headed to the park he followed the mile walk with a half hour of intense emdr work that helped get him from a sud score of seven down to six then he showered and headed into the city jillian met him in the shelby stone lobby dressed in a pair of dark slacks cinched with a broad leather belt below a simple beige silk blouse he kissed her gently on the cheek when they embraced and held her close a few seconds longer than might have been appropriate given their surroundings somebody missed me jillian whispered in his ear i like that i like that you like it for the briefest moment he flashed on the dream and her face afire in the headlights of the truck you okay she asked fine he said dismissively im fine it was then that nick noticed the package tucked under her arm wrapped in brown paper with a small white card taped to it aw you shouldnt have he said i didnt at least not for you jillians smile was enigmatic call it a little mole softener i thought id try bribing our friend into helping us rather than beating us out of his office with a broom what could possibly accomplish that youll see she answered it seems to me it would help to have a sense of what makes the man tick before we barge in and ask him to stick his neck on the line for us nick said in the elevator ride to subbasement level two youre the shrink nurse any ideas well maybe its obvious but my guess is he feels left behind abandoned and disrespected after the hospital administration stripped him of his power and influence when the electronic medical records project was completed he seems bright enough but his sour personality couldnt have helped him when they made the final decision on the position sort of a chickenegg thing nick said exactly did he get bypassed because hes miserable or has he become what he is because of what they did probably a little of each is there anything we can do about it dunno empathy and trust are usually good places to start when trying to get through to anyone with a pinch of bribery thrown in who said surgeons have zero insight hey thats my specialty youre talking about they proceeded down the dimly lit corridor to saul mollenders mausoleum medical records i hope you got him new window stencils nick said pointing to the eroded lettering be brave jillian winked at him and then opened the door though their lives had changed dramatically since the last visit here time stood still in the moles world the man was seated as before at his neatly kept desk behind a tall carefully maintained stack of records he groaned when he glanced up and saw the visitors oh goodness he sighed i must remind myself to be even less hospitable next time what on earth inspired you two to come back here again nick saw jillians cheeks redden and remembered her warning him about her hairtrigger temper just a few seconds in the mans gloomy office and trust and empathy appeared to have been cast into the industrial shredder beside his desk without the mole noticing nick gently wiggled the package jillian carried trust and empathy yes she said quickly regaining her composure well since we took up your time and you were so gracious to consider helping us i wanted to give you a little something in return jillian set the wrapped package down on the desk the mole stared at it with a perplexed scowl as though a bomb squad might now be needed begrudgingly he unwrapped the package tearing the paper thoughtlessly and ignoring the card taped to the outside it was a framed saying which he lifted up to study thank you but i already have one of these he said gesturing to the wall behind them he turned the frame around and nick saw for the first time what jillian had done printed in marvelous calligraphy was the mantra of mollenders bleak operation distractions are deadly done on parchment matted in black and tastefully framed nick wondered how much of the job jillian had done herselfmost or all he suspected now it was his turn to fume you know what mollender he said you might not appreciate what jillian did for you but you could at least for a moment pretend to care and god forbid to act civil the mole lowered his oval glasses to the bridge of his nose and peered at nickperhaps the record keeper equivalent of rolling up his sleeves for a fight why should i he asked defiantly its obvious she did it only because you want something if you believed a framed aphorism would make me your friend then im sorry to say you were sadly mistaken mollender set the gift on the corner of his desk glass side down and went back to studying a file we need your help saul nick said the record keeper hesitated leaned back in his chair and looked thoughtfully at his visitors what is it you need it was working the mole sounded less hostile even vaguely interested we need to know if a friend of mine was a patient here four years ago nick explained that simple oh is that all well why didnt you just say so then youll help us jillian asked no of course not obviously you tried and were denied access because thats how the system works now you come down here wanting me to violate a rule of my departmenthell of the us government listen ms coates why dont you take this work of art and hang it where you work so you can remind yourself not to bother me again now good day maam good day nothing jillian snatched up the plaque and stormed out of the records room leaving the door ajar expecting nick to follow nick however stayed where he was standing alone in the hallway she looked back at him incredulously he held up a finger silently asking her to give him a minute alone with the man her response was to slam the door hard enough to rattle the frosted glass nick let a minute pass before speaking mollender did not even acknowledge let alone question the surgeons continued presence why are you so angry saul nick finally asked im sorry i thought you had left im guessing its not because of this job no i work with broken people all the time and i know a shell when i see onesomething a person builds around himself to keep from getting hurt i have one of those shells saul and its a whopper too hard as diamonds impenetrable do you know why do i care mollender shot back because in the army i nearly lost my will to live im still not sure ive gotten it back but a day at a time i keep trying at that mollender stopped looking down at his file and actually made eye contact with nick you served captain nick garrity of the th forward surgical team at your service training prevented nick from saluting the mole even though such action might have been considered playful and friendly by a civilian what branch where fiftysixth combat support hospital in forward operating base savannah afghanistan the mole said in a near whisper yeah about one hundred kilometers southeast of khost i lost my fianc√©e and all my staff except one in a terrorist attack suicide bomber drove his truck into the hospital i could have been blown to bits if my friend hadnt raced back in front of the truck and pulled me under a steel refrigeration unit i came home more or less shattered gave up my surgical practice to drive around in an rva rolling clinicproviding health care to those who cant afford it and helping vets like myself get their ptsd benefit claims approved its been all the medical work i can manage sad story mollender said without cynicism then the mole did something nick did not expect he opened the top drawer of his desk and took out a blue velvet box lifting the lid he turned the box around and held it up nick immediately recognized the medal inside a small silver star centered within a much larger bronze one the medal was attached to a broad ribbon with five stripes two blue two white and one red silver star nick said yours mollender shook his head my younger brother andys he enlisted at thirty because he believed in what we were doing over there nick immediately understood the significance of mollenders possessing the medal howd it happen he asked roadside bomb on his second tour to iraq mollender said his eyes misting with the memory he was a terrific soldier the medal was for something he did before that day andys life is just a statistic now was his sacrifice worth the cost i have to believe it was andy was all about sacrifice nick grabbed a pen and blank piece of paper off the desk and began to write will you help us saul he passed the note across you asked me that already my friend is a solider his name is umberto vasquez he was the only other survivor of that suicide bomber i wrote his social security numberhis hospital idon that piece of paper my phone number is on it as well umberto was all about sacrifice too until that night he was the best soldier i had ever known my closest friend after the explosion he was just a mess nick flashed on an early morning soon after he had taken over helping hands when he had searched for umberto one of many times and found him wedged against the stone support beneath a bridge comatose from booze filthy unshaven and soaked in urine he was a basket of nerves and booze he went on ptsd at its worst one day not too long after that he disappeared said the military wanted him back for a special assignment and just vanished i think he may have been here in this hospital after he went missing i need to know what happened to him saul four years ago was he a patient here what was he treated for just think about it is all im asking nick turned and opened the door to leave hey mollender called stopping nick just before he stepped into the corridor turning he saw the man holding up the piece of paper your phone number hereis that a six chapter were going to get them nick i can feel it now jillian clenched her fist for emphasis the fierceness of her anger kept fairly dormant for most of the time nick had known her was almost palpable that calligraphy was a great idea he said thanks belle taught me how to do it she said her eyes dimming at the mention of her sisters name but it was you mollender is the key and you somehow managed to get through to him i have been so damn frustrated since belle died that ive been having trouble hanging on to my faith and thats never been an issue for me now im beginning to feel hope whoever did this to her and umberto and poor mannywere going to get them hey easy on the optimism mollender didnt promise us anything i know but you accomplished what seemed impossibleyou got through to him nick shook his head hes a sad bitter guy it didnt feel all that great to see him have to connect with his pain much as the newagers might disagree with me i feel like sometimes its better to keep that stuff packed away with a few hours before jillian was due at work and nick had to ready the rv for a night of servicing the mean streets of baltimore they had driven out to nicks place in separate cars the day was warm and nick suggested a picnic in the yard with second chance or perhaps in the lush park at the end of the street within a short while the idea was forgotten as they sat on the living room sofa sipping tea and sorting out the significance of saul mollenders change of attitude both of them were sensing a growing tensiona tension born of the feelings that had been evolving between them the tension of opportunity and desire the greyhound had taken to jillian immediately and now sat beside her his muzzle resting on her leg for a time neither of them spoke then jillian reached across and covered nicks hand with hers would it scare you to death if i asked you to take me to your bedroom she said maybe not to death exactly but it might scare me then i wont ask okay lets do that over again take two second chance pretend you just asked if it would scare me to death if you asked me to take you to my room and your reply if you can pry yourself free from my pooch i think its a terrific idea me too chance started to follow then perhaps thinking better of it hopped up on the couch and rolled onto his back nick held jillians hand and led her down the hallway to his bedroom door you sure he asked she looked up at him and held his gaze with hers as sure as i need to be she said finally be it ever so humble he said guiding her inside i like it i feel you in here the room was spacious and airy with bookcases covering one wall and two large windows another nicks library neatly arranged featured huge medical tomes historical biographies the complete works of poe and shakespeare and a large array of paperback novels most of them adventure stories or thrillers interspersed throughout were framed photos of his family no photos from your army days she asked i have them but they havent made it out of the box yet i understand nick sat on his mattress and watched as jillian scanned the titles in his bookcase i never was a huge reader she said pulling out a copy of two years before the mast not like belle i always want to be around people or out experiencing nature when it gets late im usually so beat that instead of picking up a book i just conk off if you were subject to recurrent nightmares like most of us with ptsd you might become more of a reader sleep is definitely not our friend jillian scanned the list of sud scores taped on the wall beside the bed you have the nightmares often i never used to before the explosion and sarahs death since then its like the event got branded into my brain i have variations of the same bad dream almost every night and so far theres not been a damn thing i can do to keep them from happening last night you were in there she sat on the bed beside him her expression playful me in a nightmare she sighed like a starstruck teen now thats something a girl doesnt hear every day tell me about it i dont think so she caressed his face and again looked deeply and seriously into his eyes its okay to tell me she said all right but it wasnt pretty it started off as a dream a really nice one actually but then it ended with the same truck that killed sarah hitting you instead cutting you in two im not always the driver but last night i was if the mention of sarahs name or the horrific outcome of the nightmare upset jillian it did not register in her expression tell me about the nice part of the dream she said she leaned her body against his he tingled at the feel of her skin pressed against his own we were kissing he said like this she held his face in both her hands first their lips met then parted their tongues explored with increasing urgency the feel of her hands caressing the back of his neck and the gentle pull of her fingers through his hair sent shivers through him still kissing she eased him onto his back and nestled in next to him yes nick breathed into her ear we were kissing just like that nick had dozed off perhaps only for a few minutes when his cell phone startled him awake images of their lovemaking refused to leave he could not believe that it had happened and could not wait for it to happen again reaching across jillian he answered the phone and set it on speaker hello this is nick garrity he said having to clear his voice after the first word came out as a croak three years ago umberto vasquez was transported by ambulance from the singh medical spa and cosmetic surgery center to shelby stone memorial go on nick said to mollender three years and one month ago to the day to be exact vasquez was brought by a private ambulance littleton ambulance services it looks like ive tried google yahoo and a couple of other places but i cant find them and ive never heard of them i cant thank you enough for doing this saul maybe not but i will take that gift your friend ms coates was kind enough to make for methat is if she hasnt incinerated it jillian nodded vigorously and gave nick a thumbsup nope she still has it shes an optimist youre a good man saul mollender nick said not really im a bit of a dud i know that i did it because i believe andy would have wanted me to and i trust you not really sure why i guess when you spend your day reading medical records you forget the humanity that goes into those pages perhaps you reminded me of that it was then nick realized jillian had started getting dressed saul hold on a second pulling the phone up to cover the receiver with his hand nick asked where you going that date belle was a nursing student at shelby stone on the day umberto was brought there im going back to the hospital before my shift to see if i can catch up with nancy lane at the nursing school shes been like a mother to each of her students for over twenty years and she keeps incredible records theres a chance that shell be able to figure out where belle was working that day im certain thats where her path and umbertos crossed and thats how she knew about nick fury good idea saul sorry you still there yeah im here so what floor did umberto go to after he was dropped off at shelby stone well thats where it gets really interesting mollender said how so there are no other entries in his record nothing not a word according to all ive been able to find umberto vasquez was delivered at shelby stone memorial at ten oclock that morning then he just disappeared from our records its as if he simply dropped off the face of the earth chapter on the way south jillian phoned nancy lane dean of the nursing school at the shelby stone institute of health professions she had seen the woman at belles funeral and then received several concerned calls from her after that during the horrible days following the fire in her condo when it appeared as though jillian was destined for an extended stay in a residence inn or crashed out in a succession of friends guest rooms lane had come through for her as she had in so many situations for so many students one phone call was all it took to secure a room for jillian indefinitely in anne marie cosco hall the nursing school dorm lane was not in her office when jillian called but her secretary felt certain she would be back before leaving for the day in addition to all her help the dean was one of the few who did not discount that belle had been murdered hopefully knowing that jillians request to meet pertained to her sister would be enough to keep lane in her office with time to think during the sluggish drive to dc jillians mind wandered to the beautiful and entirely unexpected afternoon spent in nicks arms her desire to take their relationship to the next level had she acknowledged been there almost from the start he was a beautiful deeply caring man with demons that were keeping him somewhat at bay but she felt ready and anxious to help him drive them from his life all the two of them needed now was time belle had once likened jillians dating life to the oregon trail joking that it had begun along the smooth tracks of the hopes and desires of her admirers only to become littered along the way with pieces of their broken hearts if only her sister could be here to meet nick jillians feelings for him were unlike any she had ever experienced before and after they had made love her mind flashed like neon with a giddy but also panicky thoughtthis was it nick garrity was the one logjammed by the heavy afternoon traffic jillian grew increasingly anxious about her chances of catching the dean in by the time she had parked and trekked from the garage to the office she had all but given up she had also given up intellectualizing her feelings for nick and was ready to let emotion guide her lanes office door was closed and there was no light spilling out from underneath it jillian cursed softly thanks to saul mollender they had taken a huge step forward in connecting belle to umberto vasquez and possibly learning more about why she had been killed armed with the bewildering information that umbertos medical record had him going by ambulance from the singh center to shelby stone where his arrival was never documented jillian wanted to move as quickly as possible something was very wrong with singhs clinic and now it seemed quite possible that something was rotten at shelby stone as well she made a tentative knock then sighed with relief when she heard movement from within nancy lane in a charcoal business suit embraced her warmly in her early sixties the dean had grayed over the years and with her granny glasses and jovial laugh reminded some of santas wife but she was a force she had almost singlehandedly built the nursing school into one of the top in the country and was showing no signs of slowing thank you for waiting jillian said everything all right in the dorms perfect it seems like lately im always thanking you for something but thank you for that one staying here has made a huge difference the insurance company has come through so now im looking for a new place take your time dear stay here as long as you need to so come into my office sit down and lets talk thank you again jillian followed lane into her office suite accepted a cup of tea and settled in on the sofa beside her so tell me now whats going on the dean asked i understand its about belle yes you know i think about your sister all the time jillian nothing about her death makes any sense i wrote a recommendation for her when she moved to charlotte and she called me so excited when she got the icu job she was already such a shining star in our profession her loss has affected us all deeply with effort jillian used her anger to help her maintain composure i know that she said which is why i came to see you many people admired and loved belle but you are one of the few who truly understood and believed in my conviction that she would never ever take her own life i did then and i do today ive formed a friendship with a doctor named nick garrity he runs the medical van that drives around caring for the homeless people around dc and baltimore yes of course i have heard wonderful things about him and the marvelous nurse who works with him junie wright actually they are partners in the van they do such good for so many well theres a connection between belle and nick that ill tell you about when i have more time for now suffice it to say that nick and i might be closing in on finding her killer oh my god please be careful lane said so far were just feeling our way along but were not taking any chances jillian replied smiling inwardly at the recent events in the singh center we dont have all the facts yet so were not ready to make any claims but belles death might be linked to the disappearance of nicks close friend a soldier named umberto vasquez so what can i do to help jillian withdrew a folded piece of paper and handed it over i need to know where belle might have been on that date three years ago she was a senior nursing student back then i think that date might be very important somehow but i cant be sure let me check our record keeping for student schedules is a bit haphazard so this could be tough ill start by pulling up her transcript from student services lane crossed the office and settled in at her desk jillian took the black spindlebacked chair cattycorner to her the search did not take long well i may have something here the dean said after no more than two minutes lane motioned for jillian to look at her computer screen seeing belles school photo in the upper right corner of her digitized nursing school transcript brought a now familiar mix of sadness and intense anger to her chest intuitively lane took hold of jillians hand your sister was a beautiful woman lane said inside and out we have all her awards faculty recommendations and certifications listed here she was a standout member of our community admired by her peers and revered by our faculty anything on or around that specific date no not on the date you gave me though i thought it reminded me of something then i saw this here lane pointed to an entry in belles transcript it was an honor we gave belle for being one of our top students she was allowed to observe as part of her rotation in surgery the operation for aleem syed mohammad jillian drew a blank on the name though it sounded familiar sensing her former students puzzlement lane helped her out mohammad was a terroristone of the highest ranking we have ever captured our troops found him in a cavesomewhere in pakistan i think i dont remember the exact details but i recall that his men defended him to the death he was turned over to the cia and was brought back here of course i remember now belle told me about what happened i was away but she saved me the newspaper articles exactly not long after he was captured mohammad became progressively ill and was found to have a rather large tumor in his heartquite a rare tumor as i recall although im blocking on the name he needed major openheart surgery to remove it our hospital was selected for the operation because of our proximity to where he was being held in virginia plus weve handled this sort of highprofile thing before as i said i was away at the time friends and i were climbing in the rockies belle was the only nursing student in the or yes there was also a medical student she told me the operation what there was of it was a nightmare mohammad was the secondmostwanted terrorist in the world behind bin laden himself capturing him was quite a feat im glad i dont know what methods were being used to interrogate him but that all came to a halt when he became ill a team of experts was assembled from around the country to perform the surgery then as they were transferring mohammad from the stretcher to the operating table he had a cardiac arrest never made it to the surgery how was belle chosen to observe the case it was very lastminute who got picked because we werent sure right up until the day of the operation if the government folks were going to allow it as i recall there was no doubt about choosing her jillian was truly dumbfounded by the news the day after umberto disappeared after he had been delivered by ambulance to shelby stone memorial hospital belle witnessed the operating room death of one of the worlds most feared and reviled terrorists there had to be a connection but what and were those events in any way tied to belles murder three years later no matter how she twisted that thought in her mind jillian could not see how they could be at the moment though umberto vasquez aleem syed mohammad and dr nick fury were all they had despite the lack of an obvious scenario that connected the three this was going to be exciting news to share with nick do you have any idea who else was in the operating room that day she asked finally i dont have a clue im sure some of the names are in the mans hospital record we could check there or we could see if the case was recorded recorded yes did you know about the cameras hooked up in the operating rooms no i didnt do you record every operation lane shook her head we dont have the resources to do that because each operation has to be edited down to a manageable length and then transferred to dvd for storage but selected casesthe ones of teaching or legal or historical importanceare recorded now where do we get the funding for that as part of a grantfederal i think shelby stone was one of the first metropolitan hospitals to install video equipment in all twentyfour of our operating rooms we use the videos in our teaching curriculum and so do the medical school and residency programs in addition ive heard of a couple of malpractice suits that have been squashed because of the recordings do you think mohammads operation was filmed jillian asked well i suppose if theyre going to record any case theyd have done that one then there should be a dvd of his operation archived somewhere jillian said i think youre right lane said we request them by the surgical procedure or even by the surgeon and the record room transmits it to us or maybe sends a disc over i could ask one of our instructors how it all works dont worry about that jillian replied youve been an amazing help already but how will you find out jillian flashed on the mole i have someone i can call she said chapter phillip maccandliss knew the jericho people would come to their senses given the level of exposure and risk thrust upon him following the manny ferris breach they had actually gotten off easy in addition to vasquez and ferris he had delivered three other worthless vets to them over the last four years the three like vasquez and ferris before them were near duplicates for the photos jericho had provided himsevenoutoftenpoint matches for the facial characteristics they had insisted upon one of them an eight five hundred thousand for that kind of judgment resourcefulness and loyalty was a small price to pay especially when he revealed the precautions he had taken to back up his demand for a bonus jericho was cia and it would have been foolish to make demands of them without some sort of protection despite jerichos reassurances the hacking of the computer system at the va had him edgy if he needed to bolt suddenly he would need a solid escape plan and the money to make it work true he could not come up with that much incriminating evidence to put in the safedeposit box he told them about but they had no way of knowing true he had no idea who jericho was but he did have the photos and the names of the men he had turned over to them as well as the reasons for his suspicions that jericho was a unit within the cia a tape of the conversations with his contact would have been nice to have but assuming it was the cia they had ways of telling when they were being recorded the bottom line was that his jericho contact seemed impressed enough with the steps he had taken to ensure they didnt mess with him and that was all that mattered humming an offkey rendition of god bless america maccandliss maneuvered his dented and rusting subaru impreza through dcs downtown stopandgo afternoon traffic en route to the designated meeting place a room at the crescent hotel the car needed a new timing belt and the transmission fluid was leaking but that didnt matter nowat least it wouldnt in a little while his first move with the money would be to replace his junker with something sexiermuch sexier money was power and he was about to have a lot more of both a half a million dollars by his accounting would net him many thousands more given how he planned to invest it how he was going to hide this newfound wealth so his ex wouldnt get her grubby paws on any of it was a detail he had yet to work out but he would maccandliss had been warned that the crescent was a dumprooms by the hour but such a place meant no security cameras once inside the seedy hotel lobby he proceeded to the front desk as per plan he was carrying an empty duff el bag may i help you the attendant asked the man behind the dimly lit counter had a cherubic face and a hapless burntout smile ive misplaced my room key not a problem name and room number phillip maccandliss room seventwentyseven he replied citing the room number provided him by his contact maccandliss then handed the desk attendant his drivers license and just like that he had a key to the hotel room that supposedly he had already procured maccandliss chuckled to himself while waiting in the lobby for the elevator to take him up to seven these guys just couldnt get enough spy shit it was all a game to thema big game as he marched along the threadbare corridor carpet he wondered why they bothered going through the missing key bit wouldnt it have been just as easy if he made the reservation himself and then checked in to the room before the meeting the ruse made him only a little curious they had their reasons his expertise was in selecting perfect candidates for jericho theirs was in playing spy games there was a do not disturb sign around the handle of room maccandliss removed it and slipped his electronic key into the slot payday he thought he entered the room putting the sign back where it had been the television was on probably something connected with the illusion jericho was creating that he had checked in earlier the door connecting with the adjoining room was locked the bathroom door was ajar and the light was on except for half of the stall shower which was covered by a featureless plastic curtain he could see no one was there hello he said tentatively anyone in there feeling suddenly ill at ease he flipped on the light the room was as he had expectedgloomy and tawdry with frayed curtains and a faded bedspread it was impossible not to wonder how many sexual engagements had been consummated on the queensized bed over the years he lifted the hem of the spread the mattress was up on a wooden platform with a sigh designed to slow his pounding heart he rounded the bed and stepped into the bathroom the toilet and ruststained sink had to be at least fifty years old and the tiny institutional hexagonal tiles were probably even older than that hello he said again a tidal wave of apprehension swept over him as he grasped the edge of the curtain and jerked it open the stall was empty except for a black overnight bag sitting on the drain the money he thought excitedly goddamn game players maccandliss felt his tension begin to abate and actually managed a tight smile then as he reached down for the bag he realized that it was hisname tag and all not a replicahis taken from the hall closet in his apartment damn them give him the money he had asked for but make sure he never took them for granted good move he had to hand it to them a really good move he hefted the bag up reentered the bedroom and gasped his heart stopped completely then decided to beat again a man was standing at the foot of the bedtall and well built with a narrow face and dark hair swept back he was dressed completely in black wore wirerimmed glasses and was carrying a black briefcase god you scared the shit out of me sorry for that the man said i knocked but there was no answer you what i didnt h the man tossed the briefcase onto the bed heres your money then whats in here what do you think this is a hotel with what i have on you you guys are real jerks to play a stunt like this whoever broke into my apartment and took my stuff out ought to be canned actually that was me names koller like the toilet maccandliss snapped different spelling koller said with an unsettling grin maccandliss opened his bag and pulled out clothes for an overnight stay toiletrieshis toiletriesand an inchthick packet of photographs secured with a rubber band he snapped the elastic getting it off and stung his fingers cursing he let the photoscolored snapshots and blackandwhite professional jobs pristine and wellwornfall out onto the bed then he shuffled them around they were all of children dozens and dozens of naked boys and girls from toddler to teen all races in all manner of poses and postures and angles many of them quite unsettling what the not yours no theyre not fucking mine ive never been into this sort of thing oh my mistake koller said happy to see maccandliss touch a number of the pictures let me make it up to you he snapped open the briefcase and flipped up the lid hundreddollar billsstacks of them thats more like it maccandliss said greedily snatching one of the stacks beneath the single hundred there was only blank paper you can count it koller said calmly its all there before maccandliss could straighten up he felt a sharp jab at the base of his neck in that same instant with just a small amount of pressure the succinylcholine was in his body kollers powerful arms had him before he could even mount a struggle less than twentyfive seconds later restraint was unnecessary youre a very stupid man koller said maccandliss terrified felt the muscles in his body begin to quiver as though insects were burrowing below his skin the man let go of him and he dropped to his knees then toppled over onto his back what have you done to me did you really think your little safedeposit box would protect you it took me ten minutes to find the key you taped under your bureau drawer ten minutes your lawyers name was all over papers in your desk well have no trouble getting him to cooperate with us when we reason with him and he learns about the perversions youve been involved in maccandliss was wide awake and alert but nearly helpless his chest was tightening squeezing on his heart im dying did he say that aloud or just think it youre not dying but you will die koller said i didnt inject enough sux to overdose you i wouldnt want you to miss your fall you see youre going to jump out this hotel window and splatter i do hope nobody is underneath when you land maccandlisss lips felt like stone unmovable the quivering of his muscles had stopped why he mouthed before he could no longer move his lips i love it the killer said it never fails always the same question from you guys why well hell i honestly dont know why somebody paid me to kill you but i do know why you will kill yourself you see although you dont know it you called the help desk at work yesterday and had your laptop sent to the it department for some routine maintenance shame on you for having so much kiddie porn on it gruesome stuff really somebody tipped you off about the find theres an email to that effect which you apparently read last night so you know the noose around your neck was starting to tighten they were going to bag you on child porn do you know what they do to short eyes in prison so you checked into this hotel last night brought only a few of your things which youve already seen here nobody is going to question why phillip maccandliss jumped out the seventhstory window of the crescent hotel the sux will already be metabolized so your autopsy wont show any drugs and he had two little girls everyone will say such a shame nearly effortlessly koller lifted maccandliss off the floor and turned so that his mark could get one last look at the money easy come easy go koller said my advice is to just relax and enjoy the ride phillip maccandliss felt himself being maneuvered over the windowsill for a moment as he hung down his lids fell open giving him a view of the scene seven stories below then he felt hands pushing on his bottom and he began to slide forward its not going to happen he thought but it was he slid off the sill and was instantly airborne the wind whipped past his face as the world rose up to meet him despite what he had read on several claim filings from vets who had neardeath experiences his demise wasnt painless and beautiful or filled with a warming beckoning light there was only pain brief and beyond excruciating nearly every bone in his body shattered at once his skull erupted against the hood of a parked car fragments of his brain exploded onto the windshield like a spattering of bugs seven stories above franz koller mussed the bedspread scattered the pornographic photos about set the toiletries on the sink and left room through room pausing only to check that the door between them was locked nicely done chapter if there ever was a dvd recording of the aleem syed mohammad operation its gone now saul mollender sounded bewildered but also more energized than nick had ever heard him it was nearly half past midnight and the mole had just returned the call nick had left on his machine at seven giving him details of jillians meeting with the nursing school dean patient volume on the fourstop baltimore loop had been unusually light and nick and junie were already parked on the street by her house nearly done cleaning up the rv does that make any sense nick now slouched in the drivers seat asked mollender were talking about one of the most highprofile cases that shelby stone has ever had since they had the capability to do so how could it not have been recorded i dont have any record of the surgery in my database either thats crazy but theres more when can we meet now of course now do you want to know whats happened here or dont you nick rubbed at the gritty fatigue stinging his eyes the day had started early and the ecstatic exhaustion from his time with jillian had never gone away you cant tell me over the phone he asked if i wanted to tell you over the phone i would have told you over the phone the mole said suddenly sounding like his old testy self junie who had finished restocking waved that she was done and motioned nick to lock up jillian wont be off duty until one he said after junie had left i want her to be there does she have my plaque if she does shell bring it i dont want to meet in or near the hospital are you going weird on me nick came close to asking okay well meet wherever you want he said instead but remember i have to drive in from baltimore should be fun without any traffic for a change theres an allnight coffee shop mikes on south dakota near eighteenth one thirty make it two nick said just as he hung up junie startled him with a knock on the passenger side door this folder was on the kitchen table with a note from reggie for you she said passing it over hes an artiste on the internet nick replied so i asked him to do a little research for me thanks next time ask him to do some homework good job tonight junie winked at him and headed to her house as the quiet closed in nick flipped through the articles reggie had put together then closed the folder and sat staring through the darkness at nothing in particular quickly his thoughts homed in on umbertoclear images of the man as he was at fob savannah working in the base clinic during his offhours taking vital signs straightening up the waiting room smiling and joking with the patients always smiling always joking what in the hell had become of him why was mollender suddenly acting so secretive what was the connection between belle and dr nick fury had she really crossed paths with umberto or did she hear the name from someone else hopefully the answers to those questions would not remain elusive for much longer finally with a prolonged stretch and a deep sigh nick flipped open his cell phone and called jillian hope you can stay awake a little longer he said weve been summoned by the mole it seemed as if the owners of mikes la diner and coffee emporium had tried and failed any number of times to find an identity for the place there was neon and more neon framed blackandwhite glossies of bogie bacall and betty and a greasestained menu that was a cross between a railroad car diners and starbucks there was also at almost two in the morning a decentsized crowd that included college students from nearby catholic university street people and a few affluent suburbanites but did not to this point at least include saul mollender while waiting for the man nick ordered a black coffee and jillian an iced tea fries and a grilled cheese sandwich there was no overt discussion about their afternoon lovemaking both felt comfortable simply being together holding hands underneath the table and proposing different theories that would fit the bizarre truncated medical record of umberto vasquez and the absence of any videorecording of the aleem syed mohammad operation maybe they didnt record it for security reasons jillian suggested possibly but i would think the cia or whoever was in charge of questioning the dude would have wanted to show the world how enlightened and compassionate we were even to one of the archenemies of our country any idea why mollender would have said he wanted to meet us out here i still dont know him well enough to say he sounded a little i dont know disconnected on the phone sort of squirrellysensitive and tuned in one moment brash and confrontational the next the keys to everything are the hospital records and the video of that operation nick then i guess well just have to wait and see what the mole found hopefully we wont have to wait long she gestured behind nick saul mollender approached their table with his head down and his gaze shifting from side to side as if he were part of some clandestine operation he skipped the formality of shaking hands and quickly sat himself down on the empty chair across from them people have been talking mollender said nick thought the man seemed agitated and anxious talking whos talking what about about me mollender said one of my two employees noticed i was doing some research for you he spoke to the other of my employees and they both started asking questions about our investigation jillian asked heck no mollender snapped my team doesnt gossip thats against my policy but the two of them are wondering if ive turned over a new leaf and decided to become more helpful to peoplegod forbid friendly even nick shook his head in disbelief you made us come all the way out here at two in the morning just so you could protect your reputation of being a grouch mollender remained tightlipped and serious do you know what would happen if word got out that people could just barge into my office and not only demand attention from me but actually get it by the way do you have my plaque suppressing a smile jillian passed the framed calligraphy across mentally adding the records room head to the list of the most eccentric people she knew so youre worried that maybe people might actually i dont know use your services she asked funny very funny but yes first of all our services such as they are are dwindling with each record we make electronic ever hear of a position whose job it was to make itself obsolete were literally working ourselves out of existence the only way we three can stay employed is if no one knows were there easy saul easy jillian said gently you can only do what you can do i guess now can you tell us what you found out mollender motioned the waitress over and ordered a tall glass of skim milk warmed on the stove not in a microwave and dont try and trick me he said to the girl i can tell he turned back to nick and jillian what i found out is that fred johnson is even more of a jackass than i originally thought fred johnson nick asked before i delve into him can you tell me why somebody would have wanted to steal the dvd of that operation did you say steal i thought you just said it was gone and thats the truth if it ever existed its gone now why am i not surprised nick said i personally supervised setting up the video camera system in the ors over six years ago for that reason let alone everything else ive done for my unit over the past twenty years youd think id be the one selected to run the electronic medical records department but no smarmy fred johnson gets the position over me just because hes the ctos nephew or cousin or something that true thats what i heard the personnel lady told me i was lacking people skills whatever those are but i never believed her smarmy i think the word was invented for fred do you have any proof that somebody stole the dvd of mohammads operation we have three cameras in each of our twentyfour operating rooms on three separate floorsa direct overhead shot into the incision one up from the foot of the table and one that continuously pans the room including the anesthesiologists station at the head of the table each camera is attached to a dvr machine by cables like a supercharged tivo amazing nick said pleased to sense that the mole had regained much of his equilibrium the waitress returned with the stovewarmed milk and mollender sampled it like a wine connoisseur before nodding his approval supervising the recording process he went on after a few sips is one of the few functions my little department still has but ive heard rumors that it might not be for long damn johnson anyhow as things stand the or supervisor tells us which operations they want recorded and we push the buttonswell my assistant annette does anyway she has a booth in the operating suite and works from there at the end of each day she burns the cases onto dvds because we cant store all that data indefinitely on the dvr machines we also keep a registry of the discs which is what the instructors use to look up operations they want to show their students we catalog them not only by date and time but also by idc code and keywords i checked after you called doctor there is no entry anyplace for aleem syed mohammads surgery could somebody have taken the dvd and deleted the entry in your database as well jillian asked anything is possible i suppose but why would somebody do that actually i asked myself that very question any number of times tell me about this mohammad fellow what do you know about him nick produced the folder of articles reggie had printed out during the evening mohammad was born and raised in jordan nick said he was in his late forties when he was captured in karachi by us and pakistani special forces in a joint operation codenamed shining star theres no telling how many deaths he was responsible for he was a prime suspect in several major bombings including the massacre at the united states embassy in new delhi whats his affiliation mollender asked are we talking al qaeda nick shook his head i havent had time to go through all this yet he said but i think not at first apparently at some point after the iraq invasion his organization islamic jihad in jordan merged with the al qaeda terror network making him one of the most powerful and wanted terrorists in the world the mole thought for a few beats yes i remember now his capture was touted as a major victory in the war against terror correct nick said the controversy that erupted when word got out that mohammad required surgery to remove a dangerous cardiac tumor and that a team of doctors had been assembled for the operation was intense i guess there were those who felt the famed hippocratic oath phrase do no harm applied to the doctors but not to the patients mollender said chuckling at his own humor there were threats made by extremist groups who wanted him saved and others who wanted him not treated at all nick added they promised retaliation against anyone who helped keep mohammad alive which they believed would have made it possible for us to torture him some more thats why the location where his surgery was scheduled to be performed was kept a closely guarded secret right up until the day of the operation according to nancy lane at the nursing school jillian said a lot of people felt justice had been served when mohammad died on the operating table that day autopsy results indicated he suffered a massive brain aneurysm and subsequent cardiac arrest from chronic high blood pressure tough way to go mollender said thats why we need to see the tape of his operation maybe belles death was some sort of retribution for his death even though its hard to understand why they waited three years but why her nick asked saul that operation is all we have at the moment we need to know everything we can about it i cant believe you of all people dont have a backup mollender snickered hence my statement that fred johnson is a jackass what does he have to do with any of this nick asked before johnson took over i would send the dvds by mail to my friend noreen siliski who runs a disaster recovery business in sutton virginia she would then copy the files to her servers and mail the dvds back to me and bingo wed have our backup noreen is a wonderful person very bright very unique we were once quite close now were just good friends you dont sound so pleased about that im not really but like you said what can you do sorry can you go on so when fred johnson takes over and sees this minuscule payment were giving noreen each month the guy decides to flex his muscles make it a point to the hospital administrators that hes looking after every nickel and dime meanwhile his emr department is a million over budget i was told to stop sending backups to noreen jillian frowned im afraid to ask when johnson made you stop using your friend for disaster recovery four years ago a year before mohammads operation so thats it then no video even if we were able to find out what personnel were in the or that day it wont tell us anything about what happened during the operation for the first time jillian noted a glint in the moles eyes well all might not be as bleak as it seems my friend he said you see if mohammads surgery was ever recorded then there is a copy of that video nobody knows about thats why i asked who would want to steal it and cover their tracks by deleting it from my database log and the real reason why i wanted to meet here if someones stolen the original dvds i didnt want to meet anywhere near the place but you just told us there wasnt any backup nick said i told you there wasnt supposed to be any backup well with fred johnson being so selfrighteous about noreen and at the same time being so wrong i guess i forgot to put in the paperwork to shut down our little disaster recovery operation you mean yup fred johnson assumed as did everybody else that we stopped sending dvds to noreen but as with most things the pompous jackass was wrong buried in that massive budget of his is one tiny line item that he wouldnt find unless he went through the whole thing ten times with a finetooth comb you see i changed the name of noreens company but i never canceled her contract with us saul let me buy you another milk jillian said chapter better safe than sorry electronic storage noreen siliskis data backup and recovery business was located in an isolated threestory brick business center on the outskirts of sutton virginia it was ten in the morning when nick pulled into the nearly deserted parking lot rush hour traffic away from the city had been intense although he suspected it was not unusually so nick had the entire day free junie would be working the rv with one of his backups a seventyyearold retired professor of medicine from georgetowna brilliant caring woman who was beloved by the patients and utterly devoted to the evening each week she spent on the roads with helping hands the drive across the river and south was made in virtual silence mollender sitting in back with his hands folded tightly in his lap stared out the window of nicks cutlass cierra in the front nick and jillian were each engrossed in the same gnawing question would the recording of aleem syed mohammads illfated surgery shed any light at all on the strange oneway ambulance trip of umberto from the singh center to shelby stone or on belles subsequent murder three years later just pull in there a couple of spaces left of the dumpster mollender said breaking the prolonged silence the chute is coming out of noreens office on the third floor shes always remodeling you got it nick said easing into the spot down on the seat where the mole could not see jillian squeezed nicks hand then they followed mollender into a rather stark tiled lobby and up two flights of stairs at that instant a gunshot rang out from within noreens office then several more in rapid succession nick pounded once on the door and grasped the knob the door flew open the womans outer office which was about the size of a twocar garage had been stripped down to the studs on a stepladder at the center of the room wielding a hefty cordless nail gun was noreen siliski this is what one can do when there is almost no human traffic noreen said making no mention of nicks rather sensational entrance as she stepped down to the floor and shook hands heartily with the new arrivals business was good when i petitioned the owner to add storage space when he finally approved the changes business was bad but i love building things so im doing it anyway half the office was covered by bedsheets sprinkled with a fine misting of sawdust the smell of freshly cut wood hung pleasantly in the air in the center of the main room next to the ladder was a wooden rolling workbench underneath and on top of which were an assortment of tools including a circular saw and cordless drill noreen siliski was a pleasantlooking brunette slightly on the muscular side with her dark hair pulled back in a sizeable ponytail nick sensed that her jeans and white denim work shirt might be the central elements of her wardrobe its wonderful that youre doing this all yourself noreen jillian said its sort of learn as you go but ive always been able to handle most tools finally mollender stepped forward i like what youre doing here noreen he said seeming somewhat cowed thats nice of you to say saul so you have the recording jillian asked anxious to break the negative vibes she sensed were building between the two i believe i do saul told me the date i digitize and archive all the video files he sends me so it was easy to find i burned it to dvd so we can watch it here in the office can you pull the shades over there noreen went to the back room and quickly returned struggling some to push a steel av cart over the threshold and into a free corner of the room in front of a quartet of folding chairs on the top of the cart was a fortyinch hd television set with a dvd player on the shelf beneath it as the door she came through began closing nick caught a glimpse of the work space that lay behind itone with a raised floor similar to the call center at don reeses precinct headquarters and racks that he figured were used to house her computer equipment nick proceeded over to the wall housing three doublehung windows the chute to the dumpster an absolute marvel of practical engineering opened at the center one the chute was constructed of large heavy rubber trash barrels with the bottoms cut out stacked one just inside another and held in place by chains looped through the handles and bolted above the inside of the window the threestory drop to the dumpster was a modest arc rather than a straight shot and the overall appearance of the green barrels was that of a giant caterpillar remarkable nick said calling jillian over to see how did you know how to do this she asked amazed how else noreen replied the internet i just drop that canvas flap down over the window when i leave it took a few trips to a few hardware and home depot stores to get enough barrels but it wasnt that expensive or that hard to build nick closed the blinds and dropped the canvas over the window opening with the room sufficiently dark they gathered in front of the television nick and jillian were both feeling too anxious to sit well i hope this disc is holding what youre looking for we hope so too nick said in that case i think we should get on with this noreen slipped the dvd into the slot and with a nod of understanding to her guests pressed play chapter you ready for this nick asked as the screen lit up with static dunno jillian said grimly are you im not sure weve come so far i cant believe im going to see belle alive want me to stop it nick asked holding up the remote given to him by noreen no but i want to sit down i think jillian inhaled deeply and took nicks hand in the darkness they were six feet from the screen about to watch a video that included the death of a patient it also was probably going to include shots of jillians younger sister subsequently murdered in a manner that every policeman involved with the case believed was suicide saul mollender and noreen siliski sat next to each other behind and to the right of the others the tension in the room was high in half a minute the static gave way to a set of standard legal notices yellow on black that included a summary of the hipaa laws surrounding patient confidentiality an outline of who was allowed to view the recording and for what purposes and the name of the editor annette furst department of medical records finally came the hospital name date and operating room number jillian was rigid in her seat squeezing blood from nicks hand the introductory information was in the same yellow print patient aleem syed mohammad hospital id karachi pakistan condition cardiac rhabdomyoma procedure cardiopulmonary bypass excision of rhabdomyoma cardiac reconstruction present in the operating room surgeon abigail spielmann md asst surgeon lewis leonard md cardiac surgical resident yasmin dasariolan md anesthesiologist thomas landrew md perfusionist roger pendleton ccp cert abcp scrub nurse kimberly fox circulating nurse cassandra browningleavitt medical student yu jiang nursing student belle coates nick felt the energy in jillians grip increase at the sight of her sisters name he froze the picture do we know who dr abigail spielmann is he asked i think she was brought in from another hospital the mole replied probably an expert in cardiac tumors like this one she must be big stuff if the cardiac surgical chief would allow it jillian said nick undid the pause the printing gave way to a gleaming operating room three cameras according to mollenderone of them straight down into where the patient would be placed on the now empty table one up from the foot and the other giving a wideangle shot of the entire operating room the video editors job mollender explained was to mix the various camera angles into a cohesive and useful presentation the opening sequence was shot from the wideangle camera and showed the perfusionist wearing scrubs a mask and hair cover but set back from the sterile field where the surgeons would be working seated behind the long heartlung bypass machine he looked like a concert pianist preparing for a performance he was chatting with the scrub nurse need anything the perfusionist said cassandras right outside the audio and visual feeds were excellent as a matter of fact yes the scrub nurse replied the only thing from dr spielmanns instrument list that i dont have here is a locness tissue stabilizer could you ask cassandra to get one for me please will do have you met spielmann she came by to see me a little while ago she seems terrific i thought the same thing be right back the scrub nurse was positioned just above and behind where dr abigail spielmann would be working she was ready for the casegloved gowned and masked with intense dark eyes looking out from beneath her blue hair covering as she checked through a huge tray of instruments at that point there was some obvious editingeleven minutes according to the running digital time in the upper right corner the perfusionist was back at his post and the circulating nurse had appeared and was helping one of the surgeons a darkskinned woman it appeared into her gloves and gown it felt stranger to nick than he had expected to be viewing or drama after so long between his internship residency fellowship in trauma surgery private practice and the military he had been a surgeon for more than nine years before the explosion that took sarahnearly as long as he had been away from his specialty suddenly jillians grasp on his hand intensified two people a man and a woman both in scrubs mask and hair covers entered through the main doors and took a position against the wall well away from the table thats her jillian whispered loudly thats belle nick was able to make out a tallish slender woman with very attractive eyes if dr spielmann has no objections the circulating nurse told belle and the medical student well get you up on risers so you can see more than peoples backs either way the procedure will be on that screen have you both read up on cardiac rhabdomyomas yes the students said in unison nick felt jillian stiff en at the sound of her sisters voice great the circulator went on so you know its not a cancer that spreads to other parts of the body but it arises from the inner heart muscle and just keeps growing and taking up space until cardiac function becomes severely compromised there was another lengthy edit leading to the sudden appearance at the head of the table of the anesthesiologist and on the left side of the table another surgeonthe first assistant nick assumed actually remembering lewis leonard from the list of players because of a gradeschool classmate in oregon with the same name at that moment the main doors burst open and aleem syed mohammad was wheeled in by two men in scrubs surgical masks and hair covers in a short while the infamous murderer and terrorist lying so peacefully on the stretcher was going to be dead mohammad eyes closed probably in a pleasant swoon from his preop medication had a sheet draped across his body from the midchest down he was a swarthy rather handsome man with high cheekbones and narrow features including a striking aquiline nose nick got a brief clear view of him as he was transferred onto the operating table one of the two transport men remained in the room and was posted to belles right on the other side of the main doors nick recalled that such a person was not identified in the roster of those observing the procedure and speculated that he was a security presence probably from the cia he was a stocky man of average height and although only his eyes and throat were exposed there was something strangely familiar about him the door to the scrub room opened and the principal medical player in the scene dr abigail spielmann backed into the room her hands up in front of her palms in she was a surprisingly slight woman with light blue eyes that sparkled with intelligence despite the distance from the camera the hand drying and nurseassisted gowning of the cardiac surgeon was edited out dr landrew she said to the anesthesiologist every word tinged with authority anything i should know about in his preop examination his history and examination were done with the help of an interpreter the patient had not received any medication that would alter his mental status but he still seemed a little groggy despite the grogginess you trust his signing of the consent form spielmann asked i do there were three witnessestwo nurses from his floor and his interpreter i actually spoke with him after you did spielmann said i have been using some tapes to learn a little arabic mr mohammad seemed to know what i was saying which made me very pleased i was able to pick out a few words he said but just a few at the time we spoke he seemed tired but in command of his faculties so i agree with you dr landrew excellent then are we ready to get this show on the road ready mr pendleton ready doctor said the perfusionist okay then well put him to sleep and prep him as a team according to the method i have distributed to each of you those of you observing can take your places on the risers after he is asleep prepped and draped questions there were none the anesthesiologist adjusted his position to inject what nick felt certain was succinylcholine to paralyze mohammad before inserting a breathing tube into his trachea but at that instant aleem syed mohammad began to move first he stirred then he groaned then he reached both hands up and squeezed them against the sides of his head next he began to moan then he cried out loudly and suddenly he screamed a moment later he sat bolt upright flailing his arms and screeching at the top of his lungs in what nick assumed was arabic instantly everyone around the operating table seemed to be speaking and moving at once the surgeons and the circulating nurse tried to force him back onto the table his flailing arms caught one of the assistants on the side of the face and sent her sprawling his iv tore from his arm blood instantly began oozing through the gauze that had been holding the large cannula in place his cries of pain grew louder still his eyes seemed twice their natural size he violently snapped his head from side to side as if trying to dislodge a parasite then with his arms waving wildly he flung himself off the table sending the circulating nurse and a surgical assistant crashing into the heartlung perfusion pump which rose up on two wheels and toppled over the camera angle switched to the one looking from the foot of the or bed toward the headthe only view that could show the utter chaos on the operating room floor where three people struggled amidst the fluids from the ivs and the perfusion machine saedoony saedoony mohammad shouted out im sure thats arabic nick said but i dont know what it means despite the noise and commotion mohammads words were clear saedoony ahderoo lee eddoctor fury ahderoo lee eddoctor nick fury saedoony socorro ay√∫denme b√∫squenme al doctor nick fury oh my god nick exclaimed in a strained whisper that last bit wasnt arabic it was spanish its umberto thats his voice i swear it is hes calling for me saedoony umbertos screams echoed through the room the camera angle was switched to the overhead view then as suddenly as it had started the thrashing and screaming ended the surgical assistants stumbled to their feet and lifted the lifeless body of their patient back onto the table nick felt ill as the mans head flopped back his face was absolutely that of aleem syed mohammad plastic surgery nick realized lots of it pump abigail spielmann ordered endotracheal tube is in no pulse someone called out both lungs aerating ekg is hooked up flat line absolutely flat pupils are blown fully dilated and fixed on both sides keep pumping bp zero looks as if he blew an aneurysm in his head abigail spielmann said with seasoned calm a huge one i suspect could i have two ccs of epi on an intracardiac needle i think we should see what this does and then make a decision about opening his chest for manual compressions bp still zero spielmann took the long cardiac needle and drove it down beside the patients sternum keeping suction on the plunger there was an immediate jet of dark almost black blood into the syringe she injected the contents into the left ventricle of the heart nothing straight line bp zero pupils fixed i cannot see anything to be gained by going to the final level and opening this mans chest anyone feel differently there was only silence from the room okay then time of death ten thirtyone am thank you everybody i appreciate your efforts im very sorry this happened the overhead camera showed the deceased mans face staring sightlessly upward at the saucer lights nick hit pause and held the image in the center of the screen my god nick said while they were doing all that work on umbertos face they must have taught him arabic so he would be ready for the preop interviews its just like when i heard manny speak in arabic billy pearl said that manny had been brainwashed i bet the same thing was done to umberto jillian said did your sister speak arabic mollender asked no but as nick said the arabic umberto spoke was mixed in with spanish okay so did your sister speak spanish she was almost fluent jillian replied we both were chapter nick was dazed when he shut off the tv witnessing umbertos gruesome death held him spellbound capable only of staring at his own reflection in the black television screen he ached at the irony that umbertos final words had been a chilling cry for helpa cry to him b√∫squenme al doctor nick fury get me dr nick fury with the mans agonized screams echoing in his head nick tried to make sense of the almost inconceivable events that had occurred in the operating room three years ago first though he had to begin to deal with the fact that his search was finally over don reese had been right the reason umbertos and mannys captors had not bothered issuing them new social security numbers was that both men were slated to die manny ferriss escape had spoiled their plan the secret mission that was to be umbertos passage out of his ptsd hell had been anything but that it had been the doorway to another more ferocious nightmare and ultimately the invitation to his grave umberto nick murmured feeling intense anger searing the back of his neck he stared at the screen as if the ghost of his friend was trapped inside it marked for eternity by a video epitaph jillian placed her hand gently upon his shoulder nick im so sorry what was it he said jill i mean exactly just what you would imaginefor the spanish part anyway help help me get me dr fury get me dr nick fury even though the words were jumbled in with umbertos screams and with the arabic belle heard and understood them although not the meaning behind them later on someone must have told her about the comic book character and she set out to understand more belle was all about understandinggetting to the bottom of things jillians voice sounded distantbarely audible nick could not respond he was already weighed down with guilt over sarahs death now this was there anything he could have done it didnt matter the line between grief and guilt was often a very fine one as long as the two didnt paralyze his life he thought now there was no reason he couldnt live with them eventually the fog enveloping his thoughts began to lift now we know he managed to say now we know jillian echoed softly she wrapped her arms around him at first nick thought he was trembling but soon he realized that it was she jillian pulled away her hands still on nicks shoulders i am so sad and so damn angry he said i know what finding umberto alive meant to you but you didnt let him down something terrible is going on herea secret that somebody desperately needed to keep hiddena secret belle paid for with her life belle the mention of the name jolted away what remained of nicks selfpity he had to stay strong and be there for jillian and for himself of all the perils on the road to truth one of his favorite buddhist teachings read the truth itself could actually prove the greatest peril of all who would have done this nick asked aloud its hard to believe his death was unexpected there was no damn cardiac tumor what we witnessed was an executiona lethal charade that amounted to the ticket to freedom for aleem mohammad ill bet that bastard was thousands of miles away when umberto died a very public execution mollender said the ultimate witness protection hoax thats horrible noreen said belle must have been unable to let matters lie jillian said maybe shes the only one who heard and understood what umberto was screaming maybe she said the wrong thing to the wrong person what we just saw ties umberto to the singh center nick said poor manny ferris too maybe manny was the one who was supposed to be on that operating table but something about his plastic surgery didnt work out they couldnt make him look enough like mohammad to pull off the switch possible nick said if he were partway through a sequence of surgeries that would explain mannys appearance listen i know its painful to watch but we might have missed something important in the initial viewing i need to watch the operation again and maybe again you guys dont have to im in jillian said im feeling stronger than i have since belle died noreen mollender asked i dont know what help i could be and im really shaken up she replied but if the solidarity will help ill try noreen and mollender stood beside nick and jillian forming an arc in front of the television then they took their seats and nick pressed play out of the corner of his eye nick observed mollender take hold of noreens hand as the first images of the operating room appeared they watched the video twice through until jillian broke down crying and nick felt his own eyes begin to well finally jillian excused herself from the roomto clear her thoughts she explained noreen decided to go with her of the four of them mollender seemed to be the most composed although it was clear that he too was affected you okay to see it once more nick asked its easier to take if i keep telling myself its only a movie this time at the moment just before umbertos death nick paused the disc using the remote control he advanced the video a single frame at a time then back and forward once more umberto grabs his head here nick said tapping his finger against the television screen its as though something erupted in his brain i havent actually witnessed an aneurysm bursting in someones head but a rupture like that is accompanied by a sudden massive increase in volume within the skull the victims experience a blinding headache which he showed signs of having but he wasnt vomiting from the huge increase in intracranial pressure a seizure is typical too but he didnt have one of those either the whole thing with umberto took no more than a couple of minutes from beginning to end i dont know what else it could have been besides a ruptured aneurysm but something seems off to me are you suggesting that someone might have done this to him mollender asked just as jillian and noreen returned i dont know all i keep thinking is that the surgeon could never have been allowed to open umbertos heart to operate because he didnt have anything wrong with it no tumor nothing if their plan was to have it look like aleem mohammad died on the table it had to happen before his actual operation that means someone had control of the situation the whole time nick turned to jillian i think umberto was killed right there it looks like an aneurysm but i dont believe it was someone did something to himto his brain otherwise they would have operated on his heart and found no tumor but what about the tests tests can be faked the surgeon could have been brought in to do the case on the basis of someone elses mri the people who did this are no amateurs and i would bet they have technology available to them that the average man or even doctor knows nothing about so who do you think is responsible nicks anger was pulsing through him now driving his thoughts pieces of the mystery surrounding umberto were falling into place almost too rapidly for him to integrate them you mean what person is responsible he said or what government agency with three letters beginning with a c that just happened at least according to the papers to be pumping information from one aleem syed mohammad noreen nick asked more energized perhaps than at any time since sarahs death do you have a large piece of paper and something to write with she left the room returning moments later with a flip chart and several markers freezing the list of those in the or nick transcribed it to the flip chart in a twocolumn format dr abigail spielmannsurgeon dr yasmin dasariolansurgical resident dr lewis leonardasst surgeon cassandra browningleavittcirculating nurse dr thomas landrewanesthesiologist yu jiangmedical student roger pendletonperfusionist belle coatesnursing student kimberly foxscrub nurse what are you doing jillian asked these are the people who were in the or that day i noticed something on that last viewing but i need to confirm it first jillian i have to play some of the video again its okay i can handle it he located a shot that contained a full view of the room there are ten people in the or not counting the patient nick said there are nine names on this chart i noticed the tenth man when he helped wheel umberto in there were two of them actually one left and he stayed i remember the mole said the one who left was quite a bit taller exactly i thought maybe the two of them or at least this guy were from security that made sense at the time but take your eyes off of umberto and keep them fixed on the tenth man once again nick had the strange feeling of having seen the heavyset man before he appeared quite a bit in the view from the camera above the foot of the narrow table not once during the terrible commotion surrounding umbertos death did he move from his spotnot so much as an inch to get a better vantage point or to help this time through nick also noticed that unlike belle the medical student the perfusionist or the anesthesiologist the tenth man was wearing a surgical gown in addition he kept his hands inside the gown throughout the grisly ordeal nicks pulse was hammering he ran the dvd again and then once more his eyes remained fixed on the man at the instant the team finished transferring umberto from the gurney to the operating table nick paused the playback backed up a few frames and then walked it forward again his focus intensifying with each advance there nick exclaimed did you see it his hands stay underneath his surgical gown while umberto is going through whatever it was that killed him and look at his eyes he is like dead calm you think he has some sort of device under there mollender asked something that could fry umbertos brain or burst an artery maybe they had implanted some sort of radio receiver in there poor umberto had multiple procedures done at the singh center one of them certainly could have been that for a time there was only silence as each of the other threemollender noreen and jillianmulled over the awesome possibilities finally jillian spoke so why did they kill belle she asked in a near whisper again there was silence then the color drained from nicks face oh god he breathed what belle wasnt the only one who heard umberto she may not have been the only one who could understand that he was speaking spanish in addition to his arabic what are you suggesting were assuming that belle was murdered because she said something to the wrong person what if she wasnt the only one who spoke up what if its not just belle they killed noreen took a few steps backward im not sure i can handle this anymore she said do we need to call the police i dont know yet nick said but i do know we need your help noreen if belle is the only one who has died then im way off base but we need to check on the rest of the people on that flip chart noreen was beginning to hyperventilate look around she exclaimed there are reasons i work with computers and not people mollender took noreen by the hand and walked over to her desk where she had two computers already set up and running well do this together he said noreen ill work off your laptop you take the desktop well start searching each of the names on the web and see what comes up im scared saul we need to do this lives may be at stake nick listen in addition to the other nine who were in the or maybe you should put down annette furst the video editor who works for me shes very much alive i saw her yesterday that might be a good sign maybe im completely off base here or maybe they just havent thought to include her they make mistakes all the time coverup is their middle name all right okay start with the surgeons nick directed them saul take spielmann and noreen look up what you can on leonard noreen sat in her chair while mollender had to hunch over the desk to access the laptop they both opened web browsers and in near synchronized movements began scouring the internet mollender struck first jesus he exclaimed spielmanns dead she died just a couple of weeks ago in her apartment in new york apparently from an anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting i think i just found something on leonard noreen added a few minutes later this is just too freaky i think i might get sick leonard was riding his motorcycle when he was killed in a collision with a tractortrailer according to this report in the chicago tribune the driver of the truck said it looked to him as though leonard lost control of the bike and went into a skid across a lane and right into his path it could have been an accident jillian said or somebody could have sabotaged his motorcycle nick countered keep going another tense minute passed the only sound in noreens office was of fingers tapping on keyboards nick added the location of each persons death next to their names chicago new york north carolina there was no longer any doubt in the room mollender was next to speak up dr thomas landrew drowned he said grimly avid sportsman and prominent anesthesiologist drowned while kayaking on the chesapeake when nick asked just three weeks ago april eighteenth this is terrible i actually knew about his accident landrew did the anesthesia on me when i had a hernia fixed a few years ago he was a terrific guy i just glossed right over his name nick wrote maryland next to landrews name mollender continued kimberly fox is dead too assuming shes the same kimberly fox on the board here she was killed near her familys home in utah skiing accident it says here broke her neck no details no mention that she worked at shelby stone but it does say she was a nurse she could have moved jillian said nurses especially younger ones are constantly changing hospitals like belle mass murder one by one nick muttered oh no ive got another hit noreen said shortly her voice quaked with a raw mix of fear and anxiety cassandra browningleavitt killed here in dc shot from the woods while she was jogging along rock creek no witnesses believed to be a random event no suspects i remember cassandra now jillian said she was still working at shelby stone when she was killed they sent a notice around after it happened warning people to be careful that was a while ago maybe back in february for a minute two nobody could speak nick felt a band tightening around his chest washington chicago new york north carolina utah maryland somebody is killing these people and doing it in such a way that it doesnt appear to be murder nick said or at least not deliberate murder and certainly not serial murder i knew it jillian said viciously i told them i told them all shed never kill herself with these deaths so spread out across the country mollender said who would think to link them we would thats who nick answered then he drew a line through the names of those they had confirmed dead including belle that leaves us four people we havent accounted for yet roger pendleton the perfusionist yasmin dasari the surgical resident yu jiang who was a medical student at the time and sauls video editor annette furst noreen nodded she kept her gaze fixed to her computer screen her fingers sweeping across her keyboard while her computer mouse remained in a state of constant motion expecting to find death notices posted online for at least three mollender continued his search for other victims as well im not getting anything on dasari or jiang but i logged in to our intranet at shelby stone mollender said pendleton is listed as still being an employee i have an address for him phone number too according to this he lives in alexandria virginia lets hope thats true nick said what that hes in alexandria no that he lives chapter there are three possible reasons pendletons not answering his phone nick told jillian either hes not at home hes busy or hes already dead jillian grimaced at the notion why are they doing this after so many years nick its pure evil could a branch of our government really be responsible i wish i knew i really do maybe people from mohammads terrorist organization are finally exacting revenge for his death even though we know he wasnt the one who died that day maybe they dont its a thought but terrorists usually go out of their way to take credit for acts of vengeance like this and we havent heard a word six people dead at least nick gripped the steering wheel with whiteknuckle force frustrated that so many answers still eluded them before they left her office noreen had handed nick two leather cases each containing a copy of the operation that she had burned to dvd now jillian held them in her lap a reminder she said that umberto and belle were with them on this journey until the end the traffic was moderately heavy and nick estimated they were still ten minutes away from roger pendletons address in alexandria the mole had volunteered to stay behind with a stillshaken noreen and to continue searching for information about the surgical resident and the medical student neither of whom had proven that easy to find during the drive jillian wrote a note for pendleton begging him to call either of them as soon as possible twice she had tried to reach him at home and through the page operator at the hospital nick had also phoned don reese but his call to the detective went straight into voice mail maybe we should call nineoneone jillian suggested let the authorities take it from here remember what reese told us were in deep here too jill if the police are going to get involved now better if its reeses call how and when in the meantime we need to warn pendleton to be careful i just hope that were not too late me too nick said with a heavy sigh me too pendletons modest splitlevel ranch was the last house on a treelined deadend street the idyllic familyfriendly setting made the reason they were there even more disturbing nick pulled up along the grassy tree belt and had opened the drivers side door when jillian grabbed his arm and pulled him back inside we cant just go rushing in there nick she said we have no idea what were up against i dont want to see any more death and i dont want anything to happen to you nick took hold of her hands nothings going to happen to either of us trust me on that jill well knock on the door well leave the note and then well look for pendleton at the hospital im sorry to sound like such a baby that video really got to methe thought of that man in the surgical gown calmly standing there murdering umberto its as if he had no soul well thanks to you im reconnecting with mine nick said i have an emdr session later on i intend to work at it the way i used to when i was studying organic chemistry or training for a climb jillian squeezed his hands then caressed the stubble on his face are you ready ready side by side they proceeded up the flagstone walkway to pendletons redpainted front door with jillian clutching a copy of the dvd all was eerily quiet save for the crunch of loose slate and the white noise of birdsong on the warm afternoon breeze the yard was small but well maintained with no toys to suggest pendleton had kids nick peered into the living room through a small opening between the drapes but could see only a few feet inside there was no movement he rang the bell then tried the door locked maybe hes at work jillian said i dont trust shelby stones page system nick pressed the doorbell a second time and they listened to a cascade of chimes reverberating inside the house lets try around back he said growing more anxious suddenly the door swung open the man standing there was dressed in hospital scrubs and had a cell phone pressed between his ear and shoulder he was hopping around in a circle trying to wiggle on a sneaker just untie it nick wanted to shout as pendleton wrestled the sneaker onto his foot he lost hold of his phone which dropped to the hardwood floor with a sharp crack if youre recruiting me for your church im going to be really pissed he snapped bending down to retrieve the phone jerry jerry you still there shit thats just great were sorry to bother you the man hesitated taking in a deep breath dont worry its not your fault im a klutz im running late and the guy on the phone was telling me where i needed to have been twenty minutes ago sorry if i raised my voice at you guys phone still seems to be working though so ill call him back just hang on or else leave if youre going to try and cost me money his composure regained pendleton placed his call and learned what he needed to about the emergency case waiting for him at shelby stone the perfusionist was a trim balding man in his early thirties and struck nick as an athlete roger pendleton jillian asked yeah thats me look im really in a hurry guys theres a transplant going down so if youre selling something especially god just assume ive got one already okay nick stepped forward roger im dr nick garrity a surgeon working with the helping hands medical van this is my friend jillian coates shes a psych nurse at shelby stone pendleton seemed to soften at that okay whats up not often a tech like me gets paid a house call not ever actually i know youre in a hurry but we need to talk it could be a matter of life or death yeah alas so is the operation if i dont make it in to the hospital im on backup and the guy on duty is tied up and word is a hearts come in when we say matter of life or death we mean yours nick said we really need to talk can you get anyone else to go in for you pendleton studied nicks face and his expression darkened no i cant get anyone to go in he said how many backups do you think we have okay okay im sorry to sound snippy i cant imagine what youre talking about but i can give you two minutes standing just inside the open doorway nick relayed what they knew of the identity switch in the or three years ago and the fact that over recent months six of the ten people who were there for the disaster had died suddenly then he handed over a copy of the dvd recording the events when nick finished pendleton stared down at the disc a deep furrow across his brow so youre saying that im on somebodys kill list theres nothing else to believe roger jillian said well i stopped in and met mohammad the evening before the case i try and do that with all my patients his photo had been all over the papers i promise you that was him in his room that night and him on the table the next day and him who went berserk and flew into my equipment and him who died six out of nine medical personnel are dead including my sister belle jillian said patiently we believe the man responsible for the or death if not all of them was number tenone of the two who wheeled the patient in we are absolutely certain that the victim in the operating room that day wasnt the man you thought he was pendleton checked his watch look i dont know whether you two know what youre talking about or not but i do know ive got to finish getting dressed and get to the hospital you sure you dont have just a few minutes to watch that video nick asked it will convince you i dont need to watch anything to remember that day that sort of thing you dont forget all i can tell you and i probably shouldnt even be doing that is that after it was over i was called into my bosss office there were a couple suits waiting there to speak with me they told me what had just happened was a matter of national security and that i was to tell nobody about anything i had seen they made me sign a paper stating just that and warned that if i spoke about the case i could lose my job or even face prison time they gave me a name to refer any reporters to but i have no idea where that is otherwise id refer you to them look just give me your card and ill get you the name but i gotta leave jillian shot nick a concerned look that would explain why belle never told me much about the operation look i appreciate the warning pendleton said but i have to get to the hospital right away im not sure i can even talk with you about this case without risking my job and god only knows what else why dont you tell me quickly what you think im supposed to do now and ill think it over just please give us your cell number and pick up if you see its me or jillian calling also stay very aware of your surroundings and remain extra vigilant were trying to contact a detective we know in dc i appreciate the visit ill pick up if you call we tried to reach you a bunch of times on the way over here but you didnt answer you had us a little worried long night last night i was sleeping with the ringer off thats why the hospital called me on my cell nick and pendleton quickly exchanged numbers call me if anything comes up nick said otherwise ill call you as soon as we have more information to share sure pendleton replied his tone still tinged with disbelief do that one last thing yes why has it taken three years for all this horrible stuff to start happening jillian and nick exchanged looks and shrugged we dont know was all they could say roger pendleton hated rushing into a caseespecially a transplant experience had taught him that mistakes happened when protocols were shortcut or skipped altogether for the sake of expedience often there wasnt enough time to review the patients medical record properly certainly today time was a luxury that a twentyyearold kid his heart failing rapidly could not aff ord instead of contemplating the shocking revelations about the aleem syed mohammad operation from three years ago pendleton was thinking about his cardiopulmonary bypass setup this operation would mark only the sixth time he had used the new machine that featured a centrifugal pump an advance over the roller pump he had used for so long not many knew the stress involved with being a perfusionist keeping blood out of the surgical field was one part of the job in addition he was the patients lifeline controlling oxygenation and balancing any number of fluids for all his worldbedamned carefree attitude pendleton was almost maniacal about maintaining his equipment he trotted up the carpeted staircase to his bedroom to grab the gym bag he would need for his ritual postop workout he wondered if his surprise visitors could be anything but kooks doubtful he decided when they could explain the threeyear gap from the operation to the killings assuming they were killings he might take them more seriously he was on his way back down the stairs when they rang the bell again pendleton really didnt have any more patience for them even if they had thought of something more persuasive listen well have to talk later he was saying as he swung open the front door right now i really have to a tall uniformed man from his gas company smiled politely said his name and held out his id oh jeez pendleton said holding his hand over his hammering heart and laughing at himself you startled me i thought you were the people who just left here sorry about that the man said his eyes shadowed by the bill of his cap i actually think i saw them go i startle lots of folks when i have to make a house call well i was a little jumpy the people who just left were telling me i had to be careful the man chuckled actually thats why im here he said its about your gas leak pendleton sniff ed the air i think you have the wrong place i dont have a gas leak no not yet you dont that was when roger pendleton looked down and saw that the man was holding a gun chapter jillian suggested they use the time before nicks emdr therapy session to grab a drink and something to eat and plan their next steps they settled on kilkennys irish pub in the adams morgan section of dc arriving there just after noon the cozy tavern paneled in dark barn siding was crowded with businesspeople enjoying a guinness with their lunch along with those nick pegged as regulars some of whom sat at the bar watching an international soccer match on tv while others were engaged in an animated game of darts the jukebox was off and traditional irish music piped through an impressive sound system provided a pleasant background relaxed simple life they sat down beside each other at the end of the bar where two of the dozen worn and scratched wooden stools were empty passing on the lunch menu offered by the bartender nick ordered a glenlivet neat and jillian an amstel light in the bottle their lives at that moment were as far removed from those of the folks in the homey pub as the earth was from mars nick took a sip of the single malt scotch whisky from a reasonably clean tumbler letting it linger in his mouth until the taste demanded that he swallow then he stared numbly ahead at the liquor bottles housed inside cubbies built into the wall behind the bar jillian touched his hand and he turned slowly to meet her gaze a bar snack for your thoughts she said smiling as she nudged over a black plastic dish filled with pretzels nick took one but offered only a thin smile in return what do you think these people would say if they knew the depravity of what were confronting he asked finally if they believed us and thats a big if theyd probably say something like as long as it doesnt affect me directly and i can go on tossing my darts and drinking my stout do whatever it is you need to do weve come so far from when we first met jill and yet i feel so incredibly helpless you know pendleton thought we were crazy i know he seems like a good guy though yup maybe well hear from reese before something happens to him do you want to try the mole again maybe hes come up with something on the resident or medical student nah he said he was going to stick around with noreen at her place and keep looking hell call if he comes up with anything i know what you mean about feeling helpless what did junie say when you told her she was stunned naturally i dont think its hit her yet that umberto is dead and that somebody killed him in such a horrid selfserving way has it hit you the question pulled nicks head down until his eyes met the gritty floor he looked up long enough to take a hard swallow of his drink which he downed in a single gulp then he closed his eyes tightly clenching his fists against the burn of the alcohol spilling down his throat and against the evil none of this is your fault jillian said softly believe it or not ive come to grips with that what im angry at now is my own rage i was put together to care for people regardless of who they were or what they might have done in their lives now i want to kill someone maybe anyone i really do which would you take at this moment your rage or the total lack of feeling youve had for so long its all changing for you nick maybe maybe youre right im going to tell you something that scares the bejesus out of me yeah whats that i think you may be the most amazing man ive ever met somebody im really capable of falling for someone i think i would have fallen for in a heartbeat before before what happened to you in afghanistan but i want the next time i fall in love with a man to be the last i dont need you to have arrived at the personat the doctoryoure capable of being i just need to know youre committed to making the journey you cant go on hiding your emptiness behind your charm a doctor loses a patient do they quit being a doctor im going with no damn straight even if they believe it was their fault sick patients force doctorsand nursesinto having to make decisions if we had more time less pressure on us to act the choices we made might have been different continuing to help others with our talent and skill is actually honoring the memory of the patient who died i dont blame myself for belles death i blame the person who killed her same way as losing sarah and umberto isnt on you nick its on the people who killed them we cant bring them back but we can still do more for them nick looked up at the dark rafters heres the thing with ptsd he said some people think its in your head and that you can just snap your fingers or crank up your willpower and come out of it or like maccandliss keeps insisting that its all manufactured for some secondary gain but thats not the case at all its a chemical change where the thinking takes place like an internal depression or a cancer eating away at you much as you want to just shake the symptoms off sometimes they wont let go so you end up walking around in circles holding yourself hostage to the places and people where you feel most comfortable and safe because the alternative means facing an unknown i used to love the unknown i was a pure adrenaline junkie rock climbing skiing you name it but after watching sarah get hacked apart by that truck moments before umberto saved my life under that refrigerator lying there covered with broken bags of blood that rush lost its appeal i retreated into what was safest for me i know youre hurting nick nick held up a hand cutting her short the scotch was settling in doing what he wanted it to no let me finish he said since losing sarah i know ive been a walking shell but then you came along and now each day your strength is becoming my strength you just have to be patient with me jill and believe that i really do want to become the manthe doci once was this struggle is a war not a battle but i feel the tide turning and more important i feel i want to work at it and ill help you as best as i can i swear i will nick swung his legs around to face her it makes all the difference he said no longer able to keep his lips from hers as they were kissing the bar erupted in a huge cheer they quickly pulled away from one another thinking for an embarrassed moment that the applause and shouts were for them back to your smoochin the totally amused bartender said pointing up at the tv chelsea just scored the tying goal against manchester united maybe ill skip therapy nick whispered in her ear maybe you wont we have time baby step by step we have time lets plan on meeting up with saul either at the hospital or at noreens place after my session if i havent heard from reese by then we might have to find somebody else im sure junie knows who we can contact shes connected with everyone but you said yourself we dont know who we can trust or how deep this whole thing goes thatll be a chance we have to take just then jillians cell phone rang nick perked up thinking it might be reese but she let him know she did not recognize the caller id her expression brightened though as soon as she answered over the din of the pub nick picked up only fragments of her brief conversation hi there im so glad to hear from you you do oh my god thats fascinating as i told you ive been suspicious of the timing from the getgo no its not a problem this is a good time sure i can where yeah i know the place ill meet you in an hour okay see you there she set the phone down and turned to nick talk about things coming together what was that all about that was my condos insurance company now theyre thinking the fire was arson apparently they actually have information about who might have set it he wants to meet with me in an hour and go over their findings is this the same fire inspector you told me about exactly jillian said his names regis paul regis chapter nicks ninetyminute eye movement therapy session was especially intense but he was ready for it dr coletta deems his therapist a tall formal scarecrow of a woman was impressed and said so you seem exceptionally focused today dr garrity well uncovering a conspiracy of serial murder has that effect on me he thought about saying especially when combined with finding out that the woman of anyones dreams might be in love with me im visualizing better he said instead maybe todays like the fiftyfoot putt that keeps you coming back to the golf course pardon not worth repeating i have a lot on my mind today which makes my ability to control my thinking that much more surprising and satisfying so where would you put your sud score at this moment nick looked up at the subjective units of distress chart on the wall of the tranquil therapy room ten was defined as unbearably bad zero was absolute peace and serenity four he decided and said so four somewhat upset to the point that you cannot easily ignore an unpleasant thought you can handle it okay but dont feel good yes i believe im under five deems was as delighted as she seemed capable of being progress is what were after dr garrity she said adjusting her wirerims no more or less than progress progress nick echoed excited to share the news of his sud triumph with jillian oh by the way doctor you asked not to have our session interrupted for any call other than one from don reese yes well he didnt call but ashe checked a small slip of paper mr mollender called about twenty minutes ago he asked you to call him in the office i have the number here as soon as he could nick called noreen siliskis office the mole answered on the first ring saul sorry i wasnt able to take your call you got anything i do but i think we need to meet in person to discuss it im still at noreens office i know thats the number i dialed did you find them the med student and the resident mollender said vaguely yes yes i think so but id rather show you can you make it down here mollender sounded tense and exhausted hardly like a man with any good news to share nick looked across at the sud chart and decided he had drifted up to a five unpleasant feelings still manageable with some effort its getting on rush hour he said but ill be down as soon as i can and nick do you still have the dvds of andys death andy you mean umberto i have one and i left the other one with roger pendleton the perfusionist im pretty sure i already told you that ill see you soon mollender said the line went dead on the stopandgo drive to sutton nick tried unsuccessfully to reach jillian and junie he did manage to catch reggie at home who told him that both his foster mother and the rv were gone although he hadnt seen her leave strange nick thought junie almost certainly was in the rv headed for dc to pick up the professor as they referred to this particular covering doc there should be no reason why she wouldnt answer her phone maybe she had already arrived at the professors and stopped in for coffee maybe jillian he figured was bogged down in dealing with what had now become an arson investigation but she had a caller id why hadnt she answered his call his sud score had spent a nanosecond in the fours and may now he realized be approaching six feeling poorly or anxious to the point that you begin to think something ought to be done about the way you feel nick pulled into the same space where he had parked earlier that day to the left of the dumpster and alongside a red corolla the only other vehicle in an otherwise deserted lot he peered up along the ingenious twostory telescoping trashbarrel chute snaking down from noreens window to the center of the halffilled dumpster there was no light coming from the window surrounding the upper end of the tube and he assumed the canvas shade had been dropped down his uneasiness increased what had earlier been a bright afternoon had during his drive south progressively given way to dense clouds now a light rain had begun to fall plucking rhythmically against the leaves of the dense woods that bordered the parking lot as mollender requested nick had dropped the dvd into his wellworn leather bag alongside the research on aleem syed mohammad that reggie had compiled now glancing about he took the disc out of his bag and slid it onto a metal support beneath the dumpster he felt increasingly unsettled about the moles nervousness and use of his dead brothers name rather than umbertos perhaps he was being paranoid but with all they had uncovered he felt he had good reason to be he heightened his own tension by trying junie jillian reese and mollender once more nothing moving through a burgeoning sense of unease nick entered the building and took the stairs up two floors he tried the door assuming it would be open locked he knocked several times no answer saul noreen his voice reverberated off of the stairwell walls you there he tried the knob again and was only slightly surprised when it turned he pushed the door open and stepped inside noreens partially renovated office the first thing he saw was blood there were pools of it on the floor soaking several of the white sheets red and mixing with sawdust to form nauseating clumps the scent of freshly cut wood so pleasant earlier that day was overtaken by the hideous bitterly metallic stench of blood and death nicks mouth went dry and he felt his stomach lurch then he saw noreen she lay spreadeagled on the floor several feet to the right of her workbench in roughly the center of the room her throat had been widely sliced open drenching her white work shirt with blood now in the process of drying she appeared to be staring right at him instinct made him check her carotid pulse though he knew her gray eyes and milky nearly colorless skin meant she was looking only into oblivion nick turned his head to the right to look away that was when he saw mollender the mole was directly opposite noreen on the other side of the room nearer the windows he too was spreadeagled but facedown on the polished oak floor two feet away was a heavy eightinch kitchen knife covered with gore the right side of mollenders head had been blown apartan exit wound from his years of dealing with gunshot wounds nick knew there would be a bullet hole on the opposite temple blood continued seeping from the gaping hole and fragments of bone and brain tissue dotted the floor like tiny islands of death nick took a few cautious steps forward his eyes now transfixed on the dull steel of a pistol resting next to mollenders outstretched lifeless hand a guttural primal scream exploded from nicks throat as he crouched by the body the odd little record room librarian had killed his onetime lover and then shot himself that conclusion seemed obvious but why the two of them had held hands they appeared to be doing wonderfully he did not know mollender well but on the surface at least the man hardly seemed capable of such violence it was then that nick heard the click of the door closing behind him startled he whirled around rising to his feet his leather bag still slung over his shoulder swung in an arc across the front of his body as he confronted a tall wellbuilt man dressed head to toe in black he was wearing latex surgical gloves the heavy pistol held loosely in his right hand was pointed at the center of nicks chest nicks gaze traveled upward until he met with the coldest pale blue eyes he had ever seen pure evil what have you done nick shrieked why pipe down doctor the killer said calmly what ive done is the nonkill that i do better than any other murdersuicide im a master at it if i do say so myself what do you think he gestured to the grotesque pair of corpses this was the man nick knew immediately this was the man who had sat by and watched belle coates die he wasnt the stocky killer in the or but he was probably responsible for some of the other deaths if not all of them nick could barely keep from charging him in fact fueled by rage he actually took a half step forward easy doc this thing could get ugly for you quick you brought the dvd the man spoke with utter confidence and his soulless eyes actually flickered with a hint of joy suddenly nick was certain that he had jillian where is she he demanded she jillian coates where is she if anything happens to her i swear ill kill you relax doctor isnt that what you tell your patients before you take your index finger and ream them just relax from what i can see youre not really in a position to demand or threaten anything besides as chance would have it i stopped by roger pendletons place right after you left and retrieved one of the discs it had this lovely womans business sticker on it thats what led me here with a little prompting she told me you probably had the second of the two discs she gave you i had our friend mollender over there summon you here so give me the dvd what dvd dont fuck with me nick recoiled from the ferocity of the killers outburst as quickly as that explosion came the emotion drained from the mans face until he was once again a steely evil in an unhurried voice he said you know what im talking about doc that cute little nurse died rather than expose her sister to the pain i had in store for jillian dont make the mistake of thinking i wont do it to her now nicks heart beat wildly he could feel his blood pressure rising releasing beads of sweat across his brow and down the back of his neck instead of reacting irrationally though he closed his eyes willed his pulse to slow and began taking charge of his emotions his only option for himself and for jillian was to buy some time to that end he had two possible tools the dvd and the monsters gigantic ego it might be too late for him too late for jillian but he had to do what he could to take charge of the ptsd that had controlled his life for so long he had to act intelligently rationally and with force why are you doing this he began searching for an openingany opening who are you hey slow down i have the big gun so i get to ask the questions now wheres the disc in your sack there in the glove compartment of your car dont make me tie you up and torture you my friend because if i have to do that after youre bloody and dead im going to settle up with that girl of yours and i mean settle up in every sense of the words now the disc just tell me tell me how you managed to kill all those people from the or without having anyone know it looked as if the killer was about to answer him but before he could nick heard the haunting first notes of acdcs back in black the man pulled a cell phone off of his belt clip never for a second lowering his gun or averting his soulless eyes for several seconds he held the phone to his ear and listened no he hasnt given me the dvd he said i think i can convince him but it may require more pain than hes equipped to endure he listened again then took a step toward nick the pistol an accusatory finger now pointing steadily at nicks heart then he grinned its for you he said chapter who is this nick shouted into the killers phone mr koller there intends to torture you until you give us the disc or you die a mans gravelly voice said i dont want you to die i have great respect for you as a man and a patriot who has served his country with honor the voice sounded familiar nick thought but from where it was unhurried and composed with an edge of power and entitlement who are you nick said why are you having these people killed dr garrity i believe if you were in my position you would do the same thing again nick tried to connect with where he had heard that voice before thats insane he said youre insane it was you in the operating room wasnt it youre the one who killed umberto youd be better off letting me drive this conversation said the man so i suggest you listen and try to understand what this is all about nicks eyes met kollers the gun in his right hand was rock steady and pointed straight at his head the selfconfident smirk etched across the killers face had nick envisioning kicking him full force in the teeth easy he told himself its going to happen somehow its going to happen just be cool at least tell me who you are he said his composure now largely regained all you need to know is that you have become involved in business that is of the utmost importance to our countrys national security the danger we are facing is very real we need you to act like the soldier that you are ramsland nick caught his breath he felt his chest tighten the room seemed to be spinning the mans ads had been all over the media alone and with moderate presidential candidate john greenleigh ramsland the patriot it was all starting to make sense the ads portrayed the man as the consummate american whose promise to protect every citizen against the threat of terrorism was resonating loudly with voters of both parties what in the hell had the man gotten himself into the solider that i am the doctor that i am would never take an innocent life why dont you come over here and see what youve done look at the people youve murdered mr ramsland for a time there was silence the people who have died are heroes no theyre victims im going to bury you ramsland just like you buried them easy an understandable reaction given the circumstances but doctor before you go making any more threats its best we have a little talk i mean it ramsland ill find you and when i do youll wish our paths had never crossed easy does it nick warned himself again you need to understand more of where hes coming from i didnt want this to happen to these people nick there was no choice do you think im against peace in this warweary world nick hated that the man was now using his first name so casually i think youre a murderer nick said simple as that no sir that is not any more true than saying that the men in your unit in afghanistan were murderers you see what i am nick is a patriot just as they are and you are the people from that operating room and lying there now in front of you are casualties of war just as were all those blown up in your hospital in fob savannah nicks sense of the man and his motivations was coming more into focus whether it was guilt or zeal lionel ramsland needed to have his actions justified he was looking for understanding and even praise for the choices he had made and the lives he had taken and nick a decorated soldier and a surgeon as well as a friend of several of the casualties was the perfect subject from which to earn such absolution if nick had agreed and cooperated by turning over the dvd he might have been offered a position in ramslands inner circle but as things were he was going to die were nothing alike nick said he turned his back to koller who continued blocking the only exit keeping the phone pressed tightly against his ear he stepped farther into the room trying unsuccessfully to avoid looking at noreens lifeless body to his left and saul mollenders to his right his insides quaked with rage as he wondered what their last horrible moments were like patriots indeed youre wrong there nick ramsland was saying you and i are far more similar than you think nick was eight feet away from noreens workbench now many of her impressive array of tools were resting on top in a tool bucket and in the heavy work belt that surrounded it wary of drawing kollers attention to the setup he quickly broke off his gaze maybe he was thinking as a plan began to materialize just maybe i have a chance but he also knew it would be one chance and only one he needed to stall and to continue composing himself for a single definitive move yeah he said you and your friend here kill people and i save them how is that alike pacing in front of the workbench nick wanted his movements to appear random it was doubtful koller missed much so he had to move carefully powerful jolts of adrenaline were coursing through him bringing the sort of heightened awareness he often experienced during an intense triage or operation you and i are both soldiers nick a guy like you could have made a bundle in private practice but no you sacrificed that earning potential for something much more important your country i did what i felt was right my point exactly your devotion to finding your war buddy umberto is in a soldiers dna never leave a man behind am i right i guess thats loyalty go on all im saying nick is that you have a very rare opportunity to serve your country in a way few americans can you can make a difference how murder no nick by saving lives check again i dont see any lives being saved here of course you dont thats just my point you think you know everything about whats going on but you havent the slightest clue whats really happening yeah why dont you enlighten me nick glanced over at koller the killer stood just a few feet away like a big cat lean and sinewy poised to launch himself at the slightest hint of trouble it isnt time yet nick decided but soon keep stalling this wasnt how we wanted things to play out ramsland was saying mohammad wanted out he was weary he had a price on his head and one of his sons was killed while someone was trying to collect it we wanted mohammad to give us informationinformation that would save american lives and he did the sears tower in chicago the american embassy in paris grand central station at rush hour thousands and thousands of lives attacks against innocent civilians women and children who might have been blown to bits i never heard a word about any of those attacks nick said you didnt hear about them in the news because they never happened the information we extracted from mohammad kept them from happening you didnt extract information from him ramsland he gave it to you we didnt capture him like the news said he gave himself up he gave the information to you in exchange for my friends life you cut a deal with him public highprofile deaththe ultimate disappearing act you know as well as i do that the united states does not negotiate with terrorists we capture them and learn what we can through due process of law abiding by whatever protection the geneva convention grants these monsters thats bullshit and you know it ramsland you dont play by anybodys rules but your own it was a tradepure and simple if you want me on your side then at least tell the truth thats the best starting point again nick made a cautious glance over at koller the killer appeared as though he were enjoying the banter despite his hearing only half of the conversation the pistol was no longer pointing at the center of his chest good lower your guard just a fraction thats what i need rules are what keep men like me from making a real diff erence in the world were all walking contradictions nick in afghanistan you patched up soldiers just so we could put them back in theater again we dont torture prisoners all we do is use every means to make them give us information they dont want to share if promising them something they want will get that information out quicker and more completely thats a road worth considering dont you think i suppose so do you think we enjoy trading soldiers like your friend umberto of course not but men like us know our duty as patriots is to act we do so to save lives just as truman traded one set of lives for another when he sent out the enola gay thats the nature of war nick and you know that as well as i do im beginning to understand i hoped you would youve suffered a great deal for the cause nick continued to shake on the inside his stomach was churning still with koller watching his every step gun at the ready he managed to keep a calm demeanor nick marched back and forth in front of the workbench willing himself to look on occasion at mollenders and noreens bodies now using that emotion to help fuel his resolve soon he thought what is it you want from me i want you to cooperate give the dvd to my associate forget about umberto forget about your friends here focus on yourself for a change nick how involved is ms coates nick felt a new flash of anger rip through him you leave her out of this maybe we will maybe it all depends on you you see i can trust you if you say youll do something know why no tell me because i know everything i know what people think i know what they say before they even say it i know when they break with my program you could have asked your friend phillip maccandliss maccandliss whats he got to do with this nothing now you see he went against his country thats when we had mr koller pay him a visit youre a sick sick man dont feel sorry for maccandliss nick you can thank him for bringing us umberto and true your friend was the right profile for our mission but i also knew how much maccandliss despised you umberto was his pathetic little way of beating a man that he couldnt beat on his own nick clenched the phone wishing he had the strength to crush it into tiny pieces he closed his eyes counting backward to slow his pulse turning his back to koller he leaned up against the workbench for his plan to succeed he had to get the killer even closer to him keeping his hands out of the assassins line of sight nick hoped it would be enough of a lure to get him to move for a better angle in seconds koller had changed position crossing the room and moving diagonally toward the bench i dont believe maccandliss had anything do to with umbertos death nick said and i dont care ramsland replied believe what you want both are dead but you still have a choice give us the dvd and your pledge to be a patriot and well see about letting you move along with your life ms coates too by patriot you mean silent call it what you will were soldiers nick you and i i felt i owed you a chance koller was in the best position possible directly to nicks right nick had served ramslands purpose by even considering going in with him there was absolutely no chance he was going to be allowed to survive this day now do it now nick thought his senses were heightened by another intense surge of adrenaline the pungent coppery stench of blood noticeable before was now overpowering kollers empty left hand was the target there was no way to get at his pistol panic is not an option nick was thinking remembering his days in the or panic costs lives he silently repeated the mantra while praying koller had not noticed his hand inching closer toward the tool bucket with ramsland still on the line nick set the phone down on the middle of the workbench his pulse was hammering in his throat chances were he was about to die he wants to talk to you he managed koller kept his weapon level as his left hand moved to pick up the phone his eyes left nick for perhaps a second it was just enough time the nail guns bright orange handle stuck out of the tool bucket holster like an outlaws sixshooter it was a cordless model not the compressor type nick had used in his early teens to help his father frame a modest addition on their house the magazine on the paslode gun was designed to be easily visible nothing upset a framer or roofer more than running out of nails midjob nick had already noticed that the tool was full with what looked like threeinch nails if the battery was charged he had a chance if not he hoped it would be over quickly kollers gun hand dropped several inches as he looked down to locate the phone in that moment nick went for the nail gun koller saw movement but turned his head just before he raised his pistol in that instant nick snatched the nail gun out of its holster and in a continuous motion drove the tip into the back of kollers hand with all the force he could muster there was a sharp pop followed by a geyser of blood from the spot simultaneous with the sound nick heard the cracking of bone as the nail plowed through skin then metacarpal then nerves and muscle and finally through skin again the shaft shot down its full three inches exiting the palm and entering the wood impaling the killers hand onto the workbench kollers feral scream was more surprise and rage than agony nick dove for the floor clutching the nail gun with both his hands as he hit he was positioned directly beside koller and hoisted the nail gun again this time driving the steel nail into the top of kollers shoe kollers scream louder this time reverberated throughout the office run nick yelled to himself run now koller remained cool enough to work his hand free and turn to shoot the bullet tore through nicks upper right arm with the sensation of touching a hot stove a second shot missed crouching nick charged toward the windows zigzagging sharply he had considered the stairs but those were to his back and turning around would have cost seconds he didnt have three feet nick closed his eyes and lunged for the canvas flap hanging in front of the dumpster chute barely aware of the pain in his arm the flap gave way and in an instant he plunged into darkness flying downward three stories inside noreens makeshift trashcan slide the trip down was bruising the hard rubber of the barrels gouged at his face and chest as he sped toward the disk of evening light at the bottom the dumpster itself was hardly a sanctuary it was half filled with splintered boards broken glass jagged metal and nails nick shot headfirst from the end of the tube dropping two feet into the potentially lethal trash shielding his face from the impact when he hit it was into a blanket of pink fiberglass insulation glass fragments embedded in the insulation tore at his skin he rolled to the right as he landed gashing his scalp just above one eyebrow on a strip of rusty metal blood began pouring into his eye his thoughts were fogged and his vision blurred from the combination of pain blood and what he had endured in noreen siliskis office partially by feel he found the dumpsters edge and began to climb out jamming an exposed nail through his sneaker and into his foot he cried out but kept on scrambling he hit the asphalt of the parking lot heavily and immediately toppled over pawing at the blood that was oozing down into his eye closing that eye he looked up for any sign of koller and saw him ripping down the canvas covering the window it was too gloomy to see if the nail that had pierced through the mans hand was still lodged there but then with a warriors pride the killer held it out for nick to see that it was you look bad doc he called out real bad god hes smiling nick realized koller hoisted his gun and nick took off running two shots snapped harmlessly into the asphalt several feet from him he clambered for the woods blood continuing to blur his vision and reached the tree line knowing that although he was still alive he was not in the least safe koller would follow chapter weaving awkwardly nick hobbled across the parking lot the impact of the asphalt on his injured foot sent jolts of pain up his leg his upper arm was afire and any number of lesser injuries were also making themselves known blood continued to flow down into his eye it took most of a minute to reach the woods he tangled with a wall of saplings and thick brush that lined the forest perimeter and lost his balance falling facefirst onto the rainsoaked ground the damp leaves turned red with his blood his face was muddied and bruised keeping low to the forest floor and running clumsily ahead nick ripped a strip of fabric from his shirt and tied a makeshift bandage around his head even with pressure in place blood from the cut still oozed down into his eye with branches snapping across his face he risked a glance over his shoulder but could not see his pursuer through the rain and mounting gloom veering to his left nick tried to gauge where the road might be the building housing noreens office was an odd one and quite isolated as if a developer had bought a lot of land built the first building of a planned office park and then simply stopped nick sensed that he was heading not toward the highway but deeper into the dense woods he thought about trying to find the road but rejected the notion and plunged ahead another thirty or forty feet and he stopped and listened the rain was continuing steadily and he was breathing heavily making it difficult to hear anything else he held his breath and risked a furtive glance behind him it took several seconds for him to make out the soft crunching of brush koller had traversed the parking lot and was moving stealthily but steadily toward him hide or run through the dark he thought he saw the mans silhouette he cast about trying to get a sense of his position there really was no place to hide the darkness was his ally his injuries were his foe but koller was hurt too he reminded himself crawling forward on hands and knees nick waited until the trees grew taller and denser before rising to his feet again his only chance was to push deeper into the darkening woods the predator was closing in ignoring the burning from his gunshot wound and sacrificing his forearms to the whipping branches nick shielded his face and barreled ahead here the forest floor was uneven and decaying leaves hid sinkholes that with one unfortunate step could break an ankle he accelerated toward a small clearing that was when the ground dipped unexpectedly he failed to see an exposed rock directly in his path his foot caught the solidly embedded stone and he tumbled down a steep embankment landing heavily on his back in the middle of a slowmoving stream his head snapped against a rock with dizzying force the water instantly soaked through his shirt and jeans weighing him down when he tried to stand again he paused and listened again he heard branches breaking somewhere up the embankment behind him damn for no wellconceived reason he decided to let the bank of the stream be his guide his lungs were burning now with each labored breath and a painful stitch had developed in his right side soaked through he began following the stream as it widened and snaked its way through the forest in what seemed like an eastwest flow dusk had given way to a deepening darkness the going was slow twice the muddy bank gave way dropping him into the water despite his intense exertion he quickly began to chill now though when he stopped he heard nothing except the spattering of rain and the white noise of insects have i lost him twenty feet thirty forty oblivious to the pain nick dove ahead suddenly from behind and to his right he heard the crack of a gunshot followed by the hum of a bullet cutting through the heavy air at almost the same moment a small tree to his right splintered whirling he saw kollers silhouette perhaps a hundred yards away climbing over a fallen log given the distance the accuracy of the shot was astounding driven by new intense urgency he pushed forward another shot zipped past this one slicing into a tree only inches above his head the thought of hiding from the killer even in the mounting darkness vanished with that near miss his only chance was to somehow get out of the woods to a neighborhood and call for help it seemed though it was probably totally irrational that continuing to follow the water was his best chance once again the storm intensified rain pelted his face washing away the mud and blood his injured foot ached with every step sending hot needles up into his calf give me what i want and i promise your lady wont be hurt kollers taunts seemed to echo from every direction nick kept his vision focused forward as he thrashed ahead he would have sacrificed himself for jillian without hesitating but if koller even had her he was bluffing about letting her live ramsland could never leave survivors now despite his bluster he had never really intended to there was too much blood on his hands to chance putting his patriotism to the test he might believe in the horrible things he had done or authorized but it was doubtful the electorate would nick forged on for what he guessed to be a quarter of a mile without slowing down his eyes stayed fixed on the ground in front of him as he dodged treacherous rocks and heavy roots he had done well to avoid going down as the last fragments of light seeped from the forest several checks behind showed no sign of koller and nick began allowing himself to believe he might have somehow lost the man the forest landscape began to change there were fewer trees here more low brush it was as though the woods were disappearing then the brush too gave way he lifted his head just in time to see the stream fall away he dropped to his knees and inched forward peering down into the darkness a thin shallow waterfall disappeared beneath him fifty feet straight down seventyfive it was impossible to tell the gorge formed by the river below cut the forest in two it was a hundred or two hundred feet wide and ran ahead as far as he could see the sound of rushing water reverberated off the cliff walls from behind him nick heard dead branches and leaves crunching how could he have made such a mess of things to travel the ridge of the gorge in either direction would leave him totally exposed from lack of cover going down beside the narrow falls was an option but not a desirable one years ago before nick traded in his adrenaline addiction for emdr therapy his skills as a rock climber hovered just below expert in his heyday nick could engineer the three most common rope systems blindfolded he knew the right knots to tie in for most climbing situations abseiling down a rock wall such as this was always a favorite maneuver of his he did some rappelling in the army and always excelled at it but freesolo descent was a different beast entirely especially in the rain there were no ropes here to provide him a quick trip down he had tried bouldering before but that hardly qualified him as more than a rank novice at freesolo techniques still with koller getting nearer he had no options necessity is the mother of insanity nick muttered to himself lying flat on his stomach he inched over the cliff s edge forty feet down there appeared to be a rock overhang if he could descend the top part of the drop and reach the overhang before koller spotted him there was a chance he could hide out underneath it until it was safe to move againuntil dawn if necessary more rustling to his back there were no options he would have to onsight this routefigure out his holds on the fly as he worked his way down turning around and dropping his feet so he was facing the rock nick eased himself over the ledge he located his first foothold five feet down moss and the rain had turned every rock and crevice slick and treacherous there was no sure footing here no dependable handholds he kept his hands just past shoulder width digging around the loose stone until he found what seemed like a reasonable grip his left leg was shaking perhaps from the tension of the tiptoe hold but probably from exhaustion as well the first twenty feet down passed fairly easily the rocks jutted out like jagged teeth making the holds painless to feel out even in dim light nick was gaining on the overhang ignoring his fear and the pain from the gunshot wound in his right arm and focusing all his intensity on the goal almost there keep going easy easy a voice called out to him from above hey there doc koller said havent you read about the dangers of climbing at night without ropes the monster was only a silhouette but even in darkness nick thought he could see the white of his cheshire cat grin he hurried his movements inch by inch working his way down you made this very easy doc set up a perfect nonkill actually watch out for falling rocks those can be a bitch a small boulder clattered past just two or three feet from nicks face he sensed the miss might have been on purpose what about the dvd nick yelled up into the blackness you dont have my copy yes its a shame your death will make it harder to find but i know its not far from where your friends siliski and mollender are napping the good news is youll be dead so i wont have to send you my medical bills for the hand and foot you impaled with that fucking nail gun i hope they really hurt nicks right foot hungrily sought out a new hold the tips of his fingers began to burn from fatigue koller dropped another rock missing by no more than a foot the overhang was too far away for nick to reach in time to get cover another rock clattered down then anotherthis one glancing off his left shoulder once you fall and hit bottom ill amble down myself and make sure if youre still alive that you die slowly you stuck there the next rock a foot or more around smashed just above nicks head spraying a cloud of loose stone and dust into his face the river continued to churn some fifty feet below and he began peering down searching for a pool there was one he felt certain of it but there was no way of guessing its depth even if it ran deeper than six feet a drop from this height could still be fatal or at least legbreaking which would be the same thing still his options had all but vanished where did i screw up he wondered what could i have done differently kollers next drop hit nick squarely on the shoulder startled he lost his footing and for several seconds his body swung out over the river like a hinged door with only the fingers of his left hand sustaining him teeth clenched he held on and waited to swing back staying there was suicide he decided he had to jump and doc kollers voice rang out im going to do your girl before i kill her driven by the demons words nick found the grip he needed his footing felt solid enough the handholds were in long fissures of the rock which provided him with surprisingly good leverage he visualized the move he was about to perform there was no time to work up the needed courage no matter what he was going to jump he flattened against the rock feeling the cool moisture on his skin then with every bit of power he could generate he pushed himself away from the crag and flew am i far enough out his arms and legs flailed against the rushing air as he plummeted downward please god please nick hit the water with the force of a thunderclap air exploded from his lungs his head snapped forward his legs hit bottom then gave way immediately the current pulled him under grinding his body against rocks and sand before spitting him back to the surface again nick choked and sputtered on the mustytasting water a bullet slapped into the river mere feet from where he was being carried downstream it was followed by another shot but there was no sound of impact nick took one stroke but again was pulled under his lungs burned his strength was all but gone panic had replaced fear and he was desperately hungry for air back on the surface nick gagged and coughed out the water threatening to fill his lungs his arms windmilled wildly searching for anything that would hold him on the surface each time he submerged he felt it would be his last the sense of dying one moment living the next was a cruel joke finally the churning water slowed and the turbulent river became a placid stream once more nick floated on the surface completely spent dont give in garrity stay conscious stay alive everything went black nick had no idea how long hed been out he was faceup in the stream and he was still alive his shirt had caught on a branch that was jutting out over the water and might have been what had saved him he was chilled to the core and unable to stop shaking the first sound he heard besides the rippling water was koller calling his name the killer was somewhere upstream but moving in nicks direction it wouldnt be long i know youre out there i hope youre suffering i hope i dont find you dead i owe you i owe you for the holes in my hand and my foot and i owe you because im getting cold please dont be dead nick freed himself from the branch and sank to eye level in the chilly water which was only two or three feet deep at this spot bit by bit details of his flight from the killer came into focus hesitant to leave the water despite his chill he pushed himself downstream the rain had stopped and moonlight had broken through the clouds in places thirty or forty feet ahead were the roots of a huge fallen tree he let go of his hold and guided his body toward it the tree was hollow the opening was barely big enough for him to fit through but nick managed to squeeze his body inside no sooner had his feet disappeared into the mosslined opening than he heard koller pass by at most five feet from him ill find you doctor and im going to make you watch what i do to your pretty girlfriend you hear me im going to make you watch nick breathed fresh air using a rottedout hole in the trunk he could hide out inside the log but hypothermia was now a serious concern nick closed his eyes he listened then he waited thirty minutes was probably too long to survive in this cold there had been no sign of koller for at least the last ten nick shivered violently he had to move soon before his body began to shut down permanently another five minutes and he slipped out the other end of the log he floated with the current praying that koller had abandoned the search the water slowed considerably after another ten minutes virtually helpless and barely conscious he saw the lights of passing traffic it took every bit of his will and remaining strength to crawl toward them waving his arms on the side of the road he watched with growing dismay as car after car zoomed past why arent they stopping his teeth continued snapping together like a jackhammer please stop im in trouble every muscle in his body ached he no longer had the strength to stand suddenly a ford pickup truck slowed and then pulled to a stop in front of him responding to a burst of adrenaline nick rose and ran over to the truck the old man behind the wheel sized him up you okay son the man asked i could use a blanket and a ride nick said through chattering teeth but first do you have a phone i can borrow its very urgent the man considered the request then tossed nick a blanket he fished out from behind his seat and handed nick a cell phone jillian was probably in kollers control but he could still reach junie with his hands shaking he could barely dial her number on the third ring he gratefully heard his call being answered thank god youre there he said not even waiting for her to say hello junie weve got big trouble that we do kollers voice responded over junies phone big trouble indeed chapter goddamn you koller if youve hurt junie i swear zip it doc im nowhere near the woman but obviously i had calls to her cell forwarded to me so i do know where she is shes unharmed for the moment at least the rv has scheduled stops all over baltimore and dc police will be looking for her when it doesnt show actually the whole evenings been canceled already dr saunders thats whos listed for tonight in the log book knows all about the mechanical problems youre having with the rv in fact you yourself told herat least she thinks it was you as we speak that woman is visiting each stop to break the bad news to your patients this isnt over koller not by a long shot nick could no longer tell if he was shaking from cold or rage the old man as easygoing as his faded denim jeans and buttondown cowboy shirt sat patiently in the front seat of his pickup keeping a watchful eye on his cell phone and nick through the open passenger door you know something koller replied i sort of wish that were true believe me it is no it is over doc and youve lost you just dont realize it yet but i must confess youve impressed me i hurt you too a big hurt and im going to do it again next time itll be a hammer to the mouth i have a score to settle with ramsland too now dont you start naming names there nicky or whoevers phone youve borrowed will be none too pleased to have helped you out this is between you and me koller you bet its between you and me do you know how many contracts ive executed in my career i know what you did to saul and noreen belle coates too the answer is ive lost count but suffice it to say its an impressive number and do you know how many of those marks have managed to hurt me a monster like you has no feelings oh wrong again doc i have plenty of feelings the point im making here is that after all those people ive taken out youd think at least a couple of them would have left a scratch or two behind but there youd be wrong turns out youre the first to how should i put it nail franz in any way for that i commend you where is junie do you have jillian too tell me you bastard the old man slid across the cab and poked his head out after hearing the commotion everything all right out there im afraid you have to be moving on before long my daughters got dinner waitin tell whoever that is youll only be a minute koller instructed you and me have some business we need to discuss everything is okay sir thank you just another minute and i should be all set no worries son said the man at my age time is something i might not have in bulk but i got no trouble giving away now nick koller said i want to offer you a deal no deals really even when i have something precious that you want two things as a matter of fact and you have a couple things that i very much want too which are the dvd and your life you wont get either i think i will lets get down to business shall we because you dont have much time nobody else dies koller i wont let it happen im afraid thats an option that is well out of your control its not if youre going to die doctor or your two friends its how at kollers words much of nicks bravado faded what are you saying give yourself over to me the last dvd too and i promise that when i kill you and the ladies it will be instant and painless a single shot to the base of the skull oblivion in an instant you wont even know what hit you but should you refuse me should you give me any further trouble i will torture ms coates and ms wright in ways so horrible you couldnt possibly imagine and ill enjoy it i always do then ill burn them alive nicky but ill take my sweet time doing it piece by piece until theyre nothing but cinders that bus of yours will be their incinerator clearly koller was relishing the description nick began to shake you wouldnt dare he managed with no authority whatsoever youre a doctor you know the degree of pain im talking about and the ladies miserable agonizing deaths will be on your head too ill make sure you have souvenir photos of the aftermath and give you ample time to think about what you did to them before i do something similarly creative to you nick froze at the words tears of helplessness and sheer anger blurred his vision this isnt happening no not like this nicks index finger hovered just above the phones redlettered end button but he could not bring himself to disconnect the call his mind was filled with the imagery and hideous screams of jillians and junies horrifying final moments he pictured their blackened bodies in some landfill he smelled their deaths this offer has a limited shelf life doc you know how belle coates died i cut her a similar deal a painless peaceful end for her and in exchange sister jillian got to live im a man of my word that you should know by now nick was hesitating stalling as best he could desperate for the sudden brilliant flash of an idea each turn in the maze led quickly to another dead end beaten he bowed his head the location of the dvd only after i know for certain that nobody suff ers i have to see their deaths for myself i can handle it so long as i know mine is next it was kollers turn to think my my he said you are a source of constant surprises i can always torture the information from you if you try and hold out on me okay its a deal you get to watch i get the disc nick found it strange but he believed koller would keep his word there were aspects of the monster that he had come to understand including a twisted code of keeping his word testified to by jillians continued presence on the planet what other option did nick have at least if he gave himself up jillian and junie would be safe a while longer meanwhile he would spend every moment searching for an opening and in the end if there was any chance however small of defeating koller before he killed the women he would take it what now he asked give the phone back to the man you borrowed it from allow me to speak with him trembling nick handed the old man back his phone exhaustion his wounds and the battering his body had absorbed had him bracing himself on the front seat to remain upright he wants to talk to you he said who is it the man asked better if you dont know but i really need you to talk to him the man pressed the cell to his ear yes that would be exit thirteen sir yes i can do that okay two and a half minutes then yes i understand nick could feel panic tightening his throat what did he say he asked i have two minutes and thirty seconds to get you down the highway and to drop you off at exit thirteen or the deals off thats what he said nick leaped into the trucks cab drive please drive two peoples lives are at stake anything i can nothing just drive and drop me off and then get as far away as possible the old mans weathered face blanched and he hit the gas pedal before nick had even closed the door his tires squealed on the wet pavement and the pickup skidded into oncoming traffic nearly broadsiding a minivan we got two minutes but the exit aint that far what sort of trouble are you in son im dealing with a very bad sick dangerous man it wont concern you as soon as im gone but take this card nick worked his sodden wallet from his back pocket and fished out don reeses limp business card when youre far enough away and i mean several miles down the road call this man hes a detective tell him that nicks been taken somewhere leave a message if you get his voice mail nicks been taken that all the less you know the safer youll be as it is hes probably going to get a look at your license plate number nick set reeses business card on the trucks dash we got a minute and a half the man said i aint got no wife anymore died some years back nowadays i live for fixing up old trucks driving new ones and watching nascar with the boys but i sure wish i could help you out more that makes two of us nick said almost thirty seconds to spare nice going i really appreciate it the man pulled the truck off the highway just past the exit thirteen cutoff they peered out through the raindotted windows for another vehicle but saw none that were parked doesnt seem to be anybody here the old man said suddenly the drivers side door flew open as if blown by the wind koller leaped inside shoving the driver over as if he were a doll sandwiching him between himself and nick then without uttering a word koller grabbed the mans head between his hands and in a single powerful twist snapped his neck with a sickening crack of bone the cab instantly filled with a foul stench as his bowels and bladder let go you fucking bastard nick screamed koller leveled his gun on him nothing you can do will save him now but a deals a deal doc and you just cut one with me you dont want to go back on thats a promise with the dead man riding between them koller eased the truck into the flow of traffic the rain was falling harder now chapter if you light up in here young man junie said i promise you im going to throw up even with the door and windows open you could cut the roof off this bus with a giant can opener and id still vomit its like an allergy a person smokes around me indoors i throw up just go outside youll be looking right at us through the windows while you give yourself cancer and emphysema and heart disease but what you wont be looking at darlin is this old lady getting violently ill the guard a handsome wellbuilt africanamerican man in his thirties glanced about the rv clearly pondering what problems could possibly arise from leaving the two women handcuff ed to the supports of the dining table while he smoked outside finally he unfolded his sixfoot frame from the passenger chair and stepped easily down to the dirtcovered floor of the barn ive seen you smoke junie jillian whispered only one a day its a deal i made with sam when we got married ive never broken the deal not once but god does that one marlboro taste fine junie we cant just sit here waiting for them to kill us weve got to do something were not going to be as easy as i was when they hijacked the rv the guy was already behind the curtain in the exam room waiting for me when i left to go pick up nicks replacement for the night lets vow right now we wont go down without a fight any sense of where nick might be im worried thats for sure but im also worried they might be using us to get at him all the more reason to fight the question is how do we deal with an armed guard while were handcuff ed you may not be able to tell yet but im softening him up i remind him of his mother how do you know that i remind every man of his mother what do we do after youve got him softened im counting on you for that one sweetie youre the psych nurse it had been five uncomfortable hours since paul regis or whatever his name was had led jillian to his car on the pretext of getting some papers for her to sign over coffee he had been charming worldly funny and complimentary even after she had told him she had met someone and so she was totally unprepared when he grabbed her wrist and viciously twisted her arm behind her back in almost the same movement he shoved her facedown onto the passenger side floor hoisted her into the car by her belt and demanded she hold her hands together behind her back by the time they arrived at the farmsomewhere north and west of dc she guessedher forehead and one cheek were rubbed raw by the carpet it was late afternoon when the car finally stopped and regis opened the passengers side door they were parked in a broad field flat and verdant facing them in parallel were four large weatherworn barns the sort used for storing and curing tobacco some distance behind the barns was a small whitewashed house but there was no farming equipment anywhere and no corrals or other signs that livestock was about parked in front of the second barn from the right was a black pickup truck and beside it was a man in dark slacks sunglasses and a white shirt wearing a shoulder holster it bothered jillian greatly that regis had made no attempt to keep her from viewing the setup or from gazing around apparently it didnt matter to him what she saw because she wasnt ever going to leave the place alive at the second barn regis spoke briefly with the man on duty turned her over to him and left in something of a hurry she was handcuffed and led through the side door into a surprisingly vast raftered space two stories high poorly lit by three widely spaced naked bulbs there were dozens of boxes and crates of all sizes stacked along the walls and a small jeep parked at the rear in the center of the barn beneath one of the three hanging lights was the helping hands medical rv she was devastated but not completely surprised to see junie through the windows sitting calmly at the table a minute later jillian was sitting across from her also handcuffed to the table leg looks like hes almost done with his smoke jillian said any ideas i feel certain i can get out of these handcuffs at least temporarily how no man wants to sit around and watch while an old lady wets herself in fact im not going to have to act very hard to convince him of that threat what comes after that coffee junie whispered urgently as the guard stubbed out his butt and turned to mount the stairs i gotcha jillian replied as the man settled back wearily into his seat hey thanks for doing your smoking out there junie said no big deal you really shouldnt be doing that at all you know thanks for the advice my names junejunie everyone calls me this heres jillian were both nurses we know about smoking thats nice you got a name call me butch this cant be much fun for you butch holding two ladies prisoner like this i do what im told i have a son your age he never did what he was told thats nice jillian sensed that she was watching a master at worka queen of swaying people to her point of view hes a lawyer nowa public defender you some kind of cop why would you ask that i dont know just something about the way you carry yourself i been around for quite a while i know people for instance i know that underneath that gruff exterior youre a good guysort of a john wayne type you got kids enough all you need to know is that im very good at my job which right now is watching over you two i understand tell me something butch did your boss or bosses tell you what to do if your sixtytwoyearold captives bladder was about to explode the man chuckled you can go to the bathroom you just got to keep the door open if you wanna watch thats not my problem door stays open even though i dont see you as much of a threat youre right there butch hey i dont want to push my luck but after i get this bladder business straightened out any way i could make us some coffee its instant but youd never know it well well see first things first butch removed the small brass key from his pants pocket and unlocked her cuffs junie managed a sideways glance at jillian who immediately picked up the ball me next she pleaded like i said first things first junie rose with no small difficulty groaning mightily as she did someday someones going to handcuff you to a pole butch and make you sit in just that position for a million hours sorry orders are orders i can barely move youll loosen up maybe and maybe not about that coffee what is it with you two first things first how many times do i have to say it let me just get some water simmering while i use the bathroom like i said youll love this stuff junie had already taken a large saucepan from beside the sink run in some water from the tap and set it on the propane stove jillian was astounded watching the woman operate it was just as junie had saidas if butch was responding to his mother theres a box of matches right here junie said i just have to light the okay enough put those down and get into the bathroom sure you take cream in your coffee sugar ill bet neither you look like a neither type of guy my son is a neither guy too here ill light the burner and you can take charge then im off to the restroom the coffees in the refrigerator right next to the cream i take both cream and a couple of sugars by the time she had turned around and headed up the aisle to the small washroom across from the shower the propane burner was on and the water was beginning to heat in and out butch insisted adjusting the gun in his shoulder holster for emphasis i dont have much patience my son doesnt have any patience either deception diversion the woman was good jillian was thinking incredibly good she risked a glance over at the stove where the saucepan had begun to rattle on the burner that they had gotten this far was a miracle but they couldnt stop or even hesitate now these men were professionals committed to learning how much the two women knew and then eliminating them unless they did something about it they were both going to die it was as simple as that jillian swung around as much as she could junie had maneuvered her way into the tiny bathroom near the rear of the rv then suddenly she closed the door the guard raced past the stove and pounded on the bathroom door jillian noticed that the saucepan on the stove was beginning to clatter as the water approached boiling i told you not to close the door open it up now or ill kick it in i cant go with somebody watching me two more seconds now the door flew open and junie stepped out with both her hands in the air im done dont shoot junie lowered her hands and began moving down the narrow aisle as butch backed up two feet in front of her with all the commotion jillian wondered if he even remembered the near boiling water just a few feet behind him with luck if gentle loving junie wasnt tentative in anything she did he was about to get a fearsome reminder three feet jillian estimated suddenly junie reached one hand behind her back and brought it out holding an aerosol can of disinfectant butch was reaching for it when she sprayed him in the face it was a feeble effort and the guard swatted the can away after only one blast but some of the chemical had stung his eyes his hand shot up and grabbed her by the throat as his other hand wiped the aerosol away please dont hurt her jillian screamed shes never harmed anyone junie dont be foolish butch hesitated then loosened his grip junie dropped to one knee gasping for air but jillian noticed that she had moved the guard backward another two feet butch still rubbing at his eyes was paying no attention to the saucepan of water which jillian felt certain was boiling now that was a damn stupid thing to do the guard said youre going to kill us anyway arent you i had to try something shut up and get back to your seat theres not going to be any killing here inch by inch junie moved ahead purposely keeping her gaze down thank you butch jillian said thank you for not hurting her butch glanced behind him at jillian the distraction had lasted only a fraction of a second but it was enough junies moves were quick and deadly accurate she grasped the saucepan handle cried out butchs name and as he turned back splashed the boiling water into his face from just a few inches away before the guard had even hit the carpeted floor screaming and pawing at his eyes junie was pounding him again and again with the saucepanpowerful strikes that sounded like rifle shots it took just two blows for him to become limp but junie landed half a dozen more each more forceful than the last at some point jillian thought she heard bone crack she stared wideeyed at the woman i grew up in a dogeatdog neighborhood junie said breathless she reached down first to check butchs carotid pulse then removed his pistol and finally fished inside his pocket for the handcuff key sometimes just making it to the corner grocery store was a serious adventure hes still got a pulse but i dont think waking up is in his near future just remind me never to ask you for any coffee jillian said chapter koller exited the highway pulled to a stop on an unlit deserted street and cut the engine he had been using only one hand to steer the other he rested on the dead mans lap pointing the gun he held there at nick move this guy into the truck bed back there koller said motioning nick out of the ford with the gun barrel he stinks and dont get any ideas ive left instructions with my people that if we dont show in thirty minutes to start scalding the ladies with hot oil you understand me nick nodded and slipped out of the passenger door and onto the grassy roadside he was desperate to get to jillian and junie and believed that as long as he did what koller asked of him that would happen soon enough there was nothing he could do to help the old man now except to add that guilt to the guilt he was already dealing with he felt terrible about indirectly being the cause of his death but he forced himself to remember that it was koller who killed himkoller and fate cold hurting and tired nick struggled to lift the body relying essentially on his one good arm then he laid the old man down gently on the trucks muddy bed and covered him one more score to settle with koller when the time came what will you do with the body nick asked as soon as they were traveling again my clients have the means to dispose of bodies i just provide them you dont feel a thing for that mans life do you koller the killer smiled think of me like an animal put on earth to hunt for food he replied ive been put on this earth to use my considerable skills to kill people thats just what i do somebody might report the truck stolen arent you afraid of getting stopped by the police do i strike you as a man whos afraid of anything nick did not answer we have plenty of time to get where were going without speeding koller added you really think of everything dont you you think of a lot yourself doc im curious why didnt you bring the dvd with you up to siliskis office saul tipped me off nick said gritting his teeth against another wave of pain this one centered in his belly he used his dead brothers name instead of umbertos so you knew exactly what he was doing koller said with a laugh i picked up on it yes well i did too thats why i made him suffer before i killed him i dont like people messing with me or thinking theyre smarter than me even with the trucks heat on high nick could not stop shivering the bullet wound was throbbing more intensely now perhaps irritated from his efforts moving the body chatting with koller disgusted him but it seemed like the only thing keeping him conscious at the moment he was afraid that if he closed his eyes for anything longer than a blink he might never open them again dont worry i wont do to you and the women what i did to your pal mollender koller said breaking a brief silence after all a deals a deal nick dug his index finger into the bullet hole in his arm and discovered that the intense pain caused by the maneuver made him feel more alert and even more determined from now on he decided he would repeat the action again and again for as long as he could stand it until this was over between him and koller he wanted to feel the hurt he wanted to feel the hatred by the time the killer eased the pickup to a stop in a wide grassy field nick doubted he had the strength even to stand how can i help anyone if i cant even walk once again he dug his finger deeply into his wound with his gun drawn koller crossed in front of the truck and dragged nick out letting him drop to his knees on the ground they were at a farm of some sort reached by a road that had no traffic outside lighting was minimal but nick could see a number of barns none with any windows and another pickup truck koller hoisted him up by what remained of his shirt and dragged him to the closest door a man wearing a shoulder holster was standing guard this the doc yeah open up the door you might not want to stick around in there for whats going to happen i signed on to die for my country or to help someone else die for theirs whatevers going to happen i can handle they spoke as though nick were not present which in his current state was not that far from the truth nick again pressed his finger into the bullet hole and was a bit dismayed that the pain he generated seemed less still his alertness was enhanced as his eyes adjusted to the dim light he began casting about for anything he could use as a weapon while at the same time testing his limbs the barn door slid open on a track and koller pushed nick inside nicks heart sank at the sight of the helping hands rv parked in the center of the space the interior of the barn was poorly lit partly because the bulb hanging over the van one of three dangling on cords from the rafters was out then he realized that the rv itself although the passenger door was open was dark could the women be in there once inside the barn koller hesitated then stopped wheres the other guard butch the guard called out butch where in the hell are you does he know what hes doing hes the best sir the very best call him again butch hey buddy nick was awake now wide awake something was going wrong koller was tense shit the killer muttered scanning the barn which was stacked with cartons crates and any number of places to hide violently he pushed nick down so he was leaning against the rear tire of the bus then he turned to the guard gun out watch the door and stay here with him if he opens his mouth if he says one fucking word shoot him in the balls dont kill him nick was fully with it now pistol ready koller cautiously approached the open rv door then he dropped down to one knee and peered inside jesus christ what the guard called out your pal butch the very best is on the floor unconscious theres water everywhere and unless i miss my guess his prisoners are no longer in this bus yes nick whispered he could see that the killers face was contorted with anger this door is the only way out the guard said and i was out there on duty every second just like you ordered i swear i was if theyre not in the bus then theyre still somewhere in this barn a determined smile crossed nicks face he had enough circulating adrenaline now to hold his head up and survey his surroundings dark corners tall rafters mountains of crates and boxes would give the women ample places to hide despite their being trapped inside they were smart and resourceful and had the advantage of surprise on their side as well as the fallen guards gun you go girls nick was thinking but for gods sake be careful on red alert koller spun in a circle his gun aiming wherever his eyes traveled he walked backward a few feet moving away from nick to scan areas of the barn that were obscured from his view by the rv do you have a flashlight in that truck he asked the guard um im afraid its butchs truck so i dont know of course come on now ladies ive got your friend nick here do you really want to see him die kollers voice was less commanding nick noticed his confidence not as evident he absolutely cant stand being at a disadvantage nick was thinking nobody else has to get hurt but only if you come out from wherever youre hiding im going to get you ladies if i have to burn this barn to the ground im going to get you nick dug his finger deep into the bullet hole in his biceps again it was time to get active stay where you are he shouted make him come to you he cant kill us he needs his words were cut short as the butt of a gun whipped against the side of his head dazing him and knocking him over i thought i said shoot him if he talks koller screamed disc or no disc shoot him nick pushed himself to his feet as koller took up a position five feet away sorry pal the guard said stepping forward wait koller ordered ladies you have three seconds to show yourself or we kill him one dont come out nick yelled loud enough for his voice to fill the barn two im sorry buddy the guard said again to nick but this is war three nick clenched his jaws there was a loud gunshot but remarkably no pain nick looked up just as the guard reeled past him and koller and slammed into the rv smearing a broad crimson stroke on the white wall as he slid to the ground another shot rang out they were coming from somewhere among the crates to nicks right koller whirled in the direction of the first shot and fired a rapid spray the second shot was accompanied by a muzzle flash that both he and nick saw the killer needed no more he snapped off a fourshot volley aimed precisely at the spot junie cried out and pitched forward facefirst collapsing a tower of crates and boxes on top of herself slowly agonizingly nick pulled himself to his feet at that instant there was another scream this one from the shadows overhead jillian koller spun around and peered up through the gloom at the roof of the rv he was still raising his gun when several gallons of gasoline were poured down into his face nick was close enough to be splashed a bit but koller was doused nick scrambled away as the killer screaming and pawing futilely at his eyes stumbled and fell in the dim light he could see jillian kneeling on the roof of the rv hurl a now empty metal bucket down on the man the bucket hit koller squarely on the top of the head but the pain had to be nothing compared to the agony he was already experiencing ill fucking kill you he was screeching though his words were barely audible through his violent gagging ill kill you koller was on his feet now spinning wildly coughing and rubbing fruitlessly at his eyes jillian on her feet as well atop the rv had one more surprise in store for the monster whose thick black hair was matted with gasoline paul regis or whoever you are she screamed you killed my sister her name was belle elizabeth coates you son of a bitch nick was backing toward where junie lay motionless when he saw jillian light a match and drop it into the small cardboard box she held in her other hand the matches within the box flared illuminating her face and the beams above her at that instant she released her grip and let the container drop nick felt as if he were watching the fireball descend in slow motion it landed a foot away from koller but that was close enough there was a moment of silence and then an explosion of fire that lit every corner of the expansive barn along with a tremendous sucking sound as oxygen rushed to fuel the flames the pungent odors of gasoline and smoke were overpowered by the stench of kollers burning hair and flesh carried skyward inside a towering pillar of fire in seconds flame swallowed his face and his skin charred off before it could even blister kollers saturated clothes were consumed as one incinerating the flesh beneath them which melted in places down to the bone as the killer continued to stagger around the floor of the barn nick had to shield his face and turn away from the blast of heat from somewhere within the pillar of flame he thought he heard koller screaming then the cylinder of fire collapsed as the flames receded darkness began to recapture the recesses of the barn nick raced past the smoldering mound that had so recently proclaimed itself the master of the nonkill he moved the crates aside and gently rolled junie to her back he knew the moment he touched her that she was alive the bullet had entered her left chest just above her breast there was no exit wound that he could discern her eyes were closed but she was breathing albeit shallowly her carotids were still reasonably strong jillian having scrambled down the ladder at the rear of the rv had raced to nicks side blood was forming an expanding circle across junies shirt pulse jillian asked taking the womans hand in hers nick shrugged not so bad actually he said he leaned over made a tube of his hand and used it to check each side of her chest shes moving air hey junie wright its nick and jillian can you hear us junie moaned and tried to open her eyes just lie still sweetie jillian said well take good care of you good thing she brought her van nick said good point how about if i go and get you some equipment i know where everything is in there you keep pressure on this wound and a couple of fingers on her carotid and ill get my black bag and some stuff for an iv weve got a neat little crash kit too you going to make it you dont look so good i can do it find a phone in there and call nineoneone jillian called after him ill bet the guard inside has one got it flashlights too and turn on the headlights nick passed what remained of koller and paused long enough by the guard to affirm that he was beyond fixing minutes later he had the rvs high beams on and was lugging the crash kit and some other equipment over to where junie lay hurry nick jillian called out her pressures dropping i called nineoneone he said breathless from his exertion but i had no idea where to tell them we were and i didnt want to spend too much time talking to them the dispatcher said she could barely hear me but shed try to locate us using our cell phone signal working amidst the smoke and the stench nurse and doctor kneeled sidebyside establishing an iv and then another getting a blood pressure cuff in place and finally hooking up some oxygen they spoke little pressures eighty jillian said ill add some dopamine to the drip nick she was the real hero she saved us all shes got to make it shes going to make it come on lady enough of this deep breaths deep breaths did the dispatcher say how long it would take to find us all she said was that it would take time pressures seventy nick we dont have time im doing about all i can do the dopamine and the fluid are wide open all this smoke isnt helping i wish we could get her the heck out of here into some decent air he snatched up the cell phone any luck well keep trying keep trying nothing jillian asked nothing she needs an or and she needs it fast i think we should try and get her into the van and see if we can find a hospital do you have the strength to move her if i need it ill have the strength would it hurt her if we have to drag her over to the rv maybe jillian checked junies pressure again and clenched her fist in frustration still seventy jillian said come on god dont you let this happen we need her we all need her ive been at least willing to discuss belle and my faith with you but if you take this woman i swear youve heard the last from me get it at that moment the still night was pierced by the faint sound of sirens less than a minute later with the sirens rapidly closing strobes appeared across the field many strobes they found us jillian exclaimed looks like an invasion from outer space nick picked up the cell phone and talked for a few seconds then he looked at jillian curiously the dispatcher lady says shes sorry they havent been able to find us theyre still trying to track us several police cars and an ambulance pulled up at the barn door i think its safe to say theres a surprise or two waiting in here for them jillian said the first to enter the barn was don reese followed by the paramedics who immediately set about performing their magic praising jillian and nick as they worked reese nick called out the detective hurried to nicks side and stared about in uncharacteristic disbelief the police report on this scene should make for some interesting reading reese said who got torched i sure hope hes a bad guy the worst nick said how the heck did you get here nineoneone said they couldnt find us remember after you um helped me out i gave you that magnetic gps logger for your rv of course well twenty messages of distress from you freaked me out doc i always thought you were a pretty cool customer when i couldnt reach you well lets just say i chose action i made a quick call to the company and we tracked your position here nice going now i guess we can call us even nick said as the paramedics gave him a thumbsup i dont think so reese responded oh come on don jillian said taking his arm if i can settle the score i just settled you guys can settle yours junie was up on a stretcher nick and jillian kissed her on the forehead as she was rolled past them to the waiting ambulance do you want to ride in the ambulance with her nick jillian asked if theyll let me looks like youll need some medical attention too reese said well meet you at the hospital theyll be taking you to county general its a good place and only five miles from here jillian and reese supported nick and helped him to the ambulance the rain had stopped overhead the clouds had parted revealing a bright crescent moon chapter the white stretch limousine eased its way down constitution avenue toward the hart senate office building it was the twelfth day of september a sparkling clear wednesday and it would be no understatement to say that there was more interest in the hearing scheduled to resume in half an hour than in any senate inquiry since watergate answer me true reggie said from the center of the backseat are we going to get us one of these limos or not i wouldnt bet on you not getting one of your own someday junie said pausing to cough and take a breath but only if you do your homework hey dr nick fury here told me that when i move in with him and nurse jillian i wont have to do any homework you wish jillian said you havent seen the nasty side of either of us yet junie you okay the older woman cleared her throat and nodded she hadnt done that well following the removal of the upper lobe of her left lung and seemed to have aged considerably over her months of recovery still it was no surprise to anyone who knew her that she had managed to parlay her growing celebrity into massive donations to helping hands as well as the promise from winnebago of a new deluxe fully equipped rv have you looked outside don reese asked we still have a ways to go and its already walltowall photographers and reporters lets hop out reggie said i want some more pictures of me in the papers theres this girl at school i want to impress and enough junie said ive spoken to your civics teacher and shes expecting at least a fivepage paper on these hearings that should be more than enough to impress any girl thats worth impressing nick honey the humiditys getting to me a little could we please have the driver take us right up to the door yes maam there are a few stairs reese said but theres a ramp do you need a wheelchair i can handle it junie said reese had not only been a lifesaver during the drama in the ciaowned barn but afterward as well it was he who first began to put the pressure on william conklin the director of the cia whom he knew personally to do what he could to restore public trust in the agency given ramslands stature and power conklin had for years turned a blind eye to the activities of the jericho vigilantes now conklins job was on the line the nasty publicity the agency was garnering around the globe was unlike anything since the senator frank church hearings in the midseventies which focused on cia political assassinations and other excesses this afternoon reeses work with the cia chief was hopefully going to come to fruition following a morning of testimony from paresh singh officials and surgeons from shelby stone memorial hospital and relatives of the seven victims from operating room ten lionel ramsland had begun what to nick and the others was an utterly frustrating denial of any direct wrongdoing soon after the man completed the remainder of his testimony it would be conklins turn the final testimony although it would be only hearsay would be from nick dont expect to be called if they run out of time nicks attorney told him they may reconvene tomorrow or they may delete you because your story is unsubstantiated with objective evidence the reporters crowding the curb and spilling over into the street seemed to have been tipped off about the occupants of the approaching limo there had been lengthy articles on nick jillian and the others in the times the washington papers and people as well as on all the networks and cnn the ten little indians or murders people had headlined their cover story david bagdasarian the groups attorney and one of the legal team representing nick and jillian before the boards of medicine and nursing had arranged for the transportation now he met them at the curb opened the door for them and led the group into the modern hart senate building nicks and jillians licenses to practice had been suspended but then the suspensions were stayed pending further investigation ramslands real good bagdasarian said as they passed through the ninestory atrium and by the massive alexander calder metal mobile mountains and clouds and ascended to room today the legendary hearing room was the home of the senate select committee on intelligence he admitted to being the tenth man in the operating room video the senators saw but he denied doing anything illegal and of course even with the plastic surgeons testimony no one can figure out definitively who was on the operating table that day three years ago or what happened to the body supposedly an autopsy was performed but no one has produced the results god bless em all hey dont press that panic button just yet reese said as they took their seats in the third row behind the witness table as yogi berra said the opera aint over until the fat lady sings reese had admitted to nick and jillian that for weeks he had been working with william conklin at the cia but he had shared few details until this morning the six of them were all seated except for nick thanks to his flight from franz koller his shoulders and knees still balked at being kept in one position for very long physical therapy had helped but his joints continued to feel a decade or two older than the rest of him his ptsd was another story altogether his ultimate triumph over the killer his continued emdr therapy and his new life with jillian and reggie were working wonders with his condition his sud score was now consistently between three mildly upset worried bothered to the point where you notice it and two a little bit upset but not noticeable unless you take care to pay attention to your feelings and then realize yes there is something bothering me with an occasional one no acute distress and feeling basically good thrown in nick was massaging the muscles at the base of his neck when lionel ramsland entered the packed hearing room he had lost some weight and almost certainly was wearing expertly applied makeup but in general he appeared as cocky and confident as ever and as bagdasarian said he had strong reason to be nick had taken great pleasure in the mans announcement two months ago that in the interest of not being a distraction to his party he was stepping down as a vice presidential candidate before being nominated now as ramsland approached his seat his eyes and nicks met for a few frozen seconds neither of them moved then never releasing his gaze or altering his expression ramsland raised his right hand and saluted nick swallowing a jet of bile shook his head derisively and took his seat between jillian and reese facing the panel and behind them the massive marble wall with the seal of the senate ramslands continued testimony was gaveled to order by the chairman a wizened senator from missouri named blackstone over the next hour under oath the man who might have been a heartbeat from the presidency lied again and again about his relationship with franz koller the electronic device under cia contract that could stimulate portions of the brain or cause the electrical pathways of the brain to shortcircuit and stop functioning altogether his role as creator and mastermind of the black ops jericho unit and his relationship and dealings with aleem syed mohammad he also swore that he had never had a cell phone conversation with nick and that records of the calls made from his personal cell phone showed absolutely no calls made during the time period nick had stated in his deposition nicks fists were clenched throughout the barrage of dishonesty at one point reese leaned over and whispered its all just rope nickyboy every lie is just more rope well hes almost finished nick said and i dont see any noose at that moment as the final senator was finishing his five minutes of largely redundant questions reese looked over his shoulder his expression which had been getting somewhat gloomy brightened considerably again he bent over close to nick let the games begin reese whispered the fat lady has arrived nick turned around to see cia chief william conklin standing by the rear doors between what appeared to be two lawyers minutes later with ramsland now seated to the side of the room conklin in his midfifties with thick white hair the body of an obsessive athlete and heavy bags under his eyes was called forward sworn in and asked by blackstone to identify himself i notice that you have not been present for the early portion of these hearings blackstone said clearly prepared for this witness no i just flew in the flight was delayed you were traveling alone no i traveled with deputy cia chief arthur senstrom lionel ramslands successor to that post yes senator and where did you fly in from mr conklin from south america senator i cannot disclose the country the purpose of your trip we spent two days with the terrorist aleem syed mohammad the hearing room erupted everyone it seemed was speaking at once in an instant blackstones gavel was pounding nice going nick whispered to reese conklins scrambling to keep the agency together i helped him to see that this was his only chance i just didnt know if the trip was going to accomplish what we hoped now it appears as if it did tell jillian she can take out that photo of her sister shes got in her bag nick did as reese asked jillian set the photo on her lap it was a fivebyseven blackandwhite candid of belle in a spring dress seated with her back against a tree she was reading a book her shoulderlength hair framed a porcelain face that was at once beautiful and transcendently serene nick had seen the photo a number of times before and knew jillian had taken it he reached across and squeezed her right hand with his a single tear broke free from the corner of her eye and landed on his wrist gradually order was restored to the chambers you have come back with evidence pertaining to this case mr conklin blackstone asked yes senator objection ramslands lawyer shouted leaping to his feet i demand the right to review this evidence before it is presented mr dietz this is a hearing to gain facts your client is not on trial here just under oath i am going to permit the presentation of any evidence that will help us expeditiously get to the truth please proceed mr conklin the cia chief set two tape recorders on the table before him and turned the first one on a mans deep voice filled the room he spoke in arabic rather than play the full recording im going to read you the translation conklin said shutting off the tape as he began voice prints will confirm that i am aleem syed mohammad you will also find my fingerprints on this and another tape i am speaking to you from a concealed location in south america in exchange for my cooperation here as well as for any further information mr conklin may require i have been given permission to continue living my life in secrecy some years ago after the death of my oldest son i grew extremely weary of war and of the jihad for reasons that will become clear to you i sought out mr lionel ramsland of the cia and he agreed to meet with me my capture by us forces was arranged and i was transferred from the american military to the cia over the next year my appearance was totally altered by a number of plastic surgical procedures performed by dr paresh singh at the same time two men with bone structures similar to my own were chosen to be made to look exactly as i did before my surgeries in the meanwhile medical evidence was created showing that i was dying from a rare cardiac tumor it is my understanding that my doubles were brainwashed with very sophisticated methods and taught to speak enough arabic to converse with people and in particular with the physicians who would be caring for me nick glanced behind him to the second row from the back where bill pearl wearing his trademark black suit and dress shirt was sitting next to manny ferris who looked remarkably well in a tan sports coat and tie thanks to jillian manny had begun a series of plastic surgery procedures designed to reverse the disfiguring that had resulted from his escape from the singh center in addition a team of therapists from shelby stone had been deprogramming him and treating his ptsd according to jillian progress was slow and there was some doubt among his treaters as to how far back manny could make it but no one was inclined to stop trying after a year conklin continued my perfect double was sent to the operating room at shelby stone memorial hospital where he died before the operation could be performed by that time i was safely ensconced in the country and the home where i am living now in exchange for my life i fed a great deal of legitimate information to mr ramsland regarding various activities of the groups you refer to as terrorist mr ramsland came to see me every couple of months and pumped me with more questions after three years mr ramsland resigned to pursue his political ambitions his replacement mr arthur senstrom began visiting me but on the second visit he made the mistake of telling me that the operation in which i allegedly died had been recorded i of course demanded to view the recording as you will learn i had the leverage with lionel ramsland to make such a demand the recording showed me sitting up before my surgery in great distress screaming in arabic and in spanish for a man named dr nick fury then collapsing and dying from a device that i am certain was triggered by lionel ramsland who was in the room clearly the others in the operating room that day heard the same thing i did it was my feeling that so long as they were alive my safety and security would be in jeopardy i met with mr ramsland and he assured me he could and would take care of the matter in such a way that no ones attention would be called to the operation further he promised that all copies of the recording would be destroyed as far as i know mr ramsland kept his promise in that regard william conklin set the transcript aside and folded his hands the packed hall was deathly silent all eyes were fixed on lionel ramsland who sat rigidly erect and looked to nick as if he were going to launch into a tirade of selfjustification and patriotism similar to the one he had spewed at nick in noreen siliskis office this time the silence held there was no need for blackstone to gavel for order there was one unanswered question and the room was waiting for the senator from missouri to ask it assuming what we have heard is true mr conklin this is a terrible terrible revelation and i am sure that all who have heard it are as stunned as i am ramsland could stand matters no more he leaped to his feet and shouted there are two sides to every story i saved lives hundreds of lives thousands of lives this is war senator war young american soldiers are being killed every day blackstones gavel thundered down again and again bailiffs rushed over to silence ramsland who had lost all composure and was now an apoplectic crimson his lawyer whispered harshly into his ear meekly he sank back into his chair mr conklin blackstone said finally is that second tape going to further enlighten us as to just what this socalled leverage was it will senator but it is more than an hour long can you paraphrase it for us i can sir conklin adjusted his notes it is a conversation that occurred six years ago in karachi and was secretly recorded by aleem mohammad the meeting was instigated by lionel ramsland in it ramsland promises mohammad the delivery of a large cache of untraceable weapons mostly russian in origin as well as five million dollars in untraceable cash in exchange for the death of mr ashai bayoumi the egyptian foreign minister who was openly antiamerican ramsland then promises to inform mohammad of the precise time and place when mr bayoumi would be at prayer our intelligence shows that a month later that small mosque was blown up killing bayoumi and a dozen others neither i nor anyone else at the agency had any knowledge of such a deal being made it was mohammads possession of that tape that led him to contact lionel ramsland regarding his desire to pass on vital information to jericho and then to have his death staged that tape which we have here has been the leveragethe dead mans switch if you willthat mohammad has used to insure his own survival again ramsland was on his feet screaming dispensing of bayoumi kept egypt from forming alliances with several terrorist groups thousands of lives were saved thousands this time the chambers were in chaos helpless blackstone gaveled the session to a close but few heard him everyone seemed to be running at once wedging through the double doors ramsland was surrounded and led away as ramsland and the bailiffs neared the exit nick felt certain the man turned and glared at him at last for a time after the room was nearly empty the six of themnick jillian reese junie reggie and bagdasarianremained silent in their seats i thought it would feel better than it does nick said finally how could it jillian replied dead is dead ramsland will go to his grave believing that what he did the good innocent people he had killed was in the best interests of the country again there was a pensive silence well i think weve all heard enough for one day reggie said suddenly can we go home not only can we junie said we should in the limo in the limo my friend nick echoed epilogue thanksgiving dinner at the new headquarters of the helping hands foundation was at once joyous and bittersweet the broad rented table in the waiting room was piled high not with food but with boxes of food prepared by volunteers and supervised by jillian board and staff members set up a human chain to pass the boxes to a waiting line of patrons sam wright and the levishefsky twins worked alongside members of the washington and baltimore professional sports teams handing out the turkeys the mayor was there shoulder to shoulder with reggie and nicks ptsd students were there in force and unusually good humor hey nick matthew mcbean called across the room i think my sud score is a three today seeing all these people outside makes me so appreciative of what i have that im having trouble feeling lousy nick smiled at his friend since the death of phillip maccandliss a number of the former enlisted men had gotten the benefits that had previously been denied several more had gone back to work and one eddie thompson had actually gone to work for the va david bagdasarian nicks attorney entered the crowded room carrying two huge boxes of pastry breaking news nick he said yesterday evening ramslands latest bail appeal was denied too great a flight risk the guy is going to stay locked up until his trial his lawyers argued that without aleem mohammad the prosecution doesnt have much of a case but the judge disagreed jillian who was standing nearby gave the lawyer a thumbsup i guess the judge knows a mass murderer when he sees one she said the fallout from the government cutting a deal with mohammad in exchange for his statements and cooperation had not fully dissipated there had been demonstrations and an organization called no deals was agitating the cia to disclose the terrorists whereabouts and to begin proceedings to bring him back anything new on paresh singh and the moneylaundering charges nick asked not since he jumped bail and vanished india is a big country and he has more than enough money to bribe anyone nobody thinks theyre going to find him junie came in from where she had been arranging the equipment in the new helping hands thirtyninefoot winnebago do you want me to take you home nick asked what do you think junie said this is more physical labor than im used to but the doctors say its good for me to start pushing myself a bit more and now that i dont have to worry about this guy every day since youre adopting himshe put her arm around reggieill be back to a full schedule in no time remember reggie said you promised i could go with you on the first run in the new rv its not exactly a limo but like you said i plan on having my own one day mr mayor junie said things are slowing down a little now would you like to come out and see the new rv you helped us raise money to purchase id like that very much the mayor said together jillian junie reggie and nick guided the mayor to the street where the two vans were parked second chance leashed to the steering wheel greeted them proudly this is my dog chance reggie said chance this is the mayor the mayor toured the new rv briefly and thanked them before heading off for a time the four of them stood quietly looking at a glassenclosed display on one wall in it was a postersize version of the picture of umberto vasquez that nick had carried from street to street for four years and beside it was the photo of a beautiful young woman reading a book beneath a tree michael palmer
